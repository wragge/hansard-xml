          <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - On several occasions during the past few months, members of both Houses of this Parliament have complained of unfair discrimination between the citizens of different States by reason of the fact that, in two States, a deduction in income tax assessments on account of unemployment relief tax is being refused, because the tax is not described as State income tax, whilst in other States the corresponding tax has been levied as an additional State income tax, and is, therefore, an allowable deduc tion. In consequence of those representations, the Commissioner of Taxation gave, further consideration to the possible removal of this discrimination, and sought the advice of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department. That advice has been received, and discloses a curious position. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The legal opinion on the subject is that State unemployment relief tax, which is levied as such by reference to income, is an income tax, and that, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphb of sub-section1 of section 23 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, it falls within  the  deductionallowable for State income tax if it is annually assessed. Unemployment relief tax which is not annually assessed, but which is deducted from salaries and wages at the source, is not a permissible deduction. It appears that all the State acts which impose unemployment relief tax, provide that in the case of salary and wage earners, it shall be deducted at the source, and where this is the only manner in which the tax is calculated and collected, the tax is not an allowable deduction in the federal assessments of the persons concerned. Thus one discrimination is removed by the opinion, namely, that previously existing between the several States as States, whilst another discrimination has been discovered as between the citizens ofa State. It is intended to remove this newly discovered discrimination as early as possible. </para>
        <para>It may be added that the foregoing observations regarding unemployment relief tax apply equally to the Western Australian hospital fund tax, because that tax also is a tax on income. The Commissioner of Taxation has decided, in the light of the Crown Law Department&#39;s advice, to allow deductions of State unemployment relief tax and the Western Australian hospital fund tax in those cases in which it is legally deductible; that is, where it is annually assessed. The Commissioner intends to apply his decision retrospectively to past assessments in which the deduction has not been allowed, provided, as required by section 37 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the tax on these assessments was originally due and payable not more than three years prior to the 1st October, 1931.Unemployment relief tax which is deductedat the source, and, therefore, is not annually assessed, cannot be allowed as a deduction underthe present law. The Government will consider an amendment of thelaw to remove this anomaly. </para>

            <para>- An amount of about &#163;200,000 became due in New York on the 1st October. As there is no exchange market in that city for Australian currency, payment had to be remitted through London, and the Commonwealth was mulct in heavy exchange discounts on both Australian sterling and English sterling. This heavy burden on the taxpayer will, we hope, be lightened as the exchange position improves. </para>

Last evening when speaking on the motion for the second reading of the Public Accounts Committee Bill, I stated that members were paid a sitting fee of 30s. a day, and travelling expenses at the rate of &#163;1 a day while absent from Canberra. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> is reported to have interjected that members of the Public Accounts Committee received no allowance for meetings held at Canberra, but that for other meetings they were paid at the rate of 25s. a day, less 20 per cent. I have since learned that members of the committee receive 25s. a day when sitting in Canberra, and &#163;2 5s. a day when sitting elsewhere. I make this explanation in justification of my statement last night. </para>

            <para>- As a tribute to a great Australian, and because it is an excellent example of the work of Australia&#39;s greatest sculptor, will the Minister for Home Affairs have the bronze bust which was presented to the Commonwealth by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bertram</inline> Mackennal, and is now on the Commonwealth-avenue, removed from its present unsuitable position to a more appropriate one? Also, will he see that it is properly titled, so that the public may appreciate this work, and understand the sculptor&#39;s symbolism, which expresses his revulsion from war? </para>

I have made inquiries and have ascertained that very few copies of this report were received by my department from the League of Nations. A copy is, however, being placed on the table of the library for the information of honorable members, but, owing to the extra expenditure for printing which would be entailed, it is regretted that it will not be possible to make copies generally available. </para>

            <para>That the bill be now read a second time. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I propose to deal briefly with this measure, which embodies minor amendments to the Financial Emergency Act. There are only four clauses involved, two of which are purely machinery in nature. Section 10 of the principal act dealt with the general reduction of wages and salaries. The amending bill is designed to prevent any misinterpretation. It makes the provisions of the principal act clearer, and is in accordance with the intention of the framers of that legislation. </para>
          <para class="block">The existing provision adequately covers officers whose salaries do not vary after the date of the operation of the section, but as regards officers whose salaries are increased or decreased after that date, there is a lack of specific provision for corresponding variation of the amount of reduction. As an example, I instance the case of an officer receiving &#163;300 per annum when the section came into operation, who was reduced to &#163;240 per annum, a drop of &#163;60. If he subsequently becomes due for an increase of &#163;18, his salary, for the purposes of the act, might be regarded as still below &#163;300, instead of being &#163;318, which is the new minimum upon which the percentage reduction shall be effective. The proper reduction in the latter salary would be &#163;64 per annum, which is the amount which officers receiving that salary - &#163;318 - at the commencement of the section were reduced. Similarly, if an officer&#39;s salary is decreased, for example, as a punishment, the reduction to be made from the decreased salary may, under the existing provision, be on the higher salary which he formerly received, and not on his new rate. </para>
          <para>The proposed amendment of the section will ensure that variations are made in the amounts of reduction in keeping with any rise or fall in the salaries normally due to officers. The amount&#39; of reduction will remain constant only where there is no variation of the normal rate of pay. In the event of any variation in salary having occurred since the commencement of the act, provision is proposed to ensure that the amendment will cover those variations. </para>
          <para>Section19 of the principal act deals with State taxation in respect of salaries and allowances paid by the Commonwealth. This clause amends section 19 in order that the protection sought to be provided by that section may be effectively secured. Section 19 of the principal act is, in effect, a limitation of the Commonwealth Salaries Act 1907, which authorizes a State to tax the allowances, or salary and allowances of any member of the Commonwealth Parliament representing that State or a constituency therein, and the salary of any officer or employee of the Commonwealth carrying out his duties in that State, subject to the rate and extent of that taxation not being in excess of that applicable to any other citizen of the State having a similar  amount  and class of income. Section 19 of the principal act provides that the remuneration referred to shall not <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> subject to taxation in a State to any extent above the tax payable under the State taxation law in force at 30th June, 1930, except to the extent prescribed. Power was granted under the section to the GovernorGeneral to prescribe, from time to time, the rates or percentages for the additional tax mentioned, but this power of prescription was limited to the prescription of a uniform rate or percentage for the Commonwealth as a whole, and forbade the prescription of different rates or percentages for different States. </para>
          <para>Subsequent to the passing of the Financial Emergency Act, State rates -of income tax were increased in some instances. It was considered desirable that any limitation of further taxation by the States on the Commonwealth remunerations under notice should be fixed by reference to the new State rates, rather than to those in force on 30th June, 1930, as the latter rates had, in effect, become obsolete. It was thought to be more desirable to employ somewhat different terminology to express the powers of prescription. The clause, therefore, authorizes the pre- scribing of the maximum amount, rate, percentage, or extent to which the remuneration of the member of Parliament, official, or employee, may be subject under an income tax law of a State. </para>
          <para>It is believed that it would be equitable to select, as the maximum rate of ordinary income tax to be levied by any State on the Commonwealth remuneration of federal servants, the present&#39; income tax rates in force in South Australia. This does not mean that the Commonwealth remuneration .in any other State than South Australia would thereupon become subject to income tax at the South Australian rate. It would&#39; merely authorize that other State to collect, tax at its own rates of income tax on the Commonwealth remuneration, up to, but not exceeding, those rates at present in force in South Australia. In other words, the South Australian rates become the maximum. The proposed schedule is as follows : - </para>

          <para>Section 29 of the principal act deals with maternity allowances paid in connexion with the Maternity Allowance Act 1912-1927. The Maternity Allowance Act as amended by the Financial Emergency Act 1931, provides that a maternity allowance shall not be paid in any case where the total income of the claimant and her husband, or of the claimant where there is no husband, for the twelve months preceding the date of the birth exceeded &#163;260. It has been found that this provision is causing hardship in cases where the income had ceased or materially diminished at the date of the birth. Realizing the position, it is proposed to provide relief in these cases by giving to the Commissioner the power to make payment of a maternity allowance where he is satisfied that at the time of the birth the claimant and her husband were not in receipt of income exceeding &#163;260 per annum. </para>

            <para>.- I do not think that honorable members on this side of the House will ask that there should be any delay in proceeding with the bill. &#39; It seems a pity that this Parliament should find it necessary to pass legislation to safeguard any one against what I may call the taxation depredations of any State. It ought to be necessary only to provide that members of the Federal Parliament and officers of the Federal Public Service shall be subject to the same taxation as applies to others in the State of which they are citizens. We realize, of course, that because of the proposals put forward in one State recently, it was necessary to protect members of Parliament and officers of the Public Service against exorbitant taxation, but I hope that such a position will not arise in the future. Lest there should be misunderstanding in the minds of the people, we should make clear that it is not proposed in this bill to grant any concession to members of the Federal </para>

For instance, he referred to the various rates of taxation which would be allowable on various incomes. Starting at &#163;250 a year, the rate would be 3d. in the &#163;1, and so on. I suppose a further explanation of this part of the bill will be given during the committee stage. </para>

              <para>- I am pleased that the Government has seen fit to amend the bill with respect to the payment of the maternity allowance. On the 17th September, on the adjournment of the House, I and other honorable members of this group brought this matter under the notice of the Government, because, in a number of instances, Ave had. found it necessary to make representation to the Commissioner that hardship had been imposed on. certain persons by the refusal of the department to pay the allowance  because  the husbands of the applicants had been in receipt of an income of &#163;200 during the previous year. Many of those husbands were at the time on the dole, notwithstanding that in the previous year they may have received &#163;260 in wages. Yet at the time extra comforts had to be provided in the  home.  Every honorable member can easily appreciate the unfortunate circumstances of these persons. I take it that it is now to be provided that if the husbands of applicants are unemployed to-day, the fact that they received &#163;260 last year, will not be taken into consideration. If that bc the case, the position will be relieved in some measure, and therefore I propose to support this clause -in the bill. 4 </para>

            <para>.- I have no desire to delay the passage of the measure; but considerable controversy has arisen on account of serious objection having been taken by the Premier of South Australia to the action of the Federal Government in introducing a bill of this character. Others have commented upon the remarks of the Premier of South Australia, and the statements published in the columns of the press have suggested that members of the Federal Parliament, and of the Commonwealth Public Service, are trying to escape from taxation to which they should be subjected. I understand, from the remarks of the Minister who introduced the bill, and from the interjection of the Prime Minister, that the measure has been brought down merely with a view to clearing up the position. There is an opinion abroad to-day that men who occupy seats in Parliament are allowed to escape taxation. So far as my experience goes, members of the Federal Parliament receive Federal and State income tax assessment notices, and if they own laud, they are served with land tax assessment notices. They also receive assessment&#39; notices for the payment of unemployment tax. Therefore, all ordinary taxes are paid by members of this Parliament. It has been suggested in the public press that an effort is being made by the Government and the Federal Parliament to relieve members of this House from payment of the unemployment tax. I am sure that no member in this chamber wishes to evade that. As this bill makes the position clear, I have no objection to it, </para>

            <para>. - The provisions embodied in the Financial Emergency Act wore intended to protect the Common wealth Public Service from what might be described as punitive taxation that might be imposed by any State. The circumstances in which these provisions were inserted are well known. At that time it was proposed by New South Wales to impose a very high rate of tax, amounting to 5s. in the &#163;1, for the purposeof providing for the unemployed. It will be remembered that at the Premiers Conference we discussed proposals for certain economies, and it was unanimously agreed, amongst other things, to make a reduction of 20 per cent. ofall adjustable expenditure. For that purpose each government brought down certain proposals. The unemployment tax in New South Wales of1s. in the &#163;1 was taken into the calculations by the State Government when arriving at the reduction of wages necessary to make the 20 per cent. reduction in adjustable expenditure. It was then considered by the Commonwealth Government that, if the1s. in the &#163;1 was to be calculated when making a. reduction of the salaries of the New South Wales public servants, it was not reasonable that, the whole of the tax should be imposed upon Commonwealth public servants residing in that State. It was not easy to adjust the matter, but in the act we took power to make a regulation that would provide what should be the amount of tax imposed upon Commonwealth public servants in excess of the taxation in operation on the 30th June, 1930. An impression gained ground that we were trying to prevent the States from imposing extra taxation, but that was not the intention. The act, of course, would prevent any increase over the taxation in force on the 30th June, 1930, until such time as a regulation was issued, but provision was made in the section for the issuing of a regulation. I notice that the Premier of South Australia has declared that we are trying to relieve members of this Parliament and Commonwealth public servants residing in South Australia from paying as much State taxation as is payable by other residents of that State. </para>

              <para>- No, it is not. A later statement made by the South Australian Premier was that the Commonwealth Government intended to repeal the section of the act to which he referred. We are not repealing it, but merely making it more effective for carrying out our original intention. We have to proclaim by regulation what rate of income tax should be payable, and we cannot discriminate between States. But as the Assistant Minister explained, we intend to issue a regulation setting out what the maximum in any State shall be in respect of income taxation. At present the maximum tax is being imposed in South Australia, and that will be made the maximum in the regulation. If any changes take place, adjustments will have to be made; but the Government will be able to issue an amended regulation without, any alteration to the law. We shall have to watch the position from time to time. We do not desire to make a privileged class of theCommonwealth public servants; but we do intend to protect our servants from being treated in an abnormal way, for they are already bearing their share of the general economies. The fact that the regulation will provide that the maximum tax shall be the rate at present payable in South Australiadoes not mean that that rate will become the effective rate in every other State. Commonwealth publie servants in Victoria, New South Wales, and the other States will pay the same rate of income taxation as other citizens in those States. </para>

              <para>- It will not be. No State will have the power to impose a super tax on Commonwealth public servants. There will be no discrimination against our officers. For instance, the New South &#34;Wales 5 per cent, unemployment tax is calculated by the State Government as part of the economy plan, but we do not propose that the whole of it shall apply to our public servants, for they have been involved in other sacrifices. That is the only distinction made in the whole proposition. </para>

          <para>The amendment in regard to the maternity allowance is to give effect to the original intention of the Government, and it will apply to every case. Recently the honorable member for &#34;West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> in speaking to the adjournment motion, directed attention to&#39; the case of the wife of a man on the dole, who had been refused the maternity allowance. I said at that time that it was never intended that the act should operate in that way, and that I would look into the case. I subsequently made inquiries, and found that while the husband had been in receipt of an income of more than &#163;260 in the preceding twelve months he was actually out of work when his child was born. But a strict reading of the act prevented the authorities from granting the allowance in that case. The amendment now being effected will bring it into conformity with the old-age and invalid pensions law, under which present earnings are taken into consideration. A discretion is being left with the Commissioner, who will now be able to carry out the original intention of the Government. In the future those who are in receipt of more than the stipulated income, will be debarred from obtaining the allowance, but those who are not in receipt of it will not be debarred from receiving it. Every case that has been dealt with since the Financial Emergency Act was passed will be reviewed. </para>

              <para>- The Treasurer made a statement on that subject to-day. There is an anomaly in the law which will be adjusted by an amendment of the act that the Government hopes to introduce very shortly. The Crown Law authorities have advised that unemployment taxation, such as that imposed in New South Wales, or hospital taxation, such as that imposed in Western Australia, which are collected on an annual basis, may be deducted, but that taxation of a similar character, which is collected at its source from wages, may not bc deducted. All such taxation, however collected, is taxation on income, and the Government will introduce an amendment of the act to provide that it may be deducted. </para>

A comparison is made between the wages received by these men and the basie wage paid in New South Wales, particularly specifying a section of the workers in the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. It also deals with the subject of time off in lieu of Sunday and holiday work, and with reductions that have been made in allowances and the like. I have no doubt that the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cunningham)</inline> has received a copy  pf  this letter, and I should like him to reply to the statements contained in it. The Prime Minister (Mv. Scullin) has pointed out that, if the till is passed, the Government may issue regulations which it may vary from time to time. He has also said that it is in tended to make the rate of income tax at present in force in South Australia the maximum rate that may be applied to Commonwealth public servants. Will the Assistant Minister inform me what that rate of taxation is? </para>

              <para>- It appears that wo shall have to consider this subject from the point of view of unemployment taxation in New South Wales and income taxation in South Australia. I should like to know whether the combined income and unemployment taxation in New South Wales is heavier than the income taxation in South Australia. In any case,  Careful  consideration should be given to this subject with the object of insuring that the sacrifices which various workers are being called upon to make in the way of wages reductions, reduced allowances, and the like are equitable, and not in excess of 20 per cent, in any case. The members of the Postal Workers Union naturally do not wish to be, and should not be, more heavily penalized than other workers. I admit that it is difficult in the bill to adjust all thu circumstances in these cases, because, after all, while the bill gives certain power to the Government, it does not state,  at  the moment, what these postal workers will  be  called upon  to  pay  in  unemployment taxation in the  different  States. It leaves the question open, but no doubt that is necessary, because the Government may from time to time find it necessary to amend the regulation. As this is a matter for future determination, it is difficult for me to answer or explain the circular which has been received from this section of Commonwealth employees. </para>

              <para>- The next point is whether in South Australia where the tax is heaviest, it will be necessary to have a regulation different from that in New South Wales, or is this regulation to be of a general character throughout the States? Commonwealth employees who live in South Australia will certainly bc affected more than other public servants by this legislation. They will he called upon to carry a greater responsibility than the Commonwealth employees, say, in Victoria. If the Government has any further information on this subject, it should give it to the House. </para>

One regulation will certify what shall be income tax, and another regulation what shall be the unemployment tax that may be imposed as a maximum in any State.

          <para class="block">State oau apply existing taxation to Commonwealth public servants in that State. It is quite true that Commonwealth employees in South Australia will pay more than those in other States, because South Australia is the most highly taxed State. The only answer that we can make to that is that we cannot discriminate between Commonwealth public servants and other citizens. Every citizen and every worker of South Australia receiving the same wage as a Commonwealth employee will pay the same taxation. &#39;But in New South Wales there would be discrimination if we imposed the whole of the unemployment tax on Commonwealth public servants, because that was taken into calculation when making the reductions in the wages of State employees. We wish, as nearly as possible, to treat our Commonwealth public servants in the same way under this emergency legislation as each Government is treating its own employees. <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Mr. Coleman.</inline> - What will be the effect in New South Wales? </para>

              <para>- The only differentiation will be in New South Wales. Take one of the junior officers receiving, say, &#163;105 ii year. Previously, he paid an unemploy ment tax of &#163;5 5s. a year. Now he will pay &#163;1 6s. 3d., an advantage to him of &#163;3 18s. 9d. On a salary of &#163;203 per year, the unemployment tax was &#163;10 3s. Now it will be &#163;2 10s. 9d., an advantage of &#163;7 12s. 3d. On a salary of &#163;235 per annum, the tax was &#163;11 15s. Now ii will be &#163;2 18s. 9d., an advantage of &#163;8 16s. 3d. On a salary of &#163;274 per annum, the unemployment tax was &#163;13 14s. Now it will be &#163;6 17s., an advantage of &#163;6 17s. On a salary of &#163;293, the unemployment tax was &#163;14 13s. Now it will be &#163;7 6s. 6d., an advantage of &#163;7 6s. 6d. On a salary of &#163;302 per annum, the tax was &#163;15 2s. Now it will be &#163;7 lis., or an advantage of &#163;7 lis. These sums can readily be calculated by honorable members. The Minister gave the details in the schedule which will be set out, not in the bill, but in the regulation. If any anomalies or injustices arise, the regulation can be amended. We have set out to make this tax as equitable as possible. On salaries up to &#163;250 the maximum unemployment tax will be 3d. in the &#163;1. On salaries ex ceeding &#163;250 and not exceeding &#163;500 tha maximum will be 4&#163;d. in the &#163;1. On. salaries exceeding &#163;500 and not exceeding &#163;1,000 the maximum will be 6d. in the &#163;1. On salaries exceeding &#163;1,000 and not exceeding &#163;1,400 the maximum will be 7id. in the &#163;1. On salaries exceeding &#163;1,400 and not exceeding; &#163;1,800 the maximum will be 9d. in the- &#163;1. On salaries exceeding &#163;1,800 and not. exceeding &#163;2,500 the maximum will be* ls. in the &#163;1. On salaries exceeding&#39; &#163;2,500 the maximum will be ls. 3d. in the &#163;1. I think that honorable members will realize that this tax has been adjusted fairly equitably. It is not possible to make for uniformity. Soma Commonwealth employees take the view that as they are receiving salaries which apply all over Australia, we should endeavour to place them on a uniform basis ; but that is impossible because, under the Constitution, we cannot discriminate between one State and another. In adopting this legislation we are not discriminating, because we are imposing the maximum applying in each State. </para>

              <para>- Representations were made to us by a number of organizations that it was difficult for the employees to pay an annual sum, and that they were prepared to suffer a fortnightly deduction from their wages. As honorable members know, the States have no power to impose a wages tax upon Commonwealth public servants, therefore, the tax had to be imposed in the form of an income tax, but we have decided, and we have power to do it, to enter into an agreement with any State Government, where such action is desired by the Commonwealth employees in that State, to have the tax deducted from the fortnightly pay. </para>

            <para>.- By imposing this unemployment tax on Commonwealth public servants, we appear to be compelling them to bear a sacrifice greater than that borne by the other sections of the community since the passing of the Financial Emergency Act. That legislation provided for a 20 per cent, reduction in wages, which  Drought  the basic wage down to &#163;3 10s. per week. Now an additional tax of 3d. in the &#163;1 is to be inflicted upon the lower-grade Commonwealth employees. In Queensland this is being made a sort of class tax. When the Financial Emergency Act was passed, it was understood that where taxation or additional taxation in regard to wages was levied by State Governments, the Commonwealth public servants in those States would be protected. In Queensland, State public servants are better paid than Commonwealth officers, yet the latter have to bear heavier taxation. I understand that recently Public Service organizations interviewed the Prime Minister and the Treasurer regarding this matter. </para>

After all, we  are  discussing taxation which produces  the  money by which government is financed, and it is our duty to ensure that the burden does not press unfairly on any section of the community. For that reason, I ask the Prime Minister to promise that if this taxation is found to {dace federal public servants in Queensand fit a disadvantage as compared with  the  State public servants, it will be amended. </para>

              <para>- That also would be unconstitutional discrimination. It is because Commonwealth servants in some States suffer disabilities that this bill to afford relief to them is proposed. In Victoria the unemployment relief tax is slightly over 6d. in the &#163;1; in Queensland slightly under 6d. ; and in Tasmania a little less. Western Australia imposes no unemployment relief tax, but collects a hospital fund tax, which this legislation will take into account. In South Australia the unemployment relief contribution is included in the State income tax, which is very high; unfortunately, wo cannot ascertain the exact proportion allotted for the relief of unemployment. In New South Wales the unemployment tax is ls. in the &#163;1 in addition to the income tax. One of the defects of the federal system. is that six State parliaments are giving effect to varying ideas of government and taxation, and legislation such as the Government, is proposing is needed to rectify some of the anomalies thus created. At one stage the Government of New South Wales proposed a. tax of 5s. in the &#163;1. </para>

            <para>.- The remarks of some honorable members suggest the possibility of Commonwealth public servants in New South Wales being placed at a disadvantage as compared with State public servants.

          <para class="block">Parliaments, when imposing a 20 per cent, reduction of salaries, took into account the unemployment relief tax. As the Commonwealth Parliament did not extend that consideration to its servants, they are suffering a greater reduction of income than are the members of the State Public Service. The organizations complain, also, that the Commonwealth basic wage is lower than that for the servants of the States. Those who are not in receipt of the prevailing basic wage should be exempt from the unemployment relief tax, and if that necessitates a further adjustment, I suggest that members of Parliament pay the full one shilling in the pound, instead of 6d. in the pound, as proposed for those in receipt of salaries ranging from &#163;500 to .-&#163;1,000. Pew members of Parliament are dependent on their salaries; most of thom hold Ministerial office or positions on committees, which entitle them to fees and travelling expenses, and, therefore, they are well able to pay the unemployment tax of ls. in the &#177;1. Those officers who are receiving &#163;500 and upwards are fortunate in being linked with members of Parliament. The representatives of New South &#34;Wales are more concerned about the reduction of salary they will suffer and the amount of unemployment tax they will pay than with the lot of the public servants. </para>

              <para>- I withdraw it. I regret having to hurt the feelings of honorable members, but there is no disguising the fact that when their own rights and privileges ave at stake, -champions arise on every side to defend them. But when wc are discussing pensions, some honorable members are very ready to point out that the aged and the invalid can well bear a reduction of 2s. Gd. a week. Any diminution of the income of honorable members, however, is regarded as unfair. I am prepared to say this in the constituencies, and even to follow the Minister for Defence .into his electorate to defend the attitude I have adopted to-day. I know that the numbers are available to pass this bill, but I believe that there has been unfair discrimination between Commonwealth and State public servants in respect of the 20 per cent, reduction of salaries. It is not fair to say that Statepublic servants have been placed at a disadvantage, when we have appeals from the Commonwealth service organizations to redress what they regard as unfair discrimination against them. </para>

            <para>.- One of . the decisions of the Premiers Conference in June last, was that Commonwealth and State Governments should reduce their adjustable expenditure by 22 J per cent. The Parliament of New South Wales applied that deduction to State public servants, but took into account the unemployment tax of ls. in the &#163;1. The Commonwealth public servant resident in New South Wales was subject to the same percentage reduction of salary, but has to pay the unemployment, tax also. Thus he is placed at a disadvantage in comparison with the State public servant. The Minister in charge of the bill has. stated that regulations will be promulgated to allow the Commonwealth public servant to take credit for his payment of State unemployment relief tax. I can see no objection to this measure. I remind the honorable &#39; member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> that members of this Parliament reduced their own salaries by 20 per cent.; in addition those who represent New South Wales Iia ve to pay the State unemployment tax of ls. in the &#163;1. </para>

              <para>- Much is heard about the Government&#39;s- action with regard to oldage pensions. Undoubtedly, it has caused hardship, but it was inevitable. The Government tried to alleviate the position by making the reduction only 12&#163; per cent. I am confident that, if the bill is studied closely, and attention paid to the lucid explanation that was made by the Prime Minister, it will be agreed that the measure is a legitimate endeavour to bring about equity of treatment between Commonwealth&#39; and State public servants. The committee should agree that Commonwealth public servants are entitled to at least the same treatment that is extended by State governments to State public servants. </para>

            <para>.- I regret exceedingly that the  Deputy.  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> is not present to participate in the debate. The early history of this legislation may not be known to some honorable members. Originally trouble arose over the taxation of State instrumentalities by the Federal Government, and vice versa. The idea originally at the bottom of this legislation was that, if the Commonwealth Government were to tax State public servants, it would interfere with State rights. It was also considered that, if a State had the power to tax the incomes of federal public servants resident in the State, it would be an encroachment of the administration of the federal body. The case of <inline font-style="italic">D&#39; Emden</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Pedder</inline> in Tasmania, concerned the right of a State to charge stamp duty on the salary received by a federal public servant. It was decided by the High Court of Australia that the State of. Tasmania had not the right to insist upon federal public servants paying such stamp duty. That decision still applies, and through it federal public servants escape quite a large amount of taxation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Then arose a question as to the power of a State to tax federal salaries at&#39; all. A test case was instituted by the Victorian Commissioner of Taxation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prout</inline> Webb. It was decided that two members of the then Federal Government,the Prime Minister and Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Deakin, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, should represent the Ministry, that I should represent the members, and that Baxter and another, two public servants, should represent federal public servants. The case went to the High Court. For the first time in Australia, that court applied a decision given in the United States of America - that of <inline font-style="italic">McCulloch</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">the State of Maryland</inline> - which provided that States could not tax a bank instituted under federal authority in the United States of America, a decision that still holds good in that country. The finding of the High Court was in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, myself, and the two public servants. In 1907, the Commonwealth Parliament passed legislation to meet what was regarded as a possible anomaly, and enabled State taxation to be applied to the salaries of federal public servants resident im States. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Bent, Premier of Victoria, was very dissatisfied with the position as it stood, and he induced <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Outtrim, Deputy</inline> Commissioner of Taxes, and then on the eve of retirement, to defend a case brought by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prout</inline> Webb, Commissioner of Taxes for Victoria, in the Supreme Court of that State. The decision was against the Commissioner of Taxes, and was based on that given in the case that I have already narrated. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webb</inline> appealed direct to the Privy Council, which decided that States possessed the right to apply their income taxation laws to salaries received by federal public servants resident within their borders. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Bent then applied to the Privy Council for the rehearing of the cases covered by <inline font-style="italic">Webb</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Deakin and others.</inline> However, in view of the act passed by the Federal Parliament in 1907, the Privy Council refused leave to appeal, on the ground that any decision reached would bc useless, as it was unnecessary in view of the legislative action of the Commonwealth Government. There have been no further appeals to the Privy. Council in the matter. I venture the opinion that, if an appeal were made under this section, the legislation that we are now passing would be declared <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> There is not the slightest doubt that, so long as we retain in our Constitution the right to appeal to the Privy Council, and recognize the decision of that body as final, the finding in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Webb</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Outtrim</inline> must hold good. </para>
          <para>There will be difficulties in connexion with this legislation. To begin with, previous Commonwealth legislation provides -that, for taxation purposes, every public servant resident in a State is to be treated similarly to State public servants resident in that State. To my mind that is only fair. The Commonwealth public servant receives the same protection from the State laws as does his colleague in the State Service, and he must, therefore, accept his share of the responsibility for the mismanagement and extravagance of that State, if there has been such. I believe that, by this legislation, we shall bring about an anomaly which will cause resentment against the protection afforded to Commonwealth public servants resident in States. I do not think that a federal member of Parliament, who is resident in a State, should escape taxation similar to that levied upon a State member. This act provides that, by proclamation of the Governor-General, federal members and federal public servants shall be exempted from certain phases of State taxation. </para>

              <para>- There might be a Premier in Victoria who would decide to introduce income tax legislation, declaring that any person resident in Victoria, and receiving over  &#163;500  a year, should be subjected to a. full  100  per cent. State tax on the excess over  &#163;600,  as was recently proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> in New South Wales. If that were done, these provisions  would apply  to Victoria. In my opinion, it is a mistake to distinguish between citizens living in and enjoying the amenities of the same State in regard to taxation, whether their salaries are paid by the Commonwealth Government or by a State Government.. </para>

            <para>.- Queensland has recently increased its unemployment insurance tax, and I understand the explanation of the Minister to mean that the Commonwealth Government will have power under the law to ensure that Commonwealth public servants will pay neither more nor loss by way of taxation than other citizens of Queensland. The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> suggested this afternoon that the Commonwealth Government was the only Labour Government in Australia which was careless of the interests of the poorer sections of the community, or of those who were unable to defend themselves. He referred to the legislation passed by this Parliament reducing salaries and pensions, and one might imagine from his remarks that the Government ofNew South Wales, of which the honorable member is a supporter, is particularly zealous in the interests of the poorer sections of the community. As a matter of fact, I. do not think that the citizens of New South Wales are any better off under the unemployment insurance legislation than are those of Queensland. A charwoman in New South Wales, even though she earns only 15s. or &#163;1 a week, must pay her tax at just the same rate as a person earning &#163;1,000 a year, although it bears much more heavily upon her. </para>

              <para>- Members of the New South Wales Parliament do not pay unemployment taxation at a higher rate than does the person in receipt of &#163;2 a week, so that I cannot understand why members of this Parliament should bo asked to make greater sacrifices. I do not wish to make the charge that any honorable member obtains election to this Parliament simply for the sake of what he can make out of it. Most of us believe that we can do something as members of this House better than others could do it. We like to get here and try ourselves out. I strongly resent the suggestion that this is the only Government which has imposed sacrifices on the poorer sectionsof the community; all other Governments in Australia have done the same thing. </para>

Wc are trying to protect those under our control from the unreasonable taxation imposed by the Government of New South Wales. The Treasurer explained that the present New South Wales Government has refused to fall in with a uniform plan for the relief of unemployment. The Government of New South Wales has chosen to regard the reductions as a cut in wages, while the honorable member for East Sydney referred to them as income tax. Because i lie Premier of New South Wales has refused to co-operate with the other governments, we have been compelled to rake action in order to adjust some of the worst anomalies for which he is responsible. It is ridiculous for the honorable member for East Sydney to lecture this Government for something with which it has nothing to do. If he feels that there is a case for the lower paid salary-earners in New South Wales, let. 1 i i  i  n. go to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> and ask him to remit the tax.  His  place is there, not here. The deception has been carried on for in on the that the Commonwealth Government is the only Labour Government which has cut wages.

            <para>- Yes. It is illuminating to peruse a statement that has been circulated showing the effect of the 50 per cent, duty on imports into Australia. It will bo found that the value of the imports affected by this duty amounted to &#163;10,905,673 in 1929-30, and to &#163;3,124,063 in 1930-31, a reduction of about &#163;7,000,000. A comparative statement of the imports during 1929-30 and 1930-31 of goods, the importation of which was restricted by the proclamation of the 4th April, 1930, shows that the value pf these goods was &#163;5,495,355 in 1929-30. and &#163;1,34S,232 in 1930-31. The Prime Minister further stated that in selecting the items upon which special duties were being imposed, it was recognized that the action being taken would have a beneficial effect on the Australian industries that were manufacturing the commodities concerned. It is true that in addition to restricting imports and enabling us to rectify our adverse trade balance, the action taken has had an additional protective effect. </para>

        <para>I propose, briefly, to give the reasons which prompted the Government in taking these special emergency measures. In the first place, it is necessary to review the Commonwealth&#39;s external trade balance over the past eight or nine years. From 1923 to 1929, that is, during the regime of the Bruce-Page Government, our total adverse trade balance amounted to &#163;7S,000,000, excluding bullion and specie. In addition to having to meet the deficit occasioned by these adverse trade balances, interest had to be found on both Commonwealth and State oversea loans. </para>

        <para class="block">The annual amount of interest that accrued in the period mentioned was a gradually decreasing one, but the total interest which had to be paid overseas during the regime of the BrucePago Government was, approximately, &#163;175,000,000, which, added to the &#163;78,000,000 excess of imports, gave a total of &#163;253,000,000. Now the greater part of this amount was converted into loans, and a small proportion remained as part of the floating debt. At the present time, our overseas annual commitments for interest alone amount to approximately &#163;29,000,000 exclusive of exchange, or, roughly, &#163;4 10s. per head of the population. The enormous task confronting the people of the Commonwealth in meeting this interest bill may best be judged by a comparison with the indemnities which Germany has been required to pay. Under the Dawes plan, assessed on its capacity to pay, Germany was called upon to find approximately &#163;125,000,000, or &#163;2 per head of its population. Later, under the Young plan, this amount was reduced to &#163;85,000,000, or less than 30s. per head of population. As against this figure, Australia has an amount of &#163;4 10s. per head to meet- in overseas interest annually, which is almost a superhuman task, and, if this commitment is to be met in full, it is essential that imports bc kept at a minimum. If imports are not&#39; restricted, the Commonwealth and the States will be unable to pay their overseas interest bill. </para>
        <para>When the present Government assumed office, remedial action, which had been long delayed, was essential. This could be effected by an increase of exports, a reduction of imports, or a combination of both. As regards the proposal to increase our exports, any one who has studied the problem knows the great difficulties confronting a country which sets out to increase its exports to a considerable extent in a short period. In the first place, production must bc increased, and, secondly, overseas markets must be found. </para>

            <para>- If I were to give all such statistics I should-be going beyond the scope of the schedule, and prolonging this debate, lt is true that the whole world is economically sick, and Australia is affected by that position, being faced with widespread unemployment, and remarkably low prices for products that have to be sold overseas. Usually, sales in overseas markets can be increased only by displacing the products of competing countries. These countries will not allow trade to be lost to them without making special efforts to retain it, and it is usual for them, in- the last resort, to reduce the prices of their products. Thus the endeavour to increase exports may lead to lower total returns by reason of the reduced prices obtained. This is well exemplified in Russia&#39;s effort to capture a larger share of the world&#39;s wheat market. Although Russia has recently been exporting more than previously, her returns have been cut by nearly half, and it is quite impossible for her to maintain the large volume of imports that she formerly brought in when she was paying for them by obtaining phenomenal prices for her products, and borrowing approximately &#163;40,000,000 a year abroad. </para>

        <para>In view of the great difficulties on the export side, the Government had, perforce, to concentrate its attention on imports, in order to obtain immediate results. It was most unfortunate that the prices of our principal exports should have fallen so tragically. Had they remained at the same level as that obtaining at the beginning of 1930, the need for these measures would not be felt today. As it is, however, the effectiveness of the Government&#39;s plan may be judged from a comparison of our imports and exports for the last two years. In 1929- 30, the excess of imports over export&#39;s amounted to &#163;32,000,000. From the 1st July, 1930, the Government&#39;s plan began to operate, and for the year 1930-31, exports exceeded imports by &#163;28,500,000. This represents a change- over of about &#163;60,000,000, and it is a feat of which any government might well be proud. We had to run the gauntlet of severe criticism for having taken, such drastic steps to restrict imports. I was discussing this matter with a leading banker recently, and he declared that Australia would make a great mistake if she removed her tariff-restrictions at the present time, because we have not yet fully rectified our adverse trade balance. The figures that I have quoted relate to merchandise only, and do not include gold or bullion. </para>
        <para>It will be noted that the excess of exports over imports for the last financial year is not quite sufficient to meet our overseas annual interest charges, but for the forthcoming year the excess of exports should enable all interest payments to be met, and, in addition, I hope that such excess will permit of a substantial reduction being made in the overseas floating debt. The need for these measures will disappear when the annual excess of exports pays our overseas interest bill, and also enables our overseas floating debt to be liquidated. Honorable members must realize that the importing habit must not be allowed to impair our ability to meet our overseas obligations, and if they are not prepared to support the Government&#39;s plan, they must accept responsibility for the default to overseas creditors which must follow the non adoption of this and other allied measures that were decided upon after mature consideration, and on the advice of financial authorities. </para>

          <para>.- I shall not delay the committee very long, but I feel that I must direct attention to the astounding attitude which the Minister has adopted. He has said that the Government cannot see its way clear to cancel any of the special high duties that are at present being imposed, because the adverse trade balance has not yet been entirely rectified; but instead of asking that they be continued for only a limited period, he is asking that they shall remain in force for an unstipulated time, and in fact, until Parliament chooses to repeal them. If he had asked for a continuance of the duties for a year or for two years, we should have, known where we stood; but he is asking for an unlimited approval of them. Apparently they are to be continued until a new government comes into office which will cancel many of them, and reduce many others. We cannot close our eyes to the fact that in Victoria, the home of protection, there are at present fifteen or twenty different organizations pledged to work for the return of candidates who will support a reversion to the 1908-11 tariff. The members of these organizations recognize that industry is being stifled in Australia. The Minister has said a good deal about the period when heavy imports were being made; but he was not generous enough to admit that this was due principally to enormous overseas borrowing principally by the State Governments - in fact, almost wholly by them. Everybody knows that when this money was borrowed overseas it was sent to Australia in the form of goods. With the cessation of overseas borrowing there has naturally been a reduction of importations. If it were possible to-day to borrow &#163;50,000,000 or &#163;60,000,000 overseas, we should find goods from abroad flooding into this country, in spite of the heavy duties that are in operation. I have, for a very long while, strongly opposed heavy overseas borrowing. I hope that we shall not borrow one penny that we can avoid borrowing. We have boon landed in our present dreadful position because of this overseas borrowing, and the policy for which honorable members opposite stand. We hear members of the Labour party talk in a general way about &#34; our wool and our wheat &#34;, while at the same time they support a policy which doubles, trebles, and in some cases quadruples, the price of the goods which our producers need, forgetting that, all our primary production must be sold at competitive prices in the world&#39;s markets. However, when the various items of this schedule are under discussion, I shall enlarge upon these points. We all know very well that the economic commission appointed by the Bruce-Page Government showed clearly that the high duties that we have imposed on clothing and many other commodities have cost the people hundreds of thousands of pounds more than the wages paid in these industries in Australia. The giving of concessions to various secondary industries is having the effect of ^destroying the primary industries from which we obtain our wealth. </para>

It has been said on behalf of the Government that these duties were imposed, not for revenue-producing purposes, but for the purpose of correcting our adverse trade balance. It is admitted that many of the items included in this schedule are not being manufactured in Australia, and that no one has any intention of attempting to manufacture them here. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has told us that our adverse trade balance has been rectified to a large degree. If that is so, why should it be necessary to continue all of these imposts ? This policy may have been necessary at the time when it was adopted, but is it still necessary? </para>

        <para>The question I ask is why the Government cannot see its way clear to remove some of these imposts with the object of assisting the waterside workers in every Australian port. If the present policy could bc modified, these men would be helped, and so would all who are engaged in the transport industry, such as carters and drivers, storemen and packers, and others associated with the handling of goods which come to Australia from other parts of the world. I supported the imposition of these duties originally, although I knew that the policy would adversely affect many of those whom I represent in this Parliament. At that time I hoped that the policy would have the effect of developing secondary industries, which would provide employment for the men who would be displaced in transport industries; but, unfortunately, that hope has not been realized. To-day many men who are ordinarily engaged in secondary industries are receiving State aid by the dole and per medium of the coupon system, and there is no opportunity for waterside workers to transferto occupations such as these. If the Government is not permitted, by the organizations which control the financial situation, to do all that it desires to do to help the unemployed, I ask it to do something to help the waterside workers by modifying these duties, particularly in view of the fact that our adverse trade balance has, to some extent, been corrected. I ask the Minister to give fair and honest consideration to that aspect of the subject. </para>

The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has said that the imposition of the embargoes and surcharges was not part of the protectionist policy of the Government. I do not for a moment believe that that is so, nor do I think many people in Australia &#34;accept that view. It is my firm conviction that these embargoes and extortionate duties were imposed by the Government in fulfilment of promises made by the Labour party to certain manufacturing interests during the last election campaign. The Government, in my opinion, adopted this policy in order to satisfy the manufacturing interests which had not been given assistance under the heavy and punitive duties provided in the tariff schedule. </para>

            <para>- Oh, no. I think the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> can easily be recognized by my description. In any case, the Minister has not put the position fairly. He has said that during the seven years in which the Bruce-Page Government was in office, our adverse trade balance amounted to &#163;78,000,000, but he did not say that in at least one of. the closing years of that regime we had a favorable trade balance. That would be too much for the Minister to admit. It does not necessarily mean, as the Minister suggests, that a country with an adverse trade balance is running hopelessly towards a state of bankruptcy. A country with an adverse trade balance may not have the necessary funds to meet all its overseas commitments, but, it may possess goods which are of real value, and in some respects may be of more service than actual cash. Moreover, the difference in the country&#39;s trade balance is simply the difference in the amount of money we are borrowing from overseas. </para>

I am justified in saying that these honorable members only temporarily represent these constituencies, because the political history of this country records that every representative of industrial constituencies who has consistently voted for harsh, extortionate and punitive customs duties, and has thereby placed an unnecessarily heavy burden upon  the working class, has not survived a succeeding election. </para>

Nothing will convince the unemployed man walking the streets with an empty stomach, and with a wife and family to support, that the protective policy of this Government has been of any benefit to him. It is of no satisfaction for him to be told that the position would have been worse had this policy not been brought into operation. Our adverse trade balance could have been rectified by the rate of exchange and the lower purchasing power of the people without the imposition of embargoes. What importer is likely to import goods when there is a 30 per cent, exchange against him? The exchange rate, which would have been sufficient to check imports, would not have had the effect of destroying businesses over night, aud the incomes of a large number of those engaged in the industry, as this policy has done. The Minister speaks in a sneering way concerning the activities of those engaged in importing. </para>

Buyers come from Japan to purchase our wool, and from Belgium to obtain commodities which we produce; but, owing to the fiscal policy of this Government,. Japan, Belgium, France, Italy and other countries have become disgruntled potential commercial enemies. Apparently, this Government considers an adjustment of our trade balance of more importance than a balanced budget. Of what benefit have these embargoes and heavy duties been to the country? The only Australian industries in operation at present are those established under the Pratten tariff introduced by the BrucePage Government. The duties imposed by this Government have not increased secondary production, but may have resulted in the introduction of some exotic industries which, under a sound, economic and scientific tariff, would never have been established in Australia. </para>

            <para>- I shall come to that in a. moment. The only industries that are of real benefit to Australia in a rehabilitation scheme are the primary industries, but nothing has been done by this Government to assist those industries which are so essential to Australia&#39;s prosperity. I did pay tribute to the Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> for the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and Canada; but I hope that my approval of that agreement will not for ever stand to my discredit. I congratulated the Minister for having consummated a commercial treaty between the two countries. I saw so much resentment being caused by Australia&#39;s fiscal policy that I welcomed an agreement which would keep one country at least out of the disgruntled group of nations that are imposing retaliatory duties against us. Whilst the Canadian agreement is of advantage to Australia in some respects, it &#39; is equally advantageous to Canada in other respects, and I remind the committee that the benefits to both those countries are at the expense of Great Britain. With that consequence of the agreement I expressed dissatisfaction on a previous occasion. The statement made by the Minister for Trade and Customs was entirely unsatisfactory. It is high time that the embargoes were removed. The friends of the Government have had a fair run; they should now let up and give the general public a chance. Parliament should immediately remove the embargoes and 50 per cent, surcharges and substitute an economically sound tariff. </para>

          <para>.- The Australian people were given to understand that the surcharges and embargoes were only temporary. What the Government&#39;s policy has achieved in improving the trade balance does not give much justification for boasting. Because of this policy the revenue from trade and customs is approximately &#163;12,000,000 short, and the people of Australia have to make up that amount by direct taxation. The manufacturers have taken advantage of the surcharges and embargoes to maintain prices, and the consumers, whose buying capacity has been reduced, are forced to pay. more for their goods. That is retarding the great primary industries. The Prime Minister, when shamefacedly announcing the embargoes,  admitted that the financial stringency would have regulated the imports. </para>

        <para>It is remarkable that men who are apparently of normal intelligence should imagine that they have explained the trade balance completely when they have struck a balance between imports and exports. The Minister for Trade and Customs stated that, during the period 1023 to 1929, Australia&#39;s accumulated adverse trade balance was &#163;78,000,000. No doubt the honorable gentleman totalled the imports and exports in that period, and convinced himself that the whole case had been completely stated. Other factors have to be taken into consideration when determining whether a country is going backward or forward economically. In connexion with the annual stocktaking of a  business it would be ridiculous for a proprietor to attempt to determine the prosperity of the enterprise merely by comparing sales and purchases. He must take into account the extent to which stocks and plant have increased or decreased during the year. It is possible for a business to i,are been really profitable during a particular period despite the fact that its outgoings were greater than its incomings, if it has built itself up by additions of stock and plant which make it capable of conducting its operations more efficiently and extensively. That applies also to a farm. A fanner may find at the end of a year that his receipts from sales total less than his purchases. <inline font-style="italic">Yet</inline> he may have done quite well during the twelve months ; he may have increased his stock and plant to such an extent that his enterprise is in a much stronger position than it previously occupied. In considering the financial position of the country also, we have to take into consideration not only sales and purchases, but another very important factor: additions to stock and plant. Only a few days ago the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> pointed out that during the last seven years about &#163;100,000,000 worth of machinery had been imported into Australia. That is productive plan t which enables this country to produce more, and better, than it did before. Obviously, when extensive borrowing takes place over a long period, an adverse trade balance cannot be avoided, because the loans come to us in the form of imports. During the seven years 1923-29 the States of Australia, not the Commonwealth, increased the national debt by &#163;207,000,000. The amount borrowed. came to us, not in gold, but in the form of machinery. and other imports. We have to bear that factor in mind when reckoning whether the country has gone forward or backward. The national prosperity cannot be gauged by merely setting the amount of exports against the imports during a given period. Some of the greatest&#39; industrial nations had long successions of adverse trade balances, while building themselves up industrially. The United States of America, while progressing from a debtor country to one of the principal creditor nations, had a long and unbroken succession of adverse trade balances. During those years it was strengthening itself by purchasing abroad machinery and other means of production. Australia has been doing the same during the last decade. I do not contend that all the money borrowed was wisely expended, but the importation of &#163;100,000.000 worth of machinery during the last seven years is an item to he entered on the credit side of the  ledger. It is manifestly unjust to blame the Government of the Commonwealth during the years 1923-29 for the increase in importations that resulted from the extensive borrowing by the States. The Minister for Trade and Customs only half stated the case, and reached an erroneous conclusion when he said that because the Commonwealth had had a series of adverse trade balances, it had necessarily retrogressed. In any case, borrowing has now ceased, and I believe that the adverse trade balance would have been rectified automatically without resort, to those extreme measures to which the Minister attributes the reduction of imports. Even had no embargoes or surcharges been imposed importations would have been substantially diminished. The principal factor in redressing the adverse trade balance has been the reduced purchasing power of our people. After the boom and collapse of 1893, New South &#34;Wales, which was a freetrade State, had a long succession of favorable trade balances, because its people were too impoverished to import. That is the position of Australia to-day. I believe that if the tariff wall were to fall to-morrow there would be an incentive to certain people to import, with the result that a further demand would bc made upon exchange, the effect of which would  be to raise it to whatever point was necessary to prevent our importing more than we could afford. That exchange would take the place of these duties. </para>

          <para>If it be accepted as a fact that it is beneficial to have an adverse balance of trade, why has it been necessary for Great Britain to change her fiscal policy, and to adopt something in the nature of a tariff in order to assist her industries? The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> was a Minister during the period when there were heavy imports into Australia.

How can it be argued, therefore, that such a policy is beneficial? The honorable member said that the position of a farm was improved by going into debt to purchase machinery.

        <para>The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> is not entitled to anything like the measure of credit that he claims in connexion with the correction of the trade balance. It is true that for some years our purchases exceeded our sales. That will inevitably occur when a country has money to spend. For years, Australia lived above her means, because of the plentiful supply of money in this country, chiefly loan money. That is the explanation of our adverse trade balance. But even without a trade embargo it would have been quite impossible for us when the conditions changed to continue our- purchases on the scale to which we had become accustomed. No loan money was available, and comparatively little was being received from our export trade. Embargoes unquestionably have contributed to the correction of the trade balance, but at what a cost to our trade with other countries ! They have resulted in retaliation by many of our best customers&#39;, and, unfortunately, that retaliation has been visited on our primary industries. </para>

            <para>- In Germany, France, Italy, South Africa and other countries retaliatory laws have been passed, and it is acknowledged that in many cases those laws have been enacted as a counter to the prohibitions that have been imposed by this Government. The idea of Australia living to herself and not trading under ordinary conditions with the rest of the world, will get us nowhere. We are too far away from the world&#39;s markets, and have too small a community, to attempt to be self-contained. If we wish to develop to any extent we must be prepared, while maintaining a policy of fair and reasonable protection, to. trade with other countries who are prepared to trade with us. The effect of a policy is best judged by the general results that it produces. While I do not suggest that we should enjoy anything like prosperity whatever policy was adopted, I do say that Australia is in a worse position today after an experience of nearly two years of the protectionist policy of this Government, than it had been in previously within the memory of honorable members ; and it is a striking fact that the period of acute depression commenced when these embargoes were imposed by the present Government. I do not say that our position is due entirely to the operation of these embargoes, nor to the general policy of the Government; but it can be argued that we are worse off than we might have been had we continued a moderate, reasonable policy, and one more in keeping with the tariffs of those countries with whom Ave trade. Australia is in the extraordinary position, of having a tariff higher than that of any other part of the world. I know that we do extraordinary things  by legislation in Australia. This is one of the greatest experiments that we have made, but it has not brought prosperity in its train. It has not improved our internal industries ; because they are less prosperous now than they have <inline font-style="italic">been</inline> for <inline font-style="italic">years. They</inline> are not producing as much now as they were before. In fact, during the last two years, apart from the favorable trade balance, there has been nothing to which we can point with any degree of satisfaction. I am asking for a fair measure of protection. It seems to me that our present tariff policy, which we were promised would be only of a temporary character, is altogether excessive. If these heavy duties and prohibitions were at the time of their imposition to any extent necessary, at any rate they have now accomplished their purpose. There should be a remission of all these embargoes and excessive duties which have been imposed by this Government. </para>

          <para>.- I desire to say a word or two on the tariff, because it is a real reflex of the Labour party&#39;s policy, and, as such, I am prepared to support it. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> has said that our tariff policy has restricted our overseas markets, but he knows that he has not stated the facts. I have not heard from honorable members opposite one speech in which they have come down to tin-tacks, and shown where our overseas trade has been detrimentally affected by the tariff policy of this Government. Within the last month our overseas trade has shown a distinct improvement. According to the newspapers wo exported over 30,000,000 eggs. That is a record. The whole of our dried fruit has been sold. Within the last few weeks wool prices have firmed, and the newspapers contain illustrations of woolbuyers wildly competing for the various lots offered at the sales throughout Aus-., tralia. Wheat prices are recovering, and many people contend that Australia has now turned the corner to prosperity. The Government&#39;s tariff policy has certainly been in the best interests of Australia. The honorable member for Perth has said that the depression dated from the time the Government introduced its tariff proposals, but he well knows that that is a misstatement. The depression started from the time we were unable to borrow money abroad for the employment of our people. As Professor Irvine recently said in Sydney, the biggest buyer of our commodities, whether manufactured here or imported, is &#39; the worker, and once the source of his income dries up the effect is soon felt throughout the community. Two years ago I tried to promote employment by advocating an expansion of credit of &#163;20,000,000, but my efforts were unsuccessful. Since that time the banks have advanced more than that sum, but in dribs and drabs, thus nullifying any beneficial effect. The Governments of Australia have been trying to balance their budgets, at the same time starving the people instead of giving them work which would develop the secondary industries of this country and afford some evidence of prosperity. It is not the tariff that has brought about the depression in this country, but the cessation of borrowing abroad, and the load of interest which we are being asked to carry and which we cannot carry. It is the failure of the Government to provide finance from other sources that has heightened the depression. Some people are now preening themselves on the fact that the rehabilitation plan is beginning to have good results, and that there is less unemployment in South Australia. A representative of the Citizens League in that State has made such statements in Melbourne and Sydney. But let me say that if we cannot, by natural means, relieve the unemployment in our midst while spring is with us, God help, those who are out of work when winter comes. There must come a point at which no further unemployment is possible. Unemployment to-day is a black blot upon Australia. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> talked about a fair measure of protection, but if I had something to protect, and it were threatened by some one else, I would use my physical powers in an effort to give him a knockout. That is what I call fair protection. Let us get down to the tariff. </para>

            <para>- Honorable members opposite have had to swallow this tariff, and surely that is a downward process. The honorable member is in favour of assistance being given to the wheat producers to the extent of &#163;3,000,000. Yet the unfortunate unemployed are to be left to the mercy of the banking  institutions. In 1929-30, we imported 7,879 cwt&#39;. of glucose valued at &#163;8,270. The imports of glucose have now been reduced to 62 cwt., valued at &#163;28. Will any honorable member contend that that is not in the best interests of Australia and of the primary producers generally? If we manufacture glucose, and in the process make use of the maize grown in Australia, are we not acting in the best interests of this country? It is ridiculous to say that we should continue to import glucose. Our imports of biscuits have fallen from 500,000&#39; lb. to 34,000 lb. Why should we import biscuits when we can manufacture them as well as people overseas? Is there anything wonderful in the manufacture of laundry blue? It is merely a household article which should be manufactured here. Our imports of cheese have fallen from 500,000 lb. to 30,000 lb. Is that not in the interests of the primary producers? Under tariff protection, we are increasing our exports of cheese. I challenge honorable members to point to any primary product -which has been detrimentally affected by our tariff policy. We shall not get rid of the depression until there is an alteration of the system under which we live, and until we can give to t he worker who is now on the dole&#39; an opportunity to work and to regain his self respect, so that he may meet his fellow men on equal terms instead of having to line up in a queue awaiting the dole. The dole system is demoralizing this nation. We must adopt a. sane policy of development in order to enable our people to return to work, and to enable this country to progress in respect of both its primary and secondary industries. The Australian workman has been more than once eulogized for his skill. </para>

If we can make socks from wool we should go on making them until we can make them of synthetic silk. I am a sound protectionist, and I support these special duties. I hope that the schedule will be increased by other items if it can be done with advantage to Australia. I commend the Government for this schedule. It cannot be contended by honorable members opposite - by any logical argument at any rate - that the &#34;Government did not do the right thing in imposing these duties. </para>

            <para>- I think that I can show the right honorable gentleman that he did so. The circumstances to-day are quite different from those in existence when these special duties were applied. At that time our trade balance was an adverse one, and the prohibitions and super taxes imposed by the Government received a measure of support from the Opposition because we were alive to the fact that many of the items affected covered foodstuffs which need not be imported. Circumstances, however, are now entirely different. The adverse trade balance has been adjusted, possibly, as the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> has suggested, as the result of the heavy exchange rate. At the outset I contended that one effect of these prohibitions and super taxes would bo the destruction of our trade with Great Britain, our best customer for all our products, and capable of absorbing the whole of our exports if we go the right way about it. The prohibitions have not been the means of increasing employment. On the contrary, since their imposition unemployment has increased. There has been a reduction of customs revenue. The moderate duties on many of these items prior to the imposition of the super taxes and prohibitions brought in some revenue, the loss of which has had to be made up by imposing heavy primage duties on essential imports. Some honorable members, like the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jones),</inline> claim that they ure 100 per cent. Australian. I hate to think that any Australian is so dense as to think that a nation can live to itself. Isolation always reacts on those people who seek to apply it. Even the hoarding of gold has had a reactionary effect upon those countries that have attempted it. Honorable members who cannot see further than their own noses in that respect are only bringing trouble to their own country. To say that we shall make everything within  our  own country implies that we intend to sell to everybody and buy only from ourselves. </para>

Yet honorable members preach it in their trade unions, and they are loudly applauded by the unthinking. These abnormal schedules which the Minister has brought down from time to time have not given the work that was intended of them. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline></para>

        <para>The selfish, narrow and reactionary policy of trying to live to ourselves alone not only increases unemployment, but also brings about a reduction of customs revenue which means that a heavier burden of taxation has to be borne by the remaining taxpayers. This policy, when applied, has also a reactionary effect internationally. The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> is not aware that certain countries with which Australia formerly had a favorable trade balance have reacted most unfavorably towards our exports. France, Italy and Germany have each placed heavy duties on Australian wheat and other products. I brought under the notice of the Minister a threat of retaliation from a French agent. </para>

            <para>- Yes. When the Commonwealth imposed a duty on Vichy water, a mineral water bottled in a French town under the supervision of the French authorities, the French agent for this water held up his hands in horror, so to speak, and exclaimed, &#34; This stupid Government believes that it can make Vichy water!&#34; He concluded a communication on the subject by threatening retaliation by France on some of the produce France purchases from Australia. Fortunately, the Commonwealth Government saw fit to alter the duty. </para>

            <para>- I am merely replying to what the honorable member for Adelaide said. By its policy of high duties, supertaxes and embargoes, assisted by an adverse rate of exchange, and heavy shipping freights, Australia is reaching an unstable situation. It is somewhat like an inverted pyramid, about to topple at any moment. If we add to the policy already in operation, that of seeking to isolate ourselves from the outside world, the whole structure is bound to fall. Unless Australia makes up its mind to get back to a sensible basis of selective protection, and accepts the advice of the Tariff Board in the matter of imposing duties, we shall not get back on to the road to recovery. The recent slight rise  in the price of wool is merely a passing phase; the price may drop again in a month or two. </para>

            <para>- In the course of his speech the honorable member for Balaclava said that these surcharges minimized the degree of preference given to Great Britain. If the honorable member will turn to the memorandum on page 12, he will see that in the case of motor car bodies, the protection to Great Britain has been increased from 40 per cent, to 60 per cent. As to the duties on chassis, instead of being 5 per cent., 35 per cent., and 45 per cent., British, intermediate and general, respectively, the surcharge of 50 per cent, has increased them to 7&#163; per cent., 52&#163; per cent., and 67^ per cent., respectively. It is amusing to hear the critics of the Government speaking with different voices regarding the effect of these duties. Some of. them say that the duties will make no difference whatever, because a restriction of imports would have been brought about by the rationing of credits by the banks, while other honorable members of -the same party say that these duties have increased unemployment. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. The fact is that these duties have minimized unemployment; had it  not been for them many thousands more of our people&#39; would now be out of work. The items were carefully selected by the Government, and they have also been subjected to the most careful scrutiny by officers of the department, as well as by the Tariff Board which was called into consultation. The Tariff Board was asked for suggestions as to items which might be eliminated or new items which might be inserted. The schedule contains a number of luxury lines which can&#34; be manufactured in Australia or done without. Although Australia produces large quantities of dried fruits, it imported from other countries considerable quantities of dried fruits before these duties were imposed. Now the importation of dried fruits has been prohibited. </para>

The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> deplored the policy of prohibiting imports, on the ground that it adversely affected Australian wharf labourers. To follow that lo its conclusion we should wipe, out our secondary industries and import everything. The result, however, would be the unemployment of nearly 500,000 persons engaged in our factories. The late Government encouraged imports to such an extent that many additional men were recruited to the waterfront, so that when the time came when we could no longer pay for imported goods, there was a surplus of labour on the waterfront. That labour will have to be absorbed in other avocations, as will also the 200,000 workers who were kept in employment by reason of the expenditure of loan moneys. As they cannot all be absorbed  in  primary production, seeing that our primary producers are already experiencing difficulty in finding markets for their products and many lines are already overproduced, they must be absorbed in secondary industries. The Government is seeking new avenues of employment. In the tobacco-growing industry there is scope for the employment of a good number of workers in growing the tobacco for which we previously paid &#163;3,000,000 a year to the United States of America. The Government has laid the foundation on which a number of secondary industries can be built. It is wrong to say that protection has failed. The growth of unemployment is due, not to our policy of protection, but to the fall in our national income by &#163;200,000,000 a year because of the lower prices now obtaining for our staple primary products and also because of the reduced purchasing power of the people. I ask what would have happened had these duties not been imposed, seeing that prices have fallen in other countries? But for the duties, many of our secondary industries would have had to close down altogether. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> said that an exchange rate of 30 per cent, was a sufficient restriction on imports. The Government, after consulting with a number of leading bankers, realized that a curtailment of credits by the banks was not sufficient to restrict the importation of luxury lines, and, therefore, it decided to put into effect a scientific restriction of imports. Previously, numbers of people were obtaining credit overseas by selling wool and other Australian products, and purchasing motor cars and other luxury lines with the proceeds. The banks admitted that they could not restrict such action. </para>

        <para>However politically biased honorable members may be, they must admit that, whereas in 1929-30 Australia had an adverse trade balance of ?3.2,000,000, it had a favorable trade balance of over ?28,000,000 in 1930-31. Since Australia has to find an additional ?9,000,000 per annum for exchange and other charges in London, making a total of over ?30,000,000 a year, it will be realized that the time has not yet arrived for taking ofl the surcharge.

        <para class="block">There is no justification whatever for these extraordinary special duties of 50 per cent. Prior to these increases, the duties imposed on dress-making material and millinery were worth ?1,905,000 per annum to the industry if it took full advantage of them, yet the wages and salaries paid in the industry totalled only ?1,507,000. Since then the Minister has trebled the tariff on such articles. Under the old rates the duties on hats and caps were worth ?637,000, yet the total of wages and salaries paid in the industry was only ?622,000. Similarly, the duties on shirts, ties and underclothing were worth ?2,209,000, yet the salaries and wages paid in the industry were only ?1,547,000. These figures, I again remind the committee, relate to customs collections on the items enumerated prior to the trebling of the duties by the Minister in this most arbitrary manner. Apparently also the Government was so &#34; flush &#34; of money that it could afford to dispense with revenue amounting to ?119,000, obtained from the duty on matches, because the Minister imposed an embargo on the importation of matches and, so far, has not made any attempt to get anything by way of excise duties from the local manufacturers who are profiteering on the community. </para>

And only a few days ago the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> directed attention to the sweating that was reported in the clothing industry in Melbourne, and  the Prime Minister has called for a report upon the subject. Many people who advocate these excessive duties forget that, in the long run, the public have to pay.

            <para>- Any person with common sense will admit that in 1920 production costs all over the world were abnormally high. But I invite the honorable member to consider the cost of agricultural machinery in 1913 and compare it with present-day costs. In Germany manufacturing costs are now lower than in pre-war days, and the cable news of yesterday reported that costs in Great Britain had dropped to 98 per cent, in comparison with 1913 figures. In protesting against these excessive duties I have in mind particularly the hardship which they inflict upon the poorer sections of the community. Surely no one will attempt to justify the trebling of the duties on clothing. In addition to the high rates obtaining prior to the imposition of these special duties there is a natural protection of 30 per cent, representing the adverse exchange. We were told, when these duties were brought down, that their special purpose was to correct the adverse trade balance. </para>

            <para>- But wages in industry are lower, and they are likely to recede still further, because, unfortunately, there are so few buyers and so many people are being thrown out of employment in a number of industries in order to provide special conditions for a favoured few. No one can persuade me that the special duties on matches are justified. Their only effect has been to increase greatly the cost of matches in every household.  This may be a small item, but it is one of hundreds to be found throughout the tariff, in which there have been extraordinary increases. The Government is losing well over &#163;100,000 a year in customs revenue on matches alone, merely to give a concession to a few firms. Can any honorable member tell me how many Swedes are associated with the match industry in Australia? A somewhat similar position developed in connexion with the duties on galvanized iron. Because &#163;500,000 of the &#34;shares in Lysaght Limited, Newcastle, is held by John Lysaght, Bristol, as payment for the use of trade marks, brands and processes, the Minister was persuaded that the duties on galvanized iron should be high enough tq ensure to that concern an adequate dividend on the excess capital, and, unfortunately, honorable members supporting the Government appear to be only too anxious to look after the interests of these manufacturing concerns, so many of which are exploiting the .people. I hope, however, that the committee will realize that the Government has already gone too far with its protectionist policy, and that in this matter it will clip the wings of the Ministry by voting for my amendment. </para>

              <para>- The duties cannot be justified now when we consider the grounds submitted by the Minister when they were imposed. From my point of view, this matter resolves itself into one of employment. Those whom I directly represent in this Parliament have been adversely affected by these special duties, and I am seeking an opportunity to lighten their burdens in  some small measure. That may seem to some honorable members to be a selfish attitude, but we in this House are the direct representatives of specific areas, and it is our duty to watch the interests of those living in such areas, and also, of course, to conserve the interests of the country as a whole. The condition of some of those whom I represent could not be worse, and for this the duties we are now &#39; discussing are largely responsible. As I pointed out before, it would not be so bad if the men for whom I am speaking had been absorbed into secondary industries when they lost their employment on the waterfront, but this was not possible, because credit was not made available to develop these industries and provide employment. The power to make credit available has been allowed by the Government to remain with the banks, which saw fit to adopt another policy than, that of stimulating secondary industries. Since those of my constituents who have been affected have obtained no relief because of the failure of the expansion of secondary industries, I regard . it as my duty to do what is possible to secure the removal of these duties. Their removal is vitally necessary to those engaged in waterside occupations. The Minister said that the prosperity enjoyed in recent years drew to the waterfront a great many workers who might otherwise have been profitably engaged in other occupations. That may be true, but it is also true that hundreds, and even thousands, of the original waterside workers are now denied the opportunity of securing employment in their former occupations. That also applies to those engaged in various branches of the transport industry associated with the waterfront. The policy of the Government has been one of protection for our secondary industries, and the removal of these special imposts does not&#39; interfere with that policy because the goods affected are not manufactured in Australia. As these impositions rebound to the detriment of workers, whom I represent, and who are in need of assistance and, as the amendment before the House provides for an investigation that may result in the correction of this existing evil, and will probably help those who badly need help, I shall support it. </para>

          <para>While I do not doubt that the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> has some legitimate grounds for his argument, I submit that his attitude on this matter is an ultra-selfish one. What is to happen to those who are now employed in different factories if we allow unlimited importations of these commodities into Australia? Although wharf labourers may represent a fair number of our great army of unemployed, I believe no good could be served by throwing additional men out of employment, and so swelling that army. The honorable member had an opportunity to correct this evil two years ago, when he was a member of the Government. Time after time it was pointed Out that the Government should endeavour to absorb the production of the country by providing employment. This Government was returned to power to introduce an effective tariff, and it is putting its policy into force. Other governments were afraid to grasp the nettle, and give our industries proper protection. I invite honorable members opposite to take these items one by one, and give some valid reason why any should be excluded. It could not be done. Every member of the Country party should be behind this action of the Government, which benefits primary producers in addition to those in our secondary industries. </para>

          <para class="block">The matches manufactured in the Commonwealth are a credit to the country. Is it not better to have them turned out under white Australian conditions than to revert to the barbarism of sweated labour that obtained in Victoria years ago ? And that was not the result of any tariff. It was brought about by the inherent desire of capitalists to get labour as cheaply as possible, and to treat human beings as part of their machinery plant. </para>

              <para>- If the Government can find out who is responsible for them they will quickly be ended. The honorable member and his colleagues were out to scrap arbitration so that their friends might have an open go in the economic ring. Heretofore those people have won the day because they had a shoe in the glove. In a fair, open go, the workers would put them &#34; out &#34; in two rounds. No other country in the world has better workers than those to be found in Australia. Unfortunately, for many years a coterie of capitalists dominated this and other Parliaments, and nobodydared defy them. The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> indicated that the existing rate of exchange caused much of our trouble. That rate is not the outcome of normal trading. It went up by leaps and bounds because capitalists bought up all the English credits that they could in order to get their money out of the country. That is why we are. paying some &#163;10,000,000 per annum more than we should. </para>

          <para>I am glad that the Government is doing something which it was elected to do. I hope that before long it will take courage and carry out its complete policy. Then a few bank managers and financiers will no longer be able to determine what shall be done. I direct attention to the appalling conditions that exist at La Perouse. On the one side, blacks; on the other, whites. I admit that the blacks have every right to be there. The country is theirs. The whites, too, have a right to a proper existence. Those people have built up the country just as much as have our pioneers. Unf ortunately, the land has been &#34;  soonerized  &#34;, and the &#34;  soonerizers  &#34; will not get off it : They hold more ground than they need.

              <para>- Statistics irrefutably prove the contrary. When the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lewis)</inline> was speaking, an honorable member declared that he had not done any productive work during his life. Certainly very few honorable members opposite have. Personally, I worked in a factory for seventeen years, after which I went forwarding, then became traveller, and later &#34;counterskipper &#34;, all with the one firm ; so that I know how business is carried on. This Government is certainly rectifying an evil, but the only real solution of the problem is to place our people on the land. I have watched the progress of this country from the time when we were told that if we were not satisfied with the laws of the land we should enter politics. One of the first actions taken in South Australia under Labour rule was to break up the big estates for the purposes of closer settlement ; but now, when a large estate is cut up, the blocks are purchased by those who already have more land than they require. Men in South Australia who obtained land under the soldier settlement scheme are snowed under by the values at which the land had to be purchased. </para>

            <para>.- This clause provides that duties imposed pursuant to the customs tariff proposal introduced on the 3rd April, 1930, shall be deemed to have been lawfully imposed. A period of eighteen months has elapsed since the imposition of these duties. In September, 1929, or over two years ago,, large increases in duty were imposed, and even now, those proposals must be passed by the other branch of the legislature before they become law. For over two years heavy imposts have been placed upon the people, without parliamentary approval, and I contend  that  the practice is utterly wrong. I hope that, in the near future, the law will be amended so that duties will not be effective until they have received parliamentary approval, as is the position in  the United States of America, or unless they are approved within 90 days. We have before us a list of embargoes on over 80 items. It was never intended that the Minister should have power to say that Australia shall not trade with other countries. I am not discussing the merit of any particular duty ; I am merely contending, on broad principles, that tariff imposts and embargoes should not operate until parliamentary approval has been obtained. </para>

          <para class="block">This motion is designed to give effect to the Government&#39;s desire to remove certain disabilities under which primary producers have been labouring, because of the imposition of primage duty on bran, onion, potato, and ore bags. These goods are being added to the list of goods exempt from the payment of primage duty. Under the primage resolution of the 10th July, 1931, such bags were specially included as being subject to primage duty at 4 per cent., and the most convenient way to give effect to the Government&#39;s intention is to table a new resolution. Under the provisions of this motion &#34; bags, sacks, packs and bales for bran, chaff, potatoes, onions, coal corn, flour, sugar and wool &#34; will be exempt from primage duty. </para>
          <para>Following on a recent decision of the Government, Bibles and the New Testament have also been included in the list of goods exempted from primage duty. </para>
          <para>The opportunity is also being taken to include in the resolution the variations made by proclamation to the resolution tabled on the 10th July, 1931. The following minor alterations have also been made to give better effect to the intention of the previous resolution: - The words &#34; agricultural, horticultural and viticultural &#34; have been added before &#34; spraying preparations &#34;, and the word &#34; sheep &#34; has been inserted before &#34; shearing machines.&#34; Apart from these additions and exceptions the resolution is similar to that previously tabled. </para>
          <para>The primage duty was increased to 10 per cent. on the recommendation of the experts who were consulted in connexion with the financial rehabilitation plan agreed to at the Premiers Conference. </para>

              <para>- Practically all the experts agreed to this recommendation. The Government expects to receive &#163;4,250,000 in additional revenue in the current financial year through the imposition of the extra primage duties, but if the numerous requests made for exemptions were acceded to, there would be practically no increase in revenue. Every day new applications come to hand f orexemptions from this duty of articles upon which the taxation is at present being collected. The Government&#39;s experience in regard to primage duty has been similar to that in regard to sales taxation. Everybody can make out a good case for the exemption of the particular lines which he handles, but the exigencies of the financial situation are such that, although sympathetic consideration has been given to all the requests made for exemptions, many of them have had to be rejected. I regret to have to inform honorable members that no additional exemptions can be granted. </para>

          <para>If the Government is to honour the undertaking given by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer at the Premiers Conference, it must insist on the resolution being agreed to in its present form. The line&#39; of demarcation between goods exempt and other goods is no doubt somewhat arbitrary, but it is necessary to adhere to it, otherwise there will be a serious diminution of revenue. </para>

This seems to me to be an oversight. As bags, sacks, packs, and bales are exempt from this duty, it is reasonable and consistent that the twine used for sewing them should also be exempt. It has been recognized by the Government that every assistance should be given to primary producers, particularly in regard to the provision of containers for their produce, and there is, therefore, every justification for removing &#34; fibres for use in the manufacture of binder twine &#34; from the 4 per cent. list, and placing them on the free list. </para>

            <para>.- The Government has given very careful consideration to the compilation of the lists included in the motion, and it has also sympathetically considered every application made for exemption from primage duty. I think every impartial honorable member will realize, if he examines the lists, that a great deal has been done to assist the primary producers. We should very much like to enlarge the free list; but, as I have already pointed out, it is essential that we shall obtain sufficient revenue to enable us to carry out the undertakings that have been given to the Premiers Conference. I regret, therefore, that I am unable to accept the amendment. </para>

              <para>- I suggest that it would be desirable for us to make a general provision for the exemption of bags, sacks, packs, and bales used as containers for produce. I point out that bags are used for pollard and turnips and many other things. Unless these commodities are specifically mentioned, or the provision is passed in more general terms, the primary producers may be obliged to pay duty on their sacks. </para>

            <para>.- Included in the list of goods exempt from primage duty is the item &#34; Bibles, and the New Testament &#34;. That is rather ambiguous, because the Bible comprises the Old and the New Testaments, and if the New Testament is mentioned separately from the Bible it would appear that the only portion of the Bible that would be exempt would be the New Testament. If the item were amended to read &#34; The Bible or any portion thereof &#34; it would give the British and Foreign Bible Society, and other similar organizations, an opportunity to import portions of the Bible free of primage duty. I understand that it is the intention of the Government to admit any portion of the Book free of primage duty. </para>

            <para>.- Under this resolution bullion and specie are exempt from primage duty, but there appears to be an obvious anomaly. Gold is exempt from primage duty, as also is gold containing platinum. Platinum is not produced in any quantity in Australia, and is subject to 10 per cent, primage duty. Gold containing platinum can be imported for dental purposes in 3 dwt. portions, free of primage duty. There is, therefore, unfair competition between Australian makers of dental gold and those using gold containing platinum, the former &#39; having to pay <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> primage duty of 10 per cent, on the platinum so imported. The matter should be cleared up. one way or the other. Gold containing platinum should bear a 10 per cent, primage duty or platinum should be placed on the exempt list. Those using gold containing platinum on which a 10 per cent, duty is imposed on the platinum cannot compete with those who have no such duty to pay. I move - </para>

            <para>. - If the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibbons)</inline> is correct in his assertion that those producing platinum cannot find a ready market for their product, the commodity should not be placed on the exempt list, but I doubt that such is the case. If the Minister cannot accept the amendment moved by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White),</inline> will he adopt some other means to overcome the difficulty ? It would appear that regulations are sometimes framed to meet the peculiarities of importers who wish to evade the payment of duty. I ask the Minister to see if some subterfuge is not being indulged in in order to have this metal placed on the exempt list. </para>

            <para>.- I  regret  that I cannot accept the amendment moved by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White).</inline> Platinum is used chiefly by dentists and jewellers who, I do not think, are in need of relief in this direction. A number of other requests have been refused, and if the word &#34; platinum &#34; were inserted it might be held that jewellery in which platinum is used was also covered. As only &#163;10,000 worth is imported annually, it would mean giving relief to the extent of only &#163;1,000 a year which, in view of all the circumstances, is not worth worrying about. It is not likely that any dentist will go out of business if platinum is not placed on the exempt list. </para>

            <para>.- I ask the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> to indicate if he is willing to include books on the exempt list. The position generally is that the booksellers in Australia are in a very precarious position as a result of the imposition of this and other duties. They are compelled to rely upon overseas sources for their supplies, because, in the main, the books used most extensively in Australia are not produced in this country. In view&#39; of the customs and primage duties, and sales tax, as well as incidental charges, 70 per cent, of the value of books has to be added before they can be offered for sale. Any one who knows anything of the bookselling business will realize that this is a severe impost upon the intellectual and .book-reading section of the community. The net result of this and other imposts is that the booksellers -have had to increase their prices to the reading public, which has been correspondingly penalized. These duties have also resulted in increased unemployment. </para>

          <para>I have given in the main the points that I wished to stress. I sum up by saying that this duty on books greatly increases their cost; actually the increase has been over 70 per cent. As the Tariff Board has reported, it provides very little extra work for printers, and- on the other hand has actually deprived many booksellers of their living. It substantially reduces the possibility of Australian authors placing their works ahead, and in addition prevents Australia from being given, by one of the most effective means available, that world-wide publicity which it needs. If it were so disposed, the Government could amend the schedule of duties so as to secure the ends that I have in view. By so doing, it would give relief in circumstances that very definitely call for relief, without interfering with the mental food of the people of this nation. I move - </para>

            <para>. - I support the proposal of the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan).</inline> This is a reasonable proposition, and it would not involve the Government in any considerable sacrifice of revenue. I would not argue the matter if I thought that it would do so. I realize, of course, that the principal objective of the Government is to obtain revenue, so as to give effect to the agreement arrived at by the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, and that otherwise a duty would not have been imposed on many of these items. But ought not our educational facilities to be given due weight by the Government &#39;( While books and periodicals that are imported for public libraries are permitted to come in at the rate of 4 per cent., school books, which are equally deserving of consideration, have to carry the higher rate of duty. That is a direct impost upon education. The Minister would have every justification for including them in the list of exemptions. Thi.tax, in conjunction with sales tax and exchange, makes the importation of book1 prohibitive. A book that formerly could be purchased for 10s. or 12s. 6d. costs to-day considerably over &#163;1. It cannot make for the welfare of this country that books which are in circulation in other countries should be prevented from coming here, and enlarging the knowledge of our people. As the honorable member for Darling Downs has pointed out, the Tariff Board, in a most exhaustive and valuable report that has as its basis the evidence of university professors, and of practically every educational society in Australia, has expressed the view that a tax on books is a tax on education, and that it places upon the people of this country a disability that is not borne by the people of any other country in the world. We should not add to our other distinctions by making costs so prohibitive that technical, school, or rare books cannot be introduced into Australia. I invite the Minister to give this matter sympathetic consideration. </para>

              <para>- It is quite impossible to make that distinction. With imports amounting to &#163;1,000,000 annually, the revenue that would be lost by the removal of the primage duties would be &#163;100,000 per annum. Unfortunately, tbe Government cannot afford to forgo such a large sum. The honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> has quoted from the report of the Tariff Board. That board reported with respect to a protective duty, which is very different from this duty. If the protective duty that was sought by certain printers and publishers were granted, it would make the importation of books practically impossible. Primage is purely a revenue duty. </para>

              <para>- Exchange has increased the price to a three times greater extent than the primage duty. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> cited the case of a book costing 10s. The addition of 30 per cent. to that figure would raise it by 3s. 4d., whereas the primage would amountto only about 1s. 4d. It is true that sales tax, also, has to be added. Many of the arguments that have been used by booksellers with a view to showing that the primage duty has been responsible for the falling off that has taken place in the sales of books, are fallacious. The depression has hit the bookseller probably more severely than any other business man. Thousands of persons who formerly spent pounds annually in the purchase of books have had to curtail their expenditure in that direction. </para>

              <para>-  Is that not a good argument for loosening up in regard to duties?  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FORDE.-</inline> In the case of books and periodicals that are imported for public libraries, the duty remains at 4 per cent. I believe that booksellers generally would be satisfied if that rate were applied to all books. The Government would like to do that, but finds itself unable to do so. It must raise the necessary revenue to carry out the decision of the Premiers Conference, to approach as closely as possible to the balancing of the budget without making any further cuts in essential services; consequently, it must adhere to proposals that bring in such substantial sums as this. Honorable members cannot point to any other avenue in which &#163;100,000 per annum could be raised without inflicting even greater hardship upon the community. </para>

But. it ought to keep out of this particular field. Does it wish to place a tax on knowledge, and to encourage intellectual starvation in Australia? When one looks round this chamber one is inclined to feel that we are already suffering from that malady. Because of her isolation, Australia is cut off from the culture of the old world, and if we. have not ready access to books, particularly educational works, we must suffer in consequence. The primage of 10 per cent, is a very severe tax,- because, coupled with other taxes, it makes almost prohibitive the importation of books. I quote the following article that appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 6th instant, evidently from the pen of an Australian writer: - </para>

If a book written by an Australian and published in the Colonial edition were sold . at, say, 9s. 6d., the royalty on it would be approximately 2d. So it is evident that the bookseller, the author and the employees in the book trade suffer from the slightest taxation on literature.  The Minister has intimated that he will not consider placing books upon the free list, and I, therefore, give notice that I shall move that educational books be added to the list of books and periodicals imported for public libraries and subject to a 4 per cent, primage duty. 1 urge the Minister to make this concession in respect of educa*tional books, particularly in this time of depression. </para>

              <para>- That can be denned by the department in consultation with the booksellers. At the moment the citizens of Australia are finding exceptional difficulty in attending to the education of their children. Those who hitherto have sent their children to public schools are now, in many instances, transferring them to State schools. So that if the Government is producing a revenue of &#163;100,000 by means of the primage tax on books, it would be no exaggeration to- say that it will lose more than .that because of the increased cost of educating those children who are now being transferred from public to State schools. I earnestly urge the Minister to reconsider this matter. I know that representations have been made to him by the Australian Society of Authors, various booksellers  associations, and other organizations connected with the trade. If he will not place these books on the free list I hope that he will at least place them in the category of books for public libraries, which are subject to a primage duty of 4 per cent. </para>

            <para>.- 1 feel inclined to favour the amendment foreshadowed by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. White).</inline> I hope that the Minister will make some concession in respect of books that are required for educational purposes. By interjection I asked the honorable member for Balaclava what he meant by educational books, and he replied that the department could arrive at a definition. I suggest that it is not fair to ask the department to do that. </para>

              <para>- I suggest that books in use by educational institutions should be made available at the lowest cost. I realize that many books, including fiction, as has been suggested by the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan),</inline> are of value to the community. I also appreciate the fact that, as the Government has to obtain revenue, it is difficult to exclude books and periodicals from the primage duty. But I suggest that books used for purely educational purposes should be in the category of books for public libraries. Books used in the education of our young people should at least be made available to educational institutions at no greater cost than at present, and I even suggest that they be admitted free. It is all-important that literature should be made available to the community. I agree with the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell),</inline> who interjected, that it is a pity that this revenue has to be raised by way of a tax on books, because literature is of real value to mankind throughout the world. But we are in the unfortunate position of having to raise money in an effort to balance the budget. The honorable member for Darling Downs has emphasized the fact that there has been a falling-off in the demand for books. I suggest that there has been a falling-off in every direction so far as the purchasing power of the people is concerned. The necessaries of life are more vital to the community than books, and it is difficult to-day for many of our people to feed and clothe themselves. They can do without books, but not without food and clothing. I urge the Minister to accept the suggestion of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White),</inline> and to place books used for educational purposes in the category of books for public libraries. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline></para>

            <para>.- If we were members of an oligarchy, or had we a despotic form of government in this country, it would be a matter of small moment were all books denied to the public; but we are members of a democracy in which every man is equal at the ballot-box. We should, therefore, strive to provide educational facilities for the people. The greatest danger that a democracy has to overcome is ignorance and any increase in the cost of books will make it increasingly difficult for the general public to obtain information which should rightly be given to the people of a democracy. Therefore, I am heartily in agreement with the amendment of the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan).</inline> He has shown by quotations from the report of the Tariff Board what is its opinion, I wish also to draw the attention of the committee to the evidence given before the board. As honorable members know, there are few publishing houses in Australia, and one of the largest is the firm of Angus and Robertson, Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson,</inline> a member of that firm, when giving evidence before the board, said that he was opposed to any duty on books, not for business reasons, because undoubtedly a duty on books would assist his firm, but on principle. I think that the community owes a debt to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> for making that statement. This firm, in addition to being publishers, is one of the largest book-selling organizations in the Commonwealth, but the publishing side of the business is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson&#39;s</inline> baby; he takes a keener interest in publishing than in any other ramification of the business. He stated before the Tariff Board that he did not desire, nor did he deem it advisable to impose, a duty on books. The Minister for Markets, prior to entering politics, was connected with the educational system of this country. He knows full well the absolute necessity for placing knowledge as cheaply as possible before the public. To that end great publishing firms, not only here, but also in &#34;Great Britain, have placed popular editions of books upon the market with the sole object of bringing the great classics to the meaner homes of the world. We, in Australia, pride ourselves upon our educational facilities and upon the standard of education which is open to every boy and girl in the community. But now, through this Government, we are placing an almost prohibitive duty upon  books which should be available to the younger generation at the lowest cost. I recognize that the Government must find revenue; but I prefer that it be obtained in some way other than by placing a tax on literature, which is the life-blood of this nation. If we are to survive as a democracy we must do nothing to restrict the opportunity of our poorer citizens to obtain the greatest literature of the world. I am confident that every honorable member is in sympathy with the amendment of the honorable member for&#34; Darling Downs. Indeed the Minister stated that the Government is sympathetic. Surely there can be some point at which we can meet. The honorable member for Darling Downs does not suggest that all books should be admitted free of primage duty, but there are some that should, and I hope that the Government can see its way to make a line of demarcation permitting books on one side of the line to be admitted free and compelling books on the other side which Australia could very well do without, if necessary, to pay an increased rate of duty. </para>

            <para>.- There is a general impression among honorable members that books of a technical character not printed in Australia pay customs duty. That is not so. As a matter of fact, I believe they are admitted free. Honorable members must not run away with the idea that printers and publishers in Australia are not capable of doing first-class work. They are doing wonderful work. Henry  Ford&#39;s  recent book, <inline font-style="italic">My Life and Work,</inline> has been printed and published in Australia, and sold at about half the price charged in America. It was not a cheap book in the sense that it was printed on cheap paper, and with poor type. Taking into consideration our population the circulation of the work in Australia was larger than in any other country of the world. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs I was gratified at the very fine range and variety of books which I found were being published in Australia. There has been mention of school books to-night. I think that if honorable members took the trouble to inquire at the State Government Printing Offices they would find that the great bulk of the State school-books in use in Australia to-day are printed in Australia. When I was on the other side of the world a deputation of publishers introduced by Lord Riddell, one of the leading newspaper proprietors and publishers of Great Britain, waited on me. It produced several books published in Australia, and said that the British publishers had no objection to the imposition of customs duty on that class of books, but they protested against duties being imposed on books of a highly technical nature published in very expensive volumes which could not economically be produced except in one part of the world for distribution to the rest of the world. </para>

              <para>- The primage duty is imposed for the purpose of raising revenue. Were it not for the special financial circumstances hooks of the type of which I am speaking would not be taxed. My reason for speaking now is to put in a special plea for the Australian compositor, the Australian reader, and the Australian editor. All the printing that can be done in Australia ought to be done in Australia. The Minister has promised that if the financial position improves he will recommend to Cabinet an alteration of the- primage duty on books. I could suggest a dozen articles on which primage duty should be remitted before it is remitted in regard to books which can be printed in Australia. </para>

            <para>.- I should not have spoken had it not been for the remarks of the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton).</inline> The honorable member made out an excellent case for the free admission of educational text-books. He said that many excellent books are printed in Australia; but I challenge him to produce Australian books on many technical subjects. If the honorable member were to write a book, and attempted to get an Australian publisher to publish it, he would realize some of the difficulties associated with the printing of books in this country. A publisher has regard only to the requirements of the reading public. I give the honorable member credit for consistency; but blind consistency  only leads to trouble, and protection with him has become an obsession and a menace. Surely the honorable member for Maribyrnong realizes the great advantage to the youth of this land, as well as to their parents, of having educational books made available at the lowest possible prices. I could enumerate instances of Australians who have tried unsuccessfully to get Australian publishers to publish their works. I cannot claim that my literary qualifications rise to those dizzy heights necessary to qualify me for a position on the <inline font-style="italic">Broadford Howler.</inline> The great publishers of the world are not to be found in Australia. The best educational text books are printed overseas, and we should not insulate ourselves from the culture of the old world. I regard education as the greatest asset of democracy, and therefore I maintain that books should not be subjected to that blind protection, amounting almost to a disease, of which the honorable member for Maribyrnong is so strong a supporter. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. </para>

            <para>.- I shall support the amendment, but in case it is defeated, I give notice of my intention to move a further amendment to admit at 4 per cent, all text-books, and books for educational purposes. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline> There are strong reasons why educational publications, school books and text-books should be made available to the people at the lowest possible prices. It is true that some valuable text-books are printed in Australia, but many of them must necessarily be imported. These books are used chiefly by students, who do not earn large salaries, and, therefore, cannot afford to pay high prices for them. It is proposed to allow books required by public libraries to pay a primage duty of only 4 per cent. As I understand that there is only one public library in each capital city of Australia to which the reduced rate would apply, I propose to ask the committee to extend the definition of &#34; public library &#34; to include any ( library maintained by public subscription. That would include mechanics&#39; institutes, and other institutions maintained wholly by public subscription, which, perhaps, render a greater service to the community than do the public libraries, inasmuch as they provide educational facilities without drawing upon public funds. </para>

              <para>- If what the Minister says is true, my request is not important, but I know that when I was Minister of Mines, in Western Australia, there were very large importations of gelignite. I remind the Minister, however, that there are 10,000 or 15,000 men out prospecting in Australia at the present time, and anything in the way of excess charges on explosives might seriously hamper their work They are engaged in an occupation which may have most valuable results for Australia. If any of them were responsible for the discovery of a rich gold-field, or of any other precious metal, the country would benefit greatly. My impression was that the importation of explosives was very large. However, in view of the assurance given by the Minister, there would be no great advantage v secured by reducing the primage duty as I suggested. </para>

            <para>.- Newsprint paper is allowed into Australia at a primage duty of 4 per cent., whereas the better class of paper, used chiefly for the printing of periodicals, is required to pay 10 per cent. It is an anomaly that the higher rate of duty is charged on the better class of paper used chiefly by small firms engaged in the printing of periodicals, -while the big newspaper corporations are required to pay only 4 per cent, on the paper they import. They should all be placed on the same footing. The present rates of duty penalize the small firms, which are already subject to competition from the dumping of imported magazines. Practically every publishing house has communicated with the Minister and circularized honorable members with regard to this matter. American publishers make a point of printing large quantities of magazines in excess of their home sales as their claims to a great circulation brings in ample advertisements. A great quantity of the surplus production, is shipped to Australia at a big loss and sold here in competition with our own journals, the publication of which gives work to printers, compositors, blockmakers, bookbinders, and so on. It is unfair to penalize small firms by subjecting them to a primage duty of 6 per cent, greater than that which applies to the large newspapers. To rectify the anomaly I move - </para>

            <para>. - I am sorry that I cannot accept the amendment. Representations were made to the Government and, on investigation, it brought all  newsprinting  paper under the 4 per cent, primage duty, specifying that glazed, unglazed, and mill-glazed papers should be included at that rate. If the Government were to exempt all newsprinting paper from the 10 per cent impost, it would mean that all paper that is brought into Australia and used by printers would come under the 4 per cent, tax. To that the Government is unable to agree. </para>

            <para>.- When I previously referred to dynamite and gelignite, the Minister asserted that less than 5 per cent, of our explosive requirements was imported. On examining . the list of importations I note that Australia imported something like &#163;170,000 worth of explosives last year. On the estimate of the Minister the total value of our requirements would be over &#163;2,500,000. I feel satisfied that we do not use anything like that quantity of explosives in Australia. Every encouragement should be given to our prospectors. If new gold-fields were discovered it would bc a wonderful thing for the Commonwealth. Day by day we hear of new discoveries of some importance, and we should endeavour to make explosives, which is such an important, item to prospectors and miners generally, as cheap as possible. I shall not move an amendment, but I urge the Government to bring this item under the lower rate. </para>

            <para>.- I gathered the impression, after conversation with the Minister, that any item not  mentioned in the list would be exempt from this duty, also that we imported only about 5 per cent, of our explosives requirements. Already the cost, of this commodity is great. Explosives sell in North Queensland at 12s. 6d. a packet. On my representation the Customs Department made inquiries into the price charged, as also did the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> when he was a Minister. When I was recently o.n the Etheridge gold-field, I found that the State Government was supplying its wardens with dynamite at 8s. 6d. a packet, as against 12s. 6d. charged by storekeepers. On making inquiries from the storekeepers I was informed that it was a commodity that they did not wish to handle. Generally the purchasers were prospectors. If they were lucky they paid; otherwise they did not. The man who struck it lucky made up for his less fortunate colleagues. The storekeepers preferred that the Government should handle the sale of explosives through the Department of Mines. I urge the Minister to give favorable consideration to the suggestion of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline></para>

            <para>.- I also urge the Minister to agree to the suggestion made by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> with regard to reducing the primage duty on explosives. No section of workers is suffering as much from the prevailing depression as that engaged in the mining industry. There is no better body of workers, nor one more willing to submit to hardship in an endeavour to make a living rather than draw the dole. Those who are engaged in mining in a big way are merely struggling along, without making any profit, keeping their men employed. Explosives represent a very important item to the miner, and the Government should do everything it can to make this commodity as cheap as possible. I make a special appeal to the Minister to consider the suggestion that has been made. </para>

            <para>.- I am willing to support any action that will tend to reduce the cost of gelignite to the men out in the country who are striving to find gold, because there is no commodity of which Australia stands in greater need to-day. Many miners who are engaged in doing dead developmental work, require considerable quantities of explosives for the purpose of moving solid rock ; but they may receive no reward for their labours, even after all that preliminary work has been done. I have suggested on previous occasions that the explosives used in mining should be exempt from the sales tax and the primage duty. </para>

              <para>- Then it is not due to the primage duty. If we abolished this duty, the price of explosives would probably remain the same, because of the exchange position, which causes practically a 30 per cent. increase in the landed cost of the commodity. At Deer Park, in Victoria, there is an extensive and efficient explosives manufactory. </para>

              <para>- Virtually, it is; but that is largely due to the fact that the promiscuous production of explosives by any one who cared to enter upon such an enterprise could not&#39; be allowed. In addition to the explosive factory at Deer Park, Nobels (Australasia) Limited are producing explosives for mining purposes, and they have done so without asking for any protection whatever. They are carrying on their operations in competition with the explosive manufacturers in other parts of the world. The local manufacturers have given satisfaction to the Australian users of explosives, both in regard to quality and price. If the Government were to place explosives on the exempt list, it would lose &#163;10,000 in revenue, and it would not confer any benefit whatever upon the people using the explosives. It would merely give those engaged in this business an extra profit of 10 per cent. The reduction- of 10 per cent, in wages which has been made in certain industries lately has simply meant that the employers engaged in those industries have been given an additional 10 per cent. profit. In view of the fact that in normal times about 1,000 persons are engaged in the manufacture of explosives at Deer Park, the industry deserves some consideration. </para>

But I want to remind the committee that explosives fall into two classes, namely, those required for sporting purposes and those required for mining purposes. The manufacture of ammunition for sporting purposes is carried on principally by the DuPont organization, and that required for mining purposes by the De Beer and the Nobel enterprises. The De Beer company carries on its operations in South Africa with coloured labour, whereas the Nobel company is manufacturing explosives in Australia under Australian conditions. When I have to make a choice between an industry operated by coloured labour and one operated by white men working under Australian conditions, I am not in any difficulty at all. I would vote every time for the protection of the Australian industry. </para>

              <para>- Upon making inquiries, I found that one of the reasons for the great difference in price is that the precautions taken in Australia in regard to the packing and carriage of explosives in trains and otherwise are very much greater than in America. The Australian explosives are packed in steel tubes. In reply to representations that were made to him on this subject on the 28th May last, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> made the following statement in August: - </para>

The balance is imported by the company from the United Kingdom. </para>

          <para class="block">This company, therefore, has a monopoly of the distribution of explosives in Australia, and the Commonwealth Government has no power to fix prices, even in such circumstances. The statement by the Minister continued as follows: - </para>

            <para>In regard to the comparison of a case of explosives costing 77s. iri certain places in Australia, as against 30s. in America, the company claims that its explosives are equal in quality to the best in the world, whereas many grades of explosives are made in America which could not be used in Australia owing to the requirements of the State laws. It is stated, also, that the cost of packing Australian explosives to comply with those laws is considerably higher than the cost of packing in America, where defined methods of packing are not prescribed. In addition, explosives here have to be packed in steel tubes for transport, and the costs of the latter are high. It appears, however, that in order to relieve users in States outside Victoria of transport charges as far as possible, the manufacturers&#39; prices at main ports are the same. It may be mentioned that under the tariff the duties on explosives are free (United Kingdom), and 5 per cent, (general). (Latterly, of course, primage duty has been added.) The manufacturers contend that if their prices were not competitive, foreign manufacturers would certainly have been on the market. I may say that a comparison of the company&#39;s present prices with those of the past few years  has  shown that the prices have, since as far back as 1924, shown a gradual reduction until January of this year. In January and again in March prices had to be put up to cover the higher cost of imported materials used in manufacturing here, which was occasioned chiefly by the increases in the exchange rate. </para>

              <para>- There is something radically wrong wilh the cost of explosives, when it is realized that those manufactured in America are sold at 30s. whereas the cost of the .Australian product is 77s. a case. The landed cost of American fracture in Cairns  shows  a difference of over 40s. a case in favour of the American product. In discussing various items in. the tariff schedule I have always spoken and given my vote in support of duties that will provide employment for our people. Practically every newspaper published in Victoria, New South Wales, or Queensland contains notifications of new mineral discoveries, showing that a number of prospectors are actually engaged in searching for minerals without assistance from the Government rather than existing on the dole, which in the aggregate is costing the Commonwealth &#163;13,000,000 annually. This is one of the avenues in which relief can be afforded, and if a reduction in any customs duty will be the means of providing employment, such a reduction will have my support.

            <para>These increases affected also, of course, the small proportion of explosives which ure imported. It may be mentioned, however, that the present prices arc, if deduction is made of the increased costs mentioned, slightly lower than they were in December, 1930. </para>

          <para class="block">Can the Minister or the officers of his department say what has been responsible for the variation in importations? The Minister has said that explosives are slightly cheaper than they were in December, 1930. The wages of workers in practically every industry have been reduced by 20 per cent., and overhead costs generally have also been lowered. It would be interesting <inline font-style="italic">to know</inline> whether, in view of all the circumstances, those in control of our State railways intend to reduce railway freights, and if these and  other companies are to be allowed to continue to exploit those engaged in the mining industry.

            <para>The company controls the prices at which its agents sell, but in regard to sales by retailors in country districts, states - &#34;It will bc readily understood that it is quite impossible for us to control the prices at which country storekeepers sell in small quantities. We have attempted to prevent overcharging by such retailers, but it has been urged  that  in many cases the storekeeper is not paid at all unless the prospector is successful, and we hare been compelled to abandon the idea of controlling retailers&#39; selling prices.&#34; The situation is peculiar in that the whole of the business is in the hands of One company, but the conclusions arrived at from the investigations are that the company acts fairly in the matter, and that the prices at which it supplies the explosives are not excessive. </para>

I propose to move that this item be omitted from the  list  of goods that are subject to primage duty at a rate of 4 per cent., and included in the list of goods that are exempt. I cannot mention any item, the arguments in favour of the exemption of which are as strong as those that can be urged with respect to this particular item. As is well known, stud stock are used in Australia in connexion with the cattle, sheep, and horseproducing industries as well as the dairying industry. </para>

            <para>-  The committee has already agreed to paragraph 1 of the resolution, which deals with goods that are exempt from primage duty, and cannot again give consideration to it at thisstage. The effect of omitting the words &#34; stud stock &#34; in paragraph 2 would be to make stud stock liable to a primage duty of 10 per cent. At the report stage the honorable member may, if he wishes, move for the resolution to be further considered in committee of ways and means.
