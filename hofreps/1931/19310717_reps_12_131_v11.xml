                                <para>- At present 500 residents  of  Canberra are unemployed, and I have had extreme difficulty in obtaining sufficient money to provide relief work for them. To undertake relief works in the Federal Capital Territory for the absorption of the many thousands of travelling unemployed would be impossible. As I stated to the House yesterday, up to 1,300 travelling unemployed pass through Canberra each month, and receive rations on their arrival and departure. </para>

                    <para>- Yester  day the honorable member for Brisbane (Mr. D. Cameron), drew my attention to a press statement- regarding war service homes. I have now ascertained that the number of reverted homes at the 31st May, 1931, equals 531, of which number 294 were occupied by tenants. Various reasons have been given for the abandonment of homes by purchasers, the principal being: - (a) availability of other homes at cheaper rentals; (b) intention to share home occupied by another family with the object of reducing rental outlay; (c) returning to parents and living rent free. The Commission has provided 36,808 homes for ex-service men, and having regard to the present difficult times the small number of reverted homes possibly demonstrates the extent of the assistance given by the Government to those purchasers who are unemployed and who are unable to meet their obligations. The total instalments due by purchasers at the 31st May, amount to Â£11,476,392, and of this sum, Â£239,077 was unpaid. The arrears, therefore, equal only 2.08 per cent. </para>

                <para>This amendment was made to remove an anomaly. When the bill was before this committee it was proposed to make a reduction of Â£34 with respect to all salaries of male and female officers, but it was pointed out that, under the cost of living adjustments, the rates had not been increased as much for females as for males. It was agreed to remove the injustice, but the amendment that was made was wrong. The Public Service Board has drawn attention to the necessity to correct what was done. If this amendment now made by the Senate were not agreed to, a female adult would draw more money than a male adult for the  same class of work; under it the difference between the respective salaries is maintained at Â£6. </para>

                    <para>. - I am unable to accept the explanation given by the Prime Minister. The bill originally provided for a reduction of Â£34 for both male and female employees. We urged at that stage that the margin of difference between the salary reduction of male and female officers should be one-third. That was agreed to by the Minister in charge of the measure, and I believe that it gave satisfaction to the officers of the Public Service organizations that were handling the matter. If the bill were now under complete reconsideration in this chamber, exemptions would probably be provided on the basis adopted in Victoria. Under the Victorian scheme the minimum is fixed at Â£26 a year higher than under this bill. I ask the committee to reject this amendment. The Public Service generally has been heavily penalized already under this measure. Under an award, it agreed to a reduction of wages due to the annual adjustment on account of the cost of living three months earlier than the reduction would ordinarily have applied. The Public Service representatives left Canberra in the belief that this anomaly had been corrected, and the action taken by the Government in submitting this amendment in another place is provocative, and will, I believe, make the dissatisfaction more general than it now is. . </para>

                    <para>. - Prior to 1924 the salaries of males and females rose and fell in accordance with the variations in the cost of living, and there was no differentiation between them. From 1924 the increase due to the rise in the cost of living was Â£9 in the case of males and Â£7 in the case of females. The increases were Â£6 and Â£4 respectively in 1927 and 1930. It was felt, when the bill was before this committee, that the ratio of Â£6 to Â£4 observed when the salaries were going up ought to be retained when the salaries were coming down, but that principle disregarded the fact that up to 1924 the respective salaries had risen on the same scale. Owing to the hurry with which the calculation was made, a mistake occurred which was not discovered until after the bill had left this chamber, so that it was necessary to insert this amendment in the Senate. The following illustration will explain the position. Take the case of a male officer and a female officer, who, on the 30th June, 1924, were receiving Â£250 per annum. By the cost of living adjustments, the salary of the male officer was then raised by Â£21, making the total Â£271, and that of thÂ« female officer by Â£15, making the salary Â£265. There was a difference of <inline font-style="italic">Â£6</inline> in the cost of living adjustments. If the male rate were reduced by Â£34, and the female rate by Â£22 10s., as originally proposed, the salary of the male officer would be Â£237 and that of the female officer Â£242 10s., although both were doing the same class of work and under the same classification. Since there was a difference pf Â£6 in the cost of living adjustment, we should retain that difference at the present time. The object of the amendment is to avoid the dissatisfaction that would result from an inequitable adjustment. </para>

                    <para>.- At the end of the proposed proviso a discretionary power is given to the Minister which seems to introduce an entirely new principle. The Minister would have power to reduce the salary of a married male officer, who is not an adult, below Â£182 per annum. The committee should have some explanation of this amendment before it accepts so extraordinary a principle. </para>

The object of the amendment is to improve the clause to which it refers. When the clause was passed by this chamber it was thought that no awards had fallen below Â£182 per annum, but it was found upon investigation that the wages of certain employees of the Commonwealth covered by outside awards bad actually been reduced to Â£176 and Â£179 per annum. Originally the clause conferred no discretionary power upon the Minister. If awards fell below Â£182 per annum the Minister was obliged to take notice of the fact, and to act accordingly but now a discretionary power is given him. In the absence of such a provision he would be obliged to take into account certain extra payments in different industries, such as merit money and so on. The Government has no intention of reducing the basic wage applying to the Public Service. </para>

                    <para>. - I still cannot see why the words " unless directed by the Minister " should be retained. We are told that the Government desires to ensure to its own servants a basic wage of Â£3 10s. a week, but it seems to me that the inclusion of these words will make possible a reduction of this amount to any extent. In my opinion, the plan has been arranged to allow wages to fall to 40s., 35s., or even 30s. a week. If the words " unless directed by the Minister " are left out the Government will be able to reduce wages in this way. </para>

                        <para>- We do not propose in this measure to increase or decrease any awards. Some employees of the Commonwealth are working under outside awards which are at present below  Â£182  per annum. This is so in the metal trades, for instance. If the clause were left as it is the Government would be compelled to take notice of any new awards of less than  Â£182  per annum given by the court. It is desired, however, that no more Commonwealth employees shall be obliged to work for less than  Â£182  per annum. The clause will be vastly improved if honorable members will accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree that if the clause is amended in the way proposed it will be improved. In its original form it would have compelled the Government to reduce the wages of its employees below  Â£182  per annum if the court made any additional awards for wages below that figure. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has assured us that there are certain adult or married male employees of the Commonwealth receiving as little as  Â£176  or  Â£179  per annum, which is less than the  Â£182  which I understand to be the basic wage under the rehabilitation plan. My complaint is that even if the amendment is agreed to the Minister may still take notice of any future adjustments below  Â£182  per annum, although the declared intention of the legislature is that  Â£182  per annum, or its equivalent purchasing power, shall be the basic wage. The Prime Minister has said that it is not the intention of the Government, under this legislation, to increase to  Â£182  per annum the wages which are at present below that rate. </para>

                    <para>. - There is undoubtedly some ambiguity in the amendment. It certainly appeared to me that the object of the provision of clause  12,  read by the Prime Minister, was to ensure that  Â£182  per annum would be the rock-bottom basic wage. </para>

                    <para>. - This amendment may cloud the issue and cause honorable members to believe that ambiguity exists. Actually it does not. "When the clause left this chamber to go to another place, it applied comprehensively to all awards. Upon examining the matter it was 'found that although it was the intention that there should be no fall below Â£182 per annum, many awards, particularly in the metal trades, had already dropped below that figure. The clause contains the word " equivalent ",which means that the wage may be equivalent to Â£182 per annum on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis. In its amended form the clause gives the Minister power to bring up the rate to Â£182 per annum, where the circumstances warrant it. </para>

                        <para>- In some sections of the metal trades the rate is below Â£182. I do not think that honorable members are justified in criticizing the decisions of federal Ministers in this matter. Only recently the Government of New South Wales arbitrarily reduced by81/3d. per cent., not only the wages of public servants, but those of members of trade organizations employed in the Service. This Parliament is absolutely the last to show an inclination to interfere with arbitration awards by legislative action. That cannot be said of any of the States. </para>

The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> proposes to move certain amendments to the motion that has been submitted to the House. Standing Order No. 122 provides that the House may order a complicated question to be divided. I therefore propose, with the concurrence of the House, to divide the motion, and to submit it in sections. That will enable honorable members, who so desire, to make a fresh contribution to the debate as each amendment is submitted, or to speak to the whole question. </para>

                        <para>.- This motion involves a novel and important proposal, affecting not only the relations of the self-governing parts of the British Empire, but also the procedure of this Parliament. Presumably a similar motion will be introduced in another place, though there is no requirement that such action shall be taken; that will depend upon the will of the Government. If this motion is passed, important legislation will be enacted, affecting the Commonwealth of Australia and its citizens. I intend to say later something about the procedure and form adopted, and I have certain amendments to propose which I hope will draw the attention of honorable members to the fundamental and vital importance of the whole matter. In our usual parliamentary procedure, a resolution is regarded as of relatively small importance, the important work of Parliament being done generally by legislation introduced in the form of bills. </para>

                            <para>- I did not hear the Attorney-General say that, and I do not think that his remark is recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> A resolution of this Parliament is, as a rule, regarded as the mere expression of an opinion; but this resolution will be an invitation to the Parliament at Westminster to pass very important legislation affecting the powers of this Parliament, and, so far as that can be done, the powers of the Imperial Parliament itself. The question, therefore, arises whether this procedure is appro.piate for a matter of such profound importance. The proposals have been described as being designed to bring the legal status of the dominions into accord with the actual constitutional position. The Attorney-General referred to the resolution of the Imperial Conference of 1926, which was in these terms - </para>

                    <para class="block">That resolution is generally known as the Balfour Declaration. The report of the Imperial Conference of 1926, which I attended, went on to say that existing legislative and judicial forms admittedly did not wholly conform to the position so described, and that it was desirable to inquire how far changes should be made to alter the legal position in conformity with the constitutional position. Consequently, a committee was set up to inquire into, report upon, and make recommendations concerning various matters, including the competence of dominion parliaments to give their legislation extra-territorial operation, and the principles embodied in or underlying the Colonial Laws Validity Act. </para>
                    <para>The declaration of the Imperial Conference in 1926 was that the dominions were fully self-governing political entities. This was a recognition of the existing position. There was no doubt, in Australia at least, as to the reality and extent of our self-government, because we knew perfectly well that, whatever the legal position, the supreme legislative power of the Imperial Parliament would never be exercised contrary to our will. So far as Australia was concerned, nothing called for a legal change, because no real difficulty existed. In certain other parts of the Empire, particularly the Irish Free State, South Africa, and, to some extent, Canada, there was opposition to the maintenance of the existing formal legal position. The committee of experts was charged with the duty of reporting upon possible legal changes to bring about a closer correspondence between the legal and constitutional positions. As a result of the work of that committee - which was substantially a committee of lawyers - certain proposals were made which were approved by the Imperial Conference of 1930, and some of them are now before us in this motion. </para>
                    <para>The motion is divided into six clauses, which should be considered separately. Speaking generally, the object of the motion is to extend dominion legislative powers in certain directions, and to limit the power of the United Kingdom in relation to the matters as to which the powers of the dominion parliaments are extended. Of course, the Parliament of the United Kingdom is not able to limit or divest itself of its legislative powers. Whatever act it passes it can, technically, repeal or amend immediately; but the constitutional position is altered when the Imperial Parliament deliberately declares that it will not exercise certain powers which it possesses. A remarkable piece of legislation was passed by the Parliament at Westminster in the reign of George III., during the American revolution, wherein that Parliament declared that it would never tax the colonies. At that time there was a contest between Great Britain and her American colonies, largely over the principle that subjects should not be taxed unless represented in the taxing parliament. The British Parliament passed an act declaring that' it would never impose taxation on the colonists so long as they were not represented there. That act, of course, was not legally binding on succeeding parliaments, and the Parliament which passed it could have repealed it; but it had a profound constitutional significance, recognizing as it did, that a certain stage in the relations between the Mother Country and its colonies had been reached. As a matter of fact, that Parliament was making the best of a bad bargain ; it was retreating from an untenable position. </para>
                    <para>I propose to deal with these proposals under the separate heads under which they appear in the resolution. It must be remembered that, if agreed to by us, they will form the subject of legislation by the Imperial Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it worth while to split straws over the matter. If the right honorable member wishes to be accurate, it is the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The people of Northern Ireland might object to the term " British Parliament ". I call it the Imperial Parliament because it is the Parliament of the British Empire, and has powers which no other parliament in the Empire can possess, even if this proposed legislation is passed. </para>

                    <para class="block">I think that this extension of legislative power ought to be conferred on dominion parliaments; but, as a lawyer, I do not approve of the language which has been used. It suggests, for example, that a law of Canada may have effect outside Canada, or that a law of Australia may operate outside Australia. That is not intended, and the report of the committee of experts expressly sets out that it is not intended that the law of a dominion shall have operation outside that dominion. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harrison</inline> Moore, who most ably represented Australia on the committee of experts, states in paragraph 8 of his report - </para>

The final opinion was that such an expression of opinion was superfluous. </para>
                    <para>The only object that is intended to be secured is that in Australian courts Australian laws should not be held to be invalid or inapplicable because they apply extra- territorially - but only in Australian courts. This clause does not mean that because it is proposed that the Commonwealth Parliament shall have power to make laws having extra-territorial operation it should be able to pass laws which will be enforced in any other part of the world, and by courts other than Australian courts. What is proposed is to prevent any legislation being declared invalid here, which it is otherwise within the power of this Parliament to pass, because it deals with facts, matters, circumstances, or things outside the territory of Australia. I agree that the change ought to be made; but the phrase is vague and loose, and may cause trouble in interpretation, as indeed appears from the report of the experts. It is shown that there may be real doubt as to whether the use of this particular phraseology was safe. Obviously it was concluded that it was safe, and with some dubiety I am prepared to accept it. </para>

                    <para>The second  clause deals with the Colonial Laws Validity Act. It reads: - (1.) The Colonial Laws Validity Act shall not apply to any law made by the Parliament of a dominion after the commencement of this act. (2.) No law and no provision of any law made after the commencement of this act (the Statute of Westminster) by the Parliament of a dominion, shall be void or inoperative on the ground that it is repugnant to the law of England, or to the provisions of any existing or future act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, or to any order, rule or regulation made under any such act, and the powers of the Parliament of a dominion shall include the power to repeal or amend any such act, order, rule, or regulation, insofar as the same is part of the law of the dominion. </para>
                    <para class="block">The substance of the Colonial Laws Validity Act sufficiently appears from the second paragraph iu this part of the resolution. That act provides that laws passed by the parliament of a dominion, or a colony shall  e vo  void or inoperative if repugnant to a statute of the Imperial Parliament applying to that dominion or colony. This provision, therefore, declares that the Colonial Laws Validity Act shall not apply to the legislation of any dominion. I approve of these proposals. They confer complete legislative power upon this Parliament with respect to matters upon which it has power to legislate. I can see no reason for maintaining the rule of the Colonial Laws Validity Act in relation to matters within the power of the Commonwealth Parliament, but, of course, such a removal of limitations should not extend the powers of this Parliament in any respect beyond the powers already conferred upon it by the Constitution, and accordingly, in clause 4 of this resolution, it is expressly provided that the removal of the restrictions at present imposed on our legislative powers under the Colonial Laws Validity Act shall not extend the legislative powers of this Parliament beyond the powers which it already possesses under the Constitution. </para>
                    <para>Clause 3 of the resolution is important indeed, and appears to me to stand on an entirely different footing from the other clauses to which I have referred. This clause contains a suggested section of the proposed Statute of Westminster in the following terms: - </para>

                        a dominion as part of the law of that dominion, unless it is expressly declared in that act that that dominion has requested and consented to the enactment thereof.
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">I intend to propose an amendment to this clause, to omit the words " that dominion has requested " and to insert in lieu thereof the words " the Parliament and Government of that dominion have requested ". The present position is that, as the Imperial Parliament can legislate for the whole Empire, any act passed by it which, in its terms, applies- to any part of a dominion, is law there and must be administered according to its provisions, and applied by the courts in that part of -.the Empire. It has not been the practice for the Parliament at Westminster to legislate for the self-governing dominions, except in accordance with the desires of those parts of the Empire. That has been generally recognized. It is now universally held that it is not for the Imperial Parliament to legislate on the many matters which are dealt with in this Parliament, though that Parliament has full power to do so. This clause of the resolution represents an effort to crystallize into a legal formula this political convention and understanding. I believe entirely in. the principle which is here represented. Speaking generally, the Imperial Parliament should not legislate in relation to Australia or Australian matters at all, unless at the request of Australia; and I would not be prepared, as an Australian and a loyal member of the British Empire, to recognize that it was part of the ordinary function of the Imperial Parliament to legislate on Australian matters. But when I am asked to express that principle in a statute, I must examine carefully aud precisely the wording which is suggested. I regard the relations of the self-governing parts of the Empire, <inline font-style="italic">inter se,</inline> as corresponding closely in the political world to the relations of the members of a family in the personal world. I do not want the relations of myself and my children to be determined by rules written in a book, to which each of us must refer to discover who is right and who is wrong. I do not desire such things to be made rigid by legal rules and enactments. On many political and constitutional matters, the British Constitution, as applied, not only to Great Britain, but throughout the Empire, has been a success largely because it has been loose and elastic, and has left things to be determined by the common sense of statesmen as emergencies arise, instead of being decided with the precision of lawyers in the interpretation of written documents. We are now asked to make a departure from that practice, and to endeavour to express in a rigid legal formula what is perfectly well understood as a practical, political convention, a convention which causes no difficulty or trouble in working. I should, therefore, prefer very much to leave things as they are. </para>

First, it must be remembered that we are living under a federal constitution, and that the Commonwealth and the States each has a place in a federal system which depends upon a division of legislative powers between the Commonwealth and the States. This resolution does not affect, is not intended to affect, and certainly should not affect, the position of the States in relation to the Commonwealth or to the United Kingdom. The States have not been represented at any of the conferences from which this resolution has ultimately emerged, and they cannot be compromised or affected in any way by this legislation. I am sure that all honorable members will accept that proposition. I now ask them to examine the words of the proposed clause. It appears to me that these words have been drafted without -a sufficiently acute and active realization of the legal and constitutional position under a federal system. The words are - </para>

                    <para class="block">What is the meaning of " dominion " ? In relation to Australia it means the Commonwealth of Australia. What is the meaning of " the Commonwealth of Australia"? The Commonwealth of Australia is an ambiguous term. For example, in our Constitution, covering clause 3 provides that " the Queen may declare or proclaim "  that  the people of certain colonies have united, or shall be united in a federal commonwealth under the name of the Commonwealth of Australia. " Commonwealth of Australia " there means a political entity, a political organization, for discharging legislative, executive and judicial powers. Covering clause 6 contains another example of the use of this word. There we find the phrase that certain of the colonies are " part of the Commonwealth." The States are part of the Commonwealth; that is, in the territorial sense. In that clause " Commonwealth " means a territorial area, namely, Australia, in the geographical sense. When we come to clause 3 of this resolution what is meant by saying that " no act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of this act shall extend or be deemed to extend to the Commonwealth of Australia, as part of the law of that Commonwealth unless, &amp;c." ? The States, as I have said, are unaffected by this legislation. They are entitled to preserve such relations as they like with the British Parliament. We do not control the relations between the States and the rest of the Empire. They have independent relations. </para>

                            <para>- Let me give an example. Take, for instance, the criminal law of the Commonwealth as applied to Australia as a whole. Very little of the Australian criminal law is federal law; practically all of it is State law. This Parliament has not the power to legislate, speaking generally, with respect to crime. Our criminal law is chiefly State legislation. Certain Imperial statutes, such as the Fugitive Offenders Act and the Jurisdiction in Territorial Waters Act, apply to the geographical area known as Australia, and are important in relation to the effective administration of State laws. This Parliament can, under its ' immigration power, deal with the influx of criminals, but is not able to legislate upon the subjects affected by the Fugitive Offenders Act and the Jurisdiction in Territorial Waters Act. Those matters concern the States, and any alteration of the law in relation to them does not come within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth. Therefore, we have no right to ask the Imperial Parliament to pass an act stating that it will never legislate in relation to these matters unless this Parliament, which has nothing to do with them, asks it so to do. </para>

                    <para>Clause 3 imposes a limitation upon the possibility of Imperial acts extending to Australia. Does an Imperial act extend to Australia when it applies in any part of Australia? I say that it does. The Fugitive Offenders Act is an example but that deals with a subject which, though of first importance to the States, is of very little importance to the Commonwealth. Accordingly, why should the proposed statute require that an, amendment of legislation dealing with matters within the realm of the States, shall not be passed by the Imperial Parliament unless this Parliament so requests? </para>

The Fugitive Offenders Act is in force in every State of the Commonwealth; is it part of the law of Australia? Honorable members will see that there is obviously room for argument, and I suggest that we should not unnecessarily invade the doubtful realm of legal controversy.[Leave to continue given.] </para>

Clause 3 proposes that no Imperial act shall extend to a dominion "unless that dominion has requested and consented to the enactment thereof ". I have always been troubled by those words " requested and consented ". Either word would be sufficient; why employ both? A request for certain legislation surely implies consent to it. </para>

                    <para>What is meant !by " that dominion " ? Generally it means, in practice, the executive government of the dominion. I propose to ask the House to amend that provision by requiring that the request and consent shall be made and given by the Parliament and by the Government. We are asked to do something very remarkable. The proposal is that no legislation shall be enacted for a dominion by the Imperial Parliament unless " that dominion " has requested and consented to it. When a request is received from the government of a dominion for the enactment of certain legislation, is the British Government to go behind that request to ascertain what degree of support it commands? It appears to me that the British Government would be in a very difficult position if it were to cross-examine on a request made by a dominion government pursuant to this statute. I am afraid that if the Statute of Westminster, which purports to define and settle inter-governmental practice, is passed in its present form, the practice of the British Government will be to accept, without examination, any request from the government of a dominion, and to legislate accordingly. That will mean a marked change from the existing procedure. At present, there is a general understanding that the supreme legislative power of the British Parliament will not be used unless that is .substantially desired by the people of the dominion concerned. That is a loose power, to be applied according to circumstances. I say, with hesitation, but with a sense of responsibility, that in the unsettled economic and financial condition of the world at the present time, and in view of what may happen in the next few years, recourse to the supreme legislature of the British Empire may be a valuable privilege, especially having regard to the legal complications of the Australian federal system. If, however, this statute is passed as drafted, a request by the government of a dominion will be final. </para>

                            <para>- That is my contention. The Government of the day might bona fide regard a certain matter of policy as vital to the well-being of the Commonwealth. In regard to monetary policy, for instance, widely divergent views are held by members in this chamber, whilst the Senate is directly opposed to certain government proposals. If the statute were passed, the Government could request the Imperial Parliament to legislate as the Government wished, and so override both the Opposition in this chamber and the Senate. I do not pay that the Government would do that, but no government should be able to do it. In extreme circumstances, there might be a strong temptation to a government to resort to this power. Unless the statute is amended, I am afraid that the British Government will often be embarrassed, because it will practically have to legislate in accordance with every request made by the government of a dominion. I prefer to leave things as they are. This clause is not required, and the </para>

                            <para>- A government that was a party to such an action would run the risk of passing out of existence. At the present time there is no possibility of that happening; but, if this statute is passed, it appears to me that the only practice that could be adopted in Great Britain would be to refuse to look behind the request of the government of the day. As the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has indicated, to deal with dominions in the same way as foreign countries, and to regard the government as representing the people, without looking behind the request, would be too dangerous, and I am not prepared to accept such a proposal. </para>

There are no first reading, second reading, committee and third reading -stages. I suggest that the proposals should be put to the House in the form of a legislative request, instead of merely by means of a resolution. We should have the fullest opportunity for consideration and amendment, such as is afforded with respect to all important legislation. </para>

                    <para>There is another important matter to which I shall refer. If this clause is passed, Australia should request the inclusion of a provision identical in terms with that asked for by New Zealand. Should this clause be accepted, there should be a method of obtaining the concurrence of a dominion parliament in any Imperial legislation applying to the dominion. New Zealand has accepted these proposals, subject to the provision that the Statute of Westminster shall subsequently be placed before the Parliament of New Zealand, and shall not come into operation until it has been adopted by that Parliament. <inline font-style="italic">{Further leave to continue given.']</inline> The proposal of New Zealand to deal with this position will be found in the report of the Imperial Conference, 1930, at page 13, and it is in these terms - </para>

                    <para>I have circulated an amendment that a similar provision should he included, so that the statute shall not come into operation in the Commonwealth until, and then only in so far as, this Parliament has adopted its provisions. </para>
                    <para>Let me refer to another aspect of the matter, with a view to further extending the powers of this Parliament. On looking at clause 2, it will be seen that it is proposed that the Colonial Laws Validity Act shall no longer extend to a dominion, as distinct from the states or provinces constituting part of a dominion ; and it is provided that the powers of the parliament of a dominion shall include the power to repeal or amend any act, rule, or regulation of the British Parliament extending to that dominion. But there is no power, so far as I can see, conferred upon this Parliament to amend the Statute of Westminster itself, if passed, or to repeal it. If the statute is passed by the Imperial Parliament, it provides that a dominion parliament is to have full power to repeal or amend other Imperial legislation extending to it. This Parliament should have power, at least, to repeal the Statute of Westminster itself so far as it relates to Australia. Other wise, the statute, while conferring power to repeal any British legislation apply ing to Australia, will have the unique characteristic of being itself unrepealable. Therefore, I propose to add to the clause the following provision: - and the Parliament of the Commonwealth may. at any time, repeal any provision of this act which has been adopted by the said Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly, it may. Clause 6 deals with sections 735 and 736 of the Merchant Shipping Act, and provides that those sections shall be construed " as though reference therein to the legislature of a British possession did not include reference to the parliament of a dominion ".- I spoke on this matter in this chamber in August last. I think that this is a desirable removal of an unnecessary limitation on our powers. Nothing is gained by the provisions in those sections. They can easily be avoided - I will not say evaded - by any draftsman of reasonable competence, as has been done in Australia, where we have enacted legislation dealing with coastal vessels which, in effect, secures to our own ships the whole of the coastal trade, although British ships appear to be treated similarly. </para>

                    <para>I approve also of the proposal with respect to Colonial Courts of Admiralty, although I regret that the opportunity was not taken to clear up the dubious and ambiguous position in Australia in relation to admiralty jurisdiction, as disclosed by the decision of the High Court in the case of <inline font-style="italic">John Sharp &amp; Sons</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Ship Katherine Mackall</inline> reported at 34, C.L.R. 420. All the States are exercising admiralty jurisdiction. The judges of the States have for many years heard admiralty matters; but, in view of the decision of the High Court, I doubt whether a State has any real authority in admiralty matters. It was held by the High Court that the Commonwealth is a British possession for the purposes of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, and that, therefore, it may hold- Colonial Courts of Admiralty; but surely it necessarily follows that the States cannot hold such courts, although they have certainly been exercising this jurisdiction for many years. Some day a serious position will arise in this connexion. As this Parliament is unable to cure the matter by legislation, I am sorry it was not discussed at the Imperial Conference with a view to clarifying the position. </para>

                        <para>.- 1 hesitate to intervene in this debate, being but a political minnow among Tritons on this subject. I rise chiefly to express my thanks to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> for the excellent contribution that he has made to this discussion. He has given honorable members a much clearer perception of the effect of the motion. I regret that there is no provision for such far-reaching proposals as those now under consideration to be referred to a committee of the House for examination and report. Nothing of greater importance as affecting our status and constitutional jurisdiction has been presented to this House since the establishment of the Commonwealth. The  object of the statute is to give legal form to the declaration of the equality of status of the various dominions which was made at the 1926 Imperial Conference. But the giving of this legal form to that declaration must, in the future, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition pointed out, impart an element of rigidity into the interpretation of the Constitution which may not be found in practice to operate as well as the present system operates. </para>

                            <para>- I can deal, in a very few words, with the point to which I wish specially to refer. As a self-governing dominion of the British Empire, Australia has a peculiar status. The Canadian constitution provides for a more unitary system of government than the Australian Constitution, while the South African Constitution provides for a wholly unitary system as does that of New Zealand. In Australia we have six sovereign States within the federal union, and although this statute purports to give us complete constitutional authority, it does not give us such authority. Even though a majority of the people of Australia should declare their desire to alter the character of our Constitution, it could not be done. </para>

                            <para>- That is a point which is the centre of a very great legal controversy at the moment. I do not intend, as a layman, to express an opinion on a subject, which is now engaging attention of leading King's Counsel. The political aspect of this matter is of great importance in view of the relation of New South Wales to the other Australian States at the moment. While the Statute of Westminster vests in us, for all practical purposes, complete political sovereignty as a. federal union, we shall still have the State parliaments limited by certain vice-legal powers expressed in letters patent and royal instructions dating back to 1901. It is generally admitted that with our present constitutional status the Governor-General must act upon the advice of his advisors, whereas the State Governors have a discretionary power. As a matter of fact, under letters patent and royal instructions they have a considerable measure of discretionary power. Whether this is desirable or not will depend upon one's point of view at the moment; but it is surely paradoxical, and indicative of our peculiar status as a member of the British Empire, that while the Governor-General of the Commonwealth may act only on the advice of his advisors the Governors of the States may exercise a considerably  wider  discretion. It is a pity that attention was not directed to this point at the Imperial Conference. As it is, Australia is still in a more or less ambiguous position. </para>

I disagree entirely with the principles underlying the motion. To attempt to crystallize Empire relations in a legal formula is an act of supreme folly. They rest upon two principles which are antagonistic: the complete autonomy of the parts, and the unity of the whole. That this mighty Empire coheres, that this constitution - illogical and unique in the history of mankind - works at all, is due to the genius of the British people for self-government. In the hands of any other race it would have certainly failed. </para>

                    <para>We are considering an attempt to give legislative sanction to resolutions of cabinets and conferences made during and since the war. These set out in terms leaving no room for doubt, that the old order of things has passed away, that the overlordship of Britain has now been replaced by equality of status - not of stature - of every dominion with Britain. The dominions, or most of them, still regard Britain as their mother, and freely and gladly acknowledge her pre-eminence. This equality of status, which has been freely granted by Britain, carries with it implications of immense importance. If the powers now vested in the dominions arc exercised unwisely, the disruption of the Empire is inevitable. I have opposed every attempt to reduce to writing the constitutional relations of Britain and the dominions. It has been stated freely in this debate that this motion springs out of the resolutions of the 1926 conference; but that statement is misleading. The 1926 conference added nothing to the constitutional position as it then stood. Different opinions were expressed as to what had been done, and it is not without interest to quote some of them.

The reasons against any attempt to delimit the respective spheres of power and define the constitutional relations between Britain and the dominions are obvious and overwhelming. The great merit of the constitutional relationship existing between Britain and the dominions is, and always has been, its elasticity. To this is due its wonderful adaption to changing circumstances arising from the growth and development of the dominions. To attempt to substitute for this a rigid constitution or to define or set out in writing the relationship between the dominions is most undesirable. ... As things now stand, it is impossible in practice to reconcile that complete autonomy which the dominions possess - which they exercise by virtue of British statutes and waivers by British governments - with the sovereign rights of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the unity of the Empire. </para>

                    <para class="block">Speaking before representatives of the Dominions of Canada and South Africa, who were pressing for this so-called reform, I asked them what power could be added to those they then possessed, if to-morrow their dominions declared themselves to be independent? What thing of substance could be given to any dominion, if it were an independent power, that it does not now enjoy under this wonderfully elastic Constitution of ours? That the dominions would lose the substance in attempting to grasp at the shadow, is evident. </para>
                    <para>This motion, and all that preceded it at the 1926 conference, arises from the inability of some of the dominions to understand the nature of the Imperial pact. They think that membership of the British Commonwealth of nations limits their sovereignty. They are anxious to strut the world's stage in the toga of complete independence. In 1926, to satisfy the demands of their partisans, they foolishly insisted upon putting into writing what can never be reduced to writing, the constitutional relations between Britain and the dominions. The result was to be expected, for you cannot imprison a living organism in a formula. </para>
                    <para>Our Constitution to-day is very different from that of even twenty years ago. What it will be in twenty years to come no man can say. Its outstanding excellency is its elasticity. Its adaptability to change and to progress has been strikingly demonstrated. The circumstances of the Empire have radically changed ; but so smoothly has the mechanism worked that these changes have passed almost unnoticed. It may be contended that while the equality of status is only set forth in a resolution, it lacks that completeness which would be given , to it by a statute. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> pointed out. what is obvious, that no statute of the British Parliament is to be regarded as the final settlement of anything. It is, of course, owing to that common sense and genius of self-government that mark the British that the Parliament of the United Kingdom does not exercise its undoubted power, but it cannot strip itself of it, and therefore a statutory declaration that, South Africa, for instance, was an independent nation, or that i't had the right in the preamble to its legislation to omit reference to  His  Majesty the King, could be altered by  a  subsequent, or by the same, parliament. </para>
                    <para>Let us consider the practical application of this motion and of the resolutions of the 1926 conference which are responsible for its introduction into this Parliament. The folly of attempting to reduce the Empire Constitution to writing has been sufficiently revealed by events subsequent to 1926, and by the motion now before the House. No sooner were the resolutions of the 1926 conference - themselves sufficiently vague - committed to writing, than doubt, uncertainty and anxiety arose in many quarters. When the Prime Minister of Canada attended the Imperial Conference of 1926, he came hot from an election in which he had won a signal victory. The appeal to the Canadian people arose out of circumstances not without interest to members of this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackenzie</inline> King had advised the Governor-General of Canada, Lord Byng, to dissolve the Canadian Parliament.  His Excellency  refused to accept the advice, and sent for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Meighen,</inline> and asked him to form a government. He did so, but met with a hostile reception in the new parliament, and was compelled after  a  few months to appeal to the people. As a result <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackenzie</inline> King was returned with an overwhelming majority. After such a triumphant vindication of himself and his policy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackenzie</inline> King very naturally asked that something should be done to define the position of dominion prime ministers in relation to the representative of the King. He pointed out that if the status of Canada was equal to that of Great Britain in regard to affairs within her jurisdiction, then the advice of the Canadian Prime Minister ought to be 1 followed by the representative of the King in the same way as the advice of the British Prime Minister was in fact followed by  His  Majesty himself. As is well known,  His  Majesty has, for many years past, always accepted the advice of his Ministers in respect to dissolutions of parliament. </para>
                    <para>The attempt of the 1926 Imperial Conference to define these matters in writing was in part an effort to give the assurance to Canada that she really did enjoy in substance that equality of status which had been freely granted to her, and that her Prime Minister occupied the same position in relation to the Governor-General as the Prime Minister of "Great Britain occupied towards  His  Majesty in person. No sooner were these resolutions shaped into the newest charter of liberty tardily granted to a downtrodden people than the Canadian legislature became like an ant heap on which hot water had been poured. Members became alarmingly aware that in getting what they had asked for they had involved themselves in unforeseen difficulties. If the status of Canada was equal in all respects to that of Britain, then she could do everything that Britain could do in regard to her internal affairs, and, among other things, could amend her own constitution. The British. Parliament has power to do anything and everything; even to amend the Act of Succession, or to remove the King from the throne. The constitution of Canada is based on the federation of two races differing in language, historical background, religion and general outlook. The French, who were in the minority, joined with the British with reluctance and misgiving, and only on the distinct understanding that the bases of the constitution were to be so firmly fixed that no chance majority in the Canadian Parliament could undermine it. Otherwise the French would have been at the mercy of the Anglo-Saxon section of the community. When this issue was raised after the framing of the Balfour Declaration, the Canadian Parliament was in a quandary. If parliament declared that Canada was not mistress in her own house, it was to expose the Balfour Declaration of equality as a hollow sham; if, on the other hand, it said that Canada could amend the Constitution, stable government and the Confederation itself were in grave danger. And so one of those admirable explanations was made by the French Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Le</inline> Binte, in which ambiguity trod on the heels of ambiguity, and men who, when they rose up, saw some glimmer of light, sat down in Cimmerian darkness. In South Africa, too, the position was hardly less unsatisfactory. General Hertzog returned to South Africa from the Imperial Conference declaring that the overlordship of Britain had passed away. South Africa, he said, was no longer in any way subordinate to the King of England. There was a king, it was true, but he  was  King of South Africa. That he also happened to be King of England  was  one of those unfortunate facts on which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hertzog</inline> did not dwell. In every direction, the attempts to crystallize the status of the dominion in a formula, to resolve doubts by setting out constitutional relations in writing, resulted in the creation of a veritable legion of doubts. Where there had been certainty, there arose not only doubt but fear.  The  resolutions, in the very nature of things, left some matters undeclared, and it is a maxim of law that those things which are not covered are omitted ; those rights which are not  set  down in the bond, do not exist, or, at any rate, are not firmly founded. And so in South Africa, Ireland and Canada, men began to ask for fuller information regarding the powers they were supposed to have obtained. In short, these resolutions defining the powers of the dominion settled nothing and disturbed everything. </para>
                    <para>One cannot define Empire relation in other than general terms, and I declare the terms to be these: That whatever power is necessary for the well-being of this Commonwealth, or of any dominion, that is compatible with the unity upon which every dominion depends for its safety and existence, is vested in the dominions by virtue of their equality of status with Britain, and can be exercised. Beyond that one cannot safely go. This motion proposes to give legislative sanction to the declaration of the last Imperial Conference, and to crystallize in a formula the constitutional relations of the various unit,." of the Empire. Is it possible to achieve this? Has it not been shown during the course of this debate, that the attempt to define Empire relations has given rise to a hundred difficulties for every one it has removed. I do not hesitate to say that since the 1926 Imperial Conference, and indeed since the end of the war, all power has been vested in this Commonwealth Parliament to deal with matters within its jurisdiction, and that jurisdiction was not limited to the terms of the Common-  -wealth Constitution, but was as wide as was considered to be necessary by this Parliament to safeguard and promote the national welfare. </para>

                    <para>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> stated that it was desirable to amend clause 3 of the motion in order to make the intention of the clause clear. As the clause now stands, it is sufficient for the Government of the Commonwealth to request the British Government to legislate in a certain direction for the British Government to do so. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said that if this were done it would make it possible for the Commonwealth to be ruled by the Government and not by Parliament. He had in mind conditions similar to those which exist now and have existed on other occasions, when a government has a majority in one House and a minority in the other. The honorable member said that any request for legislation by the British Government should come from this Parliament, not from the Government. As things now are there is much force in his argument, but I have known instances in which the reverse of that would have appealed to the great majority of the people. The public changes its mind very rapidly, and the party which has a majority to-day may be in the minority to-morrow. I am not going to express any opinion on the matter now, other than to say that I shall, in the circumstances, support this amendment. But how infinitely better it would be to leave things as they were. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition that we ought to take power to amend any legislation to apply to Australia under this statute. If we have not that power, where is our equality of status. In regard to the Colonial Laws Validity Act no objection whatever can be raised. Only very rarely does the act apply to our circumstances. It applied once to Canada in 1929, and has on occasion applied to Australia. All these are relatively minor matters, and I desire only to say that what the British Parliament is now proposing to do should have been done long ago. In 1917, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George declared, the constitutional status as between Britain and the dominions. The whole ground was covered by the terms of his declaration. We were equal in every respect in status, and to all intents and purposes independent nations. We had, as honorable members know, equal rights with Britain in signing the Treaty of Peace. Our representatives sat at the Versailles conference, and exerted considerable influence- on its deliberations. We had equal rights with Britain or France, and exercised power equal to that of the smaller independent nations that were gathered round the table. What more could we wish? To do anything more than to repeal the Colonial Laws Validity Act and the Merchant Shipping Act, so far as they limit our powers, is quite unnecessary, and I deprecate the attempts by the resolutions of 1926 and by this motion in some instances to placate the implacable, and in other instances to satisfy a childish desire to see how the machine will work, to convince sceptics who want to put their fingers in the wounds, and will not be satisfied until they have all in black and white. These things are likely to work incalculable harm. I am opposed to any attempt to reduce our constitutional rights. I am in favour of amending the Colonial Laws Validity Act and the Merchant Shipping Act; but I am not in favour of any other part of this resolution. I deplore the fact that the British Government listened to these tempters - these men who, in some instances, were new-comers to the table of the Empire - and acceded to their demand that there should be such a modification of the existing relations between Great Britain and the countries they represented as would permit those countries to pose before the world as independent nations. We have all the constitutional rights of an independent nation. We have unfettered control of our own affairs. We can make treaties. We and other dominions have made treaties. This Constitution has worked, and still works. It is capable of almost indefinite expansion ; but it behoves us, in our relations with the rest of the Empire, to exercise the great powers that have been bestowed upon us all with wise restraint. Unless that is done, the British Empire, like every other instrumentality of human design, must inevitably decline and fall. </para>

                        <para>.- I agree with the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that, to attempt to legalize by statute the relations of the Empire would be an act of extreme folly. I would point out to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> that the proposed legalization has been rendered necessary because of the fact that our High Court has lagged behind in accepting our correct constitutional status. The right honorable member for North Sydney dates our independent status from 1916. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has stated that since 1926 what is proposed in this resolution has been almost entirely agreed to. My greatest regret is that the High Court has, in certain matters, refused to accept the constitutional position, and has been guided purely by statutory and written provisions, regardless  altogether of our new status. The attitude that I have always taken up and will continue to take up is that Australia should have the same power over Australian matters as England has over English matters. That should be indisputable. No settlement of Anglo-Saxons, having reached its maturity, has failed to assert its right to self-government. When this matter was discussed last August I was able to read to the House the claims of the Irish people year in and year out. I read their assertion of their own rights. I also read the statements of English settlers in the West Indies in the seventeenth century. I read, too, the declaration of the individual American States before their secession, declaring their own right to govern themselves' free of English interference. I suggest that Australia has, since it received its constitutional status in 1850 and 1860, had, as an </para>

                            <para>- One instance is the decision in the case which was referred to by the Attorney-General of the Union Steamship'' Company <inline font-style="italic">v.</inline> the Commonwealth, in which it was declared that although the Colonial Laws Validity Act gave us a large grant of national freedom, there was one section in that act to the effect that any law passed by us, even though it related only to Australian affairs, would, if it had any degree of repugnance to English statutes, be void. This was applied in respect of the registration of seamen in Sydney. On that occasion our rights were abrogated only to a slight extent and the incident passed almost unobserved. But the High Court, despite the statutes which have been in existence for many years, disregarded the constitutional position which had been given to Australia. They made the written word overrule the accepted constitutional spirit. It took action in accordance with the reading of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 and the Colonial Laws Validity Act of 1865. I am surprised that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, who was Attorney-General at that time, did not plead, as he should have pleaded, our constitutional status, which lie has admitted to-day was then existent, but depended purely on the written statute in defending that case. In a later case, because, I assume, of the action that I took in bringing my views before the High Court judges, of course, without reference to any particular case, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs recognized a further stage of constitutional status and, in an extract which I read last August, he stated that it would be impossible in the future for the courts to disregard the new constitutional status that had been given to the Australian people. That case arose out of the operation of the Navigation Act, which has seriously affected a section of our population, and has been responsible for the appointment of many royal commissions. That legislation was the result of the attempt of the Labour party to give effect to one of its treasured ideals. That case affected only a minor matter, which although it did not receive public attention, seriously interfered with our constitutional rights. I venture to say that there are many other sections of that act which would have caused serious trouble if the same legal argument and interpretation had been applied to the written document. The honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bayley)</inline> has asked for an example. There has been difficulty in Canada in regard to admiralty jurisdiction. I am not speaking of a difficulty such as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has referred to affecting this Commonwealth and the States. It was thought that Canada had full power to establish a court of admiralty with equal authority to the English court and it had exercised it, but an amending act of the Imperial Parliament has raised the doubt whether that right exists. These instances may be only minor ones. The right honorable member for North Sydney has said they are ; but we cannot have equality, and at the same time allow the legislation of another country to affect us. Although these are minor matters they may become important, and it is far better to settle them now than at some future time when friction may be caused thereby. I regard this attempt to legalize by statute the existing dominion status as quite unnecessary. We are an independent nation, whatever the Statute of Westminster may provide. That statute is entirely superfluous, and although there is no harm in passing it, we should, to preserve our independent status, pass legislation based on our own charter of liberty. I do not care what the legislation is called so long as it is in proper form. It is only ' our own act which we should recognize. Liberty is never granted to a people; it has to be taken. The right honorable member for North Sydney has quoted what Lloyd George said in 1917. How can we be equal to the English people if we have to ask them for a grant of additional liberty? We are equals only to the English people. I object very much to clause 3, which I consider should be struck Out. It says that no English act of Parliament shall affect Australia in the future. The very presence of those words is an admission that Great Britain has the right to interfere with our legislation, and that it has power to legislate for us. It should have no right to do that. I would repudiate completely any legislation that declared .that any parliament outside Australia has power to legislate for this country or to give us powers to legislate. We have those powers, and Australians are as much masters in their own house as Englishmen are masters in theirs. Any honorable member who does not agree with that attitude places the stigma of inferiority on our people and upon their inherent rights. Even the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> admitted such inferiority, but I refuse to acknowledge it. If, for legal purposes, and to influence a conservative and unobservant High Court, clause 1 of this statute is necessary, I accept it under protest, but I ask this Parliament to insist on declaring its independence by its own legislation and passing its own Act of Westminster. Clause 2 I accept reluctantly, but section 7 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act should be retained or section 51 of the report be carried out. Clause 3 should be omitted. </para>

                    <para class="block">To-day Australia is up against the greatest difficulties in its history, and this statute proposes that the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament shall not be extended beyond the written terms of a constitution which embodies a bargain made entirely by the States amongst themselves and endorsed by the Australian people. The necessities of the time required the English Parliament to pass our Constitution Act. The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> referred to the difficulties that were experienced preliminary to the union of Canada. The French minority would not trust the British majority, and, believing that an outside authority would deal more justly with them, insisted that the BritishNorth America Act should be the basis of the Canadian Constitution, which would, therefore, be incapable of amendment by the dominion parliament. I am glad, however, that the French province of Quebec, after a recent conference between the dominion and . provincial governments of Canada, decided to accept the provisions of the proposed Statute of Westminster without any such reservations as the Commonwealth Government is proposing to insert in relation to Australia. The Colonial Laws Validity Act, section 7, gives to us complete power to make our own laws except in so far as they may be repugnant to the provisions of any Imperial statute. Canada has accepted the proposed Statute of Westminster as an amendment of the Dominion Constitution, to be used for the advantage of the Canadian people. Clause 4 of the proposed statute can be struck out without endangering the general agreement between the dominions, because it affects only Australian rights. If the clause is omitted we shall be able to amend our Constitution as the people wish, because the repugnancy provisions of the Colonial Laws Validity Act will no longer apply. </para>

                            <para>- I very much doubt that. If the honorable member will read the report of the Constitution Commission, and will study carefully section 128, he will find that certain conditions inserted at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> and in accordance with the demands of a section of the New South Wales people, make it forever impossible, without the consent of all the States, to amend the Constitution, and certainly make impossible the creation of new States. If we accept clause 4 of the proposed statute, we shall bind ourselves helplessly to the existing Constitution, which the whole of the Australian people wish to alter. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> will agree that the latter portion of section 128 imperatively prescribes certain conditions precedent to an amendment of the Constitution, and many leading lawyers are convinced that if we accept clause 4 of the statute we shall bind ourselves in such a way as to be forever unable amend the Constitution on vital matters. That seems to be the decision of the High Court in the Legislative Council Referendum case in New South Wales. I appeal to honorable members to retain the constitutional rights of this Parliament. Almost from the inception of federation the Commonwealth has been the paramount authority in Australian finance, and the financial agreement has brought about what is equivalent to financial unification. Although we control finance, which is the basis of government at all times, and particularly now, our hands are tied by expensive State Parliaments and Governors, and we are burdened with a defaulting State. Those who are advocating the creation of new States will find in section 128 an absolute negation of their desires. </para>

South Africa has accepted the statute without any limitation such as is proposed under clause 4. I have heard to-day that New Zealand has requested that the measure should be returned to it, and I wish it to come hack to us, but for an entirely different reason from that of New Zealand; I desire our complete liberty to be preserved and by passing our own statute not to admit the necessity for another legislature passing laws affecting us. As the narrow view of the HighCourt requires the written word and not the accepted constitutional position, it might be necessary for another legislature to pass such laws. </para>

                    <para>I was asked a few moments ago how w.e are affected by British legislation.I may inform the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> that ha would not be permitted to print any part of the authorized version of the Bible without the consent of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge because of the limitation of the copyright by an English act. Let me mention another instance of the effect of British legislation.A man had carried on business at City-road. Brunswick, near Melbourne, for 40 years under the name, " Sheffield Iron Works". Under , an English law, the use of the word " Sheffield " is reserved to certain persons living in Sheffield, and, on obtaining legal advice, this man did not oppose the granting of an injunction requiring him to refrain from using the word " Sheffield " in connexion with his premises. Many instances of interference by English law arise in Australia; but as they do not raise great public issues, or affect large numbers of people, little is heard of them. Ever since  I have developed a political sense, I have felt entitled to object to English laws which conflict with those of Australia in regard to Australian matters. It is not always possible to be friendly with those who assume unauthorized superiority; but friendship with the Old Country on the part of the dominions will be assured if they are regarded as equals and co-partners. The various members of the British Commonwealth of Nations must deal with one another as man to man ; as brothers in a family. When a son leaves the parental roof, and establishes a home of his own, he does not lose his friendship for his father. On the other hand, the right given to the son to control his own household removes the irksome restriction that is sometimes felt by a son because of parental domination. Since the dominions have been accorded self-governing powers co-equal with those of the Motherland, my regard for the Old Country has increased and will ever remain absolutely unshaken. </para>

                        <para>- I enter this debate with some trepidation, after the excellent speech of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> and, in some respects, the no less admirable address of the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> I shall consider the subject from some of the broader aspects which appeal to a layman who has endeavoured to take an intelligent interest in imperial matters. The profound importance of the proposal before the House has been admirably stressed by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, but I have no intention of following him in. his contentions. The motion before the House has arisen almost wholly from the proceedings of the Imperial conferences of 1926 and 1930. When the Prime Minister was addressing the House eight or ten days ago, he took the stand that these proposals would increase community of interests in the Empire; that the self-government now enjoyed by the dominions would be strengthened. To my mind, that rather savours of taking our history from a collection of <inline font-style="italic">Border Ballads,</inline> or our theology from a hymnary. These conclusions he based upon what has come to be known as the Balfour report. Robert Stokes, in <inline font-style="italic">New Imperial Ideals,</inline> makes the following reference to the Balfour report: - </para>

                                <para>In the second place, the 192G report did not devise any legal means whereby  dominions  might be at liberty to secede, and by a well-established rule of law, a dominion parliament could not legally pass a secession law having validity, because that would bc to transgress the purpose for which it had received its powers from the Imperial Parliament and for which it existed. Such a law must be reserved and disallowed. Accordingly, the only means of peaceable secession open to it was to try and persuade the Imperial Government to pass legislation dissolving the tie with it. Such legislation would naturally not be passed unless the Imperial Parliament were convinced that the change was desired by an overwhelming majority of the citizens of the dominion. But the present report provides for the abolition of reservation and disallowance, except in respect of the Governor's constitutional powers as the personal representative of the King, and these can be overcome by the refusal of supplies. The report, therefore, would leave it possible for, say, the Irish Free State, even with an opposing Governor-General, to secede legally from the Empire by processes which could not be legally checked at any point by the rest of the Empire. A French writer "of weight contends that this is the effect of the position already described in the 1920 report itself. However that may be, it certainly appears to be the position likely to be ensured by the 1929 report. </para>

                        <para>The general design of this report is to carry the principles of the 1926 report to their logical conclusion by placing the dominions in a position of absolute equality with the United Kingdom. This involves divesting the Imperial Parliament of the last shadowy remnants of its capacity to legislate of its own motion for the dominions, and it leaves the Empire without a legislature entitled to make laws for it as a whole. It can only attain legislative unity in any matter by means of agreed concurrent legislation by the various parliaments. Of the difficulty of securing such unity let a very eminent Australian lawyer speak - " Any one who has had experience of the difficulties involved in passing identical legislation through six State Parliaments in Australia, will not be over optimistic as to the chances of obtaining identical or reciprocal legislation with a reasonable approach to simultaneity in five parliaments sitting in every quarter of the globe ". </para>

                        <para>In practice the result must inevitably be to leave the Empire without any effective constitutional means of maintaining any kind of legislative unity. It would be reduced, in fact, to a mere league or community of nations united by a moral tic and by allegiance to the person of the King. It would be an empire almost without common institutions of any kind, and in its constitutional structure going far to justify the suggestion that it may be steadily dissolving into a precarious alliance. </para>

                    <para>We know very well that the decisions of the 1926 Imperial Conference were the outcome of a set of circumstances which, if I may use the phrase, have "left the world wondering ". That conference met under most peculiar circumstances. We had the spectacle of an enraged and politically-minded Prime Minister rushing from Canada to elicit the sympathies of the disgruntled representatives of the Irish Free State, and the equally disgruntled representatives of the South African Union. He obtained their aid to secure approval of a policy which, in my opinion, was formulated in a spirit of revenge that was awakened because of the political conditions which had arisen in his own dominion. </para>

I sincerely regret that the Australian representatives at that conference gave their approval to that policy, which was subsequently brought before the 1929 and 1930 Imperial Conferences. It is true' that the committee was presided over by Lord Balfour. In that connexion, I wish to say that it was entirely due to a system of political metaphysics, applied by a master political metaphysician, that the conference adopted the course that it did, and paved the way for the formulation of the Statute of Westminster. </para>

I believe that at the 1926 Imperial Conference we saw the first definite evidence of the crumbling of the British Empire. At that conference, the bridge heads were surrendered, the boats were burned, and the key to the door of the citadel delivered up. Honorable members may remove from their minds any idea that the British Empire can continue along the old lines. It was transmuted at that conference into the kind of thing that it is shown to be by this statute that is now proposed. </para>

                    <para>The most important single factor in the maintenance of the peace of the world is  the unity of the British Empire. It is therefore eminently desirable that we should do our utmost to preserve this unity, for once it is disintegrated the door will be open for all sorts of national and international  embroilments. I cannot see thai the Statute of Westminster will &lt;lo anything to maintain the unity of the Empire. In my opinion, it is much more likely to have a disrupting influence. The Prime Minister has said that the statute will preserve dominion status as we know it to-day; but I think that it will destroy it. It may be true, as we have been told, thai the statute will not involve any change in the United Kingdom; but it will certainly involve very definite and serious changes in the Empire. Believing, as I do, that the maintenance of the unity of the Empire is the best guarantee that we can have of the contin nance of peace, I feel it necessary to do my utmost to resist anything that is likely to interfere with that unity. A serious and widespread propaganda is being conducted to-day by communistic influences against the solidarity of the Empire. .It is therefore all the more necessary that we should not do anything which might even tend to impair our unity. Take, for instance, such a subject as extra-territoriality. Into this vortex the 1926 conference definitely precipitated this country. Extraterritoriality is likely to involve us in serious trouble. Australia <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> a country with a small population, and no adequate scheme of defence. Those factors, coupled with the wide legislative powers which Australia is to be given in relation to extraterritorality multiply the possible causes of war. It is contended that the forthcoming disarmament conference is a matter of prime concern to Australia. The Prime Minister said that it was essential that Australia should be represented at that conference. As in the case of his remarks regarding the Statute of Westminster, which, he said, would strengthen, rather thun weaken, Australia's position in the future, I submit that the Prime Minister ip again wrong; for surely there is no need for Australia to be represented at the disarmament conference, seeing that for all practical purposes we have already disarmed. On the question .of disarmament Australia does not count. I submit that any system which will require this counU'Y to subscribe to any written document in the matter of inter Empire relations is not calculated ;to .serve its best interests. By adopting that system we should be abandoning political conventions which have stood the test for many years in favour of something nebulous. We must ask ourselves whether it is wise to depart from a practice which we have tried and proved to be satisfactory. The history and the traditions of the British Empire teach us that it would be unwise to adopt the proposals contained in this resolution. I agree generally with the views so admirably stated by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> and I intend to vote for the amendments he has tabled. I conclude by repeating that I agree with the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that it is infinitely better to leave things as they are, than to walk into this legal straight-jacket that has been prepared, for us in a resolution unwisely adopted at the 1926 conference. </para>

                <para>An official report on timber operations at Archangel says that barracks and public feeding places are unhealthy, and are often filthy. The workers could not bc expected to respond to the now plans to fulfil the export programme unless the conditions are improved. "Whether the information contained iri that cable is correct or not, there is evidence of an intention on the part of the Soviet Government of Russia to export wheat, oil, and timber to other countries, including Australia, and to sell them at almost any price. In marketing that timber peasant labour, indentured labour, the labour of imprisoned and unimprisoned convicts, of women and children, and political prisoners of the Soviet worked as slaves, is employed. We have official information to hand indicating that the death rate among those workers is exceedingly high, and that, owing to the inhuman treatment that is meted out, only a small percentage survive the rigours of slave service. Information has come to hand from officers and sailors of various nationalities as to the harrowing conditions of slavery that obtain on the wharfs of Russia. But, bad as are those conditions, the state of affairs in the lumber camps is infinitely worse. In six of the camps, the names of which are unpronounceable, employees numbering respectively, 30,000; 25,000; 30,000, 10,000; 20,000 and 20,000 are engaged in hewing and loading timber, and the hardships to which they are subjected are almost indescribable. It is time that we took notice of what is going on in Russia, and determined how we shall act in connexion with the importation of this timber. </para>

                    <para>I do not suggest that the Minister for Customs is sleeping at his post. The honorable gentleman is too alert and too good a protector of Australian industries to do that. My words are not directed at any individual, nor at the Government. I believe that the stage has arrived when we should definitely decide not to tolerate this invasion by the products of slavery. I ask, not for a declaration that the Tariff Board will inquire into the matter, that a surcharge will be imposed on the shipment of Russian timber that has already arrived in Australia, or that anti-dumping laws will operate in future, but that the Government will prohibit the importation of Russian timber into Australia. I am unaware whether the consignment already in Sydney has been disposed of. The Minister has available the necessary organization to obtain the desired information, both in the offices of his own department and of the Police Force, and I trust that his action will be prompt and effective. </para>

                        <para>. - Replying to the points raised by the honorable  member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> one shipment of timber from Russia was landed at Sydney. No invoices for the consignment are yet to hand, and my department has not been able to obtain a satisfactory explanation as to when they will arrive. About eight or nine days ago I was informed that they would be received within a week. The timber has not been offered for sale, so far as my department can ascertain. The agents, the Russo Export Company, have no information upon which they can arrive at the value of the consignment, and, therefore, are unable to place any price upon it. I have instructed the Sub-Collector of Customs at Sydney not to grant clearance of the consignment before consulting me. If at any time a clearance is granted, a security duty of 10 per cent. per 100 super feet will be demanded, in addition to existing duties. That amounts' practically to prohibition. I assure honorable members that the Government is determined to continue in the future its policy of the past, that of giving adequate protection to the Australian timber industry, and that there is no reason to be apprehensive with regard to timber consignments from Russia. Obviously, the Government cannot act upon hearsay, or on paragraphs that appear in the press. The proper steps are being taken to investigate the conditions under which the timber industry of Russia is being carried on. </para>

Cases such as these were not considered by the soldiers' committee which dealt with the Government's proposals to reduce war pensions, and the committee had no right to accept any compromise without consulting the rank and file of the various organizations.

                <para>A  matter to which I direct the attention of the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McNeill)</inline> is the need for providing medical attendance for the unemployed. There are approximately 5,000 workless people in the vicinity of Kurri Kurri, Cessnock and the surrounding district. They are being attended by the local doctors, who are now unable to procure the necessary medicines, &amp;c. As might be expected, sickness is more prevalent among the unemployed than among the more fortunate people who are in employment. The Federal Government should do something to aid the doctors in the humane work of attending the sick. They are willing to give their services free; but the Government should compensate them for the expense to which they are put. </para>

                        <para>- I am appealing to the Minister for Health, and I should like to hear what he has to say. The health of the people is not the sole responsibility of the State Government. It has enough difficulty in providing food and other necessaries without being also accountable for the health of the unemployed. Some responsibility rests upon the Commonwealth Government. Why have we a Commonwealth Minister for Health if he is not to function in the interests of all the people? There is also a great deal of unemployment in Swansea, in another part of my electoral division. The people there have made representations to me for similar assistance, and I have forwarded their communications to the Minister for Health. They inform me that the local doctors are prepared to attend the unemployed, but they are not able to meet the cost of motor transport to and from the unemployment camps, or provide the necessary medicines for undernourished and sick children. It is not possible for parents to keep their children in good health on the miserable dole handed out to them. I hope that the Minister for Health will give these mutters his most sympathetic consideration. </para>

                        <para>. - I direct attention to the latest development in connexion with the default of the New South Wales Government. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> in his discretion, did not this afternoon take the House fully into his confidence. I do not blame him for that; but I do claim that honorable members representing other States have a right to express the apprehension which they feel, because of the extent to which Commonwealth revenue is being used for the benefit of New South Wales. It has been made clear for some months that the Premier of the State has deliberately embarked upon a policy of getting ahead of the other States, so far as possible, with respect to advances from the Commonwealth, and, notwithstanding his insolence, he has succeeded in obtaining very large sums from the Commonwealth Government to make good the default of his Government in its interest payments on overseas loans. In addition, the negotiations which have been proceeding for some time with the Commonwealth Bank for the re-opening of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales will probably greatly add to the financial responsibilities of the Commonwealth. In all these matters, this Government has so far acted without authority from Parliament. Now it is reported that there is a demand by the Premier of New South Wales for further very large sums. Honorable members representing other States are vitally concerned about these repeated demands from New South Wales, and I think the House should be consulted regarding them. The Premier of New South Wales should be told plainly that this policy of paying up for his Government cannot go on indefinitely, and that he cannot continue in the role of the rogue in politics. No one wishes the public servants of New South Wales to go short of their salaries or wages, but surely honorable members realize that the Commonwealth cannot accept responsibility for the shortcomings of the New South Wales Government in this respect. The people of that State' put the present Ministry into power, and must take the consequences of their action, or else turn the Government out. I do not wish to complain personally of the attitude of the Prime Minister in this matter, but I direct attention to the urgency of the situation that has arisen, and suggest to him that the Commonwealth Government cannot go on paying out millions of pounds to New South Wales without consulting this Parliament. </para>

I take exception to the remarks of the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn),</inline> who said that the Government was meeting the obligations of the Government of New South Wales without consulting this Parliament; that we were acting without the authority of Parliament. That is a grave charge, but it has no foundation in fact. We are acting on the authority of the legislation of this Parliament, and of the legislation passed by every Parliament in Australia. Our authority is the financial agreement, and all we have done to date is to meet a legal obligation imposed on us by that agreement. When the New South Wales Government first failed to meet its interest obligations, I made a full statement to the House, placing before it all the information at my disposal. </para>

                            <para>- All I did was to agree that negotiations should be conducted between the two banks with a view to re-opening the New South Wales Government Savings Bank. As a Commonwealth Government, we have an obligation to all the people of Australia. The closing of a government bank in one State is a serious tiling to -the people of Australia as a whole, and particularly affects the credit of the Commonwealth. In the interests of the people of Australia, I hope to see the New South Wales Government Savings Bank re-opened, but not at the  expense of all the States for the benefit of any one State. This Government is determined that every State shall meet its own obligations, and- on that point we have never wavered. Is there, however, any honorable member in this House who disapproves of the action of the Government to date in meeting interest payments regarding which the New South Wales Government defaulted ? There is a legal obligation od us to do that. </para>

We owe it to the people of the States, and to the Commonwealth as a whole, to proceed with this litigation if necessary, but I should be glad if we could have this issue settled in a reasonable way without resorting to litigation. I have neglected  no  opportunity of arriving at such a settlement. It is a reflection on Australia that, when we are asking all sections to make sacrifices for the restoration of our credit, and the rehabilitation of our finances, the governments of the Commonwealth should be lighting one another in thecourts. </para>

                            <para>-The honorable member may, on another occasion, dispute the advice we received from two leading counsel, ono in Melbourne, and one in Sydney. The only criticism levelled to date against the Commonwealth Government has been that we delayed four days in making a declaration as to whether we would meet the interest payments or not. We delayed making a declaration, because we wanted to know exactly where we stood before we assumed the obligation. We obtained the best legal advice we could, and acted upon it. We propose to continue acting upon it, and to meet in full our legal and moral obligations. The Government has not committed this Parliament or the Commonwealth to anything without fully informing Parliament of what it was doing, and we do not propose to depart from that course. </para>

I am endeavouring to follow the rule laid down in regard to the report of the Sugar Investigation Committee. Copies of that report were sold to those interested, at 8s. each. That is very costly, I admit, but it is estimated that copies of the wine industry report could be sold for 3s. each. Fifty copies of the report have been roneoed, and, in response to an inquiry, I have learned that the stencils have been preserved. Instructions have been issued that a further 100 copies are to be made, and if the demand for copies persists, the report will be printed, and copies made available to those who desire them. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> raised the subject of medical attention being given in certain cases by qualified officers of the Commonwealth Health Department. This department has been set up to deal with purely Commonwealth matters, and the cases to which he referred are the concern of the State. I have the greatest sympathy with those on whose behalf the honorable member has spoken, and it is not because I am callous to their sufferings that I decline his request. It would create an intolerable position, however, if the Commonwealth Health Department were to make itself responsible for attention to individual cases throughout all parts of Australia. The honorable member for South Sydney (Mr.E. Riley) is needlessly alarmed. I have not seen a statement in the press that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has gone officially to consult <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson. He has. I understand, gone to Melbourne, and if, when he is down there, he consults <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, as a member of the committee he ia at liberty to do so. When I go to Melbourne next week I also hope to be able to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson. </para>

                            <para>- Day after day I read scores of press paragraphs that are not altogether correct. In any case would it be a dreadful crime for any honorable member to go to Melbourne and discuss any important subject with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, if he could meet him? To the simple question which has been asked - " Have we handed over the government of the country to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons?"</inline> my reply is " No ". </para>
