                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - Death has removed from this Parliament many members in recent months, and the latest to fall before the grim reaper is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator John</inline> Hedley Chapman, who died in Adelaide on Saturday last. He was elected to represent South Australia in this Parliament at the general elections in 1925, and served continuously until his death. Previously he was for six years a member of the House of Assembly in South Australia. Although not a robust man, he attended to his Parliamentary duties assiduously, and conscientiously, and those who had the pleasure of knowing him, held him in high esteem. Death  lies  ahead for all of us, ana the frequency with which we have to mourn the passing of a colleague is a salutary reminder, in the midst of our striving and disputations, of the brevity of human life and the limitations of human achievement. I am sure that the sympathy of all honorable members will be extended to the widow and family of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman.</inline> I move - </para>

                    <para>.As Leader of the Country party, I associate myself with the motion and with the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister. We regret the loss of a loyal colleague and very old friend. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> was one of the pioneers of the country movement in South Australia. He battled for it in the South Australian Parliament, and subsequently in this Parliament, and unquestionably the energy and enthusiasm with which he supported his principles undermined his health and hastened his untimely death. As an instance of his keenness for public service, I have only to mention that last year he visited England at his own expense to investigate the marketing overseas of Australian primary products. Death has removed an indefatigable worker for everything that was clean and wholesome in public life. </para>

                        <para>- As a result of representations made by me to the Minister for Works and Railways, a concession to the extent of 20 per cent. was granted last year to settlers in Central Australia on materials used by them in developing their properties. I have now been advised that the concession has been withdrawn. I have just received a letter on the subject from a friend who has spent many thousands of pounds on developmental work in the Territory. A portion of his letter is as follows :  - </para>

                        <para>I thought you had told me that the concession would continue so far as the Commonwealth Hallways were concerned. Many settlers here were going to do a bit of fencing, as the top-end cattle are hard to hold without it. They are finding it difficult to carry on with the present high rates of freight. I bought a half-gallon tin of soldering solution from Harris, Scarfe for 4s. 3d., and the freight on same was 16s. 8d. </para>

Recently, however, the department has been erecting unsightly tree trunks, with a derrick arrangement on top to carry electric light wires, presumably by arrangement with the Electricity Department. Has any consideration been given to the suitability of a new style of post made from "H" iron, tapered, and filled with cement? It is claimed for the post that it is everlasting, sightly, and effective. </para>

                    <para>. -  I have taken this action with the object of giving honorable members an opportunity of expressing their opinions on the extraordinary disclosures which have been made by the publication of certain confidential cables. I regret that the time available for- the discussion is so short; but that is not my fault. If desired by the Government, the time could be extended. The authenticity of these cables has not been denied by the right honorable the Prime Minister in the statement which he has made in the public press concerning them. I assume that the Government is making inquiries into the circumstances in which these cables were divulged, for the purpose of ascertaining who has been guilty of a breach of what I regard as a solemn confidence. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I shall deal with the substance of the cables as they appeared i'n the public press of Australia from which I have obtained all the information that I have in my possession. Honorable members are aware that in June last the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore),</inline> in a very clear speech, repudiated the financial policy which he now asks this House and the country to adopt. The cables now published show that four months ago the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> in very definite .and explicit terms, also repudiated the policy which he now submits to the people and the country. I notice that the Treasurer is speaking to the Prime Minister, and for their information let me state that the precise reference to the statement of the Treasurer, to which I have referred, is to  be found in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 13th June, 1930. It is a surprise to find that the right honorable gentleman, who is still the Leader of the Government, explained fully and clearly in these cables how the adoption of a certain financial policy would probably mean ruin to the country. The Government now, according to statements recently made by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, proposes to create money - to use the words of the Treasurer speaking at Brisbane on Saturday last-" to provide additional currency," and the Prime Minister himself in a speech which was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 2nd March last, spoke also of the proposal to create some £18,000,000 of additional currency. In that speech he said that the evils due to inflation arose when prices were allowed to soar, but that the Government was determined that this would not be permitted so long as it was in power. Therefore, the policy of the Government is a policy of controlled inflation. In a cablegram sent to the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> when Acting Treasurer on the 5th November last, or received in Australia on that date, the Prime Minister, after speaking of the heavy strain on the finances of the banks caused by the necessity to finance the harvest, said - </para>

                    <para>Such proposal - he referred to the £20,000,000 proposal- means permanent inflation, which could not be checked as is implied, and would demand further inflation.Inflation is a desperate attempt at a remedy, and will react seriously on all sections. The first ill-effect is upon our credit.All this talk about creating credits and inflation is most damaging, and will seriously prejudice conversion maturing loans and treasury-bills. Since inflation was suggested efforts are being made here by men to withdraw their money from Australia, as they would lose by payment in a depreciated currency. Depreciation in currency would decrease values of savings bank deposits and insurance policies. Property would increase in price, and there would be a rush to sell bonds for investment in properties. Financial panic may result. </para>

                <para class="block">That was the judgment of the Prime Minister in November last upon a proposal which cannot be distinguished from the proposal which on several occasions has recently been advocated by himself and the Treasurer, and which the House is soon to be asked to consider. There can be no clearer or more explicit demonstration of the evils of the policy now suggested than that contained in this cable message. Nothing that has happened since has disproved the truth of what the Prime Minister said in his message to the Acting Treasurer. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> consistently condemned the policy which is now the policy of the Government, and refused to carry it out; so did the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> and his colleagues until they returned to Australia from Great Britain. The honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> resigned from the Cabinet rather than change his policy, and, on the floor of this House, has had to submit to being called a traitor, because he stuck to the policy of the  Government,  and because other honorable members of the Government repudiated and reversed their own policy. In the place of the honorable member for Wilmot, the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> entered the Cabinet to carry out the policy which he himself condemned in scathing terms on the 13th June last. This question, affecting, as it does, the whole financial position, the industry, and the national economy of Australia is no mere question ofpolitical expediency in regard to which it can be said that to compromise is readily excusable and intelligible. It is a question of vital principle, profoundly affecting the welfare of the people, as the cablegram of the Prime Minister himself shows. The behaviour of the right honorable gentleman, in relation to this matter, appears to me to be indefensible, and it has certainly caused consternation throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>The other matter to which this motion refers is equally important. The independence of the judiciary is essential to the preservation of our national and individual liberties, and it is upon the independence of the judiciary that the just and non-political interpretation and the just administration of the law depend. The judges, when they are appointed, take an oath to administer the law without fear, favour, or affection. The Government has the grave responsibility of appointing judges. ' In Great Britain, and in all dominions under the British Crown, the people, the parliaments, and the governments have, up to the present, sternly resisted any appointment of judges by votes of electors, or by votes of any political party. This objection to any system of electing judges is an essential part of responsible government as we know it. The cables show that the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General realize the importance of these principles, as does every other honorable member; that they regard them, too, as absolutely vital; yet the fact is that they remain in office in a government that has sacrificed these principles for a mess of political pottage. </para>
                    <para>There could be nothing more clear than the resolute determination of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, when in England, and on their way back to Australia, to stand for what is right, than their abandonment of the right course when they returned to Australia and met the caucus. A cable from the Prime Minister to the Acting Prime Minister (Mr.Fenton) reads as follows :  - </para>

                        <para>Telegram from Vice-president Executive Council to Attorney-General stating that steps being taken to appoint judges astounds us. It is a reversal of Cabinet decision, and means that Cabinet accepts political direction on appointments to the High Court judiciary. Political interference removing this matter from Cabinet responsibility strikes fatally at authority of Court. Attorney-General and I will be no party to that. Number of judges adequate; moreover, long vacation begins. Why rush appointments, and deny Prime Minister and Attorney-General opportunity to express strongly held view? We have the right to take part in the discussion on this most vital question. We ask party to reconsider, appointments before it is too late. </para>

                    <para class="block">I can see in the drafting of that cablegram, the hand of an Attorney-General who understands something of the principles underlying our judicial and legal system, and I agree with every word of it ; it is entirely sound. There has never before been even a suggestion in Australia that a cabinet has accepted direction from the members of its party upon an appointment to the bench. "Political interference removing this matter from . Cabinet responsibility strikes fatally at authority of Court." Those are the words of the Prime Minister. </para>

                            <para>- I say that I agree that the acceptance, by a cabinet, of political direction regarding appointments to the judiciary is unsound, and strikes vitally at the authority of the court; but the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General now appear to contest that principle. They seem not to agree with that assertion in the cable. I ask them whether they do or not. If the Prime Minister replied, " Attorney-General and I will be no party to that," they followed the only possible course that decent Ministers could take, and I hope that they are not going to say that they did not, at that time, at least, take that stand. "Number of judges adequate," said the cable. Everybody knows  that the  number of judges was adequate for their work before those appointments were made. Honorable members may remem ber a return which was laid on the table, in answer to a question asked by me, showing that the work of the High Court was decreasing. It is obvious that there was no need for the making of any additional appointment to the Bench. The cable that I have just quoted goes on, "Moreover, long vacation begins." Where was the necessity at the beginning of a long vacation to appoint two judges at £3,000 a year, with other incidental expenses? There was no need at all if the only matters in view were the performance of the normal work of the court; but we know that during the vacation the waterside workers' case and the New South Wales Legislative Council case, were to be heard. I wonder what the reply was to the inquiry, " Why was it necessary to appoint those judges at the beginning of the vacation, when normally there is no work for them to do?" Will the Prime Minister answer that question? The story of the appointment of those judges is coming out, bit by bit, to the shame of the people of Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">Those cables show that the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General resented in the strongest possible manner the assumption by their party followers of the function of appointing, selecting or nominating judges. I would have expected them to do that. . It would be difficult to find any more definite statement of their concern at the likelihood of vital principles being infringed than is to be discovered in those cables. They said truly that a grave principle was involved, and added that they would be no party to a departure from fundamental principles. The right honorable gentleman went so far as to declare : " I would go out of office, if, in the circumstances, appointments were rushed through during our absence." They have not gone out of office; they still hold their positions of power and responsibility. </para>
                    <para>These messages disclose a very serious situation in relation to both of the matters to which I have confined my . speech. It is, indeed, extraordinary that the Government should bring down a financial policy which its leader described in the language that I have read; a description that had the concurrence of the Attorney-General. How can these two gentlemen expect to have the confidence and the respect of the people when they accept that policy, and condone the procedure that was followed in the making of entirely unnecessary appointments to the High Court bench, which they condemned in terms whose severity was completely justified? Early last year the Attorney-General expressly stated that it was not the intention of the Government to make any additional appointments to the High Court, the reason assigned being that the volume of its work neither demanded nor justified it. Nothing has since occurred to change that position. These appointments were absolutely unnecessary, and the making of them infringed a fundamental, although an unwritten, principle of our Constitution. These events make it impossible for me to believe that the policy of the Government in relation to financial matters is really sincere, or that it can be trusted in its administration of the public affairs of the Commonwealth. </para>

I propose to respect the tradition that has been handed down for centuries in the British Parliament. But I shall give one or two facts that will place upon the matter a complexion somewhat different from that which the honorable gentleman attempted to place upon it. Nothing is revealed by the cables with respect to my views in relation to inflation. I have repeated every word that appears in them, from the moment that I landed in Australia; and I shall do so again. I did so in the Parkes byelection campaign, and in the town hall at Richmond, Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- I have done so in different parts of Australia. It may be said that there has been a change in our financial policy. I deny that that is so. I agree, however, that there has been some change in regard to method. I shall enlarge upon that, and I am sure the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> will also do so, when the House is dealing with certain legislation. I repeat, that to issue £20,000,000 of credit or notes in order to put in hand public works, and to go on doing that, is inflation, and is unsound. But I also repeat that the making of bank advances pending an approach to the market, is not unsound. When the Government discussed with the Commonwealth Bank Board the question of making further advances, it was told that that could not be done under existing legislation, and that it could be made possible only by parliamentary sanction of a fiduciary issue. We shall explain fully to this Parliament our attitude on that matter. I deny that there has been any somersaulting by me, by the Treasurer, or by the other members of this Government. </para>

                <para>I wish to spend a few minutes in clearing up the question that has been raised in regard to the recent appointments to the High Court. It is perfectly true that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> and I sent to Australia protests regarding the making of those appointments. While we were in the Red Sea, we received very little information from our colleagues here; but we learned from wireless messages published on board ship that the matter was being discussed at meetings of the party, that the names of certain gentlemen were mentioned as likely to be appointed, and that it was suggested that we were undermining the whole of the principles of the court. I was astounded that such a suggestion could be made, and I did not believe that what was alleged could happen. Both I and the Attorney-General did what we conceived to be our duty - we sent cable messages to those whom we had left in charge. I take the view that no suspicion of political influence should surround an appointment to the High Court. I always have, and always will, hold that view. After these appointments were made, I did not question the integrity of the men who were appointed, any more than I questioned the integrity of Judge Drake-Brockman, when he was appointed. But I have always protested that there should be no possibility of the suspicion that an appointment was a political one. If ever there was a political appointment, it was that of Judge Drake-Brockman. Although I made not the slightest suggestion ' against his integrity, I protested in this House when the previous Govern-' ment appointed him. I wanted our appointments to be above even the suspicion of political action. That is why I asked that the party should not even discuss the names of possible future judges. On the 17th December I received a message from the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Penton)</inline> stating that the party had declared that these positions should be filled, and asking me to communicate with him immediately as to the appointments. On the 19th December I sent the strongly-worded protest which has been published, and which, although not entirely accurate, is substantially correct. On the. date that that message was despatched a wireless message was received on the ship in the ordinary way, stating that immediate steps were being taken to appoint two judges. I felt that, as I had received a cablegram asking me for information as to who should be appointed and then found that steps were being taken to make the appointments, a deliberate attempt was being made to deny" the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bren- nan)</inline> and myself an opportunity to express an opinion upon such an important matter. I, therefore, sent a cablegram stating that I could not remain in office if that was to be the attitude of my colleagues towards the Attorney-General and myself. </para>

I received a cable message from the Acting Prime Minister on the <inline font-style="italic">Ormonde</inline> on the 17th December, when the vessel was in the Red Sea, to which 1 replied on the 19th December; but the appointments were actually made on the 18th December. What is the explanation? Several days passed during which the vessel did not receive wireless messages - I remember that at the time wireless messages were not being received. The Acting Prime Minister assured me that my message arrived too late for the consideration of Cabinet, which placed an entirely different complexion on the matter. </para>

                        <para>- Those are the facts. That is the explanation I received from the Acting Prime Minister, and if the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> disbelieves his words he may. As late as the 29th December I sent a cablegram asking for a reply to my message of the 19th December, as to what had been done regarding the appointment of the two judges. When I returned to Australia the Acting Prime Minister informed me that he did not receive my message in time. The delay was due to the non-receipt of wireless messages during a period of several days. I am now jibed at because I did not go out of office ; out after receiving that explanation, there did not appear to be any necessity to do anything further in the matter. I also learned when I returned to Australia that there was not any discussion between the members of the party as to the names of the judges, although the appointments were discussed. I frankly admit that such appointments should be made by the Cabinet, and not by the party, and that was done. But there is a difference between a discussion on the necessity to fill position and the naming of persons to be appointed. The Acting Prime Minister did not receive my protest until after the appointments had been made. I did not receive his message for several days after it had been despatched, because of the difficulties, as those who are accustomed to travelling on the high seas know, of receiving wireless messages. </para>

He suggests that he is strongly opposed to such treachery; but he does not refuse to use the information obtained by such vile means which is disclosed by the published messages, and with which he has launched an attack upon this Government in order to defeat it. He can talk about high honour in these matters, but he uses dirty tools. A person who uses dirty tools cannot have clean hands. Every member of the Executive Council takes an oath that he will not reveal what transpires in Executive Council. The Constitution does not so provide, but it is implied that Cabinet business is Executive Council business and that the oath applies to both. </para>

                        <para>- No. The Government has been using the same code as its predecessors, but in consequence of these disclosures, has been compelled to destroy the code and prepare another, at considerable cost. Cabinet confidences have been betrayed. Such disclosures may lead to international distrust, particularly if confidential messages between Ministers are to be published in this way. This is the kind of information used by this great Nationalist party in order to pillory the Government ! This is the source from which it obtains its information - information procured by vile treachery. I would scorn to use such information. I remember an occasion when the last Government prosecuted and dismissed a person for having copies of Cabinet documents in his possession. </para>

The right honorable member, who has said that I ought to be a strong leader, did not hesitate to use information obtained in the same way as this has been obtained. That is the gentleman who can lead a party in which there is not a dissentient, because he has run away from so many parties that to-day he has no party to lead. I recall another instance when the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> was charged by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> for having accepted a local, instead of an overseas, tender for certain railway engines. When asked what happened in Cabinet he was too honorable to reveal the information. He challenged the right honorable member for Cowper to produce the Cabinet minutes. He would not do so. The honorable member for Wimmera suffered an injustice rather than betray a cabinet secret, although he had long since ceased to be a member of the Cabinet. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> did not decline to use the information that came to him in this way. My withers are unwrung, I have nothing to withdraw and no apologies to make for what I have said. The party did not do what honorable members opposite charge it with having done. I did not agree that any discussion in. the party should take place concerning the judiciary, and certainly did not agree to it dictating as to the appoinment of the two judges. It is the duty of honorable members opposite to discuss the motion upon its merits. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister never lacks vehemence in denunciation. I personally agree with him that cabinet documents should not be disclosed, and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> has said that he also deplores such disclosure. I hope that the person through whom, the information obtained publicity may be discovered, and that there may not be a repetition of this experience. I remember that towards the end of April, 1929, in the first parliament of which I was a member, the Opposition of the day gloated over the fact that the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> had obtained possession of certain Cabinet documents. The honorable member declared that he was entitled to obtain these documents by whatever means they were obtainable. I deplore that politics are in such a condition that this could happen. However that may be, the press of Australia has obtained the full text of certain cablegrams on important public questions which passed between the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> and other Cabinet Ministers, and the Prime Minister and caucus, during the right honorable gentleman's absence from Australia. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">This motion raises a question that is extremely important in parliamentary practice. If it is to be established that the  Speaker  may at any time leave the chair without the consent of the House, manifested by a motion or otherwise, then, it is obvious that the House is entirely under the control of the  Speaker  as to the time and seasons of its sittings. If the  Speaker  may leave the chair without leave for half-an-hour, he may leave it for half a week, half a month, or half a year. I invite honorable members, therefore, to consider the principle that is involved in this subject. I suggest that the true principle is that the  Speaker  may leave the chair at any time by the general consent of the House, which may be manifested by the statement that he is about to leave the chair being received without dissent, or with practical unanimity, or by the carrying of a motion. I think I am right in saying that there is no provision in our Standing Orders for the suspension of a sitting as distinct from an adjournment of the House. The House, of course, has control of its own business, and may suspend its sittings from time to time as it may think proper, and I submit that the decision of this question rests with the House itself and not with the  Speaker.  This is surely a matter of principle, otherwise the  Speaker  could suspend a sitting for a week or a month or longer by merely leaving the chair. The suspension of a sitting may occur, I contend, only with the consent of the House. Sittings are commonly suspended when communications are awaited from the other chamber, or when a meal time arrives, but this is always by general consent. That is quite all right. But if an objection to the proposed suspension is raised, the matter should be determined by the House as it thinks proper. There is no precedent, so far as I can discover, covering the precise point with which I am dealing. There are, of course, many precedents for the suspension of a sitting by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> leaving the chair when no objection has been taken, or when there has been general consent or practical unanimity. I could quote the well-established practice of the  Speaker  leaving the chair by general consent, but that does not meet the point raised in my motion. The question that I raise is whether the  Speaker  may leave the chair without leave being manifested in some appropriate manner, ordinarily by tha absence of dissent when the matter, iti mentioned, or by the passing of a motion. In <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> 10th edition, at page 21, the practice of the House of Commons is described, but this has no bearing upon the matter with which I am dealing, and will not help us to determine this question, for the point is not raised as to tha right or authority of the  Speaker  to leave the chair without leave. There are certain precedents in our own parliamentary procedure which have a more or less remote association with the point at issue; but they do not bear fairly or directly upon it. The position appears to' be that when there is practical unanimity, or when there are exceptional circumstances, such as long-continued disorder or those which may arise after an unduly long sitting, there is reserve power in the  Speaker  to leave the chair and so, as it were, cut the Gordian knot. Such long-continued sittings, leading to the physical exhaustion of honorable members, have occurred, and on one such occasion, when the House had been sitting continuously for several days, and was still sitting at midnight on Saturday, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Holder, left the chair until Monday. But I submit that only in such exceptional cases as those I have mentioned is there any reserve power in the  Speaker  to suspend a sitting. . The conditions which should govern the exercise of this reserve power are, however, illdefined. </para>
                <para>I have been unable to discover any authority which confers upon the  Speaker  the right to leave the chair at any moment that he may desire to do so. I am sure that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> will understand that in mentioning particular incidents, I desire only to deal with the general principle. Suppose, for example, that a government were in difficulties and that it was short of a vote or two for the time being, the suspension of the sitting might be very convenient to it. But I suggest that the power to suspend the sitting should rest with the House. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so ; but he should be subject to the control of the House. The determination of the time and period of sittings should, clearly and plainly, rest with the House. That is the only principle to observe to ensure strict impartiality. The attribution to the  Speaker  of the power to suspend a. sitting at his will or at the request of a Minister, at a moment's notice, would be dangerous. The adoption of procedure of that sort would be apt to lead to suspicions of partiality, which, I am sure, no honorable member desires to encourage. In November, 1905, during a long sitting of the House, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Holder suspended the sitting at midnight on Saturday until half-past 10 o'clock on Monday morning. In taking this action he gave the following reasons, his remarks being reported in volume XXIX. of the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Debates,</inline> page 5425 : - </para>

                    <para>The House will perhaps permit me to «ay that I have gathered from the speeches of honorable members, and otherwise, that there is a general wish that the sitting shall -not be continued during Sunday. I have looked up the precedents and I find that there are many for the  Speaker  suspending the fitting for such time as may be necessary for secur-ing  the purpose in view. In this House the time for which sittings have been suspended has usually been one hour for refreshments. There are other cases in which sittings have been suspended for longer periods - up to three and a half hours in one case, and in Victoria, on one occasion, the sitting was suspended for eleven hours and three-quarters. I recognize that if I suspend a sitting of this House for 24 hours, I go beyond any period for which I can find a precedent. Yet in suspending the sitting for that time, I should hot go beyond the period which is necessary to accomplish the purpose we have in view. 1 find, however, that there is a general desire that the House should not be called back to transact business at midnight to-morrow and that the convenience of honorable members should be studied to a further extent. '.Therefore, I now suspend this sitting of the House until half-past ten o'clock on Monday morning. </para>

I suggest, therefore, that this is now a matter entirely for the decision of honorable members. They are entitled to say what they think should be the practice of this House. Since the principle involved may, on occasion, be \ important, honorable members should address themselves to the discussion of it without regard to their membership of parties or whether or not .they are supporters of the Government. They should themselves lay down a clear rule on this matter. It should be determined by the House itself. This is in accordance with the principle underlying our system of parliamentary debate, namely, that the House at any time can control its own affairs. The danger of introducing any other principle is, I suggest, very great indeed. </para>

                <para class="block">House. There may arise a matter of extreme urgency or a condition of great disorder, in which case the  Speaker  may terminate the sitting of the House. But apart from such extraordinary circumstances, our Standing Orders provide that the adjournment of the sitting is a matter entirely in the hands of honorable members themselves. It is not competent for the  Speaker  himself to determine when the House will adjourn. As the Leader of the Opposition has remarked, the principle involved may be of supreme importance. It may be important to-day, in view of a certain motion before the House. It has been reported that a Yi umber of honorable members supporting the Government are coming to Canberra by means of an aeroplane. One can readily understand, therefore, that the power of the  Speaker  to adjourn the House might, on occasion, be wielded to save the Government from defeat. An adjournment for half an hour might entirely alter the complexion of a division list on a particular motion. Our Standing Orders clearly provide that except in the circumstances mentioned, the House can only be adjourned by its own resolution. We should, therefore, at all times observe them in the spirit and the letter. </para>

                    <para>If the motion correctly stated the circumstances in which the ruling from which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> wishes to dissent was given, the honorable gentleman would certainly have a grievance, and therefore, I call attention to what actually did occur. The ruling was given on the last day on which we sat before Christmas. Twice during the sitting the House was without business, and was waiting for messages from another place. The Standing Orders make no provision for the suspension of a sitting in such circumstances, and it has been usual for the Leader of the Government to suggest that for the convenience of honorable members the  Speaker  might leave the chair, either for a stated period or until a message was received from another place. Upon every occasion on which there has been a departure from the ordinary practice in regard to a suspension, affecting either its duration or the time at which it should commence when business has been before the House, I have asked whether the House concurred in the proposal to suspend the sitting at that hour, and it has always been after the signification of- the will of this House that the sitting has been suspended. When there is no business before the House, it is quite another matter ; it would be absurd to require the  Speaker  to remain for any long period in the chair. As the question of the adjournment is not raised on this issue, the point taken by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> is not applicable. When a motion for the adjournment of the House has been moved and carried, the House cannot assemble again until the hour appointed for its next meeting. </para>
                    <para>It has been the invariable rule in this Parliament from the beginning, for Speakers to leave the chair at the request, or instance, of the Leader of the Government, upon his stating that no further business is available until such time as it has been completed in another place. In such circumstances the  Speaker,  to meet the convenience of the House, temporarily suspends the sitting. It must,- however, be left to the discretion of the  Speaker  to say whether there is business before the House. In all the circumstances, I intend to follow the very worthy and, I think, proper precedents that have been laid down by my predecessors, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Holder, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Watt, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Johnson, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Groom. I do not think that the Leader of the Opposition, nor any other honorable member, can feel aggrieved at my doing so. If, however, it is thought that provision should be made in the Standing Orders to cover circumstances such as have been called in question, the matter can be raised when the Standing Orders are under review. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to say, on the question of fact - whether there was further business before the House when you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> left the chair - the notice-paper for Wednesday, 17 th December, 1930, contained quite a lot of business still undealt with. There were such items as Supply, Ways and Means, Commonwealth Bank Bill - second reading to be moved - and the Shale Oil Bounty Bill, second reading, resumption of debate. There were also eleven notices of motion and. six orders of the day. There was certainly ample business to occupy the time of the House. You have said that you propose to follow what you regard as the practice of former honorable speakers, whose names you have mentioned, but I presume that you will recognize that that depends entirely upon the result of the vote upon my motion. At any rate, I should hope so. It is for the House to determine what practice shall be followed in future. You have not been good enough to favour honorable members with, any references to the decisions of your predecessors, and my researches have not enabled me to discover any case in which objection has been raised when a request has been made by a Minister for the  Speaker  to leave the chair, or for the sitting to be suspended, and in spite of that objection the  Speaker  has left the chair. I have specifically referred to exceptional cases, such as that in which, after a long and exhausting sitting, there has been a general desire for the  Speaker  to leave the chair, or during long-continued disorder, but my investigations have not enabled me to discover any case in which, objection having been taken, the  Speaker  has left the chair, refusing to allow the House an opportunity to consider the objection. That is the point involved in the ruling to which I am taking exception. Take the case in which there can be no dispute as to the facts, that is to say, as to whether there is business before the House or not, and the  Speaker  says that he proposes to leave the chair for two hours or two weeks, and, although the House may object, he leaves the chair, exercising his own discretion, just as you say you propose to do. If Parliament were subject to control of that character, can it be said that the principle embodied in your ruling is sound? If again, as ruled by you, the  Speaker  .may upon the request of a Minister, leave the chair, notwithstanding that objection has been raised, we are presented with alarming possibilities. An instance of this kind has not arisen before, so far as I am aware ; at least no citation has been made by any one of any precedent which precisely applies to the case, and I submit that the true principle to be observed is that the House is in control of its own business where the Standing Orders do not otherwise provide. The  Speaker,  of course, may leave the chair with general consent, or as the result of a motion, or when a Minister asks that the sitting be suspended and no, objection is raised. That is a reasonable thing, and no question arises upon it. So long as there is  general consent, no question can arise. But the point is whether, when objection is taken, the House has any power to say that it prefers to go on sitting. According to your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the  Speaker  may, without the will of the House, leave the chair and, if he does so no motion can be submitted. In such a case the House is rendered incapable of giving effect to its will. That would be the effect of the ruling if carried to its logical conclusion. I, therefore, ask honorable members to disagree to it. </para>

                        <para>- Tariff protection is given to industries as a whole, and not to companies or firms. The Department of Trade and Customs has no information as to applications for a modification of wages or hours, and could not possibly link up such applications with the numerous increases which have been made in the tariff during the period mentioned. It is regretted, therefore, that the information is not available. </para>

                        <para>- Representations were made by the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia that the maximum term of 25 years for the repayment of a loan granted in respect of a timber home should be extended to 37 years, with the object of reducing the monthly repayment. The monthly instalment for the repayment of a loan of £800, over a period of 25 years, is £4 13s. 6d., the weekly equivalent being £11s. 7d. ; whilst in the case of a loan of £700 the instalment would be £41s. 10d., or 18s.10d. per week. If the repayment period were extended to 37 years the reduction in the weekly payment would only be 3s. 3d. per week. </para>

An officer with at least four years' service receives, in addition to pension from the superannuation fund, payment in lieu of furlough computed on his service at the time.

                    <para>During my visit to Canada I impressed upon the Canadian authorities the great assistance it would.be if arrangements could be made by that dominion to absorb the present Australian surplus. The question of the suitability of the Australian hop for the Canadian brewing trade was raised, and with a view to negotiations being entered into to absorb the surplus, if such hops provedsuitable, I arranged for a trial shipment to be forwarded to Canada after my return to Australia. In accordance withthis arrangement five bales of hops were shipped to Canada on the 5th March. Subsequent action will, of course, depend on the results of this trial shipment. </para>

                    <para>In speaking to the second reading of this bill it is not necessary for me to discuss its provisions in detail. It is a clearly drafted measure, and its main principles are contained in a few clauses. Having directed attention to the scheme of the bill, I shall deal at greater length with the policy of the Government in regard to finance. </para>
                    <para>The bill provides for a fiduciary currency. The notes printed by authority of this measure will be known as treasury notes. An amount not exceeding £18,000,000 will be issued by the Commonwealth Bank Board. Of that amount a sum not exceeding £6,000,000 will be issued, as and when required by the Governor-General, for the purpose of providing relief to wheatgrowers. That relief will be provided in accordance with the plan which was agreed to at a conference of Premiers held last month. There will also be an issue to an amount not exceeding £12,000,000, and not exceeding £1,000,000 in each month, to be issued as and when required by the Governor-General for the purpose of providing employment on reproductive works. The money derived from the issue of treasury notes and any interest thereon is to be placed to the credit of a fiduciary notes account - a trust account which will be under the control of the Treasury, and will be established within the meaning of the Audit Act, 1901-1926. Upon the raising of loans for the redemption of the securities issued by virtue of this bill, the proceeds, after payment of the expenses of borrowing, will be applied to the redemption of those securities, whereupon they, and also treasury notes up to £6,000,000 will be redeemed and cancelled. </para>
                    <para>The bill contains an important provision which may obviate the necessity of issuing any additional notes at all. That provision is contained in clause 10, which reads - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Notwithstanding anything contained in this part, if the board notifies the Treasurer that it is prepared to provide, for the purposes of this act, loans or advances to the Commonwealth to the extent of the whole or part of the total amount of Treasury notes which may be issued in pursuance of section 5 of this act, and the Treasurer certifies, by certificate published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> that he is satisfied that the terms upon which the board is prepared to provide those loans or advances are satisfactory to the Commonwealth, the amount for which Treasury notes may be issued in pursuance of this part shall be reduced by the amount for which the board is prepared to provide loans or advances. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The only other important provision is that which relates to the necessary statutory authority for. the expenditure of money to carry out the purposes of the  measure. The bill itself is simple; it provides the machinery whereby the Government may demand from the note issuing authority currency up to the amount already mentioned. </para>
                    <para>Before I deal more specifically with the monetary policy of the Government, I desire to remind honorable members that a fiduciary currency is by no means a novelty. In England a form of currency known as a fiduciary currency has been in operation for many years, and is now under the management of the Bank of England. It was established during the period of the war by the British Treasury as one of the measures provided for the purpose of financing the nation's war operations. It is now authorized under the British Currency and Banknotes Act, 1928, which authorizes the Bank of England to issue banknotes up to an amount representing the gold coin and gold bullion in its issue department, and, in addition, notes representing £260,000,000 in excess of the notes issued against gold. That excess issue is known as a fiduciary note issue. It is well to remind honorable members that it may arbitrarily be increased upon requisition by the Bank of England, approved by the British Treasury. When considered necessary, the bank makes a request for a certain amount of increased currency for a stated period. Upon the Treasury approving of the request, authority is given for the issue of the additional currency for a period not exceeding six months. The issue can be renewed each six months, provided that it shall not remain in force for more than two years, without the sanction of Parliament. </para>
                    <para>I mention these facts because there seems to be a widespread belief that what is being proposed by the Government in this bill is something without precedent, and therefore unorthodox and unsound. </para>
                    <para>In order to understand what has rendered necessary the introduction of this measure, we have to consider the main problem confronting Australia to-day. Australia is faced with a crisis which may be described as the result of the breakdown of our monetary and economic system. That breakdown is evident when we reflect that, although our productive capacity is almost without, limit, many thousands of our citizens are either starving or are on the brink of starvation. There is a vast amount of work waiting to be done in Australia - work which is necessary for the proper development of the country and would, if completed, be reproductive; but the work is not being proceeded with although scores of thousands of our citizens are unemployed and hungering for work. The industries Of the country are intact; the organization of industry and the marketing of the products have been placed on a sound basis. Our land has not been devastated by war, drought, pestilence, flood, or any other natural evil or calamity. Our transport services are better than they have ever been; our warehouse accommodation has never been so great; wharfs and other facilities for the handling of goods are in as good condition, as ever. Yet the country is commercially and industrially paralysed. The troubles from which we are suffering arise, not from what may be termed natural causes, but from human causes, from the maladministration of the system that is operating in the country. We are where we are to-day because of human faults and the complete breakdown of our monetary system. </para>
                    <para>Unfortunately, Australia is not alone in her  suffering  ; the present depression ' is world-wide. Primary-producing countries as well as those which are highly organized industrially; countries that have established a highwage system, and those which are struggling under low wage conditions; countries whose fiscal policy is freetrade as well as those which espouse protection ; countries with a republican, or monarchist, or other form of government - all are suffering from the samo economic maladies from which Australia is suffering. In every case the cause is the same - the complete breakdown of the monetary system. </para>
                    <para>It may be said that if the troubles from which we are suffering are worldwide, then Australia's difficulties do not arise from any failure on the part of our own bankers and financial controllers. I shall endeavour to show that those who control the financial policy of Australia have failed to do what they might have done to mitigate, so far as this country is concerned, the worst evils of the world-wide economic depression. Australia has suffered its worst effects owing to the collapse of the export market and the fall in the prices of our export commodities. The bankers and financial controllers of Australia became panic-stricken at the first onset of the trouble; by their drastic reaction to . world conditions they added immensely to our troubles. Had we such a well-ordered and flexible system that upon any diminution in the national income arising from a decline in commodity values there would be a corresponding equitable and immediate decrease in individual incomes; had we a system that would work so pleasantly that there would be a proportionate, fair and immediate reduction in all costs with our diminished national income; there would virtually be no suffering in Australia to-day. The national income comprises a certain fund out of which wages, salaries, interest, profits and dividends, and all other commitments are paid. If everyone who draws from that fund could, by some form of magic, be made to suffer a proportionate diminution of income with the decline of the fund, there would be no intolerable hardship. Whatever hardship existed would be shared by all. </para>
                    <para>Under the system now in operation a fall in the national income resulting from any sudden slump in commodity prices, brings about such a condition of disequilibrium that certain sections of the community suffer a great deal more than others do. In order to avoid that disproportionate sacrifice, a new monetary policy must be devised. These are the things which the Prime Minister and I have been discussing with bankers, State Premiers and other authorities. The Government set before the banks certain considered proposals which were designed to meet the situation in Australia, to bring about as far as practicable a revival in industry, the re-employment of our unemployed citizens, and the stimulation of business and trade in order better to meet the difficulties caused by the fall in the prices of our commodities sold overseas. </para>
                    <para>I shall outline the matters discussed first with the  chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board, subsequently with the Premiers in conference assembled, and later with the representatives of the associated banks. I shall give only an outline of the proposed financial measures, but. it will be sufficient to indicate the scheme that the Government placed before those authorities. The first discussion was with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, on 30th January last, about a week before the Premiers assembled at Canberra.

                    <para>It is expected that these measures will increase employment and production and result in budget equilibrium by June, 1933, as shown in an approximate budget statement drafted by the Treasury officials. A restoration to the 1929 level of internal prices will result in an increase in the value of production used in local consumption from approximately £220,000,000 to say, £290,000;000. With the return to normal home consumption there will be a further increase in the value of production of about £30,000,000 to replace imports. Imports very largely declined, first of all because of the lack of funds in London to finance purchasers, and, secondly, because of the operation of tariffs and markets, and so on. But the need for certain goods that we have heretofore purchased still exists, and with the restoration to something like prosperity that need could be met from local production. These increases in value will bring about a vast improvement in the national income. The public will benefit from the effect of increased volume of production and trade following as a result of the employment of many thousands of men now idle; from the enormous increased turnover, calculated in money, in almost every branch of trade and industry; and from the restored value of estates and properties. It can be expected that the revenue of the railways, post-offices, and other government services will be immediately benefited, and that after the policy has operated for a few months nearly all sources of government income will become more buoyant, especially excise, probate and succession stamp duties, as well as the sales tax, and other forms of direct and indirect taxes. The income tax will not respond to the full effect of the new policy until the third year owing to the assessments being made on an earlier income-year. </para>
                    <para class="block">That briefly is the outline of the monetary policy that was placed before the Commonwealth Bank, and discussed with the Premiers and the associated banks. It was a practicable proposal that took into account the difficulties with which this country is faced, and undoubtedly, had it operated, it would have contributed to the solution of the worst of those difficulties. It is true that had that policy operated in its entirety there may have been some risk of what is called inflation. The Prime Minister and myself consider that that risk is small. Although a certain amount of inflation may take place, it will be controllable. The factors and influences that will en able a policy of this kind to be operated can be operated to stop it, or to prevent it from getting out of hand. The banks themselves can bring about deflation, and they can stop deflation. They can if they wish bring about a certain measure of inflation, and stop where they like. It is true, however, that these are not things which can be governed exactly. The banks cannot, without many preliminary precautions, measure the point to which they can safely go in an inflationary or deflationary policy. But, proceeding cautiously, it would be an easy matter for the banks to stop the trend towards deflation at any given point. To prevent inflation from getting out of hand, precautionary measures are undoubtedly necessary. The effect of a release of credit has to be carefully watched. Let us consider what it is that everybody dreads from inflation. It is feared that inflation may lead to the collapse of our currency, or have such an adverse effect upon currency as to depreciate its value enormously. There can be no other fear. No one will oppose inflation merely because it is inflation; it is opposed because of its possible evil consequences. </para>

                            <para>- Surely not merely because of that alone; but because they fear some evil consequences. If a measure of inflation were to lead to the destruction of our currency, and to the disorganization of our financial affairs and relative values, it would be evil. We must guard against such a happening. But before we could reach that point, certain things would come about. We cannot have the effects of inflation until we stop deflation; we cannot have the adverse effects of inflation until there has been a considerable stimulus in industry, trade and business, and the setting up of such competition for the buying of goods as to cause price levels to ascend. It is this stimulus in trade ; it is this active buying and selling of goods and commodities that is so much needed in Australia to-day. Before price levels ascend to such a point as to cause the destruction of relative values, we must control the output of credit or increase  of currency or whatever measure of inflation has been operating. That is the safeguard to the community. One honorable member spoke about what has happened in Germany and other countries as a result of inflation. Inflation took place in Germany, but it was an unlimited and deliberate inflation; it was a policy of inflation that consisted of the deliberate injection into the system of finance of billions of marks for a definite purpose, as part of the definite government policy of that country. There is no doubt that that was done designedly. It was not a case of a monetary policy getting out of hand. Inflation was resorted to by the Government of the day as a means of relieving the people of Germany of the tremendous and crushing obligations resting upon them from the reparation settlements. </para>

                            <para>- Whatever happened in France, it is certain that there was an enormous increase in the currency in circulation. It was designedly increased twelvefold compared with the currency of  1913,  and by about fivefold compared with that of  1922.  In  1926,  the currency was stabilized at a certain point. What was done in France was done intentionally. If that nation depreciated its currency, and did injury to its internal bondholders, it was done  as the result of the deliberate policy of the Government. We now know that it is possible to have inflation, to control it and to stabilize it. That is all that can be argued from the experience of France. Honorable members may argue that an injustice was done to the internal bond holders, or to the holders of certain fixed money claims. That is a different question. But the history of currency control in France in recent years, teaches us that inflation is controllable. It must be strange to those who are opposing this measure to learn that at the time when the maximum increase was taking place in the French currency, there was stability in internal price levels. The price levels did not increase; they remained stable. Since  1924  the French currency increased in the following way :  - </para>

                            <para>- That may be an inquiry worth pursuing; but these figures cannot be challenged since they are taken from the monthly bulletin of statistics issued by the League of Nations in December,  1930.  They show an expansion of currency in the measure I have mentioned, while the price levels, after remaining stationary for three years, actually declined in the last year. It is well known, too, that productive activity continued to increase by leaps and bounds while the inflation was going on. </para>

                    <para>There are naturally grounds for apprehension that any policy of inflation may get out of hand. Nobody recognizes that danger more than the Government. But so long as the policy is properly controlled we can prevent it getting out of hand. Why should we not properly control it? Honorable members opposite, and their newspaper supporters, have had their fling at this idea of inflation, and have erected out of it a bogey, which is frightening even themselves. But I wish  to show how we may utilize the credit creating possibilities of this nation for the purpose of saving this nation, and we ought not to be deterred by the fear of a bogey that exists chiefly in the imagination of honorable members opposite. Even some of the conservative economists in Australia are not frightened by the bogey of inflation. Professor J. B. Brigden had something to say about this matter in the course of an address before the Queensland Grocers Association on the 30th October last.  His  address is reported in the daily press about the same date. That was on the eve of the meeting of Parliament for the short session at the end of last year. He was then envisaging the difficulties of meeting the loan maturing in December, and he said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>I think it (the money) cannot be got. I doubt very much if it can be raised in the ordinary way from the public, and either we must default in December or adopt some artificial expedient. It can be done by the expansion of credit. When the conversion is going through it will be seen that enough new money is not being subscribed, and the Commonwealth Treasury will, perhaps, bring a little pressure to bear upon the banks in order to save us from failing to pay our debts in Australia, and the banks may be forced virtually to expand credit to a degree they do not want to do at present, and increase their credit to cover the unsubscribed portion of the loan. </para>
                        <para>He explained that this was the way loans had been financed during the war. It was the cause of the inflation of credit during the war, and the inflation of prices. The same thing might happen in the near future - inflated credit and inflated prices, but reduced costs would provide a margin for the latter. </para>

                        <para>Why should Australia go down with the rest of the world to a lower price level, if that would mean more distress, and if they could check that drift and assure to manufacturers and producers generally that, if they went ahead with their production, in three months' time they would have fairly stable values ? </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">In that observation there is wisdom. Professor Brigden, although one of the leading economists of Australia, is undoubtedly a man of conservative mind; he is not one who would advocate .wild theories. I find that most of the economists in this country speak in a similar strain. Politicians,  mostly, are responsible for the scare about inflation, and for the talk about the necessity of allowing the banks to carry on their ruinous and destructive policy. </para>

                            <para>- At a later stage, I shall show the attitude they adopted. They pretended to find, something unsound in this policy, and I shall quote their letter shortly to show how they thought the situation should be faced. First of all some of the representatives of the banks rushed into the press and said that what the Government and the Treasurer advocated could not be done, because it was beyond the capacity of the banks to provide the extra credit required - they had not the reserves. That was their attitude. There was, they said, a demand for millions to provide employment. They had not the millions. I never at any time suggested that the trading banks had notes or any other tangible currency amounting to millions of pounds which they would not use. I know, as a matter of fact, that the ratio of advances to deposits in the trading banks has been gradually increasing; but that is the result of the monetary policy carried out by the banks themselves. Contraction of credits has the effect of reducing deposits, while a more liberal and progressive policy by the same banks will have the effect of increasing their deposits and reserves. </para>

                        <para>Here it may be well to draw attention to another popular misconception. It is believed by many that the source of the deposits of the ordinary cheque-paying banks is the lodging therewith of currency or its equivalent by depositors, and that the funds available for the purpose of advances by the bank are these same deposits. There is no doubt an element of truth in this. Depositors do lodge currency with their bankers, and the banks do. utilize these deposits in connexion with advances. But it is far from the whole truth. Very much of the amount which appears as " deposits " in a bank's returns was actually brought into existence as such by means of an advance by that or some other bank. That is to say, the current accounts of the bank are in part due to the lodging of currency by clients, and in part to the creation of credit by the banks themselves; and where banking business is brisk much the larger part is due to the latter cause. </para>

                    <para>Of course, any one who has read or studied the mechanism of banking knows that that is an indisputable fact. I do not say that any individual trading bank can, by its own machinery, create an unlimited amount of credit upon which its customers may draw. Nor do the trading banks, acting collectively, do that. But the banking organization of every country, including the central bank, which controls the note issue, undoubtedly has the power to create credit. The only reason why central reserve banking systems have been so largely organized in the last ten years is that an improved system for the control of credit to suit the needs of trade was desired. </para>

                    <para>The banks were unwilling to- co-operate with the Government in operating the policy that I have outlined. Had they been willing to do so, it could have been put into effect without the necessity for additional legislation. At any rate, in the first place, the only legislation that would have been necessary, and even that was conjectural, was legislation which later might have been required for the better governmental control of the exchanges. It was suggested in the course of the discussions by the banks themselves that, on account of operations outside the banks, in the exchange markets, it might have been necessary to license exports in order to give complete control of the funds accruing in London and the overseas markets. That might have been necessary ultimately; but practically no other measure was required to operate the complete policy which was outlined. </para>
                    <para>The banks having rejected that proposal, it has now become necessary for the Government to 'come to Parliament for specific legislation to give effect to the Government's monetary policy. This measure, a bill to provide for a fiduciary currency, is but one of a series that will be necessary to put the Government's scheme into operation. The fiduciary currency measure is a pivotal one, round which the others will revolve. It will provide for the wheat-growers the immediate relief of which they stand in such urgent need to-day. Without it they cannot be provided with the required assistance. Neither the banks nor any other authority can provide the £6,000,000 which is necessary. It is true that the farmers may obtain certain limited advances from State agricultural banks financed by the Commonwealth Bank. They may also have a more or less futile hope of additional assistance from the loan put up by my honorable friend the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> if ever it is subscribed, and if. having been subscribed, it is made available to the farmers, who have no security to offer for it. Apart from that measure of relief, small though it is bound to be, there is  no hope for the wheat-farmers, except what is provided under this fiduciary note scheme. That is a fact which cannot be overlooked by the farmers and their representatives in this House. There is no other possible means forthcoming. No other means is suggested by the banks, by the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> or by any other authority, to provide for the employment of the hundreds of thousands of our unemployed citizens. Where are they to obtain either sustenance or remunerative employment unless the necessary money is provided? </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable member that you cannot have  a sound creation of credit without security behind it. If credit is created by means of additional currency, or merely by bank advances, and is expended upon activities or enterprises, that have no security, it is an unsound transaction that probably will result in heavy loss to whoever is backing it. But it is not suggested that any scheme put forward by the Government for the creation of additional credit or currency will not be amply backed by security. Honorable members opposite scoff at that statement. They apparently believe that this country has no security to offer; that it is bankrupt. They have no faith in their own country. They believe that its security has vanished. If that security is impaired at the present time it is as a result of their rotten propaganda against the proposals of the Government. </para>

                    <para>At the present time the real national liabilities resting upon this nation - that is, the debts that we owe' overseas - are not greater than £575,000,000. Against that indebtedness we have in this country assets that two years ago were valued at £3,000,00'0,000. I am prepared, if honorable members opposite please, to halve that figure, to suppose that the depreciation has been so tremendous that those assets are now worth only £1,500,000,000. Even then they would amount to three times as much as we owe overseas. Surely, therefore, this country is solvent, and has all the security that it needs! Will anyone say  that it  cannot meet its commitments, provide for its requirements, and cover the additional bank credit or the additional currency that may be needed? Anyone who suggests that, does not know the economic strength of his own nation. </para>
                    <para>The Fiduciary Notes Bill is the pivotal measure. It is necessary to have other measures, in order to carry out what was outlined to the banks by the Government. We have to control in some way and to reduce interest charges upon industry and business. There is no doubt that existing interest charges are too high. They are bearing heavily upon every branch of industry and business. If we can effect a reduction of the interest on deposits, as well as upon bank loans and advances, the result will be  a  lowering of interest charges over the whole financial gamut of our industrial world. The interest charged by the banks is practically the basis upon which rates are' fixed by other institutions, and is the controlling factor also in the fixation of the rates payable on government loans. Consequently, we must deal legislatively with that matter. As the banks will not voluntarily agree to the control of interest rates, a measure designed to effect that purpose will be introduced. </para>
                    <para>Another measure may be necessary to provide better and more effective control of the exchange, so that the rate will not rise to an abnormal level. In my opinion, it is at an abnormally high level at the present time. </para>

                    <para>Then again, the Central Reserve Bank Bill must be re-introduced and become law, and the Commonwealth Bank must be freed from that private bank domination which has prevented it from carrying out its true functions in Australia. There is no doubt that it has been strangled in its operations. It has not been allowed to extend its branches, nor to operate in active or aggressive competition with other banking institutions. From the time that the Bruce-Page Government amended the Commonwealth Bank Act, the Commonwealth Bank has not expanded, but has been in a condition of arrested development.

I suppose that the logic of that interjection is "Don't send it away this year; don't pay your debts this year; keep the gold so that you will be able to pay your debts next year after you have defaulted this year." The honorable member would default in London so long as we were able to maintain that superstitious reverence for the gold reserve at the Commonwealth Bank. I see no necessity for doing so. I do see the necessity for having a limit placed upon our note issue; but that can be done without the present gold reserve. </para>

                            <para>- The metallic reserve for the Australian note issue, when established, was intended to enable Australian notes to be convertible into gold at the will of those who held them. That character of the Australian note has been entirely lost. To-day it is no longer convertible ; or at any rate, its convertibility is illusory. It is true that the notes stillbear upon their face a promise to pay in gold at the head office of the Commonwealth Bank. If a large quantity of notes were presented, and gold were demanded, that gold would be paid by the Commonwealth Bank; but the recipient of it would immediately receive from the bank a notice requisitioning that gold back from him. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The convertibility of the Australian note has been entirely lost; but that has not shaken the faith of the Australian people in it. Its value in the performance of its currency functions is exactly the same as it was previously. If all the gold in the Commonwealth Bank were shipped away, that value would not be destroyed. </para>

                            <para>- The Australian note is more valuable to-day than it was two years ago, because it purchases nearly 25 per cent. more than it did then. One of the difficulties that confront Australia to-day is that money is becoming more valuable, while goods, commodities and services are becoming less valuable. That is what is creating the dis-equilibrium between one class and another of our citizens. The Australian note has a real, a tangible value. It is legal tender; it will pay for any service or any obligation that can be paid for with any money. </para>

                            <para>- Not overseas. The paper money of any country is not currency in any other country. The honorable member simply exhibits his igno- ranee of the character of paper money when he makes that interjection. The Australian note never had currency overseas, except that kind of currency that might have been given to it by any person who held it and others who were willing to accept it. It had no legal tender character in any sense. It was made legal tender in Australia, and has to be accepted to any amount in the discharge of debts or obligations here. In that sense, the character of the Bank of England note is not in the slightest degree different from that of the Australian note. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is merely displaying his ignorance. Will those who refer to the proposed currency under this bill as " spurious money " explain what difference there will be between the character of that money and the money which is now in circulation in Australia? This fiduciary currency will be legal tender up to any amount, and will have to be accepted for the discharge of debts and obligations. Its value will not vary to the slightest extent from that of the Australian note that is now in circulation ; it will vary from time to time only as the Australian note varies. </para>

                            <para>- Will those who say that this will not be real money say what is real money? I suppose they argue that the Australian notes, or the bank currency in circulation at the present time, can be regarded as real money. According to them, if a bank grants an overdraft to a client and gives him a cheque book, with the right to draw upon his account at the bank, that is real money. Yet this, they say, is not real money. A cheque is not legal tender, and has an altogether different character. I do not wish it to be thought that I am attacking that practice as unsound. The point that I wish to convey is that apparently honorable members opposite regard as real whatever money is created by a bank, but as spurious the currency established by this Parliament, with the backing .of the resources of the nation - currency that is made legal tender within our borders. If the honorable member's salary is tendered to him in these notes, I hope he will not regard them as " spurious money." </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Fawkner asks on what principle the issue is being fixed at £18,000,000. I take it that he wishes to know how we were guided as to the amount that should be fixed as the limit. I think I indicated earlier, in outlining the plan placed before the banks, that the Government thought it safe, and, indeed, desirable, to have such an increase in credit as would not take us beyond the 1929 price levels or their equivalent. That, I think, -is a fair measure by which to control the additional amount of money made available to the community, either by way of expenditure upon public works or by assistance to industry. Indeed, it is recognized that before we could reach the price levels represented by the 1929 index number, it would be necessary to create a large amount of credit - no doubt far beyond the £18,000,000 provided for in this bill. But in this measure we are providing for specific things, which will be under control, by way of expenditure by the Government itself. "We are asking Parliament. to approve of the expenditure - of £6,000,000 for the relief of wheat farmers, and £12,000,000 for :l,ne immediate creation of employment. Because of the expenditure of that money - because of the employment of the 40,000 men who would be provided with work by the expenditure of £1,000,000 a month on public works, the consequent increased volume of purchasing power, and the extra demand that would be created in industry and trade, the necessity for additional bank credit would be created. Although only £18,000,000 is provided for in the bill, it will undoubtedly have the effect of creating a demand upon the banks for money which will result in a considerable issue of credit, a considerable restoration of purchasing power, and, therefore, absorption of a large body of men in the community. </para>

They pretend to think that this scheme which the Government is formulating is something highly dangerous, and, therefore, one that should not be tolerated; that it has never been thought of before, and, therefore^ would not be sanctioned by any authority who knew anything about economics or banking. Well, I want to call the attention of honorable members to a very interesting document, of the existence of which I learned only when I re-entered the Cabinet at the end of January. It is a document signed by Professor D. B. Copland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> C. Dyason, and Professor L. F. Giblin, and presented to the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> and the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> on the 18th September, 1930. If honorable members will carefully examine this document they will find that almost everything that, the Government has been contending for and is standing for to-day in order to secure financial and monetary re-organization is recommended by these three gentlemen. Two of those gentlemen are professors of economics, regarded as authoritative men in their profession - men whose views are taken notice of, whose knowledge is specially recognized. Professor Copland is recognized as the economist of Australia, who has specially studied banking, and Professor Giblin has given particular attention and study to monetary questions. </para><interjection>

                        <para>This distribution of the loss is inequitable, and the first problem of economic readjustment is to distribute the first loss of income fairly among all classes according to their capacity to bear the burden. If this condition is fulfilled, it will then be possible by a sound monetary policy to restore industry and employment, and thus to counteract the repercussions from the first loss of income and to provide a means of escape from the indirect losses. In this way the paralysing effects of depression will bo overcome and confidence in the future of industry restored. </para>

This cannot but depress industry throughout the country, and a continuance of the present decline in prices must result in an increase of unemployment. If the deflation of the price level necessary to restore exchange parity could be accomplished over a period of twenty years the depressing effect upon industry would be small, and severe unemployment could be avoided. But the task of reducing prices rapidly cannot be accomplished without a substantial increase in the present numbers of unemployment. This is the worst aspect of hasty deflation, but it is by no means the only serious objection to such a policy. </para>

The fall in revenue is, however, so serious that no practicable reduction in expenditure can relieve the budget sufficiently.

                            <para>- I will. I have been asked a number of times by the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> and others, not to omit to say how the banks received the policy which the Government submitted to them. They received it with hostility. That, I think, is the only word which adequately describes their attitude. My own impression is that the banks regarded the proposals of the Government from the point of view of traditional conservatism. They were unwilling to co-operate with a Labour Government in a matter of this kind. </para>

                            <para>- The impression left upon my mind was that they were prepared to remain adamant, and to follow a conservative and narrow financial policy along precedents established by the English banks. They were unwilling to depart in the slightest detail from the advice they received from the overseas financial authorities. After the matter had been discussed with the  chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board, it was dealt with in greater detail by myself in the presence of all the members of the board. The  chairman  of the board subsequently forwarded me a letter which embodied the views of the board. As the text of this letter has been published in the press, I shall not read the whole of it, but only the resolution which it contains, and which I was asked to convey to the Premiers' Conference. This resolution reads as follows: - </para>

If the Commonwealth Bank Board had been willing to co-operate with the Government there would have been no necessity for this bill, and no necessity for the delay which will be occasioned in considering it. If the board had been prepared to do what undoubtedly it should have done, this policy would have been in operation to-day, our people would have been in employment instead of being still idle; and our farmers would have been relieved instead of being still in distress and anxious about their future. </para><para>Subsequently we met the representatives of the associated banks with the representatives of the Commonwealth Bank. After having heard the Prime Minister and myself this conference considered the case submitted to it, and later sent a communication to the Government. This letter was not so blunt in its terms as the communication received from the Commonwealth Bank Board. It did not so plainly lay down the conditions which the trading banks would insist upon, but it- laid them down quite sufficiently for the Government to understand the attitude that had been adopted. </para><interjection>

An annual total of nearly £40,000,000 is involved, a sum involving so large a proportion of the community's taxable resources that it cannot escape scrutiny. This expenditure reached its present proportions in times of prosperity. The subsequent fall in the cost of living justifies the inclusion of these payments within the field of review. </para>

The inference from its report is undoubtedly that the major portion of the proposed saving of £15,000,000 per annum in government expenditure was to be obtained from these services, and the banking authorities evidently desired the same thing. The committee practically suggested that if economies were effected in these directions, the economic condition of the country would be restored. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- The banking authorities with whom the Government conferred suggested that the proposals in this bill are not on sound banking lines, and that the suggestions made by the committee of experts should be followed. The inference is that the committee of experts prepared a completely new monetary policy which, if operated by the Government, would restore prosperity to the country. But practically all that the committee recommended was the reduction of wages, salaries and allowances, and of the pensions payable to the pioneers of the country, and to those who suffered through the war. Surely no one is simple enough, or imbued with such pristine ideas of economics, or equipped with such an infantile mentality, as to think that, the adoption of these proposals would be sufficient to meet the circumstances in which Australia finds herself. </para>

                    </continue><para>I have never denied, nor has the Government, that reductions must be effected in government expenditure and all possible economies insisted upon. We recognize that this is necessary. We have economized as far as possible in government expenditure. We have cut down by £2,300.000 per annum the expenditure of the previous Government, and we say quite frankly that further economies are necessary. We must get rid of overlapping and duplication in the services rendered by the Commonwealth and the States. The Commonwealth Public Service cannot hope to retain its present salary level with the cost of living falling, and with salaries of the people in outside employment also falling. All salaries will have to be adjusted to the cost of living. The Commonwealth public servants recognize this, and I believe they will be willing to accept whatever reduction of wages might be necessary as the result of the reduction in the cost of living. </para><interjection>

We have to pay £28,000,000 per annum in interest on loans domiciled here, some of which do not mature for 40 years. We cannot compel these people to make any contribution to the general sacrifice except by taxation. That is the only way in which it can be done, unless you are going to alter the value of the £ and repay these people their interest and principal in a £ of a value equivalent to that which they subscribed. </para>

                    </continue><para>About a month ago Professor Giblin prepared a memorandum at my request dealing with the subject of national income. In it he shows that our national income grew from £153,000,000 in 1903, to £663,000,000 in 1928-29, the maximum year. In order that there may be no mistake in the minds of honorable members I shall quote the definition of " national income* " which Professor Giblin adopted. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Stamp, in <inline font-style="italic">Wealth and Taxable Capacity,</inline> says, at page 416, after discussing the different definitions of the term "national income " - </para><quote>
                        <para>When all the different conceptions have been studied we come back to the fact that the sum total of wages, . salaries, profits, and interest, presents a fairly comprehensible idea, free from important ambiguities, for ordinary comparative purposes. </para>
                    </quote><para>It is in this sense that the term " national income " is used by Professor Giblin. The professor says in this memorandum - </para><quote>
                        <para>The national income for 1.930-31 may bc estimated with some confidence at between £460,000,000 and £480,000,000, as contrasted with £063,000,000 in 1928-29, and about £550,000,000 in 1929-30. </para>
                    </quote><para>Subsequently, in dealing with fixed money claims, he says - </para><quote>
                        <para>With such diminished income the whole relationship between public and private indebtedness and national income is upset. Fixed money claims (bonds, mortgages, preference shares, long term leases, &amp;c. ), may be estimated at £70,000,000 or £80,000,000 per annum internal, and £36,000,000 per annum external, or a total (with parity restored) or about £110,000,000. It follows that fixed money claims would take nearly 30 per cent, of a national income of less than £400,000,000. In 1928-29 the fixed money claims, then a little less than £110,000,000, were about 16 per cent, of a national income of £050,000,000. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">It will be seen, therefore, that fixed money claims now take twice the proportion of national income that they took only <inline font-style="italic">two</inline> or three years ago. The change in money values has upset relationships in all money matters as between one class and another, and especially as between the debtor and the creditor class. This factor cannot be ignored in connexion with any economic reconstruction which we may essay for the solution of our problems. Honorable " members constantly ignore it. They speak only of the necessity to reduce wages, social services and pensions as though that would not be grossly unfair. We must take into account all the other factors which represent as great, if not a greater, charge upon the national income. </para><interjection>

                        <para>The false stress on money as a <inline font-style="italic">vera causa</inline> of depression and unemployment has singularly unfortunate implications. It is used to show that, since other costs of production cannot at once be lowered, money wages, a chief cost, should be reduced. The immediate result would be still further to worsen the distribution of income, and to contract still further the effective demand for commodities, with a consequent shrinkage of employment of capital and labour along the whole series of processes producing the commodities bought in reduced quantities by the employed workers. It is argued, however, that any such evil effect would be more than compensated by the expansion of our export trade which this reduction of costs would enable us to gain. More employment in this country, though at lower wages, might leave the total working-class income as large as now, or even larger. Upon this argument I make two comments. In the first place, it proposes to reduce the money income of the workers in those export or unsheltered trades where wages are already notoriously lower than in the sheltered trades. Secondly, it initiates a competition for the debasement of the standard of life throughout the economic world, by seeking to underbid foreign products and to force down the wages in their export trades so as to enable them to hold their markets. Instead of using the new machinery of internationalism in order to raise the standards of life for the workers in all countries, this proposal must work in the opposite direction. Experience in tariff wars ought to indicate sufficiently the danger of entering a contest in sweating. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline></para>
                    </quote><para>I thank honorable members for their consideration. As a final reference to this phase of the subject I remind honorable members of the sacrifices already made by Australian workers and invite them to consider whether an adequate sacrifice has, up to the present, been made by property-owners, especially those with fixed money claims. I mentioned the other night, without entering into elaborate detail, that as the result of reductions already made by the Federal and State Arbitration Courts and in industries that are not governed by awards at all - industries the awards relating to which have recently been removed by certain governments - a reduction of at least £44,000,000 a year in wages is faced by the men in these classes alone. There is in addition a large number of workers whose wages are not governed by arbitration tribunals and who do not come within this category. They have been similarly affected by the economic depression; but it is not yet possible to estimate the amount of money wages lost by them. We do know, however, that at least £44,000,000 a year* will be contributed by the Australian workers as their part of the sacrifice. Surely honorable members will not continue to urge that more and more should be extorted from these unfortunate wage-earners or from those who are drawing pensions because of war injuries, or for the part which they played in pioneering the development of this country. Surely they do not think that more should be demanded of these sections of the community, while those who have fixed money claims enjoy what is really an increase in income because of the decline in commodity prices. </para><interjection>

The banks cannot run away from that. That is their solution as contrasted with what the Government put up. </para>

                            <para>- If so, the honorable member can supply what is missing. The attitude of the Australian banks is perfectly consistent with the attitude of banking institutions in all countries. Everywhere, in this world crisis, they have adopted an attitude of unprogressive conservatism. They have been unable to solve the problem. They have meddled with it, and where they have meddled with it they have created chaos. The international bankers of the world are largely responsible for what has happened to the monetary policy of the world in the last two years, and must be held responsible for the consequences of that policy. It is not sufficient for them to say that it has got out of hand and that they are now unable to control it. They were the originating causes of the depression and the economic disaster that has overtaken the world. </para>

                            <para>- They can hardly be described as an endorsement of it, because the writers were at the time unacquainted with the intentions of the Commonwealth Labour Government; but undoubtedly they are an endorsement of the ideas that have actuated this Government in bringing forward its proposal, and they certainly do call attention to the weakness of the financial policy upon which they have commented. We are simply backing up our own policy by quoting their opinions. </para>

                    </continue><para>Australia is faced with an enormous difficulty. No one else has come forward with a constructive policy that can be put into operation to correct the economic ills of the country. It is undoubtedly the responsibility of the Government to endeavour to formulate a policy to cor rect those ills, and that responsibility has not been shirked by us. We have drafted what we regard as a complete and comprehensive working plan that can be operated, and could have been operated without delay if the banks had co-operated. If there is delay it is because the banks have resisted us. . They may take the stand that in the matter of monetary policy they and not the Government are to decide. That apparently is the stand which honorable members opposite endorse. But, I ask, is that the correct attitude? Is it sound that in so vital a matter the affairs of the nation should be left to a handful of bankers in the community - that they alone should assert control and influence in such a matter, and that governments and parliaments can be pushed aside and dictated to in regard to it? Is that the attitude taken up by honorable members opposite ? In normal times, when it is merely a matter of managing the credit business of the community, looking after the finances of private or public enterprise, and providing credit facilities for the commercial and trading community, the banks ought not to be interfered with ; but to-day we have reached a time of crisis. The nation is being strangled. The workers are being starved. Business is stagnant, and thousands of enterprises are collapsing. The Bankruptcy Court is working overtime because of the collapse of individual businesses and enterprises. In a crisis such as this it is time for governments to assert their authority and accept their responsibilities. It is not sufficient for them to stand by without exercising their authority. And so I say we should not be worth our salt as an administration if we did not assert our authority to speak for the nation in a matter of this kind. I do not care what it involves, even if it means taking over the control of the currency by the Government, should that be necessary to save this nation from the chaos in which it is wallowing, to save it from ruin and destruction at the hands of unimaginative bankers. Who has given the general managers or boards of directors of banks any special dispensation to be the final authority for the nation in such vital matters? Has any one given them a sacred right in that respect which must not be questioned? They have certainly been given great powers by this  Parlia- merit, but now we are asking Parliament to curtail those powers. When the last great crisis, the war, came upon the nation did the Government ask the banks for their kind permission or decision as to how far it should go in financing the military necessities of this nation? Did the Government take into consideration the warnings of conservative bankers on that occasion ? It may have consulted these financial institutions as to the means of implementing the Government's policy, but it certainly did not ask them to formulate that policy. Is the crisiswhich the nation is facing to-day any less serious than that through which it passed during the war ? When 300,000 men are out of work, with no hope of getting it under the monetary policy dictated by the banks, when thousands and scores of thousands of women and children are on the verge of starvation, or are actually starving; when people in business are seeing their enterprises ruined, with no hope for the future, are we not justified in regarding it as a particularly critical time, and if we do, are we to stand aside supinely because half a dozen bank managers say, " We do not agree with your policy. Slaughter pensions and wages and balance your budget " ? I say that we should not be worth a moment's consideration if we did not submit to Parliament this policy in which we believe - the only policy put forward that is capable of saving the nation in its present hour of trouble. </para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham)</inline> adjourned. </para></speech>

                        <para>.- I again ask the Prime Minister when . the Government proposes to lay upon the table of the House the new regulations under the Transport Workers Act. To-day, in reply to a question, the right honorable gentleman said that it would have been improper to table any regulation while a motion of want of confidence was before the House, although he knew that after the debate on that motion had been commenced, and while it was proceeding, over 40 regulations and ordinances were laid upon the table. The regulations under the Transport Workers Act have been in print for a long time; they have been distributed to the public, and are in operation. Moreover, they are of far greater importance than any other regulation amongst those which have been laid upon the table of the House during the last fortnight. We all know the politics which dictated the framing of the regulations under the Transport Workers Act. We know the trick which was played upon this Parliament. </para>

The regulations, although they had been prepared some time before, were introduced the day after the adjournment of Parliament on the 18th December last. From that fact honorable members may draw their own conclusions. The regulations were challenged in the High Court, which, by a majority decision, upheld their validity. This is March, and although the Government has had ample time to lay 40 other regulations upon the table, those under the Transport Workers Act are still withheld. </para>

                            <para>- In reply to my first question on this subject, the Prime Minister said that the Attorney-General would look into the matter. Has he looked into it? If he has, what did he see? The second reason given was that it would be improper to lay the regulations on the table during a confidence debate.  That  excuse also fails. Therefore, I ask the Prime Minister for the third time this session why the regulations have not been tabled. </para>

                        <para>.- Will the Prime Minister indicate to the House when the general debate on the tariff schedules which have been introduced during the last eighteen months will commence? Apparently, ministerial supporters are content to give to the Government power to introduce schedules imposing taxation on the people and giving concessions to certain sections of the community, and then to defy all parliamentary precedents by refusing the House an opportunity to discuss them. The time is overdue for this House to declare whether these special taxes shall be approved. </para>

                            <para>- I told the Leader of the Opposition that the Attorney-General would look into this matter. Now the Leader of the Opposition desires to know what he found. The answer is that the Attorney-General found that he is acting within his statutory rights; he will observe the law by tabling the regulations within the period stipulated by the act. Subject to that limitation, the regulations will be tabled when the Government thinks they should be tabled. </para>

                            <para>- The policy pursued by the Nationalist Government was to hound to the last ditch a body of unionists because they had made one mistake. They were to have no hope of forgiveness in this world - or even in the next,  if  the Leader of the Opposition could contrive to prevent it. The view of the Government is that the unionists are entitled to an opportunity to work; those who were starved while the last  Government  gave preference to scabs have a right to live. The unionists are not to be starved to death merely because they are unionists and made a mistake. The vindictive policy that was pursued by the ship-owners and supported by the Leader of the Opposition is being frustrated by an act of Parliament, passed at the instance of the honorable gentleman, when he was Attorney-General. </para>
