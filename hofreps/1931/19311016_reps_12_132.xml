            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - The distress caused to the depositors in the Government Savings Bank of New SouthWales has given Commonwealth Ministers very great concern during the past few months. More than one million depositors were affected by the closing of the bank at a time when it was vital to their needs that its machinery should be kept in motion. Unfortunately for the credit of Australia and the financial position of many people, the bank closed, inflicting severe hardship on its depositors. Many whowere dependent upon their savings for sustenance were suddenly deprived of access to their money, and wereleft in a pitiable plight. In addition to the personal loss to many thousands of depositors the closing of the bank inflicted a severe economic blow on New South Wales and the whole of Australia. It was disastrous to have millions of pounds, representing the thrift of the people, locked up in the bank. Industry suffered by the restriction of the purchasing power of the depositors,and, what was more serious, confidence in banking institutions generally was shaken. Since the bank closed there has been no change for the better so far as the old depositors are concerned, and while the present position continues, the finances of the whole Commonwealth must be disturbed. The New South Wales Government SavingsBank is a State institution with a State guarantee, but the repercussions of its closing were felt all over the Commonwealth. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Many statements have been made by which the impression is being created that, if the Commonwealth Government so desired, it could propose legislation to meet the position. I shall indicate how, in the opinion of this Government the very serious situation could he met. To enable honorable members to appreciate the situation it is necessary to survey the circumstances surrounding the closing of the bank. Unless we see the matter in true perspective we shall not arrive at an intelligent decision as to the proper solution of this vexed problem. </para>
          <para>For some months prior to the final crisis there bad been steady withdrawals from the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales; but when the State Premier announced his. refusal to pay interest overseas, and actually failed to meet some of the interest payments due by his Government to the State Savings Bank, the depositors were filled with panic, and withdrawals increased to an alarming extent. From the end of March until the 23rd April, a period of three weeks, the withdrawals amounted to over &#163;4,000,000. </para>
          <para>Towards the end of March the  chairman  of the Savings Bank Commission <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hall)</inline> asked the Commonwealth Bank for assistance. The Commonwealth Bank agreed to provide cash against fixed deposits which the State Savings Bank had with the Commonwealth and trading banks. The amount thus provided was, approximately, &#163;3,000,000. </para>
          <para>The withdrawals from the State Savings Bunk continued, and, early in April, thu commissioners published in the newspapers full-page advertisements pointing out, that thu bank was guaranteed by the State Government. That, however, had do good effect, and the bank closed on the 23rd April. </para>
          <para>Two days previously the Premier of New South Wales had written to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank asking him to arrange for the taking over of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. The Commonwealth Bank Board replied on the same day, agreeing to consider the proposal. The savings bank remained open for only one day after the Premier approached the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwea1th</inline> Bank. There was thus do time for the Commonwealth Bank to examine the position, or for even the briefest negotiation to be undertaken before  the State institution closed. The Commonwealth Bank, nevertheless, offered assistance to necessitous depositors, pending an examination of the affairs of the bank, prior to amalgamation. Certain legislation had to be passed by tho New South Wales Government to enable payments to be made to necessitous depositors. That legislation was passed on the 29th April, and five days later, on the 4th May, the Commonwealth Bank began making payments to those in need. The cash provided for this purpose amounted to &#163;1,250,000, and was in addition to the &#163;3,000,000 previously advanced. The suggested terms of amalgamation were subsequently submitted to the State Government on the 28th May. On the 15th June the Premier replied, submitting certain objections to -the proposed agreement. </para>
          <para>At the Premiers Conference in Melbourne, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> spoke to me regarding the bank, and later I suggested that the conference should appoint a committee, consisting of the Prime Minister, the Premier of Now South Wales, and the Premier of &#39; South Australia, to confer with the  Chairman  and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. This committee met on the 20th June. After two Hays&#39; discussion it was agreed that the points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> iu his letter to the Commonwealth Bank should be a matter for further negotiation between the representatives of the Commonwealth Bank and the Commissioners of the New South Wales Savings Bank. Had the proposed agreement been accepted three months ago, the old depositors could have withdrawn immediately &#163;10, or 10 per cent, of their deposits, whichever was the greater. .1 fully believe that if the agreement had been adopted the feeling of unrest would then have gradually disappeared, and that by now confidence would have been sufficiently restored to enable the old depositors to operate freely upon their accounts. </para>
          <para>The suggestion has been made that flip Commonwealth&#39;s sole desire is to get possession of the State Bank. The first proposal for amalgamation came from the State Bank and the State Premier on the. 21st April, although, prior to that, assistance had been given by the Commonwealth Bank to enable the State Bank to carry on. </para>
          <para>Speaking for this Government, I say definitely that our main desire from the beginning was to come to the rescue of the State Bank depositors ; and that is still our earnest wish. </para>
          <para>There was no urging of the Commonwealth Bank by the Commonwealth Government to get control of the State institution. When difficulties arose, the Commonwealth Bank agreed to cash the fixed deposits of the State Savings Bank, and, later, when the closing of the State Savings Bank became imminent, it was the Premier of New South Wales who asked the Commonwealth Bank to arrange for amalgamation. At that time I conveyed&#39; to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson the Commonwealth Government&#39;s wish that the depositors in the State Savings Bank should be treated as generously as possible. </para>
          <para>In a letter dated the 15th July, addressed to the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson stated - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Negotiations have been proceeding continuously between the Commonwealth Bank Board and the Commissioners of the New South Wales Savings Bank, as was agreed upon at the conference.- </para>
            <para>The whole matter has been full nf difficulties owing, chiefly, to the Sural Bank and the Homes Department. A point has now been readied which determines the limits possible on the part of the Commonwealth Bunk Board. These would now appear to be acceptable to the Commissioners of the New South Wales Savings Bank and, I understand, the commissioners have recommended acceptance by the New South Wales Government. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>It has been said that the terms of the proposed agreement were harsh. I was not in a position to judge. I did, however, arrange a conference at which the points of difference were threshed out by&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> the  President  of the State Savings Bank Commission, and. the  Chairman  and .the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. After a long discussion it was agreed that the points outstanding should be taken up by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and the  President  of the State Bank. As a result of their negotiations, a re-drafted agreement was prepared, approved by the State Bank Commissioners and, I believe, recommended to the State Government. The re-drafted  agreement, however, was not accepted by the Government of New South Wales. No further representations with respect to that proposed agreement have been made to me by the Premier of New South &#34;Wales. </para>
          <para>Statements have been made in various quarters to the effect that the Commonwealth Bank is competing unfairly with the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. After the latter closed its doors, the only savings bank in operation in the State of New South Wales was the Commonwealth Savings Bank. Naturally cbe business of that institution immediately increased, and many thousands of new accounts were opened. Where it was found that the demands on the post offices in a particular locality were becoming heavier than they could respond co, the Commonwealth Bank decided to open new branches, and thus relieve the strain. In all, eleven new branches of the Commonwealth Savings Bank were opened, one in the city of Sydney and ten in adjacent suburbs. It has been said that the bank is erecting palatial banking premises. I am informed that at the eleven points referred to the bank has gone into modest, leased premises, all of which have been taken on comparatively short tenures. I would also emphasize the fact that the State Savings Bank is at present offering 3^ per cent, interest to depositors, as against the 3 per cent, paid by the Commonwealth Bank. So much for the talk of unfair competition. </para>
          <para>It must be remembered that the Commonwealth Bank has never been the banker for the New South Wales Government. No matter what government was in office, the Commonwealth Bank was denied all share in government business in New South Wales. Government accounts have been most profitable to banks, particularly when  revenues  were buoyant, but no share of such profits came to the Commonwealth Bank from New South Wales. Private banks secured the whole of them. Now, when there are difficulties, the Commonwealth Bank is expected to come to the rescue. Despite that, however, the Government is anxious that the Commonwealth Bank shall do everything possible to aid depositors in the State institution. </para>
          <para>In a circular sent to honorable members the following statement is made : - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government Savings Bank of New South Wales holds Commonwealth Government securities totalling &#163;30,000,000. It is certainly not too much to expect that very considerable assistance could be given by the Commonwealth Government on this security. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That statement without explanation is quite misleading&#34; In consequence of the recent debt conversion all the converted loans became Commonwealth securities, but they are not all Commonwealth debts. As a matter of fact, only &#163;3,800,000 of the State bank&#39;s investments are Commonwealth Government loans. Most of the money of the Government Savings Bank was invested in State securities and deposits at the State Treasury. State loans totalled &#163;25,000,000, and the deposits at .the Treasury &#163;7,200,000. The Commonwealth Government securities amounted to &#163;3,800,000. Deposits at the State Treasury were included by the bank amongst its liquid assets. When the bank got into difficulties it could not cash these so-called liquid assets. Moreover, the New South Wales Treasury withheld from the bank some of the interest due to the bank, and required the bank to capitalize that interest. </para>
          <para>A request  is made  that the Commonwealth should guarantee deposits. The reason given is that the State has no power to issue notes. It is twenty-one years since the Commonwealth first  legislated regarding the issue of notes. In all that time the sufficiency of the State guarantee was never questioned. The Commonwealth could not guarantee an institution entirely outside its control. Moreover, the Commonwealth constitutionally has no power to guarantee the deposits of a State Savings Bank. </para>
          <para>A request has been made for the issue of notes against, the security of Government stock. It is impracticable for the Commonwealth to legislate so as to give the right to draw notes to a State savings bank, in the administration and management of which the Commonwealth has no say. Tho savings bank has to be put into a position where it will be encouraging people to increase their balances, and will be accumulating savings. If it were merely to be given funds to pay off a portion of the old deposits, it would cease to be a real savings bank; it, would really be an institution gradually going into liquidation. The real necessity is to put the savings bank on such a basis that depositors will have absolute faith in ite soundness, and in its ability to pay. Then depositors will not withdraw their money because of fear; they will withdraw only to meet their needs. </para>
          <para>Had the serious position of the State Savings Bank been firmly grappled with <inline font-style="italic">s&#62;</inline> few weeks before the bank closed, the business could have been taken over by the Commonwealth Bank as a going concern without the bank closing its doors, and without, financial loss to the Government or the people of New South Wales. I still believe that the position can be retrieved, and every penny secured to the depositors. That, however, can only be done by creating a feeling of trust and confidence in. the minds of depositors. In view of the events which I have just outlined, the Commonwealth Government is convinced that, the only sound way to deal with this problem is by the amalgamation of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales with the Commonwealth Bank. I have just, received the following telegram: - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Million old depositors demand State Bank amalgamate with Commonwealth. Request your support. </para>
            <para>Depositors&#39; Association. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>T have already written to the Premier of New South Wales pointing out that the State Savings Bank is constituted under State law. and that its management is subject only to the State. Obviously the Commonwealth could not guarantee an institution, the management of which is entirely outside its control. In any case, the Commonwealth cannot legislate in regard to State banking, and, consequently, the guarantee by the Commonwealth of the payment of the deposits of the State Savings Bank is outside the scope of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>I also conveyed to the Premier the Government&#39;s view that the only remedy for the bank&#39;s difficulties lies in its amalgamation with the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Treasurer has suggested to the commissioners of the State Bank the desirability of entering into negotiations with the Commonwealth Bank for amalgamation, and I have urged the State Premier to support that action. </para>
          <para>This Government deplores the circumstances which compelled the closing of a splendid institution. It regrets thai thousands of depositors who showed their faith in the bank should now be suffering as the result of the temporary loss of their savings. Because of that unfortunate position, the Government believes that negotiations for amalgamation should be re-opened. Not only does the Government think that necessary, but it is prepared to co-operate to that end. While more than 1,000,000 depositors of the State Bank remain dispossessed of their life savings, so long will the nation suffer. How imperative it is, therefore, that the New South Wales Government should do everything possible to assist these depositors to obtain their money ! </para>

              <para>- The Prime Minister has made perfectly clear something that I have known personally, that the Government has been and still is prepared to do anything within reason to effect an amalgamation of the Commonwealth Bank and the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. I am glad to have had such a declaration from the Government. We should all strive for such an amalgamation, lt is obvious that honor-1 able members on- this side of the chamber have no responsibility for the closing of the bank, nor for any of the suffering which that has caused. The duplication of Federal and State activities has been responsible for much unnecessary expense, particularly in connexion with the savings banks. In some States there are two savings banks, each belonging to the people, fighting each other from opposite sides of a street. When I was a member of the Government, the matter of duplication and its resultant, unnecessary expense was investigated. It was clearly seen that savings could be effected in many directions, but it was obvious that the difficulty of doing this was greatest in regard to the savings banks. For a long time I, with many others, have held that there is no justification for the continuance of the system under which the Commonwealth and State governments maintain separate and competing banking institutions. </para>

          <para>But while I approve of the proposals of the Commonwealth Government, and believe firmly that the responsibility for the present position rests with the Government of New South Wales, I cannot altogether absolve a number of honorable members in this chamber from responsibility in the matter. The trouble did not arise only a few weeks ago. The failure of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was practically certain from the moment when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> was returned with a majority, and became Premier of that State. From that moment, confidence in the bank began to wane. The figures reveal that its deposits and resources immediately began to decline. Confidence in the institution steadily dwindled, until the crash came, and the bank had to close i rs doors. I do not hold this Government, as a government, responsible for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang&#39;s</inline> election ; but those who assisted to return <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> to power cannot rid themselves of responsibility &#39;for what has happened. Certain members on the Government side made it their mission to have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> made Premier of New South Wales, and one Minister, at least, asserted that that would be the first step towards bringing Australia back to prosperity and reducing unemployment. That stigma does not rest upon the Prime Minister nor the Treasurer. Neither participated in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang&#39;s</inline> campaign, each apparently being able to foresee what would happen if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> were returned. But some other members of the Government toured the State of New South Wales, zealously espousing the cause of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline> As they had known that gentleman for years they cannot be excused for what they did. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer, however, because, no doubt, of what they knew of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> refrained from taking part in the campaign. I, too, refused to do so, despite the pressure that was brought to bear upon me when a Minister, to support <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline></para>

          <para>The election of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> and his Government immediately lessened the confidence of the public in that bank.  It-  has been asserted many times that confidence is essential if Australia is to pull through its difficulties. Confidence is essential if any Business is to be successful. Under thebanking system of Australia, a temporary run on a bank can be staved off, provided that there is still confidence in the institution. The other banks, and the Commonwealth Bank particularly, through its note issue, can come to the assistance of an institution temporarily in difficulties,and help it to tide over its trouble. But when confidence has gone completely, neither the other banks, nor the nation can save the bank affected. Lack of confidence due to the conduct of the Government of New South Wales, was the whole cause of the trouble. The Commonwealth Bank has been criticized in this connexion, and the Commonwealth authorities are being held responsible for the actions of the Lang Government and of the people of New SouthWales who re turned that Government to power. The Prime Minister, however, has shown that the Commonwealth Bank has done everything possible to meet the situation. </para>

I hope,however, that the negotiations with the Commonwealth Bank will be continued. Like other honorable members, I sympathize with the depositors who have suffered directlyas the result of the closing of the State Savings Bank - and also with the community generally, whichhas suffered indirectly. Theonly solution of the difficulty is theamalgamation of the Commonwealth and State savings banks, and I hope that the Government will continue tonegotiate to that end. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bang</inline> is not prepared to agree to an amalgamation, and brushes aside all offers of assistance, we, in this Parliament, cannot be held responsible for any failure which may result.

              <para>- The Prime Minister has mentioned the sum which has been made available by the Commonwealth to assist the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. That is not the first occasion on which the Commonwealth, during the term of office of the present Government, has come to the assistance  of  New South Wales. When I was a member of the Government, during the absence of the Prime Minister from Australia, it was proposed to float an internal loan  of  &#163;27,000,000. The Premier of New South Wales then informed the Loan Council that a sum of nearly &#163;1,000,000 was due by the Government of New South Wales to the Government Savings Bank  of that  State. He pointed out that in other years the bank had been able to renew these loans as they became due; but that  on  the present occasion, because of heavy withdrawals; the bank had no funds with which to carry on. The representative of the Commonwealth Government, together with representatives  of  the  other  State governments, thereupon agreed to assist New South Wales in this matter, and, accordingly, arrangements were made to float a loan for &#163;28,000,000- instead of &#163;27,000,000 as originally proposed - in order that the Government of New South Wales might borrow &#163;1,000,000 with which to pay the Government Savings Bank of that State. </para>

          <para>I ask honorable members to contrast the attitude of the Commonwealth Government in this matter with that of the Premier of New South Wales. When an appeal was made to the people of Australia to come to the assistance of their country by subscribing to a loan of &#163;28,000,000, every State Premier, with the exception of Mr.Lang, did his best to make the appeal a success. Mr.Lang, however, did nothing, although his State was to receive  an extra &#163;1,000,000 in the event of the loan being successful. Never once during the campaign did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> or any of his Ministers, speak in support of the loan. Indeed, when I went to New South Wales in the interests of the loan, and expected <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> to join me, he had not the courtesy to acknowledge the invitation to do so, nor did he do anything to make the loan a success.  His  attitude to-day is in keeping with his attitude all along towards a Government which has endeavoured to help him. </para>

Undoubtedly the present political propaganda against the Commonwealth Bank is having its effect on the other banks as well, and on our finances generally. The Prime Minister&#39;s statement should, therefore, be broadcast throughout Australia, so that every one may know what is being done. As the Prime Minister has said, circulars  have  been distributed from time to time in which it is stated that the Commonwealth Government should do certain things to help the old depositors. Some pf the statements are unfair and not wholly true. The right honorable gentleman has made it clear that the amount of Commonwealth stock held by the Savings Bank of New South Wales :is .only &#163;3,800,000, and the Commonwealth Bank has already advanced nearly <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5,0003000</inline> to he&#39;p tha State institution. </para>

              <para>- It was a statement supplied by the Commonwealth Bank to the Prime Minister. Certainly the last balance-sheet issued by the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales does not show that the hank holds Commonwealth securities amounting to &#163;30,000,000. </para>

          <para>The chief reason for the .closing of the Savings Bank in New South Wales was want of confidence, the result of political interference with the &#34;bank. The publicity .given to the .amount which had been withdrawn from the bank on &#39;behalf of the State Government and also the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> regarding repudiation of interest led to a run on the bank. Had the Government of New South Wales acted as it should have done, there would have been no talk of its having continually put its hands into the coffers of the bank. </para>
          <para>Some time ago the Commonwealth Bank took over the State Savings Bank of Queensland. There had been a slight run on the State institution; but the moment it was known that the Commonwealth contemplated stepping in, that run stopped. The securities held by the State Savings Bank were taken over by the Commonwealth Bank. Some of them were for long term loans, at low rates of interest. The real danger which threatens our banking system is political interfereence. The moment that politics enters into the control of any banking system, trouble is likely. The banking system of any country is a most delicate thing, and when a collapse occurs it may spread from bank to bank. We <inline font-style="italic">saw</inline> that in <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South Wales. The collapse of the State Savings Bank -was largely responsible for the later collapse of the Primary Producers Bank in that State, and of the Federal Deposits Bank in Brisbane, because it made people think that if a State Government bank was not infallible it was even more possible for the smaller private banks net to be safe and sound. It was not that the people of Queensland, who had deposited money in those institutions, took it out thinking that it would be better in their pockets, but they had before them what had happened in New South Wales, and they knew that people in that State could not get hold of the money Which they had deposited with the bank. People put their money into sav.in irs &#39;banks in the &#39;belief tha.t when they want it -they will be able &#39;to get it; but directly they begin to fear that they will not be able to get it o,n application, confidence is lost, and the banking system suffers. </para>
          <para>One of the chief difficulties about the taking over of the New South Wales Savings Bank by the Commonwealth Bank is the demand of the State that the Rural Credits Department and the Housing Department shall also be taken over. But those departments ,are not parts of a. savings bank. In Queensland they are conducted separately from the general &#39;bank, although Queensland has a department which makes both agricultural advances and advances for the building of homes. &#39; The money is obtained in the same way as in New South Wales, that is, it is part of deposits loaned by the Commonwealth Savings Bank to the departments concerned on long terms; but the business is not conducted as a part of the bank itself. If the Government of New South Wales were willing to negotiate only in respect of the savings bank portion of the bank&#39;s work, there would not be the trouble that there is. The purpose of a savings bank* is to provide a safe deposit for the savings of the people. When one man draws out his money, another puts money in. Year by year the amounts held by depositors in our several savings banks increases, but that does not mean that money is only paid in, and none withdrawn. The business of a savings bank can be conducted satisfactorily only so long as both deposits and withdrawals are made continuously; the moment that deposits cease is the beginning of that slippery slide which leads to the time when every one will draw out and no one will put in any money. No scheme will save the State institution in New South Wales except that which has already been mentioned - an amalgamation with the Commonwealth Bank. I firmly believe that the Commonwealth Bank should be the only savings bank in Australia, because it has a wider range, and can draw on greater supplies than are available to any institution confined to a State. The Primary Producers Bank failed because it appealed to only one section of the community - the people in the country. One severe drought could close its doors. The reason why so many banks have recently closed in the United States of America i3 that their banking system is different from ours, every village having its own local bank, which depends on local funds or on what it can borrow from outside sources, and in a time of difficulty, or local business depression, may be left without supplies. In Australia we have different banks operating right throughout the Commonwealth in every district and town, and dealing with different industries, so that when one industry or district is demanding more money .for its development, another, which is not at the time in need of money, is making deposits. Thus, one industry, and one section, helps other industries and other sections, and the total funds held by the banks are not depleted. But when a bank is confined to one State, as was the case with the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, and that bank is in competition with a Commonwealth institution, its work is localized, and difficulties arise. The destruction of confidence in NewSouth Wales meant that confidence outside the State was lost also, so that there was no one to come to the assistance of the State institution. The Prime Minister has shown how the Commonwealth Bank went to the assistance of the  State  institution. </para>
          <para>There is need for a campaign to educate the people in financial matters. When a country is in the doldrums, as we in Australia are to-day, &#39; and the minds of the people are disturbed, they are ready to accept any nostrum, any scheme which promise, relief. That is why the Lang Government was returned to power in New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> said that he would do this and that, and- the people were prepared to give him a trial. Only after he had been elected did they realize their mistake. The people are still in that state of mind, because of lack of education regarding the real functions of banking, and of the nature of our financial system. If there is a definite and continued run on any bank, it cannot meet the demands made on it. Runs on bank? are due to the fact that the depositors have lost confidence in them. The people should be educated to the fact thai although a bank cannot repay in cash at one time all the money paid into it, the depositors are quite safe because their money has been invested in buildings, in crops, and in other ways, and that there would be no need for panic with sound management. While people realize that the credit is good, and that the amount of cash needed by them for ordinary business purposes is always available, they will have confidence. There should be an immediate amalgamation of the Commonwealth and the New South Wales Government savings banks, in order to help both the old and the new depositors. </para>
          <para class="block">There should also be a publicity campaign for the education of the people, so that they may not believe such statements as are being circulated t&#39;o-day about fancy schemes of finance. Thus more and more should the people be instructed in the work and functions of banking. If only a section of the people had this knowledge it would act as a sound leaven, and keep the masses calm. 1 concur in the statement made on behalf of the Government, and I hope that itwill be broadcast. The old depositors should use their influence with the New South Wales authorities in bringing about the amalgamation I have advocated. </para>

            <para>- In regard to the assistance rendered by the Commonwealth Bank ro the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, about &#163;3,000,000 was advanced against fixed deposits held by the State Savings Bank. Those deposits will become payable to the Commonwealth Bank on maturity, and the debt will then lie liquidated. In regard to &#163;1,250,000, that amount is repayable to the Commonwealth by the State Savings Bank as a prior claim to any other debts owed by the bank. The drawing of treasury-bills to cover the indebtedness of the Government of New South Wales to the Commonwealth Bank in respect of interest, is an ordinary transaction arranged through the Loan Council. If there had been no attempt at default the New South Government&#39;s cash requirements to an equivalent amount would have been covered by treasury bills. </para>

            <para>- Can the Treasurer state whether the National Debt Sinking Fund Commissioners who, I understand, met yesterday, have agreed to permit the use of a certain portion of the fund for the purchase of bonds in order to relieve those persons who need, in order to meet their actual living expenses, some of the money they have invested in Commonwealth loans? In short, did the commission agree to the proposals put forward in this chamber by the Treasurer on Tuesday last ? </para>

            <para>- The National Debt Sinking Fund Commission had before it my recommendation that a certain proportion of the accruing sinking fund payments should be used to enable the Commonwealth Treasury to make an arrangement with the Commonwealth Bank to meet cases of hardship in connexion with the loan conversion operations. Having considered the matter, the commission agreed to allocate &#163;2,000,000 of the accruing funds of the present financial year for the purpose indicated, subject, however, to Parliament inserting  a  suitable provision in the bill now before it, authorizing the commission to acquire the bonds at par value. </para>

            <para>- The Premier of New South Wales informed an audience in Sydney a few days ago that one nation after another had abandoned the gold standard. I desire to know whether that statement is correct, and,- if so, which nations have departed from the gold standard. Have Great Britain and Australia done so? Is the fact that Australian notes are at a discount proof that the gold standard has been abandoned? Is it possible to abolish the gold standard before another standard has been agreed upon to take its place? </para>

            <para>- Although the statement is often made, it is not quite correct to say that either Great Britain or Australia ha3 abandoned the gold standard ; it would be more accurate to say that we have departed from gold parity in regard to our currency. So far as I know, not one of the nations that were recently on the gold standard has abandoned it, nor, in my opinion, can that  be done until some other standard has been substituted for it. Great Britain may probably resort ultimately to the devaluation of the pound rather than to the abandonment of r.he gold standard. </para>

            <para>- I gather by reference to the Senate notice-paper that it is intended to submit there a motion for the disallowance of the regulations referred t.o. Although it is not usual to outline Government policy in answer to a question, I think that I may say, with perfect safety and certainty, that the regulations, if disallowed, will be immediately re-gazetted, in order to give continuity to the policy of the Government in regard to work on the waterfront. The honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Martens)</inline> is particularly interested in the northern ports of Australia. At the port of Brisbane completely harmonious relations have been established, and I am in negotiation with the ship-owners and members of the Waterside Workers Federation in connexion with the conditions at other ports. The harassing interference on the part of another place is merely mischievous and disturbing. </para>

            <para>- For obvious reasons, it has not been customary to publish either the names of dissenters or the reasons actuating them in. declining to convert their holdings. We have not published the names of either those converting or those dissenting, without the permission of the persons concerned, and 1 think that it would be undesirable to depart from that practice. The honorable member has asked ti question regarding a public institution. 1 think that some reference was made in New South Wales by representatives of the State Government to its intention to dissent in regard to the stock mentioned, but the information was not disclosed by the Commonwealth Treasury. The loan that matured on the 10th August, the day on which the conversion loan was launched, was due by the New South Wales Government on securities held by the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that that inference can be drawn from dic present position of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. It cannot be contended that the disaster that lias overtaken that institution is attributable to the form of government control to which the honorable member has referred. As a matter of fact, the suggestion has been made by all earnest persons who are looking for a solution of the problem that an amalgamation should take place between the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Bank, and the latter bank is controlled by a board of directors appointed by the Government. </para>

As a matter of fact, until quite recently Australia was unable to produce sufficient rice to meet her own requirements, and even now her export of rice is negligible. I know that at the wool sales in Sydney yesterday. French representatives were very active buyers, and I am glad of it. </para>

            <para>. - The urgency of this matter, which I have brought before the House  on  many other occasions, has impressed me with the need for moving the adjournment of the House in order that it may be discussed. The recent rise in the price  of  silver has reduced the possible profit which the Government might make out of the minting of silver. When I first raised this matter last year, silver was only ls. an oz., and at that price a profit of  450  per cent, could he made on silver currency, less the cost of minting. At present, with  the price of silver at1s.6d. an oz., a profit of 266 per cent. could still be made. I n 1914, just after the outbreak of war, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> L. Baillieu, after several conferences of the silver interests of Australia, offered <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> the then Prime Minister, the entire silver, lead and zinc output of the mines at the English selling price prior to the war, less 30 per cent. Had Andrew Fisher been wise enough to accept that offer, Australia would have made a profit of over &#163;200,000,000 which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baillieu</inline> has pointed out, might have prevented the present economic depression. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>During the trouble on the coal-fields of Newcastle, when there was great distress among the miners, it occurred to me that, by using silver as currency, the Government would be able to make sufficient profit to render to the miners the assistance they needed. At that time certain promises were made to the miners which, unfortunately, could not be kept, although they, out of their small savings, contributed &#163;1,000 towards carrying on the political fight which returned the present Labour Government with the biggest majority enjoyed by any party since federation. Those miners are suffering still. At that time silver was at the lowest price in the history of the world, namely1s.an oz. As honorable members may be aware, every ounce of silver will coin into 5s. 6d. worth of currency. What business man in Australia would refuse to embark upon an enterprise which would return him a profit of 450 per cent.? Yet that is what the Government could have made out of minting silver when its price was1s. an oz. Although it was unanimously decided at the caucus meeting to adopt my proposal, the matter was left, at my suggestion, to the consideration of the Government, and the Government, apparently, has been considering it ever since. I do not wish the price of silver to remain always at a low level; but the Government should seize the present opportunity before it passes. </para>
          <para>I have communicated with the Premiers of all the States of Australia regarding this matter, and have received from them favorable replies. My calculations were based upon a selling price for silver of1s. an oz., and, although it is dearer now, 1 am certain that the mining interests would be glad to accept from the Government less than the market price, seeing that they would be saved freight and insurance charges, &#38;c. At1s. anoz. &#163;1,000,000 worth of silver would mint into &#163;5,500,000 worth of currency. Never in the history of Australia has a worker man or woman, refused to accept wager in silver. My suggestion was that the new silver currency should be lent to the various State governments at 2 per cent., in order to provide employment This would be equivalent to a return of 11 per cent. to the Commonwealth Government, and the State governments, in turn, would lend the money to municipalities, shires and boroughs, which would furnish the actual employment. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mitchell, Premier of Western Australia, is by no means a Labour supporter, but he is a keen financier, and he informed me that he would be very pleased to borrow money at 2 per cent. in order to relieve unemployment. All the other Premiers have expressed their appreciation of my suggestion ; they have not promised anything, but the Premier of New South Wales stated definitely that if his Government had the power of minting - of which it has been deprived -he would commence minting silver immediately. Just imagine what the currency minted from &#163;1,000,000 worth of silver would have meant to the Government Savings Bank - that institution which,in my opinion, should never have been allowed to close its doors! The bank would have had &#163;5,500,000 in coin to pay away to its depositors, who, I am certain, would not have refused to take silver. And why ? Because, after gold, which is recognized throughout the world as the most acceptable form of currency, silver comet next. If it were possible suddenly to remove either all the gold currency or all the silver currency from the world, much less distress would be caused by removing the gold currency. Only Great Britain. Ireland, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia base their currency on gold. Every European nation, every Eastern nation, as well as the United States of America, base their currency on silver. When the money powers of the world enthroned the gold standard, they sentencedevery third man, woman and child in the world to poverty and misery. I am including in my reckoning the massed millions of the East, in China, India, Japan, and the Straits Settlements. New South Wales is justly described as the silver State of the Commonwealth, but a great many of her miners are now out of work. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book,</inline> out of 5,589 miners, 56 per cent, were unemployed in 1930. </para>
          <para>In 1920 the English people were beginning to doubt the value of their fiduciary currency, which had reached the total of &#163;300,000,000. Silver at that time was at the highest price it has ever been ; it paid to melt down silver coins for their metal content. I have here a silver halfcrown minted in 1920, but only 500 parts out of 1,000 are pure silver, and I have here an Australian coin, of which 925 parts out of 1,000 parts are pure silver. England reduced the silver content of her coins until it fell below what it had been at any time since tho reign of Edward the Confessor, with the exception of tho 37th year of the reign of Henry VIII. Whereas &#163;1,000,000 worth of silver at ls. an oz. will mint into &#163;5,500,000 worth of currency in Australia to-day, it would mint &#163;9,175,000 worth in England, according to the silver content of English coins. </para>
          <para>The average cost of minting should not be added to the overhead charges of Issuing silver currency. The overhead charge of minting goes on whether the mint is working at full speed or not. Therefore, minting charges should he reckoned only as the difference between the ordinary overhead charges, and the actual cost of minting when the institution is in full swing. The profits which would be derived from the coining of silver could also be employed for assisting distressed farmers. An appeal was made to the -farmers, not only by the Government and its supporters, but by honorable members from all parts of the House, to grow more wheat. In that way this country was to be helped out of its difficulties. That slogan was broadcast throughout the length and breadth of Australia and the farmers nobly answered the call. What happened? This Government, in an endeavour to honour its promises, sent the Wheat Marketing Bill to another place, which promptly rejected it. I maintain that the Government should not have stopped at that ; it should have taken this House into its confidence, and said definitely that it would help the farmers, despite the opposition in another place. I have with me an attache case full of letters and newspaper cuttings sent to me from all over Australia by farmers and students of finance, &#38;c, supporting my plan, and these are only a part of what I have received. The Government could have assisted them by giving them 4s. in silver for every bushel of wheat that they produced. No farmer would have refused that form Of payment. What would the minting of four shillings cost the Government? If ls. worth of silver would make 5s. 6d. worth of silver coin, the actual cost to the Government of four silver shillings would be less than 9d. The wheat could have been sent to England and sold at 2s. a bushel, leaving this Government with a profit of ls. 3d. a bushel. Had 100,000,000 bushels of wheat been sold at 2s. a bushel, the Government would have received &#163;10,000,000, plus &#163;3,000,000 in exchange; or a total of &#163;13,000,000. That would have been a very useful sum to this Government. In answer to a question by the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tully)</inline> the other day, the Treasurer stated that it now costs &#163;167 to send &#163;100 to the United States of America. The &#163;13,000,000 which the Government would have received from the sale of wheat in England, had it adopted my suggestion, would have realized a profit of &#163;9,000,000. That sum, if sent to the United States of America, would have obviated the tremendous exchange rate, which is to-day crucifying this country. I have shown clearly that the Government, out of the profits of minting silver, could have paid the farmers 4s. for every bushel of wheat produced hy them. Had that been done, the Government would have honoured its promise to the primary producers, which I consider has now been broken. </para>
          <para>I come now to wool. Recently I asked the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Killen)</inline> what would be a fair average price for wool, and he told me that ls. 3d. per lb. would be satisfactory. I said, &#34;How about ls. 6d. a lb.?&#34; He replied &#34; The farmers would bless you or any one else who could guarantee them an average price of1s.6d. per lb.&#34;  I  do not know of any farmer who would refuse to accept in silver currency1s. 6d. per lb. for his wool. The sum of1s. 6d. in silver coin is equal to 3 3-lld., which is the actual cost to the Government. Therefore, we could have paid the wool producers1s. 6d. per lb. for their wool, and sold it in England at 9d. per lb. and made a profit of 5d. per lb. Had that been done, all concerned would have been satisfied. Let me point out that &#163;4,000,000 worth of silver at1s. per oz. will mint &#163;22,000,000 worth of silver currency. It must be remembered that the chief overhead expenses continue whether the mint is fully or partly occupied, therefore, the cost of minting should be based upon the difference between the overhead cost and the extra cost when the mint is in full swing. Some people say that paper money is cheaper and better, and returns a greater profit. If that is so. why did England in 1920 increase its silver currency? It was because the people there were becoming nervous about the enormous increase in the fiduciary note issue. The more silver we mint the more credit there will be for our note issue. Then suppose that of two men living in different houses, one held &#163;100 in notes, and the other &#163;100 in silver. If both houses were burnt down, the notes would be destroyed and their value lost, but the weight of the silver would remain, and if the owner could prove that he had withdrawn &#163;100 worth of silver from his bank an honest government would he justified  in  paying him the face value of the coins. Another advantage of silver is that it is the second bust money in the world. At the end of 1928 New South Wales had produced over &#163;142,116,291 worth of silver. I venture  to  say that had that State been able to obta in the permission of the Government  to  mint its silver, and to pay the profits into its Treasury, the community generally would have been greatly benefited. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Leave to continue given.&#93;</inline></para>

          </list>
          <para class="block">The answer in each instance was in the affirmative. I have to thank the honorable member for Barton for having asked that question, and I feel sure that if the press will give his action sufficient publicity he will receive a great deal of kudos at the hands of his constituents and the people generally. Australia is in difficulties, and we must endeavour to overcome them. By the remonetization of silver in the direction that I have indicated, we could help the miners of New South Wales, 56 per cent. of whom are out of work at Broken Hill alone. That would give some impetus to silver mining, although it is only a byproduct at the present time. I hope that the Government will take action along the lines that I have indicated, and if it has not the courage to mint additional silver, it should, at any rate, permit the States to do so under government supervision. </para>

            <para>. - It is rather singular that honorable members opposite, who pride themselves on being exponents of finance, are not able to enlighten the people of Australia on the subject of bimetallism, or the advisability of increasing the silver currency. The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> deserves recognition for the pertinacity with which he has put this matter before the people of Australia.The Government has said that it wouldbe delighted to know of any remedy that would assist in overcoming Australia&#39;s difficulties. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;Ido</inline> not say that the Government, because it has failed to increase the silver currency, has injured the financial stability of Australia. I do not agree with the honorable member for Melbourne that an increased silver currency would be the solution of our financial problems. There are other ways in which we could bring that about with much greater benefit to Australia. All the currency we need can be made of paper, which is much cheaper than silver. There is nothing wrong, ifwe wish to make money plentiful, with putting 5s. or even 2s. 6d. worth of gold into a sovereign, and making it legal as a currency of 20s. sterling. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for &#34;Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> is evidently eager for enlightenment. He has a keen understanding of most subjects, but not of bimetallism or tri.metallism. I realize that he, too, may have been misled by the honorable member for Melbourne. In Australia a &#163;1 note represents 20s., and it is cheaper to print more notes than, to increase the silver currency. There is no need to abandon paper currency. Money may be anything. During my business career I have had to handle paper money hearing the signature of private citizens, and it has never failed me. Some of them could hardly write their own names. In many cases the signature could not, be deciphered; yet I have accepted their cheques, and so have the banks. That form of currency has been in existence for years, and it will serve to meet our future needs. The difficulty with this Government is, not that it has no money, but that it is not making money available. Tens of millions of money is locked up in the vaults of our banks. It should put more paper money into circulation. If a person takes gilt-edged securities to the Commonwealth Bank, and obtains on them overdrafts of &#163;20,000, the moment that sum is transferred to his banking account the money is made available. That man&#39;s purchasing power is immediately increased by &#163;20,000 which did not exist before the transaction took place. Whence did the money come? It is clear that credit, which is purchasing power, is just a book entry. If the Senate would pass the necessary legislation for the reform of the banking system nothing more would be required. Give to the hundreds of thousands of business men and farmers a chance to get advances from the banks on gilt-edged securities, and we shall need neither silver nor gold* This city of Canberra was not built ou&#163; of an abundance of silver and gold ; it was financed by book-entry credits; the* men who worked on the job accepted&#39; cheques for their services. The country requires an extension of credit and the reform of banking so that &#163;3,000,000,000 worth of assets will not be regarded as valueless security for the credits which are essential to the development of Australia. Many men with &#163;20,000 worth of property have not &#163;100 worth of purchasing power, solely because the banking system has destroyed their credit. The Government is not blameworthy for not taking more notice of the advocacy by the honorable member fo-r Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> of silver currency. </para>

This Parliament is hampered because it does not control the Commonwealth Bank. The remedy is for the people to agree to an alteration of the banking system. </para>

              <para>- I doubt if the newspapers are capable of educating the public. They are more concerned with protecting the interests of the shareholders in banks and other financial institutions. They represent interests that are opposed to the true welfare of the country. One reading the conservative newspapers would imagine that the Labour party in this Parliament has no other monetary policy than the printing of notes. That is the result of the propaganda of our newspaper enemies, who are trying to make the people believe that we are in favour of inflation. </para>

            <para>. - I ask the Minister to agree to re-submit the schedule so that stud stock may be removed from paragraph 2 of the schedule, in. which the duties are 4 per cent., to paragraph 1, containing the list of exemptions. I desired to have that done on &#34;Wednesday night, but was ruled out of order. I now propose this alteration on the broad ground that the improvement of our flocks and herds is essential to the development and prosperity &#176;f our people. To a large extent Australia is dependent on stock-breeding. During the present depression, stud masters are at a particular disadvantage, and there is no immediate prospect of conditions improving. No body of specialists in primary production, is doing more useful work than those stud masters who are working to maintain and improve the standards of our flocks and herds. Any obstacle to these endeavours must operate to the serious detriment of the country. For the maintenance of proper  standards,  regular supplies of imported stock should bc available. Primage duty will press heavily on those stud masters who, after experiencing year&#39;s of drought, are suffering further from the general depression. The concession I am suggesting would not  involve  any substantial loss of revenue, but would be of considerable relief to individual stock-breeders. The duty proposed by the Government will hamper their operations, and sprag the wheels of progress in an important branch of primary production. </para>

            <para>. - Representing a. primary producing district, the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> naturally takes a very keen interest in the primage duty on stud stock. A deputation of stud masters waited upon me to urge that stud stock should be exempt from primage duty. It is already free of import duty; rightly so, &#39;because it is of the utmost importance to Australia that stud masters should be able to introduce the best stock from all parts of the world at low cost. Realizing this, the Government, when increasing the general primage duty to 10 per cent., decided to allow the impost on stud stock to remain at 4 per cent. I do not admit that the burden on stud masters is as heavy- as the honorable member for Darling Downs has said. There are many breeders in Australia who are able to supply, for the time being, at any rate, stud beasts from their own flocks and herds. Any stud master who is not satisfied with the stock available in Australia, and desires to import, will have to pay primage duty at the rate of 4 per cent. But for the financial stringency, the Government would have removed altogether the primage duty from stud stock; in the circumstances, the best it could do was not. to increase it. </para>

              <para>- If little duty is paid, the tax cannot be the burden on stud masters that it is represented to be. When I informed the deputation of stud masters (hat the duty would be left at 4 per cent., instead of being increased to 10 per cent., 1 understood that they were satisfied that that, was n fair compromise. The Government would gladly remove all primage duties, but if it did so it could not raise the new revenue to which it is pledged under the Melbourne conference plan, and if individual items are to be exempt, there are hundreds in respect of which the claims are more urgent than are those in respect of stud stock. </para>

              <para>- I do not. agree with that statement. Because of the prevailing depression, the market is poor, and the importation of stud stock is not very great. However, it might develop into a substantial item. After careful consideration, the Government has decided that at present it cannot go further than to bring stud stock under the 4 per cent, instead of the 10 per cent. rate. If such stock were admitted duty free, the door would be open to numerous requests from other persons, who could put up just as good an argument as the stud masters, the majority of whom are- wealthy individuals who dispose of their stock to the smaller men. The matter will, however, he reconsidered later. </para>

            <para>. - I wish to make a few remarks on this subject, on which I refrained from speaking last Wednesday night owing to the lateness of the hour. I believe that the imposition of these duties will very largely fail to achieve the purpose of the Government, which is to raise additional revenue. If we in Australia had a low tariff policy, and the bulk of our goods came in free, or on a low scale of duties, a 10 per cent. primage would very substantially increase our revenue. But, to impose a 10 per cent. primage on top of our already high duties, will have the effect of reducing, rather than of increasing, revenue. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This 10 per cent. primage will be imposed on all goods, except goods especially exempted. It will be imposed on goods that are already highly protected, and on goods that are otherwise free; goods that in many cases are the raw materials used by our manufacturers. When imposed on goods that are already highly protected, it may prove to be the last straw in preventing their importation, thereby reducing, rather than increasing, the amount of revenue collected. Again, the imposition of these primage duties on essential imports, some of them otherwise free, will have the very bad&#39; effect, that it will rake costs of production and of living. By the mode of its imposition, this duty is really 11 per cent. instead of 10 per cent., and, when charged on raw materials, it may grow to be 25 per cent., 30 per cent., or even more, by the time the goods reach the hands of the consumer. A profit on the tax will be imposed in each case as the goods pass through the hands of the manufacturers, merchants, and retailers, so that the original amount of primage will be almost lost sight of in the tremendous increase that will result. There is also a protective incidence in connexion with this primage tax which will add considerably to the protection already enjoyed by local manufacturers generally, and will add to their opportunities for increasing prices. I do not suggest that in all cases they will take advantage of this opportunity, but it will be there. The amount of revenue that will go into the Treasury will be small compared with the amount that will be extracted from the consumer. </para>
          <para>Although designed to provide revenue, this tax is very much worse than the sales tax, so far as its effectiveness with respect to additional revenue going into the </para>
          <para class="block">Treasury and extra costs upon the consumerare concerned.Although the sales tax is most unpopular andcomplicated,  at  least thismuchcanbe said of it that  it  is imposed on all goods, with few exceptions, whether they are produced locally or imported.Its basisis broader than that of theprimage tax, which applies onlyto importations. Further,  itis  imposed at the very laststage when  it  would bepracticable to apply  it,  when the ultimate wholesale transaction takes place. Therefore, the opportunities to increase  it  beforeit reaches the consumer are not nearly so great as  is  the case with the primage tax, which, as its name implies, is imposed when the goods reach Australia, and is multiplied many times before they reach the consumer. </para>
          <para>I regard the primage tax as a pernicious impost. It will fail of its purposetoa great extent, defeat its own object, and increase the costs of production and living at a most inopportune time. The Government would be doing the country more service  ifit  were to abolish the tax instead of foisting upon a community a burden that itcan ill affordto bear. </para>

          <para>Mr.McGRATH. - Yes. The reduction of the excise would have a dual effect; it would increase the consumption of local stout, and increase the revenue. The arrangement entered into with Guinness&#39;s was made in order to assist the hopgrowing industry of Tasmania. The heavy excise duty of 2s. a gallon has militatedagainst the hop-growing industry in this country. Guinness&#39;s would have no ground for complaint ifthe exciseduty were reduced, as suggested. Although that firm has been granted certain concessions, the brewersof Australia have not complained. They could make greater profits by using imported hops, obtainable at 6d. perlb. less than theypay for locally grown hops;but they have beenloyal to the Australian hop-growing industry. The arrangement enteredinto with Guinness&#39;s ensured a market for our surplus production of hops last year, but it may be that next year the company will not require any Australian hops. </para>

The Bruce-Page Government increased the excise duty to 2s. a gallon. In December, 1929, the present Government reduced it to1s.10d. a gallon; but later, for financial reasons, it was again raised to 2s. a gallon. I am afraid that if the excise duty on stout were reduced, there would immediately begin an agitation to reduce the duty on beer. It would be urged that the workers of Australia should not be penalized by having to pay a higher duty on beer than on stout. </para>

              <para>- That was the last year before the imposition of the restrictions. The present duty on stout, imported in bulk, is, British, 3s. a gallon; intermediate, 3s. 3d.; and general, 4s. 6d., while bottled stout is dutiable at 3s. 6d., 3s. 9d., and 6s. 6d. a gallon respectively. Generally, the higher rates apply to all imported stout, because it nearly all comes here in bottles. The special duty adds 50 per cent. to those charges, the higher rate having been imposed in accordance with the plan to restrict imports. It was only after very strong representations had been made by Tasmanian members, particularly the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost),</inline> in whose district practically all the hops grown in Tasmania are produced, that the Government decided to lift the surcharge and rationing on imported stout. Action was not taken until its possible effect on the Australian stout-making industry was considered. The surcharge and the rationing enabled us to dispose of the surplus stocks of hops, comprising 2,500 bales of the 1930 crop, and 1,500 bales of the 1931 crop, and, in addition, 1,000 bales per annum from 1933 onwards at world parity prices. That meant that &#163;57,000 in Australian currency was given to the Australian hop-growing industry, prac tically all of which went to one small district in Tasmania. I realize that the Australian breweries are the best market for Australian hops, and that we should give adequate protection to Australian brewers against importations of ale, beer, and stout from other countries. I understand that they are quite satisfied with the existing protection. </para>

              <para>- The new arrangement came into operation so recently that I have not yet had any advice; but I understand that no big importations of stout have been made recently, or are likely to be made because of the exchange position. The honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> said that there would be no loss of revenue to the Commonwealth  if  the excise were reduced  by  6d. a gallon. That is problematical. The experience of the Customs Department is that a reduction of excise has always led to a reduction of revenue, and I am afraid that any reduction now would have the same effect. Although I appreciate the strong case made out by the honorablemember for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath),</inline> I regret that the Government cannot accept his suggestion. </para>

          <para>Mr.BERNARDCORSER.-  Yes, the amendment will have theeffect ofcheck- ing the imposition onthepublic of what is known as &#34; snake juice &#34;. In any tariff alteration, we should try to do  as  little in  jury  as possible to existing institutions, and for that reason I have moved that the maturing period be three years, not five years.Had I not taken into con- sideration the interests of a few of the smaller companies in Australia, I would have suggested a period of five years. For various reasons, the Australian public has registered its approval of the period of three years. An act has been passed by the Western Australian Legislature prohibiting the sale in that State of whisky that has not been matured for threeyears. An opportunity of amending the excise tariff is presented only about once in ten years, and the committee, in the interests of the community, should effect the reform suggested in my amendment. &#39;The alteration would not inconvenience thelocal whisky distillers. While the public interest and the public health are to be considered above the interests of the local producers, it is satisfactorytoknow that the amendment would do no injury to the manufacturers concerned. If we producean Australian whisky that is well matured, there will be increased consumption of the local article, and that will assist primary producers such as barley-growers. The maize-growers willalso benefit by the increased consumption of Australian whisky, and the illicit still operators will find it harder to obtain a market for their wares.We know that at the present time a largequantityof &#34;fire water&#34; from illicit stills is being sold, and I am sure that the Ministerwillwelcomeanything which will help him to deal with the problem.If ourlocally-manufac- turedwhisky were not released until it had been matured for three years, it wouldso far surpass in flavour anything which could beproduced from illicit stills that there would belittle or no market for the illicit article . A period of three years is more reasonable than one of five, havingregard to the interests of the small distilleries. The alteration would benefit the public and the primary producers, and would not injure any one. </para>

            <para>.- I support the amendment, but desire to give notice of a furtheramendment of the same item.If people will drink spirits, it is desirable that weshoulddo all we can to insure thatthey get spirits of the hostquality. I am sure,therefore, that the amendmentwill meet withthegeneral approval ofhonorable members. My amendment is for the purpose of removing the discriminatory duty of 5s. per gallon on spirits not bottled in bond. I mention the matter now so that the question may be framed in such a way that, in the event of this amendment being carried, it will not exclude a further amendment to give effect to what I have indicated. </para>

            <para>. - I support the amendment. The longer whisky is kept in bond the &#39;better it is. We must consider the health of the public, and whisky that has not been properly matured is harmful to health. I have no interest in the liquor industry myself, but we all know that properly matured whisky is more palatable and less likely to injure the consumer than raw spirit. The Government would not lose any revenue if the period of maturity were extended to three years, and the public would benefit. </para>

            <para>.- This amendment might well have been moved by the Minister for Trade and Customs himself, or by his colleague, the Minister for Health. The honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> has pointed out that the change provided for in his amendment would benefit the health, if not of the whole community, at least of that section of it which drinks whisky. We in Australia have long prided ourselves on the &#39;steps which we have taken  to safeguard and improve the health of our people. We have boasted, for instance, that our factory legislation is the best in the world. One may well ask how it is that, we have lagged behind other parts of the world in regard to regulations governing the sale of whisky. The honorable member for Wide Bay quoted a number of countries in which the period during which whisky has to be kept in bond exceeds that in Australia. Canada, is the only leading country in the world where whisky which has not been matured for three years may he placed on the market. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lewis),</inline> who is an ardent prohibitionist, has put forward the suggestion that the demand for Canadian whisky from the United States of America is so great that the authorities do not insist upon its being properly matured. I cannot say how true that is. We have lagged behind in Australia for the reason that until recently we have not been a whisky-producing country. We had a similar experience with regard to lager up to, and including, the year 1914. Until then by far the greater quantity of bottled beer and lager consumed in Australia was imported. The ships of the Nord Deutcher line used to visit Australia regularly, and their holds contained large quantities of pilsener, munich, bock, and other light beers, for consumption here. The war taught us that we could make lager in Australia equal to anything manufactured abroad, and at the present time most of the lager consumed in Australia is locally made. The result is that there has been an increased demand for a section of our primary produce. When the figures relating to the importation into Australia of lager and light beer were put into my hands, my interest in the subject was aroused, and I went to the library, where I consulted the <inline font-style="italic">Canadian Y ear-Booh.</inline> I found that, as a result of the increased demand for Canadian whisky, the distilleries there consumed last year no less than 4,000,000 bushels of grain. If the Minister accepts this amendment, as I feel sure he should, we shall be able so to improve our locally-manufactured whisky that the public will not desire to drink the imported product. At the present time the public is not satisfied with Australian whisky. There is no more discriminating consumer than the whisky drinker. Honorable members know that in every city in Australia whisky drinkers will take their patronage from one hotel to another in order to obtain spirit which is true to label. The chief object of this amendment is to improve the standard of the whisky manufactured in Australia. I am sure that the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lewis)</inline> will agree with me that if we  aTe  to consume whisky in this country it ought to he Australian whisky, the making of which provides employment for Australian workmen, and a  nae  for Australian primary produce. By improving the standard of Australian whisky we shall not only increase its market in Australia, but find for it fresh  markets in the East. That is whyI said that the Minister for Customs himself might well have moved this amendment. The Minister, right throughout the defence of the tariff schedule, has taken the stand that the granting of increased protection would develop and promote the efficiency of Australian industries. I need quote only a few examples to show that, where Australian industries have proved really efficient, the public have supported them most generously. For example, 95 per cent. of the boots and shoes consumed in Australia are of Australian manufacture. Why? Because the price is right, and the quality is right. Of the rugs and blankets used 93 per cent. or 94 per cent. are locally made, again because the price and quality are right. Nearly 99 per cent. of the soaps used in Australia are made here ; no one can complain of their quality; no one can complain of the price. Similarly, practically all the sauces and pickles used in Australia are now made here. At one time we imported large quantities of pickles made by Crosse &#38; Blackwell and Morton, but we ore now satisfied with our own product. We cannot induce the public to consume Australian whisky unless the quality is satisfactory. Whisky which has been matured for only two years will not satisfy the public taste. In the interests of the consumers and of the primary producers, I urge the Minister to extend the period to three years. This will work injustice on none, and confer a benefit on many. </para>

              <para>- I shall ask the board to treat this as an urgent matter. The two years&#39; term was fixed on the advice of the trade and of experts at the time, and although it has been stated that certain countries favour a three-years&#39; period of storage in wood, Canada has adopted a two-years&#39; period. In 1906 the experts considered that a two-years&#39; period was sufficient. Since then no representations have been made for an alteration in the period, and no evidence has been forthcoming as to the necessity for any change. This proposed amendment was put in my hands a clay or two ago, and neither the department nor myself have had time to examine it thoroughly. In those circumstances we do not feel inclined to accept it. If this amendment were accepted, section 12 of the Spirits Act would have to be altered, because it would have to apply to imported whisky as well as to Australian-made whisky. Therefore, the question whether it should apply as well to Australian brandy and rum would also have to be considered. No maturity con dition is imposed on gin, because it does not contain the natural ingredients which occur in brandy, whisky, and rum, and necessitate the spirit being matured. In the case of whisky, brandy, and rum, the spirit or part of the spirit used is distilled at a comparatively low strength in order to retain those elements in the materials which give the characteristic flavour of brandy, whisky, or rum as the case may be. It is the presence of these elements in the spirit which necessitates maturing. The Government considers that the Tariff Board should make an investigation so as to determine whether the condition of maturity should apply to brandy and rum as well as to whisky. </para>

              <para>- Yes. Western Australia insists upon a period of maturity of three years. In the other States the period is two years. If the period is fixed at. three years, we will prevent Milne&#39;s from selling for a year, and we will render more difficult the establishment of new distilleries to compete with the large distilleries which are able to carry large stocks, and to mature them for three years. In other words, the Opposition, from which the amendment came, favours the monopoly in this case as against the small man. The Government desires all sections of the trade to have an opportunity to express their views in public before the Tariff Board, and I assure honorable members thatevery consideration will be given to the board&#39;s recommendation. </para>

          <para>Milne&#39;s or any other small distillery, but for the public health. We do not want in the spirit trade the position that existed in the wine trade when unmatured wine, known as &#34;pinkie,&#34; was placed on the market, and caused all sorts of disorders both mental and physical. I am a whisky drinker, and I have never heard of Milne&#39;s whisky. I do not care to drink whisky that has been matured for only two years. I should not like to have it in my home to offer to my guests. I suggest to the Minister that in referring this proposal to the Tariff Board, he is shelving his responsibility. During the tariff debate he adopted in some instances the recommendation of the Tariff Board, and in other instances rejected it. This is one of the occasions on which I would urge him to accept the decision of the committee. The health of the community must be safeguarded, and we can do that to some extent by increasing the maturing period of whisky spirit stored in wood to three years. </para>

              <para>- At that time the members of a commission recommended that a period of two years was sufficient for whisky to be matured in wooden vessels. We.are now asked to abide by that recommendation. I have no brief for any manufacturer. This proposal affects the public health. No whisky drinker would consume whisky knowing that it had been matured for only two years. No spirit manufacturer in Australia will benefit financially if this amendment is accepted. Its object is to improve the quality of the whisky on the Australian market. I cannot understand why the Minister does not, without further discussion, accept the amendment and make the period of maturity three years. He has given no reason for accepting the request of the small distillers to fix the period of maturity at two years. </para>

            <para>. - The Minister has raised no argument against the amendment. He has not said that he disagrees with it. He has merely stated that the amendment, if accepted, would have to apply to imported whisky, but let me point out that whisky imported here would probably have been matured for three years. In Great Britain whisky is not allowed to be sold unless it has matured for three years, and, therefore, by the time it arrives here it must have reached the required maturity. We should not agree to a period of two years just because an old act which the Minister has dug up prescribes it. I sincerely hope that ho will accept the amendment. </para>

            <para>.- I regret that the House is called upon to deal with a measure of this character. The origin of the debt conversion plan was a financial position so desperate that it was perfectly clear to all who examined it that every section of the community would be called upon to make some financial sacrifice. Those of us who had to face the facts as far back as the Premiers Conference of August 1930, recognized that investors in government stock, in common with others, would have to forego something; the interest burden of the Governments would have to be reduced in order that relief might be given to the taxpayers generally. When, subsequently, definite sacrifices were imposed by Parliament upon taxpayers, old-age and invalid pensioners, war pensioners, and the public servants of the Commonwealth and the States, the fact became increasingly obvious that those who were receiving interest from the Governments of Australia, would have to accept less than they had hitherto received. Before the Prime Minister left for Great Britain, I advocated at the Premiers Conference in </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>August, 1930, that steps in that direction should be taken. The plans considered by the Federal and State Ministers in conference in May and June of this year included a proposal for the conversion of  the  public debt, and, then, for the first time, the application of compulsion was advocated. The conference was agreed that the reduction of the interest burden was essential, that it could be achieved  only  by conversion, and t&#39;hat the conversion -must be compulsory. At that stage, the Leaders of the Opposition in the -Senate .and the -House of Representatives were inn-ted to confer with the Federal a-nfl &#39;State Ministers. </para>

              <para>- The relative merits of compulsory and voluntary conversion were being discussed when the Leaders of the Opposition were admitted to the conference. &#34;We strongly advocated -thi.&#39; adoption of the- voluntary principle, expressing our conviction that the &#39;bond holders, who are mainly representative taxpayers and citizens, would, if property appealed to, come to the assistance of the Commonwealth and the, States. Sub-  sequent to our intervention, the con&#39;ference adopted the principle of voluntary conversion, and the result of .the appeal to the conn try amply justified our faith. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> has said that the response .by bondholders was &#187; wonderful achievement, and I feel sure that the proposal now put forward - not by this Government -alone, -but by all the Governments of Australia - will do much to mar the remarkable success of the Conversion  appeal. </para>

              <para>- That makes the position to-day still more difficult. When the conference adopted the voluntary plan, there was no intention that compulsion should be applied to those who dissented ; but some reduction in the interest return by taxation might have been contemplated. The Treasurer was right in emphasizing &#39;that many who freely and cheerfully converted, might well have held back and waited for automatic conversion. But -one of the most striking features -of a wonderful achievement -was that, of the &#163;557,000,000 involved, &#163;510j000,000 was converted with <inline font-style="italic">tha</inline> direct and positive consent of nearly 250,000 holders. The legislation now proposed will destroy some of the benefits that  otherwise  .would be derived from that achievement, and ii is a pity that the bill has, been introduced. </para>

Nevertheless, according to the figures quoted by the Treasurer, 2,700 of those who had dissented, holding &#163;2,565,000 worth of stock, changed their minds. The Treasurer stated that the small percentage of dissentients vindicated the voluntary appeal. No other policy would have been justified. Morally, and patriotically, the right and only practicable course was that which the conference adopted. Therefore, I regret the bill now before the House. I am not perturbed about the interests of the dissenting individuals and  institutions  My concern is that the Government is committing a breach of contract. </para>

          <para>A breach of contract on the part of the governments of Australia must inevitably have the effect of depreciating the value of the security held by those who converted. It must make for the destruction of confidence, which, in turn, will render it difficult in the future for governments to raise money by loans. It will not be very many years before the first maturity date of the new securities is reached. Anything that makes it difficult for governments to meet the situation then must depreciate the value of the security then maturing. Therefore, a breach of contract to-day will not only do an injustice to those who found themselves unable to convert, but will &#171;also do a definite injury to those who have converted. During t.h.e course of the Treasurer&#39;s speech the honorable mem ber for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> interjected, &#39; The Government would not have been asked to do more than that&#34;, referring to the Government honouring its compact. The Treasurer replied - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>No, it would not, but a nian may, though asking for no more than the honouring of a compact, be guilty of the grossest selfishness when, by refusing to convert, he fails to accept his proper share of the national sacrifice. &#34;From that it would appear that those who did not convert - and we must put them into one class, because we cannot dis tinguish one from the other, as we do not know the circumstances - have displayed a certain amount of selfishness, which gives the Government justification for breaking its contract. Surely that is a new theory in morals and in legislation. When we raise loans upon the market we deal with certain individuals from whom we borrow money, and with whom we make a contract. Whether any of these is a selfish person who wants his last shilling out of the Government, or is generous enough to take less than the Government offers for his money, make, no difference to the binding nature of the compact into which the Government enters. </para>

              <para>- We are not justified in assuming  selfishness  on the part of these people. I know that the Treasurer has made an unsuccessful effort to obtain an analysis showing those who have converted some portion of their holdings, and have refused to convert the balance. If we could obtain that information it would disclose that there is a large number of such persons. I know of an instance in my own electorate. A man and some members of his family interviewed me, stating that they had invested their money in practically every loan that has been launched in Australia in recent years. They were advising the Treasurer that they desired to convert every holding, except one small amount that fell due in 1931. They were forced to do that because of the present state of their finances. Many others arc similarly situated. Are such to be branded as selfish individuals? I admit that there are a number of selfish people, but that does not justify the Government in breaking the bond into which it entered. </para>

          <para>I know that, in order to soften the blow, the Government is endeavouring to meet necessitous cases. Yet, after all, it merely proposes to give back to these people some portion of their own capital. We are making a virtue of this. It is humiliating for men and women who, throughout their lives have saved with the object of providing for their old age, to be compelled to come, cap in hand, to the Government when their money is due,  explain their circumstances, and plead that some of the savings to which they are legally entitled shall be returned to them. The Government recognizes the injustice of the procedure, and is doing what it can to overcome the difficulty. </para>
          <para>The Treasurer stated that those who criticized the proposal before Parliament should suggest alternatives. The action of the Government has made it very difficult to do so., as it has destroyed confidence. However, the Treasurer himself indicated a solution. The honorable gentleman stated that the sinking fund might be utilized to relieve necessitous cases to the extent of &#163;1,250,000 this year, and &#163;1,000,000 next year.; that if more were required it might be possible to come to some arrangement with the banks about it. To-day the honorable gentleman stated that the sinking fund commissioners are prepared to find &#163;2,000,000 this year instead of &#163;1,250,000. That will ease the position somewhat. The Treasurer pointed out that, under existing conditions, it is impossible to go on the market and raise the &#163;9,600,000 that is unconverted, and that will fall due within the next sixteen months. I recognize that difficulty, and I know its cause. Nobody would be optimistic enough to think that, with legislation such as is before us, it would be of any use to go on the market in the ordinary way. Had a different policy been followed I should have no doubt about the position. I look back to the time when the Commonwealth Government launched its conversion loan in 1930. Then the Treasury was advised by the banks that it was more than doubtful whether the money would be forthcoming. The banks pointed to the market position, and declared that anybody who wanted to invest money in government shares could do so more profitably by buying upon the open market than by investing in the proposed conversion loan. The loan was launched ; an appeal was made to the patriotism of the people, and the loan was oversubscribed to the extent of several million pounds. </para>

          <para>If we could obtain a couple of million pounds each year from the sinking fund, and it is a proper purpose to which to apply that money, it would all go to improve the position. We should then require:, in addition, in the next two financial years, only &#163;5,600,000. It is suggested, and I know there is something behind the suggestion, that, added to what could be obtained from the sinking fund commissioners, assistance might be had from the banks. Why could not the Commonwealth Savings Bank take over some of the smaller holdings of our investors and treat them as deposits. If the bank could not meet the bonds on their due date, it could meet a substantial proportion of them, and pay the rest within a reasonable time. I am confident that if we met the problem fairly, squarely, and honestly, we could obviate the necessity of committing this breach of contract. It is important to re-establish confidence in governments in order to make it easier in future to raise the money needed to meet commitments, particularly having regard to the paying off these debts at maturity. The appreciation of holdings which would follow a restoration of confidence in governments is a matter of great importance. I understand that there is a sum of about &#163;7,000,000 available in various sinking funds. I realize that there are certain commitments for which the Government is morally and legally liable, but I should say - and I speak without the exact figures before me - that there would still be at least &#163;3,000,000 available in each of the next two years. That would leave only about &#163;3,600,000 out of the 69,600,000 to he raised. If the Government were to appeal for that sum, explaining what had been done, there would, in my opinion, be no difficulty in getting itEven that amount-might not be necessary, because I imagine that the banks would be able to find some money. I am prepared to trust the people of Australia to stand up to their obligations. </para>

Investors were invited to convert their holdings into new stock hearing lower rates of interest. There was no hint or threat of compulsion in any shape or form.

              <para>- The draftsmen have accurately set forth the decisions of the conference; I regret that the Government did not scrutinize the wording of clause 3 more carefully before submitting the bill to Parliament. Even if the Parliaments of Australia are committed to the plan, and this thing has to be done, some other words ought to have been used. </para>

              <para>- The clause to which I have referred legalizes default and repudiation. When I was Acting Treasurer, the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> made certain proposals which throughout Australia were described in the press and. elsewhere as repudiation. So strongly did the people feel on the matter that committees were formed all over Australia in opposition to his proposals. What were those proposals? Did the honorable member for Bourke intend that the Governments of Australia should refuse to pay their debts? He did not.  His  proposal was that the repayment of loans should be deferred for twelve months, and that in the meantime the existing rate of interest should be paid. He further proposed that arrangements should be made with the banks to meet necessitous cases. As I have said, his proposal was roundly  condemned. It was regarded as a breach of contract, repudiation of the worst type. As a result of the publicity given to his proposal, pledges were given by all the Governments of Australia when the &#163;28,000,000 loan was launched that they would stand to every part of the new contract. Those pledges were signed by the Premiers of all the States, the representatives of the Commonwealth Government, and many Opposition Leaders. </para>

If the proposal of the honorable member for Bourke was repudiation, a breach of contract, what shall we say of the proposals contained in this measure? I oppose this bill on the same ground that I opposed the proposal of the honorable member for Bourke. I oppose it because I think that it is not only wrong, but particularly foolish. The difficulties which governments will have to face in the future will necessarily be great; but if this measure becomes law those difficulties will be increased one-hundred fold. It will then be almost impossible for any government, either Federal or State, to raise the money necessary to carry out&#39; any reproductive enterprise - the only purpose for which new loan moneys ought to be expended - or to meet our commitments in the future. </para>

            <para>- The point at issue  has  not arisen in other States in an acute form. The report deals exclusively with the complaints in Melbourne, and it serves to emphasize the manner in which the Commonwealth Legislature is hampered through its limited constitutional powers. The people are in the anomalous position of having two legislative authorities, Federal and State, endeavouring to grapple with this problem, neither being able to deal with it effectively. There remains, however, an extensive field over which State legislatures may operate, and which has not yet been touched. I am pleased to note, in that regard, that a bill is now before the Victorian Legislature to deal with the particular matter that I have mentioned. I am glad, also, to learn that the appropriate union is exercising vigilance to see that the awards are being observed. I have only to add that the Government will take the matter up further on fuller consideration of the legislation now awaiting the determination of the Victorian Parliament. </para>

          <para>.- For a considerable time I have been awaiting a favorable opportunity to bring forward a customs case that has been causing considerable concern in South Australia. Some time ago, News Limited, Adelaide, gave an order for a printing press and conveyors from London, and the company has been called upon to pay &#163;917 in customs duty. This matterhas been mentioned from time to time in another place, and although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> has made favorable comment upon it, and has promised to bring the matter before the Cabinet, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has refused to make a refund of any portion of the duty, on the ground that the printing machinery concerned could be manufactured in Australia. I am not sure whether the Minister in another place has taken the matter to the Cabinet; but the position, so far as  I  am aware, remains unchanged. On the 5th August, 1927, News Limited placed an order with a British firm for a complete new press, including conveyors, to be delivered within eight months. On the 12th September, 1 928, the press had been delivered in ten shipments, and on the 15th October, 1928, the conveyors arrived at Port Adelaide. The press and the conveyors, of course, were placed in bond. On the 23rd June, 1930, News Limited paid under protest &#163;916 in duty. On the 16th July, 1930, the matter was taken up with the Customs Department, which replied that Scott and Company Proprietary Limited were manufacturing machines of this nature at the date of the importation. On the 28th July, a reply was sent to the department that Scott and Company, who were really Gibson, Battle and Company, were not making conveyors about the time of the importation,but were merely contemplating doing so. As  a  matter of fact, this particular firm actually borrowed the drawings from News Limited, in order that they might put in tenders for the conveyors. Further, we find that the conveyors were ordered of necessity twelve months earlier than this. The manufacture of printing presses and conveyors is a long job. On the 8th November, 1930, the matter having again been brought before the Minister, he again  refused. In March, 1931, Nathan, Curnow and Cocks were unable to get the decision reconsidered. In June, 1931, the Minister for Customs refused a renewed application, the reason stated by the Minister being that in June, 1928, Scott sud Sons Proprietary were prepared to accept orders for conveyors. The Minister apparently overlooked the fact that the order for the whole press was given twelve months earlier, that the conveyors were specially made for this order in London, and waited there until the completion of the whole plant. A reference to Gibson, Battle Proprietary Limited, will prove the truth of the chief fact relied on by News Limited, namely, that Scott and Sons Proprietary were not manufacturing such machinery at the time when this was ordered. Some of the other newspapers in Australia, such as the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Register,</inline> actually imported these machines free. We should not penalize the State of South Australia, and particularly this firm, to the extent of &#163;916. </para>

            <para>- News Limited is a firm which contributes heavily to the revenue. The increased duty on newsprint cost it over &#163;3.000 last year. There is no free market in the State for newspapers, and News Limited cannot pas3 on tho imposition. A newspaper firm cannot sell papers at the fraction of a penny. The next step would be to sell at 2d., which is not at present commercially feasible. In all the circumstances, it should be seen that this application is full of merit, and that the refusal to entertain it is justified by no consideration, either of previous practice or of protective policy. I trust that Cabinet will reconsider the matter. </para>

          <para>.- For the information of honorable members, and of the workers whom I represent, I should like the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> to make public the replies received from the judges to the requests that they should accept a reduction of their salaries and their pensions. </para>

        <para>The other evening I raised the subject of freight charges on wool from Australia to Great Britain, stating that, in my opinion, the freights were too high. . I suggest that the shipping company might be induced to do the fair thing by the producers if the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department used the subsidies paid on mail contracts as a lever in the negotiations. </para>
        <para>I again urge that steps be taken to deal with the buffalo fly pest in Northern Queensland. This matter may not seem serious to some honorable members, but it is of the greatest importance to cattlemen in the north, particularly to those in a small way. The big cattle-grower can work his cattle down to South Australia, and get them in as store cattle to be fattened next year ; but the man with 200 or 300 bullocks to be put off each year has no chance of getting them away. As his area is limited he must destroy the increase, or give them away for practically nothing, because his land will not carry them. </para>
        <para>I desire to know what has been done by the secretariat appointed by the Premiers Conference to go into the matter of unemployment. Have any schemes been submitted from Queensland.? We were given to understand some time ago that steps were being taken to relieve unemployment. We know that. &#163;3,000,000 has been made available for the assistance of wheat-growers, but the unemployment situationis so serious, with men tramping all over the country looking for work, that something should be done. The sum of &#163;3,000,000 is to be devoted to the payment of a bounty on wheat to bring the price up to 3s. a bushel. I noticed in to-day&#39;s press that the price of wheat in Sydney is now 2s.11d. a bushel, so that, if the bounty is to be paid on this year&#39;s wheat, the bankers will have to find only 1d. a bushel. If this amount is not made available to the farmers, it should be diverted for the relief of unemployment, and to my knowledge there are plenty of schemes, independent of any secretariat, capable of providing interest and sinking fund. I trust that these matters will receive early consideration. </para>
