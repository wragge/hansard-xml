                        <para>- No newspaper reporters were present at the meeting that I addressed on Monday night, and, in certain details, the reports in the press were not correct. I was asked whether the Federal Labour party stood for the abolition of State parliaments, and I quoted the Federal Labour party's platform on the subject. It provides for reconstruction of the Commonwealth Constitution, giving all the residual, or sovereign, powers, to the central legislature, with a devolution of adequate local governing powers to subordinate provincial legislatures. If effect were given to that part of the programme, the Slate parliaments would no longer retain the sovereign powers that they hold to-day. They would be shorn of a great deal of the expensive paraphernalia that now surrounds them, and there would be one Parliament, with central governing powers for the whole of Australia, and local provincial parliaments. I think that that would accord with the wishes of, not only of the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson),</inline> but also the great body of the people who desire constitutional reform. </para>

The boggy nature of the swamp prevented the use of transport vehicles and the aircraft had to be completely dismantled in order that it could be manhandled. This party dismantled the aircraft, removed it from the swamp to a suitable place from which it could be flown away, overhauled the engine and re-erected the aircraft, thus enabling it to be flown back to Richmond. The dismantling of the aircraft and its removal from the swamp was completed in four and a half days, and the dismantling, overhauling, and re-installation of the engine occupied another thirteen days. This time would have been spent on the overhaul of the engine even ifthe aircraft had been returned to Richmond by rail. </para>

Under these conditions the aircraft would have been removed from the swamp by unskilled labour and would probably have been dragged out by force, almost certainly resulting in severe damage to an aircraft valued at £4,800. Transportation by rail would also have necessitated dismantling the aircraft and possible further damage in transit unless additional expenses were incurred in expert packing and crating. </para>

                            <para>No. The recent air mail flights between England and Australia were of an experimental character, and the Commonwealth Government did not bear any of the cost of their performance. The flights wore arranged by the British Government and Imperial Airways Limited, and that company negotiated direct with Qantas Limited in regard to the provision of a connecting air link between Darwin and Brisbane. Upon completion of the arrangements between the two companies, Qantas Limited sought the permission of the department to convey the inward and outward mails over that section of the route, which was granted on the condition that the payment made by the post office for the carriage of the mails would be at the rate which is uniform for the carriage of mails over commercial aerial services not subsidized by the Commonwealth Government. The payment due to the company in respect of outward mails was covered in the air mail surcharge imposed on correspondence posted in Australia and that duc in respect of inward mails is being collected from the British Post Office. </para>

                            <para>.- This item covers material containing cotton, and I wish to take the opportunity to protest against the committee being asked to give any further consideration to cotton goods until the Minister has produced the report of the Tariff Board on imported cotton yarn, which I believe is now in his possession. About July of last year an application from a big spinning firm for increased protection on cotton yarn was referred to the Tariff Board. The board conducted a long and expensive inquiry into the matter, and I understand that its report has been in the hands of the Minister for some months. Despite his reply to my question to-day, I cannot believe that the honorable gentleman is not fully aware of its contents. I have no idea of the nature of the board's recommendation, but it appears remarkable to me that the committee should be asked to consider granting increased protection, for cotton goods, in all their diversity of manufacture, without first perusing that report. </para>

                                <para>- This matter is of special importance, because I doubt whether, in the whole of this vast schedule, there is to be found a series of duties that will impose a heavier burden upon the people of Australia than those upon cotton goods. By and large those duties will add substantially to the cost of living to the people as a whole, and to the workers in particular. We know that, in the main, the clothes of the worker and family are made of cotton. </para>

                                <para>- I said that cotton-growing was confined practically to one electorate, that represented by the Minister in . charge of this schedule. I do not suggest that there is the least impropriety in the Minister for Customs introducing duties in favour of the people of his own electorate, but I do contend that when those duties inevitably inflict a heavy penalty on the public as a whole the Minister might be expected to proceed with very special care, and in the full light of day. I do not like to see a Minister of the Crown bringing down a 'whole sheaf of  increased duties in favour of his own constituents, and at the same time suppressing a report of the Tariff Board which deals with the industry concerned. </para>

                                <para>.- Item No. 392 deals with cotton yarns. The committee is now dealing with item 105 aa which deals with " piece goods, knitted or lock-stitched in tubular form or otherwise, of any material except when wholly of wool ". These tubular piece goods may be of silk, artificial silk, wool and silk, wool and cotton, or cotton. The report of the Tariff Board on cotton yarns will, be submitted to the committee long before item 392 is reached. I submit that it would be a waste of time to discuss cotton yarns under an item which deals with tubular piece goods of all kinds; that it would be better to wait until item 392 is reached, before which time the report of the Tariff Board on cotton yarns will be made available to honorable members. </para>

                            <para>.- I join with the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> in asking the Minister to produce the report under which increases have been made on cotton goods covered, by item No. 105 aa. Unless the honorable gentleman is prepared to supply honorable members with that report, the committee is justified in assuming that he has not yet received it, or that it is of a character not favorable to the Government's policy with regard to this item. The committee is also justified in believing that the report from which I quoted last week, which states that cotton piece goods other than those specified should not be subjected to an increase in duty, covers the articles dealt with in item 105 aa. After a cursory glance at these duties, particularly those embodied in this item, one would wonder whether the Minister has lost his powers, whether the ever-present desire on his part to make duties go still farther and farther skyward has temporarily deserted him. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">Such a glance suggests that the rates of duty are to be 2s. 6d., 3s. and 4s. per lb., or an ad valorem rate of 30 per cent., 40 per cent., and 50 per cent., that is, just as they were before. .When we look more closely, however, we see that the little conjunction " or " has been omitted and for it has been substituted the little conjunction " and ". The result is that these duties, instead of being alternative, have the effect of doubling the previous impost. Instead of the ad valorem or the fixed duty being charged, whichever is the greater, according to the new schedule both will be charged. I protest against the imposition of these duties. It would be much more straightforward on the part of the Government to fix a definite rate of duty, and it would be easier for merchants and, indeed, for honorable members of this House, to understand the effect of the impost if a simple ad valorem or fixed rate of duty had been decided upon. The effect of this alteration has been to further complicate an already sufficiently complicated matter. Moreover, it seems to me that at this particular time, when the leaders of the Government are engaged in a momentous conference, the object of which is to effect huge reductions in the cost of government, we should not impose duties which will increase costs to a large section of the community. Without rhyme or reason, without even being fortified by a Tariff Board report, we are asked to add still more to the existing high costs of production, and to make dearer goods which are needed by the poorer people of the country. I again ask the Minister to produce the Tariff Board report on item 105  a <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> Failing that, I desire him to state his arguments in favour of substituting the word " and " for the word " or " in this item. </para>

                                <para>-- -That is as it may be, but if the Government grants protection to Australian industry to prevent the country from being flooded with cheap goods from low-wage countries, it must, if it is to be- logical, take steps to preserve in Australia the standard of living which the Labour movement demands. Only to-day the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> referred in the course of a question to the action of the employers in the wine and spirit industry, who, having obtained increased protection, immediately applied to the Arbitration Court for a reduction of 10 per cent, in the wages payable to their employees. The same sort of thing has been done by the employers in other industries. Not only have they reduced wages, but they have raised prices to the general public. Since these increased duties were first introduced, honorable members have repeatedly asked what the Government proposed to do to prevent manufacturers from exploiting the public. Time after time Ministers have given the assurance that the Customs Department had detailed special officers to check prices, and to inform the Minister in charge if anything in the nature of exploitation were taking place. I am convinced that such checking, if it were done, has not had the desired  result, because it is quite evident that manufacturers have taken advantage of the high duties to exploit the community. Representing, as I do, an industrial constituency, I am not going to sit idly by and allow the workers to be exploited not only in regard to high prices for their goods, but also in regard to their  wages  and conditions. I am not going to support protection for manufacturers who, immediately they obtain it, take steps te exploit the workers in their employ. </para>

                            <para>.- I support the proposal for deferring consideration of this item, although I do so from motives different from those which actuate the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley).</inline> It is due to this committee that the Government should give reasons for any increased duties which it proposes. The duties come before the House in the nature of a resolution which we are asked to adopt, and the Government should support the resolution. It is not fair that the Minister should simply throw the schedule on the table, placing honorable members in the position of having either to accept it or to give their reasons. The manner in which this item has been amended by changing the word " or " to " and " shows merely that it is a rough and ready method of arriving at what the Government thinks ought to be done. Sufficient time has elapsed since the alteration was made to enable the Government to determine whether or not it has been justified. The Minister should be able to tell honorable members whether the alteration has resulted in the establishment of new enterprises, or whether it has affected 'the price of goods. He should be able to give us the result of the experiment as far as it has gone, and should then advance his reason for proposing these altered and increased duties. </para>

The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> asked whether the experiment, as he described the increased duties, had been successful. If he wishes to find out, he should take steps to inspect the cotton-growing industry in Queensland, and to discover, by personal observation, just what has been, and is being, done. He should visit the cotton areas in the northern parts of Australia, particularly in the central districts of </para>

                        <para class="block">Queensland, and in the Burnett area, where marked progress has been made. Special organization has been undertaken, and sufficient ginneries and oil mills have been established, mainly as a result of the co-operative efforts of the growers. Cotton-growing in Australia to-day is not only practicable, but also a successful means of settling people on the land, and of producing our own requirements of cotton goods. Formerly an enormous sum of money left this country annually in payment for imported cotton goods. To-day we are' purchasing our own cotton goods, at the same time keeping in Australia the money that we expend on them. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> has asked whether the operation of the tariff has had the desired effect, but he forgets that this tariff protection has been in operation only twelve months. If honorable members were to visit Queensland, they would soon learn that the actual production of cotton in the field has entirely warranted the tariff protection that the industry has received. Large areas in Queensland, which previously were used for cattle-growing, are now producing cotton of a quality equal to that produced in any other part of the world. </para>

                                <para>- I am prepared to give to the industry a protection sufficient to enable it to be properly developed, and to become valuable to Australia. The trouble with this country is that too many people wish to live in the cities so as to enjoy the conditions prevailing in the great industrial centres. It is time that at least some honorable members realized the necessity for giving encouragement to those people who are prepared to develop our virgin lands in Queensland, and to produce a commodity which to-day we are importing from overseas, and which is required by every person in this country. It has been said that because  some  of our cotton fabrics contain percentages of silk and wool, this additional protection is not warranted , but I ask honorable  members  whether the woollen industry is not entitled to some measure of protection? <inline font-style="italic">1 am</inline> taking no .parochial view in this debate </para>

I cannot for the life of me understand why we should pass this item without having before us the report of the Tai-iff Board on the cotton-growing industry. The duty on this item formerly stood at, per lb., '2s. 6d., British preferential; 3s. intermediate, and 4s., general, or #0 per cent., 40 per cent., and 50 per cent., respectively. The word " and " is now to be substituted for the word " or ", and if that alteration is agreed to, the cotton industry will have the protection of both the ad valorem duty and the fixed duty. </para>

                                <para>- This excessive duty strikes at the very root of our revenue. It gives inordinate protection to the cotton-growing industry. Already this Government has granted a bounty of £800,000 to the industry, and I venture to say that it will never develop beyond its infant stage, and will never be of any va/hae to this country. It will be another .of the great white elephants which have been introduced into this country, under the pretence of giving increased employment. Nothing of the sort has happened. The protection that we have given to this industry has been to the detriment of natural industries. </para>

                                <para>- I am speaking for Australia as a whole. We have in this chamber the spectacle of one honorable  member putting the view of the Labour party. Another honorable member puts the view of his' constituents. The Minister himself always advances arguments that favour certain industries in his own electorate. That seems to be his life's desire. To-day I asked the Minister whether the operation of the duty on a certain item had increased by  500  per cent, the cost of the farmers' requirements. Certain manufacturers have increased their prices, although they promised, in the event of protection being afforded them, that they would not do so. In some instances, prices have doubled, and the position is that the consumers generally are being fleeced. At a time like this, one would have expected the Government to introduce a revenue-producing tariff, but the duties are so excessive that they preclude imports and restrict revenue customs. This excessive tariff has enabled a few manufacturers in this country to build up small fortunes at the expense of the rest of the community, one section of which is on the verge of penury, because of the fall in the price of its products. These new tariff duties are entirely unbalanced and improper. I trust that honorable members will decide to defer the proposal of the Minister, particularly in view of the fact that the recommendation of the Tariff Board is not yet before us. </para>

                            <para>. -  When a previous proposal was made at the instance of the textile workers, that certain duties should be postponed, the explanation was offered that the employers of New South Wales had no desire to reduce wages, but merely wanted the conditions under which they are obliged to conduct their industry made uniform with those in other parts of Australia. The protection given to the textile industry applies throughout Australia, and it is reasonable to ask that all employers be on the same footing in respect of wages and conditions of labour. In New South Wales this industry is being conducted under an expired award of the Federal Arbitration Court, pending the making of a new one. But the New South Wales State awards prescribe rates of pay approximately  24'  per cent, higher than those in Victoria. The' direct and obvious consequence is that the- Victorian mills can tender below their rivals in New South Wales. The only effect of the amendment proposed by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> Would b'e to bring the industry in New South Wales to a standstill and throw out of work a large number of people, while the trade went to Victoria. The following table shows the rates of wages paid in the industry in New South Wales and Victoria : - </para>

                        <para>In addition, the hours of labour in Victoria are  45  a week as compared with  44  in Now South Wales. In the former State there is no child endowment, whereas ill New South Wales the' employers have to pay a special tax of  1  per cent. The piece-workers' rates are: Victoria, basic wage, plus  10  per cent.; New South Wales, basic wage plus  15  per cent. In Victoria when the piece-worker's earnings are below the basic wage, the basic wage only need be paid; in New South Wales, the employer must pay the basic wage plus  15  per cent. In regard to workers' compensation, the act in New South Wales is more comprehensive than that iri Victoria, and the premium is greater in accordance with the higher individual rate of wages. </para>

                        <para>The reason given by the Minister for his refusal to produce the Tariff Board's report is most un satisfactory. It is obvious that cotton yarn, is an important constituent of many of the articles covered by the item now under consideration, and, therefore, the request for the production of the board's report on cotton yarn at this stage is reasonable. The Minister should take the committee into his confidence, and place before it all the facts relating to the industry and the proposed duties. Unfortunately, the Minister is always seeking to get an item accepted with no explanation, or only half an explanation. There is reason to believe that the Tariff Board's report does not favour this duty, and the Minister's endeavour to get the item agreed to without the report being made available is not fair to the committee. This item affects a portion of the everyday requirements of over 6,000,000 people, and we are entitled to all the information that has been prepared by the board and the departmental officers. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> has pointed out that the substitution of "and" for "or" places on imports an exorbitant duty, amounting almost to prohibition. The Minister may declare that the granting of a monopoly to local manufacturers will not lead to increased prices, but nobody will believe him; the public knows better. Manufacturers will be able to charge whatever prices they choose. Are only the interests of the manufacturers and those engaged in the industry to bo considered? Will nobody on the Government side of the chamber say a word for the consumers? I ask the committee to show some sympathy with the workers to whom these goods are an every-day necessity. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Wide Bay (Mr.Corser) has made the usual appeal, which he employs whenever an industry in his electorate is affected. He seems to think that before one should dare to speak about the cotton industry, he must have walked over the plantations, and inspected the ginneries. He would permit representatives of industrial and suburban constituencies only the right to " pay up and shut up."  His  appeal leaves me cold, because, whether the subject be cotton, ginger, peanuts, sugar, or anything else produced in his electorate, he advances the same pleas and arguments. I have sympathy with all these industries; but I feel bound to have some regard to the cost of their production. The honorable member does not care what burden is placed on the taxpayers of Australia, so long as an industry in his electorate gains, and he gets thereby an electoral advantage. That is a narrow view, which I am proud not to take either voluntarily or compulsorily. Industries and protective duties should be considered on a nation-wide basis. If that were done, the consuming public, including the workers, and even the unemployed, would receive some consideration; instead, the Government seems intent on serving only the interests of the employers and the employees in industry, regardless of the effect upon the general public. The Tariff Board's report on cotton yarn should be produced. There must be an extraordinary reason why the committee has not been supplied with a report that is germane to this item. No Minister should be allowed to trifle with the committee. Every member has a right to all information that the Tariff Board provides. The Minister, in withholding this report, is committing, to say the least, an error of judgment. </para>

                            (Capricornia - Minister  honorable members are evidently laboring under a misapprehension in this matter. The Tariff Board reported on this item as far back as 1927. After a thorough investigation, it recommended that protection be given to the industry, as was provided for under the 1921-1928 tariff. The increased duties included in the present schedule were imposed by the Government on the 21st "November, 1929, when the member for Maribyrnong

                            was the Minister for Trade and Customs, after certain investigations had been made by officers of the department. It should be remembered that the present Government went to the country on a policy of high protection, and was elected upon it. It found that certain secondary industries were languishing, and among them were those manufacturing tubular piece goods. On hearing the remarks of certain honorable members, one might think that this item dealt only with cotton goods. It covers also silk and artificial silk tubular goods, wool and cotton, and cotton tubular piece goods. Tho Tariff Board's report on item 105 was submitted when the previous government was in office.

It helps to provide employment in this country in the manufacture of yarn, and it assists to provide a market for our wool and cotton.

                        <para>The policies of past governments have been shortsighted, because, while a bounty was given to help cotton growers, and certain cotton spinners, adequate protection was not given to those who were turning out the cotton tubular piece goods, wool and cotton goods, or artificial silk piece goods included in this item. When the present Government assumed office it corrected that mistake. The report of the Tariff Board on cotton yarn relates to an entirely different matter. This subject was submitted to the board in connexion with item 392, and the report of the board will be made available before that item is reached. I remind . the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> that the Tariff Board's report on cotton generally was submitted to his Government in February or March, 1929, and fully nine or ten months elapsed before it was made available. That honorable member himself refused to make it available to me, and to other members of this committee. </para>

                                <para>- When the present  Government came into office, there were 50 or 60 reports by the board which had never been made available. I have adopted the practice of tabling the board's reports immediately the Government has finished with them. I shall see that the board's report on cotton yarn is made  available  before we reach item 392. On inquiries made by the Government, we  feel justified in increasing the duties on cotton piece goods. All the talk about the consumers being charged an increased price is so much gallery play, because the prices of cotton piece goods have been reduced 14 per cent.  since  these duties have been imposed. </para>

                        <para>The importation of artificial silk piece goods has been increasing, and this shows that even the present duties under this item are insufficient. The imports of artificial silk piece goods, not containing wool, and knitted in tubular form or otherwise, were valued at £35,011 in 1927-28, and at £181,313 in 1928-29, while, in 1929-30, their value increased to £226,331. Many factories import artificial silk yarns, and are turning them into the knitted tubular piece goods included in the item under consideration. The imports of knitted cotton, in tubular form or otherwise, were valued at £156,624 in 1927-28; at £105,717 in 1928-29; and £67,399 in 1929-30. The imports of silk piece goods, or piece goods containing silk, but not containing wool, knitted in tubular form or otherwise, were valued at £12,762 in 1927-28 ; at £9,007 in 1928-29 ; and at £5,718 in 1929-30. In 1925, the duties on apparel, including knitted apparel, were substantially increased, in the interests of Australian clothing manufacturers. I think that that action was taken at the instance of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten</inline> when he was Minister for Trade and Customs. In 1928, the duties on knitted piece goods, other than all-wool piece goods, for the manufacture of apparel, were increased to 30 per cent, ad valorem, or 2s. 6d. per lb., British preferential tariff, and 50 per cent, ad valorem, or 4s. per lb., general tariff, as it was found that the manufacturers of knitted cotton, underwear were being deprived of their market by the importation of cotton piece goods, in tubular form or otherwise, and the subsequent manufacture of underwear and such like from the imported piece goods. </para>
                        <para>Insofar as cottons are concerned, the statistical figures indicate that the duties have been particularly effective. The value of imports has decreased from £156,624 in 1927-28 to £67,399. Australia is now growing practically all the cotton required by our  manufacturers  for tubular piece goods. Certain mercerized yarns required for cottOn tweeds are not dutiable, but all cotton yarns are dutiable. Australia is fast reaching the position in which she will be growing all the raw cotton required by Australian factories. Some thousands of farmers are engaged in the production of raw cotton in Australia, and in the electorate of the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis),</inline> and the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser),</inline> between 3,000 and 4,000 workers obtain seasonal employment in the picking of cotton, after they leave the canefields.  In accordance with the policy laid down by the Government in regard to the cotton industry, and at the request of certain, interested parties in Queensland representing the growers and the workers in the industry, I had a Commonwealth tribunal appointed to fix fair and reasonable rates for the cottonpickers, and these have been settled satisfactorily by a unanimous decision of that tribunal, representative of the growers and the workers, of which the Commonwealth Conciliation Commissioner is chairman. It is true that, when the present Government came into office, a bounty was operating to encourage the growing of cotton and the spinning of the cotton yarns in Australia, but the future of the industry was uncertain. The Government put the matter on a proper basis, and gave adequate protection to both the primary and secondary branches of the industry, by providing for an annually diminishing bounty, which will cease in 1936, This action has mean! a great deal to the big factories in the capital cities of the southern States, to thousands of farmers who are growing cotton in Queensland, and to the workers who obtain seasonal occupation in the fields. </para>

                                <para>- There has been a substantial increase. The number of employees in Bond's Industries Limited rose from 1,382, in 1929, to 2,267 in 1931, an increase of 885. There has been a <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> increase in the other big mills of Australia. Notwithstanding the present depression, there is great activity in the textile industry. The manufacturers assure me that they are working at high pressure to meet the demand for their goods, because the imports were substantially reduced at a time when we had an adverse trade balance, and were faced with bankruptcy if we did not rectify it. Is it not a wise policy to meet our own requirements, as far as possible, particularly in regard to- wool and cotton, by converting the raw product into the finished article? It surely will not be denied that it is much better for us to manufacture our requirements here than to send our raw materials 16,000 miles overseas to be manufactured and then sent back to us. The figures covering th* importation of artificial silk piece goods, knitted, have been recorded separately for the last three years only. In 1929-30 a substantial increase of these imports, valued at approximately £45,000, occurred, which shows beyond question that the duties cannot be too high. </para>

                                <para>- The development is increasing year by year, and greater quantities of raw cotton are being grown. This, with the protection of the secondary industries, is enabling the Australian manufacturers, who have agreed to buy Australian-grown cotton, to increase their activities considerably. In the circumstances it should not be many years before we are growing all the cotton that we require, though, naturally, I cannot say exactly how long it will be. </para>

                        <para>Information received recently indicates that various factors, in which may be included the high tariff rate, the adverse exchange, and the temporary lack of demand, have brought about an almost total cessation of imports of artificial silk knitted piece goods. Local factories are now equipped to produce the normal Australian requirements, but the plants are to-day running at only about half their capacity. With a revival of trade, and subject to the present rates of duty being maintained, Australian manufacturers anticipate that their machines will soon be running at full time. There has been an improvement in the last few weeks. It is worthy of mention that the present world-prices of artificial silk piece knitted goods are lower than those which have ruled at any previous period for the same quality of material. We are thus carrying on our operations in a time of extreme difficulty. The' Government assumed office when price levels were falling rapidly in England and Europe. This, with a pegged rate of exchange, enabled these goods to be dumped on this market at prices with which the Australian manufacturer could not compete. It was, therefore, necessary that strong action should be taken. The importation of knitted piece goods is detrimental alike to the class of Australian industry which engages in the knitting of completed garments, and to that which engages in the manufacture of piece goods from which the completed garments are made up. Australian manufacturers are capable of supplying the whole of our requirements of cotton underwear. In view of the increases in duty on apparel incorporated in the 1919 tariff schedule, our underwear manufacturers should make every effort to use Australian materials. This item has been amended to cover lockstitch piece goods, as the process of  lockstitching,  is very much akin to knitting. </para>
                        <para>Since the imposition of these duties there has been a considerable development in the industry. A new factory has  been  established in Melbourne for the making of tubular piece goods and underwear of all kinds. The firm responsible for opening it has also established a big spinning mill, the machinery of which was bought in England, and it recently bought, in one lot, 3,000 bales of Australian-grown cotton. The company, Davis, Coop Proprietary Limited, is now making cotton yarn for its own use, and is also willing to sell yarn to other manufacturers. The amount of capital invested in this enterprise is £75,000. This money has been made available by good Australians, in order to give employment to the people of this country. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member for West Syduey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> has foreshadowed an amendment which, if carried, would mean the postponement of the consideration of this item. He has told us that he intends to take this step because of the efforts of certain manufacturers to bring about a reduction of wages and a lengthening of working hours in New South Wales. I dealt with this subject last week when another item was being considered, and explained that, although the policy of the Government was new protection, which provides for the protection of the workers in industry and of the consuming public, the High Court, in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Bex</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Barger,</inline> decided in 1906, held that the Commonwealth Parliament had not the constitutional power to put that policy into full operation. I make it clear, however, that I do not approve of manufacturers who have claimed and obtained protection on the ground that they have to observe Australian standards of wages and conditions, approaching the Arbitration Court, or other fixing tribunal, immediately after such protection has been granted, in order to obtain a variation df wages and conditions. </para>

                                <para>- The action of certain manufacturers in this respect is regrettable; but I have to regard the interests of the whole of Australia. I can only fight a battle against such persons with the weapons which the Government has at its disposal. I know that on the representation of the Textile Workers Union, in Melbourne, a conference was held between representatives of the employers and employees, which reached an amicable arrangement. It is true that the workers were obliged to accept a 10 per cent, wage cut, but <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> per cent, of this was due to the fall in the cost of living. This reduction is to operate from 1st July, by agreement between the parties. A spirit of compromise was shown on each side. I sincerely trust that the employers and employees of New South Wales will also confer on this subject, and come to an amicable arrangement. So many industries are affected by tariff variations that it would be impossible for the Minister for Trade and Customs to convene and preside over conferences of the employers and employees in the different industries. Requests have been made to me recently to convene conferences of employers and employees in the metal trade, the glass manufacturing industry, and the textile industry. If I convened such conferences, cumbersome and overlapping machinery would be put into operation. In any case, the only weapon that I could use would be the withdrawal of the duty. I have discussed that possibility with representatives of the Textile Workers Union, and they understand the difficulties of the position from the Government stand-point. They know that if the duty were withdrawn great injury would be done to the industry. </para>

                                <para>- I am aware that that branch of the union and the Sydney Trades and Labour Council desire the duty to be lifted ; but I must consider the effect of that action upon employment generally in this . industry throughout Australia. If the duty were lifted, probably 50 per cent, of the persons engaged in the industry would be thrown out of work. In these circumstances it would be useless for me to adopt a stand-and-deliver attitude. I am not prepared to face the consequences of throwing out of work half the people employed in the industry, and of allowing an influx of these goods from cheap labour countries. It would be impracticable for me to convene a conference, as has been suggested. Consequently, I cannot agree to the postponement of the item. </para>

                                <para>- I have received a telegram from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Larke,</inline> the General Secretary of the Textile Workers Union of Australia, asking me to convene a conference. I regret that I cannot do it. In regard to the New South Wales position, I remind honorable members that the matter was first dealt with at a conference arranged by the Conciliation Commissioner. This proved to be abortive, and recourse was then had to the full Arbitration. Court of New South Wales. The officers of the union were unable to tell me how long it would take the court to deal with the case. For this reason also I cannot agree to the suggestion that consideration of the item should be postponed. This matter has already been awaiting attention for eighteen months, and it is desirable that the new duty shall be ratified as early as possible. We have about 400 items to deal with, and are now only at item 105. I know that the Attorney-General is desirous of introducing some arbitration legislation, and I have a number of bills to submit to honorable members. It is essential, therefore, that we should push on with the business before the committee. </para>

                            <para>.- I am not altogether surprised that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has adopted a "hush" policy in regard to the report of the Tariff Board on cotton goods, for these duties are the most one-sided ever presented to this Parliament. In deciding upon them the Minister has shown an utter disregard of the interests of the whole community in order that he might benefit the people of one constituency. He has said that tb&gt; report of the board applies only to cotton yarns. Last week, when another item was  under consideration, the report of the board on the subject was made available: but no recent report on this subject is available to honorable members. An old report has been tabled, and certain investigations ha.ve been carried out by departmental officers. But not even the full result of those investigations has been published. The Minister has seen fit to reveal only the parts of the reports of his officers which support the action he has taken in the interests of the cotton growers of Capricornia. </para>

                                <para>- That is an additional reason why the report of the board should be made available. The price of cotton piece goods has a big influence upon the cost of living in Australia. Our workers are the principal wearers of cotton garments, and in their interests it is highly desirable, and in fact urgent, that the report of the board on the subject should be made available. In a report which dealt with an item considered by the committee last week, a point made in evidence by a cotton-weaver in support of a claim for an increased duty on certain cotton piece goods was that the price of cotton yarn had been increased; in this case the manufacturers may also want higher duties because the price of cotton yarn has been increased. Surely, in these circumstances, the Minister should not refuse to table the report of the board on the subject. It is most unfair to the committee and to the people who use cotton goods, particularly the workers, to bring forward these increased duties under a fog of suppressed reports, and in sections  which tend to obscure the identity of the cotton piece goods concerned. It is the duty of the Minister to supply the committee with the fullest and latest information that he has on the matter. The honorable gentleman has given us some information, and, if he had not shown some reluctance to produce the report that has been asked for, honorable members might assume that his statement, based upon investigations made by departmental officials, was an entirely fair one. But, when the honorable gentleman endeavours to sneak these duties through a bit at a time, and deprives the committee of information to which it is entitled, he cannot expect honorable members to accept his statement as to the necessity for these duties. The honorable gentleman stated that this item includes artificial silk and wool, wool and cotton, and other piece goods, and that the duties will confer a substantial benefit on local wool-growers, manufacturers, and users. The Minister completely ignores the fact that the grower receives export parity for his wool. Even when it goes to cheap labour countries, or comparatively dearer labour countries, such as Canada and the United States of America, and the manufactured article comes back here, the determining factor is the price of the finished article in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- At times one section of competition is stronger than another, and so influences the price of wool, but there <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> no evidence that the local mills pay higher than they are forced to do, because of overseas competition. In the long run, the only effect that the establishment of a local woollen industry can have upon the returns to the grower for his wool is that which would result from the creation of a greater demand for woollen goods because of the attractiveness of their price or quality to local consumers. If the use of woollen articles were being encouraged as a result of low prices, there would be no necessity for this prohibitive tariff. While this particular rise in duties may not have increased the existing prices of woollen goods in Australia, it has definitely prevented the fall in prices that is taking place everywhere else in the world. By keeping woollen goods dearer, the Government will reduce the ability of wool to compete with cheaper kinds of material. It is nothing but eyewash to suggest that, where a big proportion of the output is exported, and the producers are dependent for their main market upon sending their products overseas, the diversion of some of the raw material, such as wool, to the local manufacturer enhances its selling price to the grower. The case of cotton is different, because Australia does not export that commodity. Every increase in the tariff with regard to cotton goods can be shared by the growers of raw cotton at the expense of tha poorer section of the community. That may be the result of the duties set out in this item. But it is most unfair for the Minister to suppress the presentation of the report concerning a section of the industry which, although it may not be covered by the item with \vhich the committee is dealing, materially affects the cost of these goods. The report of the Tariff Board on cotton piece goods, made on the 30th June last, states, among other things - </para>

In order to pass on the increased costs of materials due to this duty, an increase of from 33;'f per cent, to 50 per cent, in the rates now requested on the cloths mentioned would be necessary. </para>

                                <para>- The increase on yarns must similarly affect the position with regard to piece goods, and it is unfair to ask the committee to consider the piece goods section of the schedule until the report of the Tariff Board on yarns is made available. It is improper to ask honorable members to increase the cost of these necessary articles to the workers when the Minister is deliberately suppressing knowledge that has been made available to him by the Tariff Board. For his own credit, and for the sake of the committee, I urge the honorable gentleman to make the report available, so that honorable members may arrive at an unbiased opinion in the matter. </para>

                            <para>.- I think that the Minister might accede to the request of the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> and postpone this item. An increase in duty cannot be justified if the employees in the industry concerned do not receive a proper rate of wages. The Minister stated that if the item were postponed he could not convene a conference of these manufacturers and workers. I contend that if the item were postponed the manufacturers would be tumbling over themselves in an endeavour to meet their employees in conference, so that they might make this increase in duties a certainty. The Minister, therefore, need not bother, about his inability to convene a conference. </para>

                                <para>- I said that they would tumble over each other to avoid wage cuts in order to get the duty. They want them only because the manufactured material of one industry is the raw material of another. The cost of raw cotton has been increased by 3d. per lb., and it is only because of the absolute necessity to do so in their own defence that manufacturers have sought these increases in duty. I have copies of letters which have been sent to the Minister, which indicate that if a certain regulation that was withdrawn on the 7th April, and which allowed the free importation of cotton used in the manufacture of flannel, is not reinstated, the Stawell "Woollen Mills, which manufacture flannel, and need a certain percentage of cotton for the process, will have to dismiss a number of men. I forwarded those letters to the Minister on the 2nd May, but have received no reply. </para>

                            <para>.- I intend to support the amendment, although not on the grounds advocated by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley).</inline> I support it because I desire, first of all, to postpone these duties, as they are excessive, and again because of the failure of the Minister to produce the report of the Tariff Board on cotton yarns. A great deal has been said about the magnitude of these increases. I point out to the committee, and especially to the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> that the increases shown in the schedule do not include the 50 per cent, surcharge to which these items are subject. It will be realized when that 50 per cent, surcharge is taken into consideration, that an extraordinarily high level of protection will be given to these items that cannot fail to increase substantially the price of all articles of clothing made out of cotton piece goods, whether imported or manufactured in Australia. As the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> pointed out, the old duty was 30 per cent. British, or 2s. 6d. per lb. Under the new tariff the duty is to be 2s. 6d. per lb., and 30 per cent., but if we add the surcharge to this, the new duty will be 3s. 9d. per lb., and 45 per cent. That is the British rate, which is substantially lower than either the intermediate or the general rate. These duties, extraordinary as they are, represent only the beginning of the protection afforded to this industry. It also receives a large measure of assistance hy way of bounty payable directly from the Treasury. There is a bounty of lid. per lb. on seed cotton, amounting to 4Jd. per lb. on cotton yarn of the popular Wo. 16 count. Then again, there is a bounty of one-third of a penny on cotton yarn of No. 16 count, which amounts to a further 5.3d. per lb., or a total bounty on each lb. of cotton of 9.8d. per lb., whereas the landed cost of imported cotton yarn of No. 16 count is ls. 7d. per lb. Then we have the new cotton yarn duty imposed in item 392. Here again there have been very large increases. The old duty was 35 per cent., whereas the new one is 35 per cent., plus a specific new duty of 6d. per lb. on all imported yarn. Altogether, therefore as against imported cotton yarn worth ls. 7d. per lb., there is a total protection by way of duty and straight out bounty of ls. lOd. per lb., or 115 per cent., much of it paid in spot cash. That is the basis on which the Government now begins to build the further greatly increased duties on cotton piece goods containing yarn which is, or could be, produced in Australia. I have said before in this House that the bolstering up of the cotton industry is easily the most expensive piece of protection in which this Parliament has ever engaged. The new duties will have the effect of doubling or even trebling the cost of cotton clothing as compared with what it might be sold for. Such a policy is most undesirable, especially at this time. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>Therefore, I rejoice at the prospect of any postponement of this item. There are many ways in which the Minister could overcome the difficulties he has raised. He pleaded that the item contained piece goods made up in materials other than cotton, hut if he wishes to deal fairly with the committee, let him exclude from the item cotton piece goods, and let him take in, if he likes, artificial silk or woollen piece goods. I would prefer, however, that he postponed the item altogether, or negatived it insofar as these increased duties are concerned. </para>

                            <para>. - The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> placed before the committee a detailed statement regarding the wages, hours of labour, and working conditions of those employed in the cotton industry in Victoria. The honorable member, in my opinion, only succeeded in proving that those who represent industrial constituencies in New South Wales should do everything in their power to maintain the standards of employment which have been secured in their State.  His  remarks should strengthen them in their determination to fight against the proposed reduction of wages in New South Wales. The honorable member said that it was unfair to ask the employers in New South Wales to pay higher wages than were being paid by their friends in Victoria. I do not complain because he holds that opinion, because he is advocating the cause of those he represents, but I point out that, while the hours of labour in this industry are 45 in Victoria, the application of the employers in New South Wales is for a 48-bour week. </para>

                                <para>- If the employers in New South Wales are successful in this application, the position will be that. Victorian employers will want their hours increased, and a state of affairs will very quickly grow up in which the employers will seek to make the lowest wage rates and the longest hours prevailing in any part of Australia the standard for the whole of Australia. If the employers in any State are able to bring sufficient pressure to bear to reduce wages or lengthen hours, owing, for instance, to the weakness of trade unions, that will be used as an argument in this chamber and elsewhere for applying that lower standard to all parts of Australia. I do not complain because the honorable member for Warringah puts the case as he sees it; because that is his job in this chamber; but I do not wish honorable members on this side of the chamber to be misled into accepting his arguments. The workers of Australia, or indeed of any part of the world, have won such amenities as they enjoy only by close organization and effort. I have heard the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> say in this House that if the working farmers are to better their condition, they must organize and make their strength felt iii the politics of the country. In that I agree with him. The same reasoning applies to the industrial workers. It is because they have organized, and because they have built up their trade unions, that they have been able to win for themselves such wage rates and working conditions as they now enjoy. If they had not taken that action, the question of preserving such standard of living as is now theirs would never have arisen. There would be nothing to preserve. If we accept that principle - and I am sure it is accepted by most honorable members on this side, for many of them have been associated with the trade union movement - we must realize that at no cost should we surrender the favorable position won in those States where a higher standard of living prevails. There should be no support from this side of the House for the policy advocated by the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill).</inline> The Minister said that he had taken steps to see that the interests of the cottonpickers in his own State had been safeguarded to the fullest extent. I applaud him for his action, but I wish to impress upon him that he should not confine his interest to the welfare of the workers in his own State. </para>

                        <para class="block">The cotton industry is particularly associated with Queensland ; but I do  not  mention that for the purpose of suggesting that the Minister, who hails from that State, is concerned only for the interests of the workers of the north. The Minister, as I have pointed out, has been successful in affording those workers the protection they deserve, and my contention is that he, and others who support the Government, should do what is possible to assist and protect the workers engaged in the secondary side of the industry in other States. The field workers in Queensland have informed me that they are in sympathy with the fight being waged on behalf of the factory workers. I am convinced that Victorian representatives on this side of the House will see the wisdom of endeavouring to maintain the 44-hour week in' New South Wales, and of preserving the present rate of wages, because once the present standard is lowered in New South Wales there will be very little prospect of the workers of Victoria ever being ,able to win back the conditions they enjoyed before the recent reduction. The Government has publicly declared itself to be in opposition to the Arbitration Court's recent 10 per cent, wage cut. The Government took such action as it thought to be within its powers to oppose the application. It failed in its endeavours, but it has definitely proclaimed itself to be opposed to the policy of wage slashing. Although it failed to prevent the reduction ordered by the federal court, it can take such action now as will be successful in preventing the cutting of wages in the cotton-milling industry. I agree with the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch)</inline> that if the Government showed its sympathy with the workers, and deferred consideration of this item, the manufacturers would very quickly agree to an arrangement which would be favorable to their employees. </para>

"His  job lies in another direction. If it is desirable that some representative of the Government should preside over a conference between the parties, there is an Assistant Minister for Industry who could very well do the work. This Government favours industrial conferences for the settlement of disputes, and the holding of such a conference on this occasion would tend to establish the practice. </para>

                        <para>It is being more and more accepted in all parts of the world to-day, and has been emphasized in recent American publications, that wage reduction is not going to solve national problems and is not in the interests of the countries in which it is practised. Most reasonable persons will agree that if the purchasing power of the people is reduced, they can no longer be in a position to purchase so much of what the industries of the country produce. If protection is applied in any country to stimulate local industry, it is utterly wrong at the same time to reduce the wages of the workers and thereby prevent them from purchasing the products of the industries which have been assisted. It is vitally necessary that every means should be adopted to establish a home market for our industries. If wages are reduced in the textile industry they will, no doubt, be reduced in other industries also, and the home market for the product of both our secondary and primary industries, will be restricted and, in some respects, destroyed. The employers have adopted a sta.nd-and-deliver attitude in regard to this matter, and it is within the power of this Government to let them know that they cannot have things entirely their own way. If they insist upon forcing down the wages and living conditions of their employees, the Government should see that it metes out similar treatment to them, more especially if they take advantage of the protection afforded by the tariff to exploit the public. It has been suggested that if this or that duty is removed or decreased, the result will be increased unemployment. The secretary of the textile workers' organization in New South Wales has informed me that the increased duties have not been the means of giving additional employment to members of that organization. </para>

Other honorable members have said that four of the States are under federal awards which have given satisfaction to employer and employee alike. The allegation that prices have not been reduced, although duties have been increased, has been refuted, because prices have been reduced by something like 21 per cent, in many of the mills throughout the Commonwealth. I ask the Minister to defer consideration of this item until the report of the Tariff Board is available, because that report will be of undoubted value in the debate. </para>

Iron, and steel form the base of most manufactures in the metal industry, yet, because of the absence of the report, the duties on many manuf actures of metal were increased to a much greater extent than, they should have been. A similar mistake may be made, in this instance. The Tariff Board has inquired into cotton yarns, and its report has been made to the Minister. For some reason he is hiding it. </para>

                                <para>- I am considering not the producers, but the tariff on piece goods. The Minister has said that if this duty is imposed employment will be increased, hut I suggest that the growing unemployment with which we are faced shows that the Minister has overestimated his power to create work. He fervently believes that he can increase employment by simply increasing duties, but the result has proved otherwise. The excessive tariffs have shattered established importing businesses, which previously ' contributed, through the customs, large sums of money to the Commonwealth revenue. I have no doubt that the increased duties have benefited, a few people in the Minister's own electorate. However, I urge him to defer the consideration of this item. If he refuses to. do that,. I shall vote for the amendment. </para>

                            <para>. -  I was inclined to vote for the motion for postponement as a protest against the Minister refusing to take the slightest heed of the request made to him to produce the report of the Tariff Board on cotton yarn, but I decline to vote for it now that the honorable member for West Sydney has further explained his reason for moving it. He  spent much, time in pointing out what organized Labour had won, and what it was entitled to do. I agree that Labour is entitled to what it can get. It is entitled to a fair thing. The employee has just as much right to. organize for the betterment of his wages and conditions as the employer has to: organize for the protection of his interests. But what is overlooked by the honorable member is that in that process a tremendous injustice is likely to be done to another class of the community - the general public. The honorable member for West Sydney has proposed the deferring of this duty because the employers in the textile industry have made application to the Arbitration Court. Why does he object to the case of the textile workers going be-fore that, tribunal? It may he that the court's decision would be in favour of the unionists. Because a section of the employers in this country propose to take an action which they are legally entitled to take, because they propose to go before the Arbitration Court, in order to settle their disputes, the honorable member for West Sydney has contended that they be denied the tariff protection proposed under this schedule. If the employers were summarily reducing the wages of their employees there would be some ground for his argument, but the employers merely wish to approach the Arbitration Court so that the conditions of employment in the industry may be brought into line with those applying in other industries in Australia. The court may decide differently. </para>

                                <para>- J was assuming that the Labour party believed in the policy of arbitration, and in the integrity of the Arbitration Court, and, despite what the honorable member for- East Sydney has said, I still believe that the great majority of the Labour members in this House believe in r.he justice and integrity of that institution. That the employers in a particular industry wish to take advantage of the arbitration laws which were supported by the Labour party, and upon which they won the last  federal  election., is no ground for withholding the consideration of this item. Do.es &gt;the motion to postpone mean that if the two parties in this industry come to a mutual arrangement they are bo be entitled to, ask this Parliament for whatever- duties, they desire?. That is what is happening to-day. It is wrong in principle because it ignores the biggest interest of all - that of the general public' It is a species of blackmail that should not be tolerated. The honorable member for West Sydney has said that if we postpone this item we shall compel the employers to, seek a conference iri order to come to some arrangement with the unio.n concerned, and that, 30 soon as that is done, this duty should be imposed. No more nefarious <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> pernicious action has ever before been advocated in any Parliament. It should be stopped at once. It should be made perfectly clear that the tariff is to be f ramed and considered by this Australian Parliament, due consideration being given to the great mass of the consumers, as well as to those who are engaged in the industry. Much as I should like to compel the Minister to produce the report of the Tariff Board, I will not support the motion of the honorable member for West Sydney. </para>

If the honorable member for Henty'- moves, after the vote has been taken on the motion of the honorable member for West Sydney, I shall give him  my support. </para>

                            <para>.- No satisfactory explanation has been given of the tremendous increase of the duty on sub-item aa2 by the substitution of "and" for "or", the effect of which is to make the two duties cumulative instead of alternative. In addition, this is an item on which a surcharge of 50 per cent, of the existing duty is imposed. That represents an enormous increase on the duties in force in 1928. The Minister stated this afternoon that the most recent report by the Tariff Board in regard to the piece goods included in this item dates back to 1927. In the absence of other information it is reasonable to assume that the 1928 duties conformed to the recommendations in the 1927 report. </para>

Surely some limit must be imposed on the height to which the tariff wall may be raised to shut out external competition. As the Minister stated this afternoon, this Parliament has no power to fix prices, and, therefore, it has no means of protecting the consumers in respect of the prices charged for goods produced in Australian factories except by leaving the tariff door ajar to admit of some competition from abroad. </para>
                        <para>Mr.Forde.  -  Keen competition within Australia has caused prices' to drop between 14 per cent, and 33 per cent, in the last two years. </para>

                                <para>- The Tariff Board's report of 1927 said that other cotton piece goods not specifically mentioned in item 105 aa, b, and c should not be protected by any higher duty. If the Minister cannot, or will not, produce a more up-to-date report, this committee is entitled to assume that the piece goods covered by item aa2 were included in the "other piece goods not specifically mentioned"  which the Tariff Board declared in 1927 should not be further protected. Honorable members sitting on this side do not desire that any cotton goods should be imported which can be economically produced in Australia, but the prices of local goods must compare reasonably with those of goods from abroad. We have to ask ourselves how much handicap is to be imposed on outside goods, the competition of which is the only means of regulating the prices and quality of the local article. The duties that were in operation in 1928, plus a 50 per cent, surcharge, are more than ample for the industry. </para>

                            <para>. -I take it that the duties on both artificial silk and pure silk goods are in the main revenue imposts. It has always appeared to me to be an anomaly that the duty on artificial silk should be 25 per cent., and on pure silk 10 per cent. Artificial silk is the wearing apparel of relatively poor people, as compared with silk, which is a luxury. I should have thought that, in these needy days, without striking a heavy blow at any particular country, and inviting retaliation, we might have imposed a higher revenue duty than 10 per cent, on pure silk. </para>

As item 105d stands, it is possible to include within it such lines as cotton tweeds and other similar materials . used for outer wear, containing a thread of silk or arti- ficial silk. Ithas been observed that overseas manufacturers are producing such lines in order to evade the duties under item 105 a 1 <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> which were imposed for the protection of Australian textile manufacturers. It will he noted that a precedent has been established in the case of knitted piece goods - item 105 aa and woollen piece goods item 105 f. This amendment, if adopted, should effectively dispose of any further attempts to defeat the protective incidence of the tariff. If this amendment were not adopted cotton tweeds containing stripes of artificial silk, perhaps half an inch apart, would be dutiable under the lower rate. </para>

                            <para>.- Item  f  1 deals with "Piece goods, woollen, or containing wool, ordinarily used in the manufacture of outer clothing for human wear and weighing more than three ounces per square yard," upon which the British duty is 2s. per square yard and 35 per cent, ad val. These rates are now absurdly excessive owing to the operation of both the flat rate, increased from1s. to 2s., and the ad val. rate, raised from 30 per cent, to 35 per cent. The most serious aspect of the subject is, however, the all-round increase in the range of goods covered by the item, which now includes all woollen piece goods weighing more than, three ounces per square yard, instead of six ounces as previously. Wool crepe de chine from Great Britain, wool jersey from France, and wool georgette are examples. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>In order that honorable members may appreciate the full effect of this duty, I point out that the f.o.b. price of British wool crepe de chine is 4s. 8d. per square yard. Under the old rate of duty, the landed cost of this fabric was 7s. 3d. per yard; under the new duties it is 10s. 3d. per yard, or 120 per cent, above the f.o.b. price. No attempt is made by the Australian manufacturers to produce wool crepe de chine, the production of which was specially undertaken in Great Britain in order to put on the market a light woollen cloth which could compete with artificial silk. The hold that artificial silk was gaining on the market was so seriously affecting the woollen industry that the manufacturers felt it necessary to produce this type of woollen material suitable for outer wearing apparel for women and children. In the manufacture of this cloth, Australian wool is used, and the competition of artificial silk goods has been met, at least to some extent. Under the duty now in operation the importation of this material has, however, been practically prohibited, while, at the same time, a special preference has been given to artificial silk. </para>
                        <para>Wool jersey, made in France, is another similar item. The f.o.b. price of this cloth is 5s. 9d. per yard. Prior  to  the imposition, of the present duty, it could be landed in Australia for 9s. l0d. per yard, whereas it now costs 15s. l0d. per yard to land it here, or 175 per cent, more than the f.o.b. price. </para>
                        <para>Wool georgette at 5s. per yard f.o.b., previously cost8s. 7d. per yard to land, while it now costs 13s.1d. landed, or 162 per cent, in excess of the f.o.b. price. The landed costs quoted do not provide for abnormal exchange rates, which make the prices considerably higher. </para>
                        <para>The effect of this duty on one very well-known British material was to increase the retail price to 12s. per yard as against 4s.11d. per yard at which it is sold in England. The exchange at the time this price was fixed was only 10 per cent. The manufacturers of this fabric have a factory in Australia, employing Australian labour for turning into garments here its cloths made overseas. In the past this company has bought Australian wool with every penny realized from its Australian sales, and spent a good deal of other money besides. It continues to buy Australian wool, but there is now little incentive to it to give preference to the Australian product as against that of other dominions which do not impose prohibitive tariffs against its own manufactured products. If these goods came into active competition with Australian goods, there might be some justification for a high protective tariff; but they are a highly specialized product which is not made in Australia, and, I . am informed, is not likely to be manufactured here  for the present. The goods in question have certain definite advantages and uses, and cannot he replaced, either in quality or in quantity, by Australian goods. The effect of the duty is to deprive the Australian public of the benefits of this popular product, by making it too expensive for them to buy; consequently, trade which legitimately belongs to woollen goods is diverted to artificial silks and other cheaper imported fabrics. It will be seen, therefore, that not only does the Australian manufacturer derive no benefit from the duty, but the producers of wool also suffer by the Minister's action in bringing about a decrease in the consumption of woollen goods. This class of light woollen clothing has been manufactured mainly in Great Britain and Trance in order to meet the competition of artificial silks and other substitutes for wool. Since the imposition of this duty, some Australian manufacturers who specialized in the production of light woollen fabrics have closed their factories, while others have closed the portions of their factories previously devoted to the manufacture of goods made from the imported materials, because the high prices necessarily charged for such goods place them beyond the reach of the public. Honorable members will see that this item in the tariff has meant a falling off in the consumption of woollen goods, and has increased the difficulty of disposing of our wool yield. It has also added considerably to the number of unemployed persons in our midst. I should not be surprised if this duty has thrown more men out of work than the Government claims to have been employed as a result of it. I am satisfied that this item has been directly responsible for considerable accretions to the ranks of the unemployed. I have here two samples of wool crepe de chine. The wool crepe de chine in the first garment which I have just submitted to the Minister, cost ls. 3d. per square yard. The factory costs of manufacturing the wool amounted to 3s. lid. per square yard, the duty represented 6s. 9d. per square yard. Without any freight or insurance charges, the garment cost 10s. 7d. per yard. Here is an article made of Australian wool which costs the public to land in Australia 10s. 7d. a yard, while the grower nf the wool received only ls. 3d. per square yard of the material. The chief item in the excessive cost of this material is the heavy duty. I again emphasize that this material is not made in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- Apparently the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Keane)</inline> does not. If the imposition of prohibitive duties decreases the use of woollen goods, we help neither the producer of the wool nor the Australian workers. The samples which I have exhibited are only two out of at least 50 classes of articles which are similarly penalized under this item. They are not made in Australia, and are not likely to be made here at present. This duty strikes a serious blow at our wool industry by encouraging the wearing of artificial silk. A heavy duty on these woollen goods, which are worn chiefly by women and children, means either that people pay more for them or are forced to wear substitutes. </para>

                        <para>The imposition of high duties on articles manufactured in other countries which buy wool from us in large quantities, when such goods are not manufactured by us, has resulted in their adopting a policy of retaliation. Australia's prosperity depends largely upon our ability to sell our primary products in overseas markets. Employment for workers in secondary industries is dependent on the purchasing power of the people, which in turn reflects, the success or otherwise of our primary industries. Every action, therefore, which retards or restricts reciprocal trade between Australia and other countries which buy our primary products, makes it more difficult for our primary industries to carry on. I submit that a careful revision of the tariff would reveal many articles which could with advantage be purchased from Great Britain and other nations, and remove the causes for retaliatory action by them. Obviously, the adoption of a policy which unnecessarily restricts our purchases from countries which are the principal buyers of our exportable surplus must eventually react upon ourselves. Decreased purchases from Britain will inevitably mean decreased sales by us to Britain. It is not sufficient' to say that the tariff gives preference to Britain, for where the preferential duties are so high as to amount to prohibition, the preference is of no value. France has already retaliated against our clumsy and ill-considered tariff. Since the introduction of the tariff schedule in November, 1929, that country has imposed retaliatory duties by way of a super tax of 200 per cent, above the previous rates on Australian butter and wheat. Prior to the imposition of the French super tax, the duty on Australian butter entering France was 16s. 4d. per cwt. The super tax raised the duty to 49s. per cwt. As in the case of wheat, the French tariff on Australian butter has been raised until, exclusive of the super tax, it is 32s. 9d. per cwt., and inclusive of that tax, 9Ss. 3d. per cwt. Before the imposition of the super tax, France placed a duty of ls. 6d. per bushel on Australian wheat; under the super tax the duty became 4s. 6d. per bushel. The French tariff has since been raised to 3s. 6d. per bushel exclusive of the super tax, or 10s. 6d. a bushel inclusive of that tax. Japan, Germany, Belgium and Italy are also big purchasers of our principal primary products, on which we depend for our financial recovery. </para>

They are, moreover, articles which, for the most part, are not made in Australia. Those countries, with Great Britain, constitute the chief purchasers of our surplus primary products.

I mentioned, also, the retaliatory action taken by France. During 1928-29 Australia's exports to France were valued at £15,200,000. Those exports included meat and butter, £16,000; wheat and barley, £500,000; wool, hides and skins, £14,500,000 ; minerals, £80,000 ; vegetable substances, £214,000. </para>

                        <para>I am a strong protectionist, and an* always willing and anxious to assist  any deserving Australian industry; but, where an item in the tariff does serious injury to our overseas trade, and causes hardship to both our primary producers and those engaged in secondary industries, I feel that it is time for us to call a halt, and to register our protest against it. These heavy duties cannot possibly help Australia. In order to regain our prosperity we must find a market for our wool, wheat, butter and other primary products. People will not buy woollen goods if, for articles of clothing, the wool in which is worth only 1.3d., they are asked to pay over 10s. a yard when cheaper artificial silk goods are available. The additional duties will assist no one in Australia, and they will do serious injury to many. I move - </para>

                                <para>- I suggest that the matter should have been submitted to the Tariff Board, or that, if the Minister has the board's report on this item, he should make it available to the committee, and endeavour to justify his action in bringing down these proposals. If my amendment is accepted, it will give the Australian woollen industry a better opportunity to find a market for its product which is so much needed. I am informed that neither the articles covered by this item, nor. anything like them, are manufactured in Australia. Many letters have been sent to the Minister indicating the serious injury that will result if the duties are maintained, and I urge the honorable gentleman and the House to accept my amendment. </para>

                            <para>. - I support the amendment of the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis).</inline> I express my regret that the limitation of weight under this sub-item has been altered from 6 oz. to 3 oz. per square yard without being referred to the Tariff Board. The Minister has circulated the report of the board dated the 20th June, 1930, on this item and sub-item, but that report specifically states that the inquiry was confined to a request to alter the definition, " but not including flannel ". If there is another report on the subject which the Minister has not circulated, I suggest that he should postpone the consideration of the item until copies of it have been supplied to honorable members. Incidentally, I should like to acknowledge the prompt manner in which the Minister has, on the whole, circulated the reports of the Tariff Board. In many cases he has seen that honorable members were supplied with copies before the report was tabled. I, for one, very much appreciate that courtesy. The fact, that the honorable gentleman has been obliging in a number of instances make all the more conspicuous those cases in which he has suppressed other reports. I hope that the Minister will tell the committee whether this matter was referred to tie Tariff Board, or whether he has haphazardly rushed in and altered the schedule, with the result that a good deal of money has been put into the pockets of certain manufacturers; but also with the result that much has been done to nullify the efforts that have been made to assist the woollen industry to compete in the manufacture of more attractivelooking fabrics. The woollen industry, supplemented by other industries, has subscribed tens of thousands of pounds to a research fund, in an endeavour to devise technical means to overcome the trade disadvantages under which wool suffers, as compared with silk and artificial silk. As honorable members know, wool is a textile fibre which has specially valuable qualities for clothing  purposes. It has warmth, certain elasticity, and durability. At the same time as compared 'with artificial silk and cotton it has certain disadvantages; it is less showy, will not take dyes so easily, shrinks when washed, and has not the light attractiveness of those materials. One of the results of that technical research has been the production of these light and attractive fabrics, with a weight averaging between 3 and 6 oz. per square yard. Their manufacture has led to a revival in the use of wool, and also to a restriction of the output of artificial silk. In the circumstances it is most unjust and unwise to impose a duty such as this. Even if the local manufacturers used only half of the duty it doubles the price of these woollen goods in Australia, and lessens their competitive power against substitutes. </para>

Perhaps the honorable gentleman has some samples which compare favorably with those of the honorable member for Moreton, and which he can submit, Avith prices, to honorable members while they are waiting for the report of the Tariff Board. The committee may then be able to appreciate exactly what handicap the Minister is placing upon the marketing of Australian wool by introducing these duties. </para>

                        <para>It seems exceedingly short-sighted to impose heavier duties on woollen than on silk and artificial silk goods. I have no special bias in the matter of duties, but I believe in the woollen industry, for which there is a good prospect of effective and economical expansion. The imposition of this heavy duty will make such endeavours futile, and decrease the amount of wool that is now used in this country. Some honorable members opposite who represent city constituencies, and others, like the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lewis),</inline> who come from partly rural districts, believe that if a duty enables a few more men to be employed, it is some gain. They overlook the fact that if, because of the excessive increase in price, less of the commodity will be used, great hardship may be inflicted, which may result in many more being thrown out of work. Recently funds have been collected in South Australia to give relief to farmers' families in certain back country districts, while in the constituency of at least one honorable member opposite, there have actually been cases where children could not be sent to school because they were only clothed in bags. The Minister for Trade and Customs apparently ignores the suffering that he is causing by this indiscriminate imposition of duties. I do think that the honorable gentleman is deliberately causing misery. I attribute it to his lack of vision; to his desire to please those who live in the suburbs of Sydney, and the few monopolists and manufacturers who wait upon him in deputations. </para>

                                <para>- Probably he would. I do not stand for duties of this nature, when people cannot afford to buy even the simplest clothes. If honorable members have taken notice of the trend of the prices of our main commodities, they must be aware of the immense influence that Japanese competition has had lately on our wool prices. That is the result of a comparatively recent change of habit in Japan. The Japanese are particularly fond of their children. In the past, infantile mortality was exceedingly heavy in that country. At the time the Japanese were a silk-wearing people. Gradually European doctors educated them up to the advantages of wool for children's clothing with the result that the use of » that material in Japan has increased enormously and the infantile death rate diminished. It would appear that the Minister is heedlessly following a policy which may reverse the case in Australia. While some Australian children are forced to resort to bagging for clothes, duties such as these make their chance of obtaining proper covering more and more difficult. </para>

It will be recollected that recently certain British wool manufacturers supported a campaign against the granting in Great Britain of preferential duties to Australian primary products. That is merely one example of the hostility engendered abroad by these irritating and short-sighted duties. This feeling of hostility and resentment against the Australian tariff policy is responsible, to some extent at least, for the. present economic depression in Australia. Even if the Minister will not accept the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> I hope that he will agree to the postponement of the item until we have the report of the Tariff Board to guide us. </para>

                            <para>.- I have very little to say with respect to these particular duties, but any observations which I may make will represent, my views concerning not only this item, but the schedule as a whole. I feel that, if Australia cannot find a market for the products of its wool and wheat industries, it will be impossible for this country to get out of its present difficulties. We must, therefore, assist, as far as possible, the sale of these commodities, and particularly the sale of our wool, in the world's markets. To this end it is imperative that we should, for some time to come, be consumers of the manufactured products of the raw materials which we sell. Although there is at Albany, in Western Australia, in the constituency of the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> an efficient woollen mill, its economic importance to Western Australia cannot be regarded as paramount to that of the great pastoral industry in that ' State. If the overseas purchasers of Western Australian wool are not to be permitted to sell any of their manufactured products in that State, obviously, there will be a general decline in the overseas demand for our wool, as well as provocation to economic retaliation which will make impossible the extension of an industry which has been one of our greatest assets in the past, and which, at the moment, is almost priceless in its value to the Commonwealth. particularly from the stand-point of our economic recovery. Therefore, I consider that the contention of the honorable member for Moreton is unanswerable. We must not consider this item only as to its effect in helping to establish the manufacturing industry for which the pastoral industry supplies the raw material. Australia has a very considerable overseas interest bill to meet every year, and to discharge our obligations we must have an excess value of exports. The imposition of unscientific protectionist duties against manufactures of the raw materials which we sell overseas will not help us in that direction. As a protectionist, 1 recognize that, if goods manufactured from our raw materials are not to have a competitive chance in the Australian market, our raw materials will not be given a competitive chance in overseas markets. It is upon this general principle, which, I think, goes to the very root of our fiscal policy, that I appeal to the Government now and indicate my intention to support the amendment. </para>

                            <para>. -When speaking in July of last year upon the general tariff debate, I referred to these increased duties on light woollen piece goods. On that occasion, strangely enough, I followed the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> as I happen to be following him now, and I recall that he spoke then as he spoke to-night. He took the view that it was not wise to encourage the establishment of industries in this country unless it could be proved definitely that ultimately they would be able to supply all our requirements at a reasonable cost. I agreed with him then, and I agree with the views  which he expressed to-night. Last year I urged the Minister to make a careful investigation to ascertain that the increased duties would not detrimentally affect the interests of our wool industry. When the duties were introduced in June last, a number of the leading retail organizations in Melbourne, whose business it is to sell wearing apparel, approached the then Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton).</inline> The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> in a report of the interview with the Minister, stated that the deputation informed him that - </para>

                                <para>- The Minister's statement is at variance with the view expressed by the Brisbane Traders Association. That body informs me that these goods are not being manufactured to any extent in Australia, because, as I understand the position, the limited market available does not justify the installation of the necessary plant. There is no substitute obtainable locally for these particular goods. It must be remembered also that these medium priced dress materials are bought principally by working girls and wives of the workers. The Brisbane Traders Association states that the higher rates of duty will prohibit the importation of these goods, which are largely composed of fine Australian wool, and that the net result will be a further loss of revenue and a considerable decline in the demand for our wool. I feel sure that the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> will appreciate the probable effect of these duties upon a considerable number of his constituents engaged in the pastoral industry. </para>

                            <para>.- It is difficult to understand the attitude of those honorable members who declare that they are supporters of the protectionist policy and yet oppose these duties, which are intended for the protection of this natural Australian industry. Since we grow the best wool in the world, there is no justification for the importation of worsteds and light weight woollen piece goods. </para>

                                <para>- The item refers to light woollen piece goods, which are being produced in many factories throughout the Commonwealth. We have to meet an interest bill overseas of approximately £36,000,000 a year. It is obvious that, if we are to discharge our obligations) we must curtail our importations of those goods which can be manufactured in Australia. I have visited factories in Sydney, Melbourne, Geelong , Bendigo and Ballarat, and have no hestitation in saying that those establishments are in a position to satisfy the demands of the most fastidious women in the Commonwealth with regard to light weight dress materials. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad to have the approval of the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lewis).</inline> The mills in his electorate are working day and night on the production of this class of material. In the 1926 tariff, item 105f 1 covered only woollen piece goods weighing more than 6½ oz. per square yard, the invoice selling price of which did not exceed the equivalent of 3s. 4d. per square  yard. In the 192S tariff, item 105 f 1, the weight per square yard was reduced to 6 oz. and the price limitation was removed. The importation of these goods has been colossal, but there has recently been a. substantial falling off, due to some extent, I admit, to the rate of exchange, but largely to the protectionist policy of this Government. For the year 1927-28, flannel importation's were valued at £46,169, whereas for the year 1929-30, they amounted to only £26,440. The decline in importations in respect to other items is shown in the following statement : - </para>

                        <para class="block">The proposed increases are as follow: - Under item 105 f 1, ls. per square yard and 5 per cent, ad valorem. The weight per square yard in this sub-item has been reduced to 3 oz. A duty of 10 per cent, ad valorem has also been imposed. Knitted piece goods, being an admixture of wool and other fibres, have been removed from this sub-item, and included in item 105 aa. No increase is proposed in item 105 f 3. It will be noted that importations for the years 1928-29 and 1929-30, as compared with the financial year 1927-28, have decreased by approximately £1,000,000, and this decrease is due primarily to three causes: - (1) The decrease in f.o.b. price; (2) the increase in Australian production; (3) and the increased use of artificial silk piece goods. Importations of artificial silk piece goods show a considerable increase, and such goods are becoming a competitor of woollen piece goods. Artificial silk has become a menace to the woollen industry throughout the world. Unless women's fashions change, and they go in for wearing woollen dress materials and cashmere stockings as they did some years ago, the demand for artificial silk will no doubt go on increasing, and the woollen industry will further suffer. </para>

                                <para>- No, I do not think so. Representations have been made to the Government to place a duty on artificial silk, and the request has been referred to the Tariff Board. In September, 1925, increased duties were imposed upon woollen piece goods to develop an industry which must be regarded as a natural secondary industry in a country growing so much wool. This duty was put on by the Bruce-Page Government while  the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten</inline> was Minister for Trade and Customs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten</inline> said that no one could justify continuing the export of our finest wool to the other side of the world when it could be manufactured here.

                                <para>- Some of them sit on the cross benches in this House. Such men have told me that they have no objection to granting protection to the Australian woollen manufacturing industry, because they regard it as a natural industry. We grow the wool here, and it is only proper that it should be spun and woven here also. Another alteration proposed is the deletion of the words " but not including flannel " which appeared in the 1921-28 tariff item. When flannel was excluded from the composite rates of duty under item 105 f 1 it was the intention to exclude only flannel of the kind used in the manufacture of underwear, but owing to the change of fashion in women's dress material, flannel dress goods became the vogue, 'and these goods entered the Commonwealth at the lower rates of duty provided for under item 105 f 2, despite the fact that they were competing with Australian woollen piece goods ordinarily used in the manufacture of outer clothing for human wear. Under the present proposal this anomaly is removed. As the Australian industry has progressed, woollen materials for outer wear weighing lei's than 6 oz. per square yard have been manufactured in Australia, and the weight limit has been reduced from 6 oz. to 3 oz. per square yard in order that Australian manufacturers of woven materials for outer wear may have the same protection in respect of all the materials produced as was previously accorded them on materials weighing more than 6 oz. per square yard. The effect of the reduction in weight limit was immediately noticeable. A market hitherto unexploited by knitters and weavers was placed within their reach, and the opportunity was readily grasped. </para>

                                <para>- The goods are being sold at very reasonable prices. A considerable increase has been noted in the use in other countries of woollen fabrics, particularly light weight dress goods. This trend is considered by one authority to be due more to economic factors than fashions decree, and may be explained by the fact that woollen fabrics have been tending downward in price in relation to artificial silk. This greater use of woollen fabrics abroad would have meant the flooding of the local market with cheap dress woollens, probably " end of season " goods, at prices below cost of production. The Government by increasing the tariff on these goods has conserved a valuable market for local mills. It would have been impossible for our local manufacturers to compete against these threatened imports. The manufacturers have invested hundreds of thousands of pounds in factories in this country. They have been obliged to pay Australian rates of wages, and observe Australian working conditions, and they are, therefore, entitled to protection against importations from cheap-labour countries. The drop in the price of wool is having the effect of inducing the people to resume the use of wool for wearing apparel, and the effect will no doubt be felt in the Australian wool market. Reports from Victoria indicate that during the last few weeks soft-goods manufacturers are experiencing a trade revival. Some factories are finding it difficult to cope with orders, and full staffs are employed, and much overtime has to be worked. "Some of the woollen mills are not able to supply Orders quickly enough. At Geelong the mills are working day and night. From October, 1929, to the present time, there have been produced in Australia 5,669 new designs of wool cloths. Of that number, 4,119 represented entirely new cloth, while the range of new patterns totalled 65,132. Some of the new lines now being manufactured are gabardines, baratheas, marcolene, face cloth, gossamer tweeds, flecked flannel,  tricotines,  crepe cloths, knop tweeds, spot tweeds,  briarproofs,  georgettes, imitation  astrachan,  lace tweeds, a large variety of light weight dress goods for women's wear, sports' worsteds, fancy flannels, fancy dress goods, bunny blankets, and art serges. The large variety and quality of cloths now made are a credit to Australian factories, and their manufacture would never have been attempted but for the tariff. The consensus of opinion in the trade is that local woollen manufacturers have produced goods which the wholesalers and retailers never thought possible. The tariff has made all the difference between success and failure. In many cases the retailers would not believe that the samples shown to them1 were of Australian manufacture. They arc so prejudiced against local manufactures that the only way to convince them is to show them through the mills and let them see the material being made. There is no doubt that a great revival in the manufacture of woollen goods has taken place. That is evident to any one who goes through the mills at Geelong, Melbourne, and Sydney. Even before this trade revival the tariff had proved the means of keeping in employment many employees who otherwise would have been dismissed. In Victoria in </para>

                        <para class="block">October, 1929, the employees engaged in the industry totalled 4,416, while in March of 1929 the employees numbered 3,900. The position of manufacturers in New South Wales indicates that exceptional progress has been made. Employment has increased from 2,667 in October of 1929 to 2,779 in March, 1931, this in spite of the depression. Increased investments in plant and buildings in that State total £222,843, while price reductions from IS per cent, to 33^ per cent, have been made since the increased tariff was imposed. </para>
                        <para>Another important matter to be considered in connexion with these duties is that the more firmly established the local woollen, manufacturing industry becomes, and the larger the range of goods manufactured, the greater is the demand for Australian wool by the local industry. The representatives in this Parliament of wool-growing districts should not overlook that fact. Local woollen manufacturers bidding for choice lines at the wool sales have pushed prices upwards. The Australian manufacturer has now become a factor at the wool sales, and his competition must be to the advantage of the wool-grower. I have here a letter from one of the leading wool-brokers of Australia, which emphasizes this aspect of the matter. I shall not disclose the name of the firm, because I have been asked to treat it as confidential. </para>

                            <para>With reference to your inquiry regarding wool purchased on your account in this centre for hat-making purposes, I desire to state that wool suitable for your trade is, at all times, in keen demand, and I can assure you that when your orders are in the market for this type of wool, higher prices are paid than the overseas buyers are prepared to pay. The chief  competitors  for this class of wool are the Italian, American, and Belgian operators. I  may  ' state that there are always good orders in the market for hat-making wools from these countries, and at all times I am forced to pay very high prices owing to keen competition. </para>
                            <para>Owing to the fact that several of the wool experts in Brisbane know that I select for you, they always advise me if they have a line which they think will suit me, knowing that they will obtain higher prices with your competition. It is rather an anomaly, nevertheless, a fact, that in many instances higher prices have been paid for the short, heavy fleeces of a clip when the quality and length are suitable for hat-making purposes, than have been paid for the leading line of the same clip. </para>
                            <para>I might add that quite recently Japanese buyers have been questioning me regarding the special types of wool which are bought for hat-making, and I am of the opinion that before long they will bc operating on these wools. </para>
                            <para>Following on an instruction which you gave me some years ago to the effect that I was to purchase, irrespective of price, any line which I was positive would be suitable for your requirements, I have been able to outbid overseas buyers, and have, on different occasions, paid extreme prices, thus benefiting the wool-grower. Your orders in this market over the last twelve months have been of considerable importance, not only on those wools which have been ultimately purchased, but the competition on other lines has forced overseas buyers to pay higher prices. </para>

Repeatedly I have been asked to show where there have been reductions; yet when I endeavour to do so, objection is raised to my action. The reductions in the prices of the goods that have been manufactured as a result of this duty range from 18 per cent, to 331/3 per cent. Opposition to the duties comes from freetrade interests, who wish to import from overseas goods that can be manufactured in Australia. </para>

                        <para>This Government came into office on a definite protectionist policy, and it is justified in putting that policy into operation. These tariff schedules fulfil the promise made on the hustings, that woollen manufacturers would be given a measure of protection. This" is a great natural Australian industry. Australia produces the best wool in the world; why, then, should she not manufacture that raw product into the finished article of wearing apparel. I have a great deal more time for men who are prepared to invest hundreds of thousands of pounds in Australian industries - which, at times, I admit, are hazardous enterprises - than for those who invest all that they can spare in bonds, and sit idly by waiting for their interest payments, which they display a marked disinclination to have reduced at any time. Those who invest money in Australian industry provide employment for Australian people, and are, therefore, entitled to be protected against importations from foreign countries. If we were to refrain from imposing duties because of the likelihood of interfering with importations from countries with which we have a favorable trade balance, no Australian industries would be built up, and we should remain for all time hewers of wood and drawers of water. The opponents of the Government contend that Australia should be supporting a much larger population than that which she now has. How can that be brought about unless we build up industries of this kind? We cannot hope to do it by putting more people on the land, to produce commodities of which there is already a surplus in Australia, and that have to be dumped on the markets of the world to compete, in some cases, against the products of black labour countries. The local market is the most advantageous for those producers. What would become of the Paterson butter scheme but for the thousands of persons who are employed by these factories ? How would the sugar industry, or any other primary industry progress, that had to be bolstered up by the local market? It is the people in the cities who afford protection to the primary producers. Of all the items in this schedule, this should most readily be ratified, because its aim is to protect  a  great Australian industry. </para>

That ruling was founded on the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> that a verbatim reading of the contents of a letter was forbidden by the rules, unless the honorable member was prepared to disclose the identity of the writer. </para>

A letter of the nature of that read by the Minister for Trade and Customs clearly is a personal communication, and cannot be regarded as a public document. The honorable gentleman declined to disclose the name of the writer, and according to the rulings to which I have referred I submit that he was not entitled to read the letter when objection was taken to his so doing. </para>

                            <para>Another rule, or principle of debate, may be here added. A Minister of the Grown is not at liberty to read or quote  from a despatch or other State paper not "before the House unless he be prepared to lay it upon the table. This restraint is similar to that rule of evidence in courts of law, which prevents counsel from citing  documents which have not been produced in evidence. The principle is so reasonable that it has not been contested; and when the objection has been made in time, it has been generally acquiesced in. It has also been admitted that a document which has been cited ought to be laid upon the table of the House if it can be done without injury to the public interests. The same rule, however, cannot be held to apply . to private letters or memoranda. </para>

                                <para>- I doubt that. What is meant by that ruling is that the Minister shall convey to the committee at least a general indication of the source from which the letter emanated, so that the committee may be confident that the text of the .letter represents the point of view of some representative body. In this case the Minister has said that he received the letter from a wool-broker. </para>

Lord <inline font-style="italic">R.</inline> Cecil contended that the papers having been cited, should be produced; but the  Speaker  declared that this ruling applied to public documents only.

                            <para>.- Throughout this tariff debate we should endeavour, as far as possible, to put aside prejudice or enthusiasm and to deal with each item on its merits. The compact Queensland party which has strongly supported the duty on cotton, and the embargo on sugar, now opposes duties on woollen goods. The woollen industry is not a phantom industry or one of those which the Minister conjures up and says will employ thousands more workmen, not' is it a hack-yard industry employing two or three persons. </para>

I wonder what the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> would say if I suggested that we should import wheat. The woollen industry is established and it is using the product of our greatest primary industry. </para>

                                <para>- The industry has had this present tariff protection since June last, and although I consider that the present method of bringing down tariff schedules is wrong and that we should have an opportunity of debating them at the time they are introduced, yet because of those increased duties, the woollen mills have, since June last, expended no less than £190,000 on machinery. I have that on the authority of the Melbourne Chamber of Manufactures and the Woollen Manufacturers Association. In addition, the mills have brought out no less than 20,000 new patterns. The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis),</inline> when speaking in opposition to these duties made mention of crepe de chine and other lines more known to feminine than masculine buyers, but I submit that that class of goods comes under sub-item 3 of this item - piece goods, woollen or containing wool, n.e.i., of a class or kind not produced in Australia, . as prescribed by departmental by-laws. The duty on that class of goods is exactly the same as it was before this Government came into power. It has been said that in Australia we do not make light weight woollens. That was said to me to-day, and I took the opportunity to telegraph to the returned soldiers mill at Geelong on the subject. </para>

I remind those honorable members on both sides of the chamber, who have no faith in their own country - and there are some - that Australian suitings are, at any rate, equal to the world's best. I cannot remember wearing anything but Australian-made suitings and although there is a diversity of opinion about women's dress materials, the fact remains that over 20,000 new patterns have been brought out, showing that the manufacturers have engaged in a great deal of research work, have exercised much patience, and are, therefore, deserving of every encouragement. </para>

The biggest importers of textiles into Australia such as Myers Limited, Foy and Gibson's Limited, and others, have established their own woollen mills.

                                <para>- The fact remains that they have established their own woollen mills. The Geelong mill, in the elec- torate of the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lewis),</inline> pays in wages no less than £7,000 a week. There are some excellent mills in Australia, the majority of them in Victoria. The honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> has instanced one mill at Albany which is but a small establishment. There are many large mills in Melbourne, Sydney and Geelong, as well as in provincial towns, that deserve encouragement, and unless we take this opportunity to assist them it is likely that many workers in the industry will be thrown out of employment. Then again there should be a more liberal interpretation of departmental by-laws. At present an importer may bring out a certain line of goods and unexpectedly have to pay a high duty on them, merely because the customs official decides that similar articles are being manufactured here. Expert opinion should be called in before any such decision is given. I support this increased duty because, if imposed, it will enable the mills to carry on. A Geelong wool-buyer and wool-scourer has told me that he has become a protectionist because he found that he could get a better price for his wool by selling it in Geelong than by sending it overseas. </para>

                            <para>. - I  was surprised at the attitude of the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. D</inline> Cameron), who is a wool-grower and a man who, probably, knows more about the wool industry than most people. When I asked him how this duty affected the wool-grower, he referred me to the remarks of the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker),</inline> saying that that honorable member had expressed the wool-growers' case. I had already listened attentively to the honorable member for Wakefield. I notice that when a person has a weak case he generally uses violent and angry words. At any rate the honorable member did so. I should imagine that the fact that the Australian manufacturer was in competition with the overseas buyer for the raw material would  give the wool-grower another market for his wool and enable him to secure a better price for it. The honorable member for Wakefield told us that the price of wool had increased in Japan. The wool-buyers tell me that the increase, which is only a slight one, is attributable to the instructions given by the League of Nations that Japan must provide for its workers an 8-hour day and a better standard of living, the result being a greater purchasing power among the Japanese people. In 1923-24 the quantity of wool used in Australian production, was 11,795,564 lb. The quantity used in 1928-29 was 23,376,591 lb. Thus the weight of the wool used in local manufactures practically doubled in five years. With a growing population why should we not manufacture our own raw material into the finished product? We ought to have more and more industries. Are we content to be the wood and water joeys for other nations? The value of woollen goods manufactured in Australia in 1923-24 was £4,863,657; the value had increased, to £7,477,295 in 1928-29. In 1923-24 the number of hands employed in Australian woollen mills was 7,532; the number increased to 11,405 in the years 1928-29. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, in normal years. Judging by the increase of employment in this industry in five years, the additional protection the Minister has given to industry would, in normal years, have given work to the number of nien he predicted. The honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. D. Cameron)</inline> put it to me, as member for a district in which there are quite a number of wool-growers, that these duties will have a detrimental effect on the wool-grower. Let me in turn put it to the honorable member that the duties will do more for the wool-grower than the duties on cotton piece goods will do for cotton-growers. The honorable member voted for the cotton duties ; I ask him to be consistent. It is useless to argue that these duties apply only to highclass materials. We know that they can be manufactured in Australia, and that they were not to any extent prior to the imposition of these duties. </para>

                        <para>It is said that Great Britain is a great buyer of our wool. Is not Australia a great buyer of British commodities? And do we not give Great Britain a preference of 25 per cent. ? What has Britain given us in return? When Russia flooded the British market with wheat the only consideration of the British people was for the market in. which they could buy at the cheapest price. During the collapse in our meat industry, what preference did Great Britain give to Australian beefgrowers over the Argentine? The man who buys our wool does not buy it out of sympathy with us. He buys it because he needs it for the manufacture of his goods. As a result of the protection afforded to the woollen manufacturer, not. only has there been more competition to buy the wool from the grower, but the price of suit lengths and suitings is to-day lower than it was before these additional duties were imposed. It. is certainly true that owing to the falling wage, and to the fact that the consumption power of the community has decreased, there has been a falling off in. the purchase of quite a number of lines, but the duties on crepe de chines do not affect the worker. We are told by the Minister that the Geelong mills are working night and day. I hop? that they are working on the shift system, and not on overtime. The more we can distribute work the better. What wc need in this country is more co-operation, and more support for our own industries. I refer the honorable member for Brisbane and the honorable member for Moreton to the views of the Queensland Preference League, behind which they frequently take shelter, and I refer honorable members for Queensland electorates generally to the fact that help to the worker in the woollen industry is practical help to the worker in the sugar industry.

It was only during the war that oar 'commodities sold freely, but that was because there was a fixed price. Under the assumption that we were patriotic people the price was fixed at a lower figure than was obtainable by other countries. This protection, instead of being a disadvantage, is an asset to the wool-growers. Between 1923-24 and 1928-29, the purchases of wool by Australian manufacturers have doubled, and as a result prices have been kept at a higher level than they would have been had there been no Australian buyers in the market. </para>

                            <para>.- In presenting a very weak case, the Minister inflicted upon the committee another lecture, in the course of which he charged honorable members sitting on the Opposition side with freetrade tendencies. But for the protectionist disposition and activities of the parties to which honorable members on this side belong, there would have been no artificially protected industries in this country. But for their tariff-making until a couple of years ago, there would have been practically no secondary industries, and not a single chamber of manufactures. That is the answer to the Minister's cheap gibes. The honorable gentleman indulged in generalities regarding the superior quality of Australian wool. He said that it is the best in the world, and that we should convert it into fabrics instead of exporting it. If we manufactured even a substantial proportion of our wool into fabrics, what would we do with them? Because of the excessive manufacturing costs, we could not sell competitively a single yard outside the Commonwealth. By the introduction of this item, the Minister is making  r  definite and heavy addition to the cost of every branch of manufacture, because he is increasing the price of the wearing apparel of every woman worker. We on this side of the chamber are in favour of reasonable, even generous, protection of this industry, but wo are opposed to a degree of protection which amounts practically to prohibition. The Minister is doubling the fixed duties, adding 6 per cent, to the ad valorem duties and halving the weight per yard on which these fabrics become dutiable. The woollen mills of Australia represent a very creditable branch of manufacturing, but, because of their limited output, they have necessarily a restricted range of production, and cannot possibly cater for the local market in respect of all the classes of fabrics contemplated by the Minister. I ask the honorable gentleman to observe some reasonable degree of uniformity in connexion with the various import duties. He is proposing a duty of 2s. a square yard, plus 35 per cent, ad valorem, upon these light woollen piece goods; yet he is, admitting their greatest competitors - artificial silk and real silk - at revenue duties of 25 per cent, and 10 per cent, respectively. That is characteristic of the hopeless inconsistency of this tariff, and of the rough and ready, slipshod manner in which it has been prepared. It is the most muddle-headed schedule ever submitted to this Parliament. I particularly appeal to honorable members to have some regard to the costs of dress stuffs of all women and girls who work for small wages or salaries. Even though this duty may benefit a few manufacturers and a few thousand employees, there is no justification for providing the opportunity to double the price of many woollen piece goods used for women's wearing apparel. The calm acquiescence of ministerial supporters in the constant raising of the prices of household necessities is heart-breaking. It was observable right through the division relating to groceries, and the same reckless and indiscriminate provision of opportunities for price-raising is being continued in connexion with textiles. I am ready to give to manufacturers a generous opportunity to compete  against their oversea rivals; but I am not prepared to help to create a big monopoly. What must be the inevitable outcome of this reckless policy? No doubt, for a little time we shall have considerable competition, which will be carried to the extent of ratecutting and profitlessness. The opportunity presented by the Minister through' the tariff looks so wonderful that, in some industries, particularly textiles, there is already installed enough plant to supply two or three times the requirements of the Australian people. As a result of the initial heavy competition.  within thu Commonwealth, the consumer will benefit for a time ; but, in the absence of any external check, the various companies will soon come together in a price- fixing combination. That <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> the invariable development. I believe in the merging of big manufacturing units ; but I do not favour making opportunities for combination in the absence of competition from outside. The manufacturers will regulate the price to the Australian consumer at a level which will return profits, dividends or interest, on the whole of the capital invested in this industry, whether the factories are working full time or part time. lt is entirely wrong for this to be done iu the National Parliament, and it is incomprehensible to me that it should be done deliberately by honorable members who belong to a Labour party. Such a policy must not only fail to benefit the workers; it must result in their exploitation. The creation of monopolies in any country has always had a detrimental effect on the people - the consumers generally, and particularly on the poorer sections of the community. </para>

                        <para>At a time of hardship, such as that which Australia is now experiencing, it might reasonably be expected that there would be a great clearing up in all industrial concerns, a sweeping out of all excessive capital, a writing-off of watered capital, and a bringing of all manufacturing concerns to a level of efficiency, with their capital down to what it should be. But the Government is not assisting iu that direction; it is providing opportunities for every company, irrespective of whether it has spent its capital badly - I do not say that all companies have done that, but many of them inevitably have - to fix prices by agreement, in order to make a profit on its full capital, no matter what the amount may be. This policy of the Government is a calamitous thing for Australia, and it stands in the way of a real economic recovery. It imposes a handicap on the community that will be felt for many years. The Minister is not only assisting industries and workers by this tariff, but he is also placing heavy shackles upon them. I urge honorable members opposite to consider this matter on broad lines, and to revive their old, distinctive antagonism to monopolies in every shape and form. I beg them now to show their dislike for monopolies, however they may be created, to east ofl the fetters of party for a few weeks, and to wipe out many of these increases in duties. </para>
