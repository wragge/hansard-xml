Thp Captain Superintendent, Sydney, was therefore instructed to withdraw from sale any clothing or bedding which might be suitable for the relief of distress, and to forward particulars of all such articles to the Navy Office. Action had already been taken to reserve any blankets suitable for issue to relieve distress. No blankets, therefore, appear in the printed catalogue. </para>

                        <para>.- It has been made clear over and over again during the course of the tariff debate that the Government has paid no attention whatever to the reports of the Tariff Board, and in view  of  that fact, I urge the  Government,  on the ground  of  economy, to abolish the Tariff Board, and pay off its members. To keep the board in existence would be a sheer waste  of  money, seeing that the Government persistently disregards its findings. At present the Government is playing a game  of make-believe. The board goes through the pretence of holding inquiries; it has long and expensive sittings' - expensive not only to the Government, but to manufacturers and other interested parties - and then, when finally it presents a report, no notice whatever is taken of it. </para>

                            <para>- No ; it is on the part of the Government, which is worse. The sham of these inquiries must be evident to every honorable member. Why maintain this useless and costly tribunal when the Government ignores its findings if it thinks fit ? Why go through the farce day after day of presenting to this House the board's reports, which have cost so much to prepare, and which will cost a good deal more to print. The Government makes a great parade of certain little economies. Last night, for example, we heard of the Government's proposal to abolish the Commonwealth Physical Training Staff, which has been engaged in training the youth in our schools. It is claimed that £4,000 will be saved in this way, but I am confident that the cost of the Tariff Board inquiries, and of printing its reports, amounts to more than £4,000. We are not justified at this time in continuing such expense when the board's reports are merely brushed aside with contempt by the Minister, if they do not suit him or his friends. </para>

                        <para>. - If honorable members do not wish the Tariff Board's reports to be printed, we can certainly save money by not. having it done, but up to the present the printing has been undertaken for the convenience of honorable members themselves. Honorable members must recognize that the Tariff Board is an advisory body to which certain subjects are referred for inquiry and report. The Government or the Minister, however, is not bound to follow the advice of the board in all matters. </para>

                            <para>- No Government has felt itself bound to adopt all the recommendations of the Tariff Board. About a fortnight ago the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> quoted in the House a passage in the Tariff Board annual report for 1928, which took the Minister for Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> to task . for not following the recommendations of the board. At that time it was complained that the Minister had departed from the board's recommendations when it suited him. The representations of the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> to the effect that it might be advisable to abolish the board will receive consideration, as will any additional particulars he may care to add in support of his contention. This Government gives full consideration to the reports of the Tariff Board ; it adopts some and does not. adopt others, and in so doing is following the example set by the Minister for Customs in the last . Government. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten</inline> was criticized in 1928 for acting in that way, he said that the Tariff Board was merely an advisory body, and that a government was not bound to carry out its recommendations - that the board was not. above Parliament, but that Parliament was supreme. That is the stand which the present Government takes. </para>

                        <para>.- Under this item it is proposed to place a revenue duty of 5 per cent, on British textiles. I do not think that the Government is justified in raising revenue from the necessary clothing of the peopled: . I am prepared, in. the special circumstances in which we find ourselves, to agree to the imposition of revenue duties on luxuries, and the other day, for instance, I supported the increased duties on brandy and whisky for that reason. Such commodities  are  undoubtedly luxuries, but that cannot  be  said of the clothing of the people. The fact that such articles are as expensive as they are to-day is one of the chief causes for our delay in returning to anything like normal trading conditions. The prices of textiles in Australia has  remained practically at the same level for years, while in Britain the price of textiles has declined even more than has the price of primary products. Professor Copland pointed out recently that, as compared with the 1926 figures, there had been practically no fall in- the price of finished goods in Australia, but that during the same period the price of the raw products which enter into the manufacture of the necessaries of life, had declined by 40 per cent. He went on to say that the whole of the decline in the cost of living has come from the fall in the price of raw products from the farm. We should take steps to bring down as quickly as possible the price of manufactured goods. If  Ave  can do that we shall be able to restore the buying power of their wages to our workers. At the beginning of this year the Federal Arbitration Court reduced the standard basic wage by 10 per cent., which lowered the purchasing, power of the wage-earners. Certain cost of living reductions also occurred; but as they made  no  change in the purchasing power I shall not further consider them at the moment. When, concurrently with that wage reduction, the Government imposed duties which increase the prices of textiles and other necessaries, th depreciation of the purchasing power of the wage-earners is very great, indeed. It must be remembered that these are not protective duties; that these articles cannot be made in Australia. The tax was imposed because the  Government  realized that huge quantities of these piece goods are imported, and that a duty of 5 per cent, would bring between £200,000 and £300,000 per annum in our revenue. Every economist of standing agrees that until there is a closing up of the margin that exists between the wholesale and retail prices we cannot expect a general trade recovery. Our great exportable raw materials have slumped. It is interesting to review the position in Great Britain. The following statistics are from <inline font-style="italic">The Economist</inline> of the 10th January, 1931 .--Taking the 1927 index number as 100, it is disclosed that in 1924 the index number for textiles was 136. S, while at the end of December, 1930, it was 51.4, a difference of 85.4. The fall in the price of textiles in Great Britain has been much greater than that in the price of cereals or the drop in wages. Dealing then with the price of cereals and meat, and putting the 1913 index number as 100, it is shown that the average index number for 1924 was 168.5, whereas at the end of December, 1930, it was 103.3. For the same years the index numbers for textiles were 214.7 and 80.7. It is apparent that in Great Britain the purchasing power of wages is relatively materially better than in Australia. In an endeavour to lift the load from our wage-earners and the community generally as quickly as possible, I move - </para>

                            <para>- No. Whereas these goods previously came into Australia free under the British preferential tariff, they now carry an impost duty of 5 per cent, under that tariff, 15 per cent, under the intermediate tariff, and 25 per cent, under the general tariff. I commend my amendment to the committee as an honest endeavour to reduce the price of these necessaries. </para>

                        <para>. - This is another of the duties which are too high. The imposition of excessive duties of this nature entirely removes the element of competition. It simply means that none of these goods will be imported, and that Australian production will be limited to very few designs. There will be no competition to compel our manufacturers to improve the quality of their output. In the past, huge importations of piece goods have brought considerable revenue to the Commonwealth. Duties such as are now imposed will reduce that revenue, and make it necessary to impose other taxation to make up the deficit. I object to these duties, first because they are too high, secondly, because by reducing them our revenue will improve, and thirdly, as was pointed out by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> because these commodities are in every-day use by the wage-earners. If these duties are maintained, the price charged for necessary articles of apparel will be beyond the means of those who most need them, a most regrettable position, particularly in winter. It is extraordinary that a Labour Government should seek to penalize the working section of the community in such a fashion. I support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- 1 also support the amendment moved by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> Honorable members should keep in mind the excessively high rate of these duties, particularly in view of the fact that Australian manufacturers have at their command the cheapest and finest raw material that is obtainable in the world. Our manufacturers have many advantages over their overseas competitors. - They may purchase wool at the wool sales during the morning and have it transported to their factories and begin to process it the same afternoon, with the result that the completed article can be available for sale the following week. Contrast that with the position of their overseas competitors. They have to -purchase the wool, and arrange for its shipment to their home country. That means a delay of between five and six weeks. The wool has then to be transported to the factories, scoured, and made into garments. Freight has to be paid on all waste. After a lapse of months, the completed articles are sent back to Australia. All that time overseas manufacturers ave standing out of the money that they paid for the raw material and for the manufacturing processes. In view of all those advantages there is something wrong when Australian textile manufacturers cannot compete in the local market without the aid of an exorbitant duty. </para>

Judging by his well-known en- . enenthusiasm for high duties, I would say that he would regard a person with a belief in high protection as an expert.

                            <para>- The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson),</inline> with his flair for figures, has calculated that the duties imposed in respect of certain items in the schedule are equivalent to a protection of some thousands per cent. I suppose that the person who recommended the application of those duties would be regarded as the " noblest Roman of them all ". There is, undoubtedly, to-day, with or without the knowledge of the Minister, a conspiracy between certain organized employers and employees to keep prices up to a high level, with the assistance of heavy customs duties. Many of the duties in this schedule are absurdly high and far outside the realm of reasonable protection. I believe that this schedule will go down in history as that which provided the highest duties, and this will be regarded as the period of our fiscal madness. </para>

                            <para>- It was first made some time ago; but it was recently reviewed. It allows for a decline of 40 per cent, on the figures for 1929-30 in the importation of the goods affected. I . point out that great Britain has been given an additional preference of 5 per cent. I wish it were not necessary to raise £265,000 of revenue by this means ; but in the existing circumstances we cannot avoid it. </para>

                            <para>- I have that under consideration at present. When this Government came into office it was faced with a huge adverse trade balance. To rectify that, it imposed increased duties and embargoes. As a result of that policy an adverse trade balance of £13,000,000 for the first eight months ending February, 1930, has been changed into a favorable trade balance of £6,000,000 for the eight months ending March, 1931. </para>

                            <para>- I agree that there were other factors, but the prohibitions imposed by ' the- Government contributed largely to the favorable trade balance. Honorable members opposite who have asked that revenue duties be removed, have had a good deal to say about the  necessity for balancing the budget and for raising revenue; but when the Government suggests a means of raising revenue it is criticized by honorable members opposite. They say that reductions should be made in this or that tax, but when we propose to curtail expenditure all sorts of objections are raised. When the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> eliminated certain activities in respect of physical culture in State schools, he was immediately asked to restore that expenditure. Honorable members opposite cannot have it both ways. If they are sincere in their desire to balance the budget they should at least allow the Government to raise sufficient revenue to enable it to meet the cost of certain very necessary social services, such as invalid and old-age pensions, the maternity bonus, and a reasonable remuneration to public servants. The Governments of Australia are faced with a huge deficit of approximately £15,000,000 at the end of the coming financial year. The Commonwealth deficit will inevitably be large, and, if we do not attempt to rectify it, we shall be subject to considerable criticism from honorable members opposite. We have saved £3,500,000 in respect of the cost of government. Extra tariff revenue is necessary to enable us to pay for the necessary services of the Commonwealth, and I sincerely hope that the committee will not reduce this item. </para>

                            <para>- These duties have been imposed entirely for revenue purposes, with no intention on the part of the Government to assist in establishing industries within Australia. These duties are really camouflaged attempts to reduce the wages of the workers. Yesterday, my colleague and I indicated our views with respect to the duty on tea, and we are adopting a similar attitude on this item. The Government contends that revenue is needed in order that the budget may be balanced. No one denies that; but we say that the process now being adopted in order to obtain that revenue is iniquitous. </para>

                        <para>.- It is refreshing to me to learn that the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge)</inline> has at last seen the light. He has openly stated that the excessive tariffs imposed by this Government have had the effect of reducing the wages of the worker.?. This is the first time that that admission has been made by representative Labour in this chamber, and I think the honorable member's attitude does him much credit. Some 15 months ago, the present Minister brought in many revenue items, including the item that we are now discussing. I remember his flamboyant statement about the hundreds of thousands of persons who would obtain employment as the result of the tariff which he was then introducing. Unfortunately, in the majority of instances, his anticipations have not been realized. The manufacture of many lines, as then promised, has not even been commenced, and the tariff has utterly failed in its object. The ruse now adopted by the Minister to escape from the just criticism of the Opposition is to state that these items are purely for revenue purposes. I remember the protestations of the Minister and his colleagues that the increased duties were being imposed, not for revenue purposes, because that would have the effect of raising prices, and so  011, but for purely protective purposes, with the object of establishing industries in Australia. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> touched on an important point when he referred to the agreements entered into between the Labour unions and the manufacturers. The employers and the employees in industry, working in concert, and with the connivance of the Government of the day, were able to raise prices to the community to their own mutual satisfaction. There were many such instances even before the present Government took office. The shipping industry afforded a striking example. For years, the employers  and the employees agreed upon a consistent series of increases in freights and passage money which were passed on to the public until the time came when the people could not afford the high charges. As a result the shipping trade diminished, and the shippers and their employees were soon in a worse position than before. Coal-mining is another magnificent example of an Australian industry which has been almost ruined because of the conspiracy entered into between the employers and the employees, connived at by the Government of the day. The sugar industry has been subjected, to some extent, to similar treatment, as have also those manufacturing cigars, confectionery, matches, iron and steel, particularly sheet iron. My chief objection to the present method of framing the tariff is that it permits of a combination of the employers and employees in industry, to the detriment of the consuming public. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the amendment. Many of the articles under this item are not manufactured in Australia and, therefore, the Minister cannot claim that the duty is protective. Moreover some of these articles are the raw material of other branches of manufacture, and the imposition of additional duties upon them merely increases the ultimate cost of manufactured goods. The Minister whenever he finds himself hard pressed to defend an item at once leans on the revenue, and points out that, although the duty is excessive and cannot be justified as a protective measure, the revenue must be safeguarded. Members of the Opposition consider that there are other avenues for the raising of revenue that are preferable to duties which have no other effect than to increase <inline font-style="italic">t)ie</inline> cost of living, particularly to the workers. Sheetings, flannelettes, cretonnes, and shirtings, are bought in proportionately greater quantities by the workers than by other sections of the community, and I am glad that honorable members in the Ministerial corner realize that these imposts can only add to the cost of living of the working classes. The Minister has stated that it is necessary to impose these revenue duties if the assistance given to the people by way of pensions and bounties is to be continued. It is an unsound and illogical policy which gives to a pensioner £1 a week with one hand, and with the other hand takes from him by increasing the price of the necessaries of life. </para>

                        <para>.- The group to which I belong believes that revenue can be raised by methods different from those proposed by either the Government or the self-professed friends of the workers on the Opposition side. We do not want the patronage of those honorable gentleman who have welcomed our opposition to this item. We prefer their censure, because their applause causes us to examine very closely our attitude. We have been told that the employers and workers have been conspiring to raise duties. The members of the Opposition are merely the marionettes of the financial institutions whose bidding they are sent here to do. I am under no misapprehension regarding the sincerity of their professed interest for the workers. Only yesterday one of their number said that water was good enough for the workers to drink, and to that sentiment, another member of the Opposition said, "Hear, hear." </para>

The Minister has admitted that this item is for revenue ' purposes only. It is not right to raise revenue at the expense of the workers. If the Government must have additional funds, it should be courageous enough to tackle the international boodlers who have been fleecing Australia for many years. If it will do that it will have the support of the group to' which I belong. If the item were to protect an existing industry, or make possible the establishment of a new one which would give employment to our workers, I would be disposed to support it; but as the Minister has said that the duty is imposed for revenue purposes only, and has adduced no reason why a representative of Labour should support it, I shall vote against it. </para>

                            <para>- It is a tax to raise more funds for the Government, which, because of its unfortunate policy, has not been able to obtain financial accommodation in other ways. It is unjust that the workers should be penalized by the increased duty of 5 per cent. ; the 25 per cent, duty in the general tariff is immaterial, because most cotton goods are obtained from the United Kingdom. The worker who cannot afford to buy woollens is dependent on cotton goods, and I regret that the Minister has not seen fit to accept a reasonable amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for East Sydney read a letter from a union, which stated that the manufacturers who are benefiting by the new duties are now applying for a reduction of the wages of their employees, and have not reduced the prices of their goods. That was merely a clever piece of propaganda intended to mislead the committee and bring, the workers further under the thumb of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline> The Textile Workers Federation covers all States but New South Wales and Queensland. In New South Wales a 44-hour week obtains, and the rates of ay are different from those in other States.  Consequently, the employers in that State have either to remove their industry to Victoria, in which most, of the mills are situated, or apply to be brought under the Federal Arbitration Court. They have followed the latter course, and that has necessitated the serving of a log on every employee in the trade. The information given to the committee in regard to prices was absolutely misleading. Manufacturers are carrying on under great difficulties, and whether they wish it or not, competition is forcing down prices. I am informed by the Woollen Manufacturers Association that 20,000 new patterns of dress goods are being made, that £190,000 has been expended on new buildings and plant, and that in the 28 mills in Australia, the average price reduction has been 21 per cent. That is true, not only of States covered by federal awards, but of New South Wales also. I hope those facts will dispose of the electioneering tactics that have been adopted by the representatives in this chamber of the Lang gang. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to support the Government in imposing a British preferential duty of 5 per cent, on cotton, linen, and other piece goods. I recognize that this is not a protective duty, but distinctly a revenue-producing one. I take the same stand in regard to this impost as I did yesterday with respect to the tea duties. I support it because revenue must be found. I am somewhat surprised that certain members on the Opposition side are opposed to this duty, but the views expressed by members of the Lang group cause no astonishment, since their party does not believe in paying anything at all. I hope that these members will not repeat the inaccurate statement made yesterday that I had declared that water was good enough for the workers. While I favour this revenue duty on cotton and linen goods, I ask the honorable member on my left, who misrepresented me yesterday, not to say that I announced to-day that fig leaves were sufficient clothing for the workers. </para>

                        <para>.- This increase of duty on cotton piece goods is one of the few imposts in support of which sound argument can be found. The country needs revenue. About £13,000,000 worth of cotton goods are imported annually, and, as an extreme measure, the imposition of this duty is justified. This is practically the largest single import item in our list of imports. We must raise funds to meet the extraordinary deficit which faces the country, and this very large item of imports gives us a field of indirect taxation that cannot be entirely overlooked. The impost is only 5 per cent. Had the Government taken other steps, it would not have been necessary to resort to this impost. </para>

                        <para>.- I find myself in a difficulty over this item. I know that the Government must have more revenue, but its need is due mainly to its own shortcomings. Had it adopted a sound financial policy, and made a sincere effort, by economies, to balance its budget, an odious revenue duty of this kind need not have been imposed. This is a most objectionable impost, because it is placed on raw materials. It is a tax levied at the bottom, and by the time it reaches the people in the increase in price of made-up goods, it will represent, not 5 per cent., but at least 10 per cent. The Government imposes a high duty to enable manufacturers to turn out cotton goods in Australia, and then it proceeds to tax the raw material. Such a procedure shows an entire absence of intelligent contact between the Treasury and the Customs Department. The Minister for Trade and Customs should not entertain a request from the Treasury that a tax be imposed on the raw material of a protected industry. I support all that has been said by way of objection to this impost, because very largely it means a charge upon the wearing apparel of the workers, and is, therefore, a straight-out tax on wages, thereby adding directly to the cost of production. The Government, however, will not resort to sound financial methods, but since revenue must be found, I will support the tax; the responsibility for which must rest entirely upon the Government. </para>

                        <para>.- I thank the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> for the courtesy which he extended to me last week by postponing the consideration of this important item. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">An increase in the general duty on this item has been imposed, and I understand that this has been done simply for the purpose of securing revenue. I am quite prepared to assist the Minister in that direction, if he will give me an assurance that a certain proportion of the money to be obtained, which, I- understand, will be a substantial sum, will be used for the purpose of assisting the establishment of the fish industry in Australia on a fairly large scale. In 1927, a conference of representatives of the various Governments of Australia, Commonwealth and State, was held to deal with this subject. A number of sub-committees of the conference sat during the following two years, and the conference finally reported to the Commonwealth Government in July, 1929. Nothing has been done in connexion with that report, which stated that the industry, if properly developed, would render unnecessary the importation of £1,500,000 worth of fish each year into Australia, and would provide employment for 18,000 men. Moreover, the fishing industry would prove an admirable training ground for naval recruits. During the war it was found in Great Britain that the men of the fishing fleets were able, better than any one else, to undertake the work of mine sweeping. For several years past the average annual importation of fish into Australia has been about 15,000 tons. Its value is approximately £1,500,000, and this is in addition to the manures, oils, and glue which are obtained from fish,, and which are imported for stock feeding and fertilizing purposes. As showing how the public taste for fish has increased, I may point out that in 1901, at the time of federation, Australia imported only £334,000 worth of fish, and two years later it was £1,500,000. The Australian production of fish in 1901 was valued at £325,000, whereas for 1929 it was valued at £1,200,000. Although there has thus been a marked increase in the consumption of fish, ' that increase would be much greater if it were possible to distribute fresh fish over a wider area, and if the industry were assisted by a scientific investigation into the habits of the fish which are to be found along our coasts to permit of them being sold cheaply to the people of Australia. </para>
                    <para class="block">The consumption of fish in Australia has increased by nearly 500 per cent, in the last 30 years, but Australia may still be described as fish-hungry. In this country we consume, on an average, 14 lb. of fish per head a year, while in Great Britain the consumption per head is about 45 lb. It is true that Australians eat much more meat than do British people, but then so do New Zealanders, who yet contrive to eat nearly twice as much fish as do Australians - about 20 lb. a head per annum. </para>

                    <para>I am convinced that, if the fishing industry were properly encouraged, we would be able to reduce our imports of fish almost to vanishing point, and before long would even be able to export fish to the East. We should take steps to garner the harvest of the sea, instead of devoting ourselves entirely to the harvest of the soil. </para>
                    <para>What special opportunities has Australia for developing the fishing industry ? First of all, we have the longest coastline of any single country in the world. Australia is an island with a coast-line of 12,000 miles, along the greater portion of which edible fish is plentiful; yet we import £1,500,000 worth of fish each year. With the exception of one or two places like Katoomba, the inland towns of Australia are entirely dependent on canned fish imported from overseas. As a result, fish is more or less a luxury in Australia, whereas, if it could be obtained at a price to suit our purse, we should find that it would suit our palates very well, also. At present about 6,000 men are employed in the fishing industry in Australia, but, if the industry were developed to the point of supplying the whole of the local market, that number could easily be increased to 18,000. </para>

                            <para>- The report of the conference has only recently been made available. We have been waiting for the necessary information. Fishing could be carried on in Australia under much more pleasant conditions than those experienced in most other countries where an extensive fishing industry exists. Our fishermen would not have to face the storms and cold which prevail in the North Sea between Great Britain and Europe, and on the fishing banks of Newfoundland. First of all, we need information to enable us to select and explore suitable fishing grounds off our coast, and then we must build up a fishing population to man the fleets. Even from the limited amount of information we now have, it is evident that abundant supplies of fish are available. New South Wales is the only State which., up to the present, has carried out any intensive investigation into the subject, aud it has been learned that on the New South Wales coast there are no fewer than 506 distinct species of fish fauna, of which at least 250 branches are found in sufficient quantities to make the catching of them a commercial proposition. We import, roughly, £300,000worth of pilchards each year, and yet the seas of Eastern Australia simply teem with this variety of fish. It has been shown that we could use in Australia £1,000,000 worth more of deep sea, trawled fish, the catching and preparation of which would employ 500 seamen on the trawlers, and at least 2,600 men on shore, if we cheapened and improved distribution and marketing in our inland towns. That would be in addition to those fishing in the estuaries along the coast, who also would be put on a much more stable basis. As to the possibilities of the industry, let me point out what took place in British Columbia, a country which has a smaller coastline than ours. In 1925 the authorities set out to encourage the fishing industry, and by the end of the year, not only had larger quantities of fish been marketed, but there had been produced 1,500 tons of fish meal for cattle and 500,000 gallons of oil. Three years later the industry produced 14,500 tons of meal valued at about £300,000 and 3,667,000 gallons of fish oil, worth about £700,000. A ready market is available for the by-products of the fishing industry. Germany imports 100,000 tons of fish meal each year for poultry and pig feeding, in addition to what is supplied by its own fishing industry. In the United States of America, which has a smaller coastline than ours, no fewer than 190,000 persons are employed in the  fishing industry and £40,000,000 of capital is sunk in the trawling industry, fishing boats and canning establishments throughout the country. Last year the canning factories added £22,000,000 to the value of the fish treated. </para>

                    <para>Before this industry can be properly developed in Australia further research work is necessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> has been interested in this subject for many years, and at the Fish Conference to which I have referred he submitted proposals for the expenditure of between £S,000 and £9,000 a year on scientific trawling investigation, to be carried out in the existing boats. It was suggested that the Commonwealth Government should find the money for this work. A much more elaborate scheme, to cost between £60,000 and £70,000, was also put forward, but I do not press for its adoption. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmills</inline> more modest proposal would serve quite well as a beginning. Such an investigation would enable us to make certain that we can furnish all the year round a steady supply of fish to the public, and indicate its exact source. It is important that the supply should be continuous. The second important requirement is the provision of better means of distribution throughout Australia. It has been shown that by the process of quick freezing fish can be kept in good condition for as long as four months. The Commonwealth Government should negotiate with the State Governments with a view to having them provide proper transport facilities, so that the fish can be carried from the coast to the inland towns. Further, of the revenue derived from this increased duty, a certain amount should be made available for the payment of a bounty on the production of canned and smoked fish in Australia. Already a very fine quality of canned crayfish is on the market, equal to that produced in any other part of the world. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> E. Pratten, who went into this matter many years ago when he was interested in the canning industry, stated on one occasion that the mullet, pilchards, and other fish to be had in the coastal waters of Australia were ideal for canning purposes. They contain such a quantity of oil that they are quite as good as salmon for canning purposes. I am confident that if the Government gave an immediate bounty, and an assurance that a protective duty would be imposed later, an industry would be established that would be of great importance to Australia. It was stated in the 1927-29 reports that the establishment of the Australian fishing industry on a national basis was of vital importance, not only to this country, but to the British Empire generally. At that time it was declared that to establish the industry in Australia, Great Britain was prepared to make available, at 1 per cent., some of the money set apart for migration purposes, in order that the British Empire might be made as self-contained as possible from the point of view of food supplies. I urge the Minister to give the committee an assurance in connexion with the two recommendations I have put forward. </para>

                        <para>.- I compliment the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> on having delivered a speech which will well repay reading. Evidently he has gone into the subject exhaustively. The reason why fish is more plentiful and cheaper in England and in New Zealand than in Australia is that its distribution in those countries is on a much more efficient basis than it is here. I speak as one who has resided for a considerable period in England, and for a lesser term in New Zealand. Australia has the longest coastline of any nation in the world, and we probably have the greatest variety of fish. I do not claim that we surpass the colder waters of Northern Europe, but I do say that on the west coast of Tasmania millions of tons of fish go to waste annually. A maritime captain once drew my attention to millions of mutton birds cruising about that locality. He told me that they were existing on great quantities of fish that, if properly tinned, would rival pilchards in quality. I have visited the sardine fisheries at Belle-Isle-en-Mer. in the Bay of Biscay, and have sampled their output when freshly cured. "While I noticed a considerable difference between the flavour of pilchards and real sardines, I think the former a very edible fish. In fact, it is very frequently marketed as sardine. </para>

                    <para>I rose specifically to seek the cooperation of the Government with regard to establishing the crustacean industry in Australia. I have known the manager of Australian Delicacies Company, of. Melbourne, since boyhood. He is a straight, true "white" man in every sense of the word. He has assured me that this industry has a great future in. Australia if given a degree of protection. I tasted lobster canned by the company, and I can say definitely that it was equal to anything produced in any other part of the world. The output of that factory, from the labels to the contents of the tins, is wholly Australian, saving only the tinned plate. It is interesting to know that the industry has also been established at Geraldton, Western Australia. My recommendation should, therefore, have the approval of the honorable 0 member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> I suggests - </para>

I recommend that the duty should be 2½d. British preferential, 3d. intermediate tariff, and 4d. general tariff. </para>

                    <para>Only fifteen men are at present employed in the Tasmanian factory; but it must be remembered that the foreign opposition is strong. The management of the Australian Delicacies Company has given a definite undertaking that if the protection which is sought is granted the company will not raise its prices. On the other hand it will make a great endeavour' to reduce them, so that the citizens of Australia may have an opportunity to obtain a wholesome and health-giving food at a reasonable price. The present factory is situated at Lady Barren on Flinders Island, which is in the Furneaux group. All of its employees are Australians. It is expected that an outlay of £950 per week for labour and materials will be reached if this protection is granted the industry. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members are aware that our waters teem with sharks. Shark fins are esteemed a delicacy in the East, and we should be able to cultivate a market for them. There is also a big trade in the East for dried prawn's. I have tasted the prawns that are being bottled in New South Wales, and I am confident that, in flavour and delicacy they suit the most exacting palate. I appeal to the Government to approve my suggestion, and I should be very proud indeed if I could convey that to the management and workers of that splendid factory in Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the proposal of the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney).</inline> If protection is given to the industry, Australia should be able to cater for the whole of its crustacean requirements. Our waters teem with crayfish, lobsters, crabs, prawns and other fish, and a serious endeavour should be made to exploit that valuable asset. It may interest honorable members to learn that in 1928, 600,000 lb. of crustaceans  were  imported into Australia; in 1929 the quantity was 900,000 lb., while last year it had grown to 1,200,000 lb." I am informed that that great increase occurred because Australia was made the dumping ground for that sort of fish from Asiatic countries. If accepted, the proposal of the honorable member for Melbourne would provide a reasonable protection for this young Australian industry, and would prevent further dumping from overseas during the period it requires to establish itself and develop. Most of our crustacean importations are of Asiatic origin. I am confident that the Australian product is of as high a quality as that imported, and that the industry warrants the protection of this Parliament. These and other fish are indigenous to Australia, while wheat is not. In Moreton Bay and along the shores of the Pacific Ocean, upon which my electorate abuts, fish of all kinds abound, and frequently the hauls are more than sufficient to provide for local requirements.'  If all branches of this industry were properly encouraged there would be -an increased consumption of both ordinary fish and crustaceans, with a resultant decrease in the prices. A new industry with wonderful possibilities of development could thus be established, providing cheap and wholesome food for the people, and employment to hundreds of our workers. Western Australia is establishing a factory similar to that already operating in Tasmania, and I -see no reason why similar factories should not be located in New South </para>

                    <para class="block">I consider, with other honorable members, that, crustaceans should be included in the item as a special class-, seeing that, the importations of this class of fish to Australia amount to hundreds of thousands of pounds weight. Australia, is, unfortunately, unable to compete, under present, conditions, with the countries which are sending, crustaceans here. The definition of " crustaceans " includes, crayfish, lobster, prawns, crabs, and all like fish. The present duty on such fish is1d., British preferential ;1½d., intermediate;., and 2½d., general. If the increase suggested by the honorable member for Melbourne were, made, only the products of Asiatic countries,, with the exception of a very small quantity of fish which comes here from South Africa, would be affected. We import, no crustaceans from Canada, nor; with the exception that I have mentioned, from any other country within the. Empire. I regret that provision has been made for an increase in the duty an salmon only. Apparently, crustaceans are still to be admitted at 2½d..' per lb., although they come principally from Asiatic countries. I hope that the Minister can see his way clear to accept the- amendment suggested by- the- honorable member for Melbourne: </para>
                    <para>A small population on Flinders. Island, in. the middle of Bass Strait, relies for- its maintenance- upon the mutton bird industry, plus a little fishing; but, owing, to. the lack of protection, fishing yields them only a bare existence. If an increase were made in the duties in, favour of . white Australian crayfish, these people would be able- to make a fair living. The request that has been made in this connexion is reasonable, and merits the sympathetic consideration of the Government. </para>
                    <para>The fishing industry of Australia has not been developed as it should have been, although operations- are. being carried on in a small way in some of the States. I am glad that the bottling of prawns has been undertaken on a commercial scale in New. South Wales, and Western Australia has- started fish canning works. </para>
                    <para>As the honorable member for Melbourne has said, the Australian Delicacies Company is now canning white Australian crayfish at Flinders Island. For the last five years this company has been working with the object of producing a good article to compete against imported crab, and I believe that it can now market a product equal, to the world's best. </para>

                            <para>- It is necessary because it is impossible to compete against the imported crab which is dumped in Australia. The weekly output of the company has now reached 60 cases of 5-dozen 7-oz. tins, equalling 1,800 lb. This output is equal to about 90,000 lb. per year. Given a small degree of encouragement, the company believes that its output can be increased enormously. According to official figures, our importations of crustaceans - mostly crab - from Japan totalled 669,072 lb. in 1928; 993,289 lb. in 1929.; and 1,214,719 lb. in 1930. As the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> pointed out, our importations have almost doubled in two years. There is reason to believe that steps are being taken to dump, further quantities of these fish on the local market, for a good deal of difficulty has been experienced, lately in marketing the local product. In view of the-fact that most of our importations of - these, fish are- from Asiatic countries, we should take steps to encourage the  local industry. If protected, the company could give a reasonable guarantee that it would supply the whole of our requirements, and that the product would be of high quality. If the protection asked for is granted, it will help to some extent, thought not greatly, to maintain a satisfactory trade balance. But what is of more importance is that a reasonable duty would make possible the provision of a certain amount of additional employment for our people, and give some encouragement to the fish-canning industry in Australia. </para>

It is known that there are 20g,000 surplus cases of Japanese crab, stored from last year, waiting to be dumped on the first available market. This is more than enough for eighteen years' supply of Australian needs. They will strain every effort to retain the Australian trade. Wherever there is a consuming market such market will get the surplus; and we believe irrespective of its production cost. Crustaceans are available for canning in all the States. With the granting of the duty, which is against Asiatic trade only, there opens up an outlay in materials and wages of £000 a week as a first development, and the certainty of extension to other fish products. Even if no other enterprises arise, we can, if necessary, ourselves supply the whole Australian demand. </para>

                        <para>.- I also support the proposal of the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney).</inline> I consider that a separate class should be made for crustaceans. We should foster the fishing industry. In Tasmania, because of the colder waters which surround our coast, we are able to obtain large quantities of first-class fish of practically all kinds. But the industry cannot be developed because of the lack of protection and the inadequate shipping service between Tasmania and the mainland. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I agree with the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> that it is not necessary to make any further investigation of this subject. Comprehensive inquiries have been made into the extent and quality of our fishing grounds, and these show that there is no reason why we should not build up a valuable fishing industry. Tasmania has a long coast-line, and her waters contain an abundance of fish, particularly crayfish, lobsters, and smaller fish such as sardines. I believe that we could supply the requirements of the whole of Australia in these lines. But the industry needs development. I disagree with the suggestion of the right honorable member for Cowper that a bounty should be provided to meet the position. Those engaged in the industry are asking for a duty, and not a bounty. </para>

                            <para>- The industry would provide work for many additional hands. At present nearly all our fishing boats are idle, because it is impossible to ship our fish 'to the mainland owing to the inadequate shipping services. Given adequate protection, Tasmania could supply all the requirements of Australia, in certain classes of fish, at any rate. There is no need for the Government to go to the expense of finding fresh fishing grounds, because the grounds to which I have referred have already been tested. All the materials that are necessary for fishing, such as boats and nets, are available, so that there is no extra outlay required to enable this company to obtain sufficient fish to supply the Australian requirements. I have pleasure in supporting the suggestion of the honorable member for Melbourne, and I hope that the Minister will give every encouragement to this industry. </para>

                        <para>.- This appears to be a most suitable industry to be developed, and, I think, should be encouraged by all honorable members. There is often a division of opinion in respect of the encouragement of manufactures in Australia, but all honorable members will admit that, when we encourage a new industry which will be able to export, we are doing the right thing towards Australia. The only competition which this new' company is facing at the moment is from Japan, which exports large quantities of fish to Australia. In 1930 it exported £1,200,000 worth of fish to this country. That seems almost incredible. This Australian company deserves much credit for its enterprise. It has started operations on an island in Bass Strait, which is cut off from civilization to a large extent. Its development has been retarded because it is dealing at present only with the mutton bird industry. Now that its operations are extended to the canning of crayfish, additional employment will be provided, and the island will be brought into closer contact with the mainland. This company is not. out. to profiteer. If given tariff protection, it claims it will not increase prices; in fact, it hopes to reduce prices. I agree with the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> that the inland towns of Australia suffer considerably because of the irregular and inadequate distribution of fish. In distribution methods we are a long way behind other parts of the world. In America fish undergoes a quick freezing process. It is then wrapped in wax paper, packed in cartons, and distributed throughout the country. Yet in Australia the provincial towns are almost cut off from the fish supply. This company, when it is not faced with the competition of Asiatic countries, will be able to supply the whole of the Australian market, and, in addition, export to the Pacific Islands, and perhaps further afield. We have an export trade in semi-primary products with the Dutch East' Indies and with India, and there is no reason why that trade should not include canned fish. I support the suggestion of the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney).</inline></para>

That suggestion, also, will be given consideration. </para>

                            <para>- No representations have been made to me about oysters. It is pleasing to note the development of this industry, and it is hoped that it will be a stepping stone to the establishment of fish-canning on a large scale. It is anomalous that Australia, whose coastal waters teem with edible fish, should not have possessed a single fish-canning factory before the establishment of this enterprise. Adequate scope exists for the development of this industry in Australia, and I trust that honorable members will accord to the pioneer companies the protection which is at present proposed. The Victorian company has invested £4,000 in this undertaking, and is employing fourteen hands. Manufacture commenced in January last, and the output of the factory approximates £2,000. Crayfish are caught in the Tasman Sea and Bass Straits and taken to Flinders Island for canning. New works have just been opened in Geraldton, Western Australia. A few minutes ago, I received the following telegram from Brown and; Dureau, Perth :  - </para>

                    <para class="block">That firm is optimistic about the possibility of establishing a large fish-canning industry in Western Australia. I find on inquiry that the Australian article is superior to the imported article, and- that fact should help materially in ensuring its sale. Russian canned crab is making its appearance on the world's markets at prices with which the local industry at the old rates of duty cannot compete. It is known, that there are large quantities of imported brands of these goods on the market, and it is possible that for some time the local industry will not make any appreciable headway, but after the stocks of imported lines are disposed of, it is anticipated that employment will be found for 100 additional hands. The value of the importations of this class of canned fish, most of which are from Asiatic waters, is estimated at £100,000 per annum. We imported in 1929-30, £1,732,395 worth of fish. The value of the Australian production of fish was approximately £1,590,000, and of oysters £121,000. It will be seen that there is an abundance of edible fish in Australian waters, and that there is great scope for establishing the fishing industry and creating employment in Australia. The development of this industry has unfortunately been slow, and the method of transport and the marketing of supplies has not been satisfactorily dealt with. The State Governments of Queensland and New South Wales have carried out investigations in the trawling industry, with mixed success. Much remains to be done in the development of this industry before it will be able to satisfy the consuming capacity of the public. The Development and Migration Commission in 1927 conferred with representatives of the States in respect of the fishing industry of Australia, and its report is a valuable document. </para>

I do mot wish to go into the whole of its details, so I shall hand it to the honorable member so that he may ascertain the nature of the inquiry. According to this report there are 220 men engaged at sea in. the fishing industry, and possibly 1,000 men handling fish on shore. The annual catch is estimated at 17,000,000 lb., valued at £400,000. I hope that honorable members will agree to the amendment, because, if carried, it will give an impetus to this new industry. I hope that before long Australia will be able to satisfy its own requirements. </para>

                        <para>. -  I have listened with great interest to the debate on the item of fish, and it has been most illuminating in that it shows the extraordinary and amazing manner in which the tariffs of this country are framed. The Minister made a statement regarding the fishing industry which upon analysis honorable members will find contains no real, solid or sound argument in favour of his contention. He refers to the reports that are available on this subject. I do not believe that he has read those reports. I do not believe that he knows the contents of the report of the Development and Migration Commission. He said that it was a most valuable document, but when I asked him what it contained, he made a facetious remark about handing it to me to read. That is not the way in which to construct tariffs. It is not the way to put forward sound arguments in favour of any proposal. Then the Minister, in order to weaken his case further, produced a telegram which he had received from Western Australia to the effect that a packer had got his pack ready and was going to proceed on an expedition, or something of that kind. The Minister's statement was most inconclusive and unimportant. Any one reading that statement would be amazed at the straits to which the Minister is reduced to defend his policy. We are told that the Australian waters teem with fish,_ there being from 500 to 600 edible varieties; but that, despite this abundance of natural wealth no industry can be established unless a substantial duty is imposed. That is not true. The industry can be developed without a duty, the only effect of which will be to increase the cost of canned fish. </para>

With all the natural advantages that the industry has, the freight and other charges borne by imported goods should be sufficient protection for it. </para>

                            <para>- They can get all the oil they require from the cotton fields of Queensland, or the olive groves of South Australia. This duty will enable the Australian people to buy canned crustaceans and other fish at prices considerably less than they now pay for fish imported from Asiatic countries. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> has struck the only discordant note; all other honorable members seem desirous to help to establish an Australian industry which will exploit the immense resources of fish in our coastal waters and make available to the people an important article of diet at reduced  prices. </para>

                            <para>- The duty is directed entirely against imports from Asiatic countries, and it will assist to put on its feet an Australian industry which is capable of exporting its products. That is the acid test; an industry that is capable of exporting is worthy of encouragement. The protection of this industry will not increase the price of canned crayfish to the consumers. </para>

                        <para>.- I am surprised at the attitude of the honorable member for Warringah; evidently he has not informed his mind in regard to this item. There is no more reason for importing crustaceans than for importing beef or mutton. They are to be found in hundreds of millions all round the Australian coast, and the very finest olive oil for preserving them is produced in South Australia, which alone is capable of supplying the whole of the Australian market with crayfish. </para>

                        <para>Since assisting the manufacturers to have their industries protected they have used all the means they possess to lower our members' wages and to debase their working conditions. </para>
                        <para>In New South Wales the employers  took  full advantage of all the anti-working-class legislation passed by the Bavin Government. In Victoria, and other States covered by the federal awards, immediately the 10 per cent, reduction in the basic wage was ordered by the court, the employers were successful in having the reduction applied to their employees. The protection given to the industry has not benefited the workers engaged in it, therefore, if the manufacturers who were protected because they claimed they could only maintain the wages and conditions of the workers by the shutting out of imported goods, now seek to lower the wages and conditions after being guarded by the Labour Government against outside competition, then it is the view of the Labour Council of New South Wales and of my union that no good purpose can be served by supporting the employers in their tariff applications. </para>

                        <para>.- Why should the business of Parliament be held up because a letter from a trade union has been read by a member of the Lang group? I pointed out earlier that this request came from a New South Wales union that was not working under a federal award, and that the employers had served a log upon the union with a view to bringing its members under the jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Court; but this log applies to woollen mills only. The honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge)</inline> is hopelessly confused between the case for cotton piece goods and that for woollen textiles. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw it, with mental reservations. The group with which I am associated is far from being confused with regard to the item now before the committee. Representations have been made to us by the workers engaged in this industry. They claim that no benefits have accrued to them by reason of the protection that has been granted to the industry. On the other hand, they say that the employers, having made representations to Labour members of Parliament, have obtained tariff protection, but have availed themselves of every opportunity of attacking the conditions of the worker* in the industry. </para>

Seeing that certain honorable members opposite frequently vote with the Government for increased duties, one realizes that their protestations about the burden of taxation that is being heaped upon the workers are sp much hypocrisy. So far as my group is concerned, we stand for the interests of the workers, and we offer no apology to anybody for doing it. In that respect we  i  are unlike our friends opposite, who know that they represent interests that are diametrically opposed to those of the workers. They try to camouflage their position by trying to make it appear that they are very considerate to the workers, and are anxious to maintain their industrial conditions. </para>

                        <para>. -  I think that a slight misunderstanding has occurred with regard to this matter. I hope that the Minister will not accept the proposal advanced for the postponement of this item. A letter which recently appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> sets out the case from the employers' point of view, and, to my mind, the statement contained in it is fair and reasonable. The letter is from the New South Wales Textile Manufacturers Association, and reads as follows : - </para>

                        <para>I desire to point out the reasons for the application made to the Federal Arbitration Court by the members of the New South Wales Textile Manufacturers Association for an award. At the present time Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania are working under a federal award, giving 48 hours per week. Victoria is the chief textile manufacturing State. New South Wales is working under a State award, and works 44 hours per week, with very much higher wages than the other States. The disparity owing to wages and hours gives a disadvantage to this State of upwards of 40 per cent, oh wages basis. Should this disparity be maintained, it must soon lead to the closing of the mills in New South Wales. </para>
                        <para>The members of my association believe that there should be equality of opportunity, and what they desire is that all States should work under reasonably even conditions, whatever the conditions mav be - this State should not be penalized. Therefore, application has been made to be brought under a federal award. </para>

                            <para>- I have no policy on this matter at the moment. I am discussing, on its merits, the proposal to equalize the conditions in this industry in all the States, and to ensure that workers in New South Wales shall not be put out of employment because their fellow trade unionists in Victoria are working 48 hours, as against 44 hours in New South Wales, and are receiving a lower .wage for 48 hours work than their fellow trade unionists in New South Wales are getting for a working week of 44 hours. The employers are making a reasonable proposition to protect a section of workers against exploitation by other sections of workers in the same industry in other States. An application has been made for a Federal award, and, if it were granted, and the industrial conditions were made uniform throughout the States, there would be no special application by workers in one State against those of another. Therefore, I suggest that it would be reasonable for the honorable member for Martin to withdraw his request for the postponement of this item. No injury to the workers in his State is sought.

                        PARKHILL.t am not concerned with the Minister's views in that respect. I am pointing out that the determination of wages is a matter for the Arbitration Court. The manufacturers seem to think that because they are able to provide a limited number of workers with particularly good conditions, they are entitled to ask Parliament for a prohibitive duty. We should not establish the principle that because, in one industry, the workers and their employers join in an application for a duty, they are, therefore, entitled to a prohibitive impost. I suggest that the grounds on which this postponement is sought are unreasonable and unsound. If the honorable member for Martin
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge)</inline>
                        were present I should urge him, on the merits of the case, to withdraw his proposal and allow the items to be discussed.

                        <para>.- When discussing these items during the general debate on the tariff I referred to the very point that has been raised by the honorable members for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> and Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge).</inline> If it is sound policy for this Government to give high, protection to an industry, it is equally sound that the rights of the workers in that industry should be preserved so far as is possible. I apply that generally. Recently I asked to be supplied with a list of employers who had applied for wage reductions after receiving high tariff protection from this Government. Subsequently I interviewed officers in charge of the department concerned, and realized that a complete answer to my question would involve the Government in considerable cost. I, therefore. re-drafted it, and expect an answer during the coming week. I have asked to be supplied with a list of the industries in which wage-cuts have occurred following the granting of high protective duties to those concerns. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I believe that it is necessary to ratify the items in this division, as the success of the industries concerned depends upon the maintenance of these duties. I think that the objection of the honorable member for East Sydney, and the honorable  member  for Martin, can be overcome by the Government giving an assurance that a conference will be convened of the employers and employees in these industries, together with the officers of the Customs Department, so that the equity of the case may be considered. I do not yield to any honorable member in my belief that certain recent actions of the Arbitration Court were, to say the least, hellish. The court refused to give union officials an opportunity to ventilate their side of the matter. That rankles in the mind of every unionist in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member will refer to the applications made by employers for a cut in the basic wage he will see that in their response the union advocates relied on the old line of argument, which centred about the cost of living, and advanced eighteen reasons why existing wages should be maintained. The Arbitration Court circumscribed the scope of the inquiry, and introduced two hitherto unknown bases of argument, that of national economy and the position of the nation. </para>

                    <para>I hold that it is unfair to grant a high protective tariff to an industry, and at the same time allow those in it to cut wages in pursuance of what must be considered to be the most ill-balanced judgment that has ever been given by an Arbitration Court in Australia. It was claimed that the employers had lost money during 1929 and 1930. I do not contest that, but it might just as reasonably have been pointed out that they made exorbitant profits from 1918 until 1929- 30. I urge the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> and the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge)</inline> not to persevere in their desire for a postponement of the debate on this item, but to seek from the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> an undertaking that a conference between employers, employees, and departmental officers will be convened at an early date, with a view to arriving at some adjustment of the existing inequitable position. If it could be proved that prices have been reduced as a result of the cut in wages, my objection would be, to some extent, overcome. </para>

                        <para>.- The suggestion that the discussion on this item should be adjourned in order to enable a conference to take place between employers and employees in a certain industry, so that they shall decide how far they will further exploit the public, indicates to what depths the Government is descending in connexion with tariff matters. I was surprised to see, in last Saturday's Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> a full-page advertisement on behalf of Messrs. Bryant &amp; May. In view of the embargo on match importations, it is difficult to appreciate why that expenditure was incurred at the moment when all of our basic industries, iron, steel, zinc, lead, gold, copper and wheat, are in extreme distress. And now we have honorable members moving for a postponement of this item in order that unionists and employers might meet to fix wages in the industry, with the intention that the tariff shall be adjusted later to make the payment of those wages possible. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that subject when the item is reached. Probably it will be, like the item of which we have just disposed, very fishy. Great quantities of cotton goods are used by our people, and we should not postpone the debate on this item. In a question which I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs to-day, I made if! clear that iron and steel prices in Germany are now below those which prevailed in 1913. It is hopelessly wrong that we should keep prices high in Australia, and so nullify the efforts of our wealth producing industries. </para>

British preferential, 45 per cent, intermediate, and 50 per cent, general. When the 1920 tariff schedule was introduced, we were told that, if a substantial duty were imposed on these items, this industry would become firmly established; but I do not think that it was imagined at that time that the duties would be increased to the present enormous figures. The imposition of such duties on goods of this class is neither more nor less than an imposition upon the poorer classes of the community. These increases force one to the conclusion that honorable members of Parliament are strongly influenced by those who demand high duties. I do not suggest that they are improperly influenced. </para>

I shall develop this aspect of the subject further when, we are dealing with the duties on iron and steel and agricultural implements. At present I am making the point that these duties have severely hit the working people. I have never objected to the imposition of high duties on luxuries. I did not object, the other day, to the increased duty on cigars. But I do object to these extraordinary increases in the duties on the wearing apparel of the people. Let me quote the following prices from the list to which I have already referred: - </para>

                            <para>- Whenever I ask for details of such reductions, the Minister proceeds to discuss some other aspect of the subject. I shall be very glad if he will give me specific instances of substantial reductions in prices, and also any figures to justify his statement that an increase in employment has occurred in consequence of the imposition of these duties. There has been an increase of nearly 300 per cent, in the price of cotton goods since pre-war days. I hope the Minister will not agree to the suggestion that consideration of this item should be postponed until an arrangement has been made between the employers and employees in the industry to exploit the poorer people of the community still further. When the amendment now before the Chair has been dealt with, I intend to move that the duties in respect of this item shall be reduced to1s. British preferential;1s. 6d. intermediate, and 2s. general, and that the ad valorem rate shall be reduced by 5 per cent, in each case. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to know on what ground the Government has departed from the recommendation of the Tariff Board in regard to this item. The board submitted a report to the Government on the 30th June last, in which it recommended that no alteration should be made in the duty which had been operating since 1928. That recommendation was made after a lengthy inquiry. The increases made were from1s. to1s. 3d. British preferential,1s. to1s. 6d. intermediate, and 2s. to 2s. 6d. general, and ad valorem, 5 per cent, in each class of duty. I point out that the increases are greater than they seem to be, for this is not an alternative duty. It is not a case of imposing the fixed duty or the ad valorem rate whichever is the greater, but of imposing the fixed duty plus the ad valorem rate. </para>

The honorable gentleman read portions of a letter sent to him by the general  president  of the Textile Workers Union, including a statement by that gentleman that no good purpose could be served by supporting the manufacturers in their application for an increase of duties. If that is the view of the honorable member for Martin and his colleagues in this chamber, and of the  president  of the union, I assure the Committee that it is not the view of the rank and file of workers engaged in the industry. I dispute the statement that the workers in this industry do not approve of these additional duties. The largest cotton mill in the Commonwealth is in my electorate, and I have been in close touch with the trained operatives in that establishment. I know from firsthand knowledge that these workers are in entire agreement with the policy of the Government in this connexion. Consequently I shall not allow the remarks of the honorable member for Martin to influence my vote on the item. A postponement of the consideration of the item would be entirely against the interests of the workers engaged in the industry. I shall resist any effort by the honorable member for Martin and his colleagues, or honorable members opposite, to reduce the duties. A reduction of the duties would re-act seriously not only upon the users of these <inline font-style="italic">goods</inline> in Australia, but also upon the workers engaged in the industry, for it would, in effect, open our doors wide to the importers of cheap goods made in foreign countries by coloured labour. I can understand certain honorable members opposite, who have little consideration for the welfare of the workers, suggesting a reduction in this item, which is designed to protect the Australian industry and to provide employment for our trained operatives. </para>

                            <para>- I am not an advocate of low wages. I have at all times urged that this Parliament should do its utmost, legislatively, to ensure uniformity in industrial conditions throughout the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, many who have been associated with industrial organizations have not given the Labour party all the help which it had every right to expect in this direction. If industrial conditions in the other States were brought more into line with the conditions obtaining in New South Wales, we should not be confronted with our present difficulties, and we should not have applications from manufacturers for an alteration in working conditions. Manufacturers who enjoy protection under the tariff should not be allowed to break down the working conditions of their employees. This Parliament should protect the industry now under discussion, and I should be unfaithful to my trust, and would not be doing what is expected of me by my supporters, if I agreed to a postponement of a decision with regard to this particular item. </para>

                            <para>- They have not asked for it. At all events, I have received no protest from them, and I have not heard of any complaints from those who are engaged in the industry. Our plain duty is to ensure its adequate protection, so that it may be further developed, and  the  volume of employment extended. Variation in awards is not a matter for this Parliament to determine; it has not the necessary authority to legislate for uniformity in industrial conditions. As an ex-trade union secretary, I am always prepared to fight the employers on behalf of employees, if I feel that their claim is a just one. The workers in this industry should have nothing to fear so long as they enjoy a fair share of the increased employment which should result from this further protection. If they have differences with their employers they can fight out their disputes in the Arbitration Court or, if they prefer it, on the job. I have never yet " squibbed " an issue, and I have entire confidence in the ability of the operatives engaged in the industry to protect their working conditions against unscrupulous employers. We should be failing in our duty as representatives of the people, and as Australians, if we did not give this particular industry its full measure of protection. The previous Government spent huge sums of money in attracting to our shores large numbers of immigrants, among whom were thousands of trained operatives from Lancashire and other centres of the textile industry in Great Britain. Until a few months ago these men and women were walking the streets of our principal cities looking in vain for employment. I have met scores of them knocking at the doors of our industrial establishments. Owing to the low customs barrier prior to the advent of this Government, Australian manufacturers were unable to compete with overseas importations. They are now producing an excellent article. Some months ago I represented to the Minister for Trade and Customs that the weight of cotton piece goods covered by this item should be reduced from 6  oz.  to 5 oz. per square yard in order to give the Australian manufacturers a further measure of protection, and at the same time safeguard the interests of the consumer. I made this suggestion because overseas manufacturers had been giving their attention to the production of a cotton tweed weighing less than 6 oz. I have in my hands a sample of the lighter weight imported cotton tweed, which weighs slightly less than 6 oz. a square yard and therefore evades the duty. If honorable members care to examine it they will see that it is in every respect inferior to, and will not stand anything like as much wear and tear as the Australian-made article. I urge the Minister, if he has not already come to a decision, to consider seriously the proposal which I made to him to alter the item by reducing the weight of the cloth from 6 oz. to 5 oz. If this item is so amended, the additional protection given to the industry will do much to ensure its stability and extension. It will mean the establishment of cotton spinning mills in Australia, and substantially increase the demand for Australian-grown cotton. The representatives in this chamber from the State of Queensland will, I feel sure, support this request. Since we have done our utmost to encourage cotton-growing in Australia, it is only natural, and logical, that we should now give all the assistance possible to the manufacturing side of the industry. It has been contended By those who are opposed to these duties, that this increased protection will not benefit employers in the textile industry. I give that assertion an emphatic denial. To my personal knowledge scores of operatives have lately secured remunerative employment in a number of mills in my electorate, and there has been no reduction in wages since the imposition of these duties. </para>

I sincerely trust that, before this item is passed, honorable members will examine this sample of cotton piece goods which I have in my possession, and compare it with samples of Australian-made goods. If they do, I feel sure that they will support the request which I have made for a reduction in the weight from 6 oz. to 5 oz. </para>

The cotton piece goods sample in question is manufactured by Asiatics for the special purpose of defeating the Government proposals for protecting the Australian industry. Garments made from it will not give the Australian worker fair wear. It is our duty to give reasonable protection to Australian manufacturers against importations from cheap-labour countries and Australian workers from inferior materials. I am informed on good authority, that the Bradford Cotton Mills, Sydney, and Bentleys Limited, Melbourne, two of the largest establishments of their kind in Australia, are prepared to manufacture from Australian yarn cotton piece goods weighing 5 oz. per square yard. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister has been assured that the firms mentioned have given a definite assurance that they will use Australian cotton for the production of high-class cotton piece goods should the proposed alteration in this item be approved. It may not be out of place if I remind honorable members of the development that has taken place in the Australian cotton industry since the manufacturing side of the industry was encouraged. In 1920-21 the area under crop was 166 acres, and the yield 493,650 lb. ; last year the area under crop was 26,122 acres, and the yield 12,290,190 lb. of unginned cotton. The cotton bounty, as honorable members are aware, will not be continued beyond 1936. About 3,000 workers are employed in the iudustry, and at the peak period of last season the wages paid amounted to approximately £1,500 a week. Cotton growing also provides additional employment in other occupations, notably the transport industry. Honorable members should have no hesitation in choosing between an article of good quality manufactured in Australia from raw material produced in this country and one produced in cheap-labour Asiatic countries. I see no reason why they should not give immediate and favorable consideration to the proposal before the committee. </para>

                            <para>- The amendment of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. C. Riley)</inline> is . necessary for the protection both of the Australian industry and of the Australian worker. Imported cotton piece goods, containing cotton and wool, are of inferior quality and give unsatisfactory wear. It is unjust to the workers of this country to import an inferior article, the product of Asiatic countries. If the amendment is carried, the Australian industry will be given a splendid opportunity to develop. The cotton tweed industry has developed considerably since the introduction of the Pratten tariff. This item affords further scope for the utilization of Australian wool and cotton. The Bradford cotton mills, and Bentley's Limited, have given a special undertaking that, if the item is altered as suggested, they will use Australian-grown cotton and wool in larger quantities, and produce a first class article weighing 5 oz. </para>

                            <para>- The party to which I have the honour to belong introduced the legislation providing for the Arbitration Court. The party stands solidly for the settlement of industrial disputes and the fixing of hours, conditions and wages in industry by means of the Arbitration Court. The cotton-growing industry has developed materially since the introduction of the last tariff. In 1920-21 there were only 166 acres of cotton under crop, which produced 57,065 lb. of unginned cotton. </para>
                        </talk.start>

                    <para class="block">The imports in that year were 493,650 lb. In 1928-29, there were 26,122 acres under crop, which produced 12,290,190 lb. of unginned cotton. The imports in that year were 1,040,473 lb. The production of cotton plus imports in 1920-21, was 550,715 lb., and in 1929-30, 13,331,383 lb. Since 1920 the number of cotton-growers has increased considerably. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the secondary side of this industry, the development of which has been remarkable. Cotton piece goods are being made from Australian-grown cotton by the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills, cotton yarns by Davies Cooperative Company Proprietary Limited, of Melbourne, the Austral Silk and Cotton Mills Limited and Bonds Industries Limited, of Sydney; cotton towelling by Bonds Industries Limited, the Commonwealth Weaving Mills Limited, which company uses 5,000 lb. of Queensland cotton per week, or 650 bales per year, and the Wattle Weaving Mills Limited, Sydney. Cotton underwear is being made by Bonds Industries Limited) and Davies Cooperative Company Proprietary Limited. Terry towelling, huckaback towelling, honeycomb towels, sponge cloth and Dorset cloth are being manufactured by the Harris Weaving Mills, of Sydney. The cotton-grower of Queensland does not directly get the benefit of this tariff protection. Ho gets it indirectly, inasmuch as it enables the spinners to operate their plants, and to purchase our raw cotton. At the time the duty was imposed, spinning plants in Australia were; practically idle, hut now they are all working full time. Bonds Industries, of Sydney, has now been completely reconstructed, and is working three shifts per day. Of late that firm has been working on Saturdays and Sundays. Spinners are taking 300 per cent, more raw cotton from the Queensland growers than they were at the corresponding period of last year. That is surely a bright spot in the present dark background of trade in this country. The industry last year gave intermittent employment to approximately 3,000 cotton-pickers. It also gave direct employment in the oil mill and ginneries to a large number of people, the wages and salaries bill at the peak period of the year being approximately £1,500 per week Indirectly, employment was given to different sections of the community, through the railway department and other transport activities. The sum of <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 3,000 was paid to the Railways Department in freights. I hope that the committee will support, this further proposal to develop the Australian spinning and weaving industry, which absorbs our own raw materials - wool and cotton. All Australian requirements of cotton can be assured by the growers. We can supply the world's requirements in respect, of wool. In fact, Australia has more or less a monopoly of the finest merino wool. The amendment, if carried, will be a considerable factor in bringing about the renewal of prosperity of the primary producers, our workers, and Australians generally. </para>

                        <para>. - I oppose the motion of the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge' that this item be deferred. I do so in view of the importance of the cotton-growing industry to Australia, and out of consideration for those who are engaged in it. This industry opens up a great field for the absorption of our unemployed in the production of cotton, and everything should be done to hasten the passing of this item so that we may give adequate protection to the cotton -growing industry. For many years the Commonwealth and the Government of Queensland and the individual growers have expended considerable time and money in an endeavour to develop this industry. Prior to the Pratten tariff, the highest production of ' cotton - 922,000 lb. was in 1920-21, but when that tariff was imposed, the production increased in one year to 18,000,000 lb. Objection has been raised on both sides of the chamber to the protection that is now being afforded this industry. Surely there is no excuse for the opposition to this item. I remind honorable members that the Bruce-Page Government guaranteed in 1923-24, 5d. per lb.; in 1924-25, 5d. per lb.; and in 1925-26, 4£d. per lb. on cotton. Half of the loss on the guarantee had to be met by the Commonwealth Government. The loss in Queensland alone amounted to £359,790, and it was borne equally by the Commonwealth and the State. A full examination of the industry was made and reports were submitted by experts, by visitors from Great Britain, and by inspectors from India. It was claimed by those experts that it was possible to produce in Australia a high-grade cotton, and that opinion was subsequently borne out by the fact that on the cotton market of Great Britain, the Australian, article realized the highest price in its class. During the period from 1923 to 1927, the Commonwealth Government expended £2,044 in research work in an endeavour to promote the cotton-growing industry. In 1925 the Commonwealth Government granted over a period of five years, a bounty of 1½d. per lb. on high-grade cotton. In 1925-26 the appropriation for seed cotton amounted to £120,000, and for cotton yarn to £60,000. From 1926-27 to 1929-30, £190,315 was expended on cotton seed, and £127,831 on cotton yarns. That is an indication that during recent years the Commonwealth Government, as well as the Queensland Government, has devoted much attention to the development of the cotton-growing industry. There is no more opportune time than the present to render further assistance to this industry so that we may absorb a considerable number of our unemployed. During the last few years, the Queensland Government, in an effort to develop this industry, has made available to settlers a number of farms in my electorate covering an area of many thousand acres. These men are now firmly established, both in their homes and in the industry. They have successfully farmed areas on which previously the survey peg was the only sign of civilization.</inline></para>

                            <para>- That recommendation referred to the cotton piece goods which are included in the first item, which has already been passed. We have not placed on such goods any protective duty, but merely a small revenue duty. Therefore, the recommendation of the Tariff Board has not been disregarded. That board has not carried out an investigation into the cotton piece goods embracing cotton tweeds included in this item since 1925. It then made the very definite recommendation, which was embodied in the tariff by the Government of the day, that the duty should be 1s. and 30 per cent. ad valorem British preferential,1s. 6d. and 40 per cent. ad valorem intermediate, and 2s. and 45 per cent. ad valorem general tariff. The addition of 5 per cent. to each of the ad valorem rates, after a lapse of six years, is only reasonable. Upon investigation, the Government found that that increase was necessary for the protection of the Australian industry. The additional protection has already had a beneficial effect. Honorable members will doubtless be told that the result has been  to increase the price of cotton piece goods; but that is not the case. Even in the last three months, reductions have been made in prices, on one line from 3s. to 2s. 8d. a yard, on another from 4s. 9d. to 4s. 3d., and on a third from 4s. to 3s. 6½d. </para>

                        <para>The Minister for Trade and Customs has requested advice on the following proposition which has been put to him by the general secretary of the Australian " Textile Workers Union :  - " The Federal Management Committee of the above union recently met and considered the action of the Federal Arbitration Court in reducing wages prescribed in our awards by 10 per cent., and, as a result of the discussions, I was instructed to write you urging that the Federal Government, in granting protection to the industry, should make provision in all cases where protection is granted that the wage rate shall not be below the equivalent of the Harvester judgment." </para>
                        <para>What the union desires is that the tariff protection accorded to textile manufacturers shall be subject to variation in such a way as to ensure that the protection of the tariff shall be accorded only to those who pay in the industry rates of wages not less than those specified in the Harvester judgment. </para>
                        <para>Similar action was attempted in the Excise Tariff 1906 (Agricultural Machinery). That act imposed certain duties of excise on agricultural machinery, but contained a proviso that the duty should not apply in cases where it was established that the conditions of employment obtaining in the production of the goods were fair and reasonable. </para>
                        <para>The High Court declared the act was invalid (Barger's case 0 C.L.R. 41), on the ground, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> that the act dealt with matters other than duties of excise, and accordingly contravened section 55 of the Constitution. </para>
                        <para>It appears that any customs tariff act imposing duties of customs subject to the conditions mentioned by the union would be liable to be dealt with by the court in a similar manner. </para>

                        <para>On behalf of the employer it was contended that the act was in substance not a taxation act, but a direct interference with the regulation of the manufacturing business which was within the exclusive legislative power of the States. The court by a majority . . . held that the act was invalid mainly on the ground that it was not an act imposing taxation, but was an attempt at the direct regulation of the domestic affairs of the States. </para>

                            <para>- I know of such instances, but it is not my function to defend -the manufacturers. I have to consider impartially whether it is advisable to defer these duties, and whether the Commonwealth has any power to regulate wages through the tariff schedule. As Minister for Trade and Customs, I have no power to do that; therefore the deferment of these duties and the convening of a conference of representatives of the spinners, knitters, and unions would be futile. If the Commonwealth Parliament had greater constitutional powers in relation to trade and commerce it would be possible to put into operation the new protection policy of the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party. Until this Parliament is granted that power, it would be useless for me to convene a conference of representatives of employers and workers in the textile industry, because the only pressure I could exert to prevent a reduction of wages would be a threat to remove the protective duties. Punitive action of that kind would unjustly penalize the good employers who are paying award rates, and throw out of employment thousands of men and women. Moreover, if I agreed to convene a conference of representatives of the textile industry immediately, the iron and steel industry, the timber industry and many others in turn would demand similar treatment, and all my time would be occupied with conferences which would certainly prove abortive, because of the constitutional limitation of the powers of this Parliament and my intrusion would be hotly  resented. I spoke on the telephone this morning to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lark,</inline> general secretary of the Textile Workers Union in Melbourne, and the  president  of the union in Sydney. The latter subsequently stated to my secretary that further consultations with the Trades and Labour Council in Sydney had confirmed their proposal that the duties on textiles should be lifted as a penalty on the employers for seeking the assistance of the Arbitration Court to alter working conditions and wages in the industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Downing,</inline> therefore, urged that full consideration should be given to the suggestions made by the general secretary of the Textile Workers Union, that the discussion of this item be postponed, that a conference representing . all sections of the industry throughout Australia be held, and that the Government be guided by the result of such conference. </para>

                    <para>I repeat that at such a conference the representative of the Commonwealth Government would have no power of compulsion. If the employers and employees failed to arrive at an amicable agreement all that the Government could do would be to withdraw or reduce the existing duties; and if. it did that it would have to accept full responsibility for throwing out of employment from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent of the workers in the textile industry, because as soon as the duties were lifted the country would be flooded with imports. I do not approve of manufacturers obtaining tariff protection, on the ground that they are handicapped by Australian, wages and working conditions, and immediately applying to the Arbitration Court for a downward variation of those wages and conditions ; but I have to face stern facts. One must not cut off his nose to spite his face, and the penalizing of the employers by lifting the duties would be poor consolation to the thousands of workers who would be thus thrown out of employment. I promise, however, that the Government will keep its eyes on this industry, and determine within its powers what action can be taken to protect the wages and working condition's of the employees. As a believer in good wages and conditions of employment, and a reasonable price to the consumers, I regret that the Government has not the power to put into operation the new protection policy. </para>
                    <para>It is wise to put before the committee both sides of the case. I have stated the views of the representatives of the unions. I now quote the following telegram, which I received to-day from the Textile Association, Sydney :  - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Regarding statements made in Parliament, following are the facts: - Employers in this State are applying to Federal Arbitration Court to be -placed on same footing as Victorian textile industry. Employers in this State are at 40 per cent, disadvantage on wages, hours, taxes, &amp;c, compared with Victoria; therefore, if consumption continues limited only question of time when the industry will have to close down in this State, and all employees be thrown out of employment. Whatever may ultimately be the award is not the chief concern, but the absolute necessity is that conditions and wages must' be reasonably levelled as between the various States. My association thinks that every facility should be afforded by federal legislature for industries to be brought under a federal award, and there should be a uniform federal basic wage throughout Australia instead of differential rates in various States. Present tariff protection is required to prevent dumping of out-of-season and other goods, and by ensuring the market to Australian industry, making volume production possible, thus providing cheaper goods to the public. This tariff has already been instrumental in this direction. Piece goods generally are 20 per cent, to 30 per cent, lower than in 1929. Excellent worsteds and tweeds are being sold at from 5s. per yard, costing less than £.1 for a suit length" </para>

As a party we stand for arbitration, and even under the new protection policy the Arbitration Court and not Parliament or the Minister, would  fix  rates of wages. We have been told of course that all these duties have meant increases to the consumers; such a statement is absolutely false. </para>

The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> also delivered a fine speech in support of the request made by the honorable member for Cook, and I have been thinking' very seriously over the matter. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten</inline> who, as Minister for Trade and Customs, first gave protection to the cotton tweed industry in Australia, with the result that many factories have been established in this country, capable of turning Out an article equal to anything produced in any other part of the world. That can be seen from the samples exhibited in the chamber to-night, and I ask honorable members' to compare them with the inferior cotton tweeds under 6 oz. in -weight which are brought in to defeat the protection afforded to the local industry. There is a great deal in the contention of the honorable member for Cook, that, in order to safeguard the Australian factories, the weight of the cloth on which the duty is payable should be reduced to 5 oz. The honorable member for Cook, as a private member, cannot submit an amendment, but I accept his suggestion, supported as it has been by the honorable member for Moreton, and at the proper time I shall move the following amendment </para>

For instance', at the' outset of his speech, he referred to certain remarks of the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> . I should like the Minister to listen, to what I am saying, because it will discredit every statement subsequently made by him, and indicate that his explanations are not worthy of credence.

                    <para class="block">Board, in its report dated the 30th June, 1930, had reported against increased duties for cotton piece goods. The Minister had the impudence to say that the request covered by the Tariff Board's report dealt only with increased duties on denims, drills, jeans, dungarees, and cloths in the grey. As a matter of fact, as shown on the covering page of the report, there was a second reference in this report, and it was whether a deferred duty should be provided to cover " other cotton piece goods ". It is an exceedingly grave and unprecedented thing for a Minister, with an official document in his hand, to make wild and wide statements in contradiction of other honorable members. I admit that the second reference to the Tariff Board mentioned a " deferred " duty ; but lest the Minister should endeavour to take shelter behind that fact I come now to the recommendation of the Tariff Board. It was most specific. It was - </para>

                    <para class="block">There can be no possibility of misunderstanding in regard to the matter. The Minister said that the item now before the committee was not dealt with by the Tariff Board in this particular report. The item before the committee includes cotton piece goods, ordinarily used for manufacture, and so on. The Minister has thus been guilty of a very grave offence, which has no precedent in the Commonwealth Parliament, and I am speaking with a knowledge of it extending over 30 years. However, we have learnt a lesson to-night. We know now what credence we can place in the Minister's statements, and what value we can place on the figures he has quoted to prove that reductions in price levels have been brought about by his precious protection policy. </para>
                    <para>We have had a long speech from the Minister on the old theory of the new protection. When listening to him, I was asking myself whether we were a parliamentary committee considering the tariff, or an assembly somewhat of the nature of a new Arbitration Court. The honorable gentleman indulged in a prolonged apology to the trade unions of this country because he had some difficulty in bringing the tariff into operation as an arbitration measure, or, in other words, because he was confronted by constitutional obstacles to the use of the tariff to prevent a reduction of wages, either through the fall in the cost of living, or by an award of the Arbitration Court. Surely this is an extraordinarily serious plea that has been made by the Minister, and an apology on behalf of the tariff which this country must view with grave concern. The tariff was never intended to be a wage maker, or a wage upholder. The Minister expressed the deepest regret that the matter of upholding wages, and maintaining existing hours of employment, was outside the ambit of his power. That was tantamount to admitting the futility of the assurance given by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> that if manufacturers increased prices as the result of increased duties, or if they did not maintain wages, those duties would be removed. </para>

                            <para>- He has made it in this chamber a dozen times. The Minister, in reality, has declared that as wages fall, in accordance with the reduction of the cost of living, or because of awards of the Arbitration <inline font-style="italic">Court, the</inline> tariff must <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> up. That is an ominous doctrine for the Australian people, and, particularly, for the primary producers, because it makes the whole policy of protection an absolute menace and blight. Unless we Australian people are able to sell primary produce profitably overseas, in great quantities, we are almost doomed. The Minister has propounded something entirely new in tariff-making. To-day there are 400,000 unemployed in this country, and, if such a policy succeeded, many more of our people would be out of work - in fact, we should always have unemployed, and the future of Australia would be dark, indeed. </para>

                        <para>.- As the proposer of the motion for the postponement of this item, I desire to reply to some of the statements that have been made. I thank the Minister for the trouble that he has taken in securing the information that he has offered to the committee ; but no valid reasons have bees given why the motion that I have submitted should not be supported. The information furnished by the Minister is, in the main, irrelevant, as were most of the statements made by honorable members opposite. I think that the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> finished up in . a cotton field. The object of the motion is not the abolition, or reduction, of the proposed duty, and there was no need for the allusions by several members, including the Minister himself. to the tragedy of unemployment that would follow the removal of the duty. The Minister might as well have talked about " the flowers that bloom in the spring ", which, like his remarks, "have nothing to do with the case ". In a " boy stood on the burning deck " type of speech, the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> tried to rouse the committee to a state of expectancy over some terrible disclosures that he was about to make. He intended to establish the perfidy of the Minister in charge of the bill. He made a number of random statements, and I, personally, would like to have a copy of the text of his charges, so that I might examine them in detail. The members of the group with which I am associated are representatives of Labour from the State of New South Wales, and our action is the result of a request from the union of the organized textile workers in the industry concerned. </para>

                            <para>- That remains to be seeD. We may still be able to persuade the Government to do something in the direction of meeting the expectations of those who have sent us into this Parliament. I say that because of the splendid contribution to this debate by the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Keane).</inline></para>

                    <para>As I have already said, an appeal has been addressed to the members of my group as Labour men, and as representatives of New South Wales. The representatives of the union are backed by the Sydney Trades and Labour Council. Their appeal contains a number of specific statements which cannot be sidetracked by the Minister or by anybody else. It is pointed out that the influence of the organized workers in this' country, and in this industry in particular, was used to have restrictions placed on the importation of goods from overseas, so that the interests of the workers in this industry would be safeguarded, and so that their employers would be protected from unfair overseas competition, which it was hoped would give these organized workers continuity of employment, and maintain or improve their wages and conditions. Otherwise, the standard of living that has been laboriously built up by our party would be lowered. The first point to be established is whether that statement is correct or not. The efforts made by this union to have the tariff rates increased practically stopped the importation of textiles that could be manufactured in Australia. I ask, is that correct or not? The object of my motion is not to abolish the duties; but, simultaneously with the attempt of the employers in this industry to secure the advantages of an increased tariff, there happens to be a move on their part to secure a 10 per cent, reduction of the wages of the employees. Can the Government ignore thi3 circumstance? If what I have outlined is a fact - and it cannot be denied - surely the Labour Government in this Parliament will not say that it is a matter that does not concern it. Despite all that has been said about an attempt being made to use the tariff as an arbitration court, the fact remains that we cannot divorce considerations of wage principles, working conditions, and general standards of living from tariff principles and proposals. </para>

                            <para>- I am putting forward the case submitted to me and my colleague, which forms the basis of the motion which I have moved. It is not my responsibility to pay regard to the opinions of others. The motion has not been submitted with the intention of causing any injury to the industry, and 1 am not reflecting in any way upon those who control it. Some honorable members spoke at great length concerning the superlative merits of the business enterprise and production of the Australian textile industry, but these merits are not questioned. My colleague and I have already paid the highest possible tribute to the Australian textile industry; but some honorable members have apparently overlooked the fact that the high reputation which it enjoys is in a large measure, if not entirely, due to the class and skill of employees engaged in it, without whose services it could not have developed in the way it has done. It is on their behalf that I have submitted my motion, which I think is fully justified, and should be seriously considered by the Government and its supporters. Its defeat will mean the betrayal of those who sent the Labour party into power - by those to whom the workers of this country are looking for relief, especially in circumstances such as those I have mentioned. </para>

I do not charge the Minister with having deliberately misled the committee, as I believe he has given the committee the information supplied to him by his officers. But just as the Minister said that I had walked into a trap, I think his advisers unwittingly and unwillingly have dug a pit into which the Minister has fallen headlong. I wish to prove my assertion that the Tariff Board's report does deal with cotton piece goods other than those referred to in item 105 a 1 <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> In the first place, the Tariff Board sets out a table of existing duties, and the items upon which requests have been made for increased duties. In setting out the existing duties the Tariff Board mentions item 105 a 1 <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and sub-items <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and c and the whole of the existing duties which are now being replaced by sub-items <inline font-style="italic">a, b,</inline> and c.

                        <para>.- I shall reply to the point raised by the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson).</inline> Before I asserted that the honorable member was wrong in stating that the Tariff Board recommended that the duty should not be increased on cotton tweeds, I consulted the officers of my department, who have had a great deal to do with the tariff, and who are thoroughly conversant with the investigations made by the Tariff Board in the matter. In addition, I personally read the report of the Tariff Board, and I came to the conclusion that it did not refer to cotton tweeds. </para>

                            <para>- That attitude does not become even an ex-Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The recommendations of the Tariff Board in this matter are under two heads, one dealing with a request for increased duties on denims, drills, jeans, dungarees and cloths in the grey, and the second with "whether a deferred duty should be provided to cover other cotton piece goods." "Why should the board inquire into a deferred duty on cotton tweed when there was a duty already operating in regard to that item?. The deferred duty referred to would be one that would operate at some future date on cotton goods not now being manufactured in </para>

                    <para class="block">Australia. Cotton tweeds were then being manufactured in Australia and were enjoying the protection contained in this schedule before the House. There is a gentleman in the gallery whose firm manufactures cotton tweeds, and he assures me that the inquiry concerned only denims, drills, jeans, dungarees and cloths in the grey and other cotton piece goods, but not cotton tweeds. So that what I stated was absolutely correct. I do not believe that the honorable member for Gippsland endeavoured to mislead the committee, but I am surprised that a gentleman who held the position of  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition should have tried to do so. If I were in the wrong I should be prepared to withdraw my statement and apologize, but I am assured by my officers, and the gentleman to whom I have referred, that what I have stated is absolutely correct. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> which appears at page 8 of the report by the Tariff Board, reads - </para>

                        <para>As regards the question of the provision of deferred duties- " Deferred duties," mark you. The duties already operating on cotton tweeds were not deferred duties, so that reference could not relate to cotton tweeds. The paragraph continues - in respect of cotton piece goods, other than those covered by the application, the manufacture of which might be started in conjunction with the existing and proposed cotton-weaving, no evidence was tendered to the board . . . </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Honorable members will notice, that the paragraph says " might be started." The manufacture of cotton tweeds had already been, started in Australia, so that the words could not apply to them. I stand by what I have said, that the investigation was not into a duty on cotton tweeds, and that the recommendation of the Tariff Board has no application to that item. The duty imposed by the Government is but a small increase on that recommended by the Tariff Board in 1925. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise to speak to the motion moved by the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Eldridge.)  The honorable member dealt with a letter that had been received by him from the Australian Textile "Workers Union, asking that the debate on this item should be postponed until a conference could be arranged by the Minister, consisting of representatives of the textile manufacturers and workers, and departmental officers. I ask the honorable member whether, if it were within the province of the Government to call such a conference, he and the union concerned would accept the responsibility of wiping out the duty if the manufacturers refused to agree to withdraw their application for a wage reduction. The honorable member for Martin came here pledged to support the principle of arbitration. There are the consumers and other workers to be considered in addition to those whose case he has put forward to-day. Does the honorable member believe in the fixation of wages by Parliament? If he does he must be consistent and advocate that principle in connexion with the fixation of wages for all workers. What about the wages of shearers, dairy employees, those in the cotton-picking industry, and so forth? </para>

                            <para>- Nobody has listened to a more flowery or more inconsistent gentleman than the honorable member for Martin, and 110 one knows him better than I do. For a long time he has " got away " with it, but he is not going to get away with is so far as the workers are concerned. I want to know whether he is prepared to go the full distance and support the removal of these duties if the manufacturers refuse to withdraw their application for a 10 per cent, wage reduction. In reply to an interjection, the honorable member said that it Was irrelevant to the issue and referred to his pretty little verse about the "flowers that bloom in the spring". He is one of the flowers blooming in this chamber, and he has proved a bad advocate for the case that has been handed to him. I believe that the Australian Textile Workers Union originally asked for protection to be granted to this industry in which they are employed, and that union's advocate in this chamber must state whether he is prepared to take the responsibility of having those duties withdrawn, if the suggested conference proves abortive. If such a conference could be convened, it should be representative of every interested section of the community. There are others besides the textile workers who are deserving of consideration. Already those workers have the protection of the Arbitration Court. This Government was returned on a policy of arbitration. An arbitration bill was one of the measures introduced when the honorable member, now followed by the honorable member for Martin, was Minister for Labour and Industry, and that gentleman was one of the party managers who conferred with members of another place on the measure. He, too, was returned on a policy of arbitration. Further, one of the planks of the New South Wales Labour party supports arbitration, and as an arbitration bill is now before the New South Wales State House, the honorable member for Martin must be frank, instead of referring in his flowery manner to the words of Nanki-Poo. </para>

I conclude that the honorable member for Martin is asking the Government to postpone the debate on this item in order that the Minister may convene a three-party conference consisting of the manufacturers and the employees concerned, and representatives of the Department of Trade and Customs. I take it that if the manufacturers are not inclined to withdraw their application for a 10 per cent, reduction of wages, the Government will be expected to withdraw the additional duties which it has imposed on cotton piece goods. That is just what he studiously refrained  from saying, but it is what, he wants. The union considers that it has been " sold a pup " over this matter. These hard-working unionists have contributed their hard-earned money to the fighting fund which helped to put the Government of the day where it is. The union also supported the employers, at least morally, in their application for increased duties, and now they feel that they have been betrayed by both parties, by the Government on the one hand, and by the manufacturers on the other. </para>

                            <para>- I shall leave the honorable member to argue the matter out with the  president  of the union. It is not I who am making these charges; I am merely trying to say what the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge)</inline> refrained from saying, namely, what his real purpose was in asking for the postponement of this item. The Minister has refused to agree to the amendment on the ground that if he postponed the item to enable a conference of outside parties to be held, he would create a precedent which would be taken advantage of by those interested in other industries. In that, I think, he is right. The parties to this bargaining seem not to have paid the least consideration to the claims of the general public who have to pay the piper. Evidently they believe that there is an inexhaustible well in which they can dip their buckets, and distribute the proceeds in the form of largesse to those whose interests they are supporting. In this matter I propose to support the Minister in tha stand he has taken. </para>

                        <para>.- It is rather surprising to witness the reversal of form on the part of some honorable members who oppose the amendment. It is true that those on this side of the House were elected to support a policy of arbitration, but I well remember the eloquent speeches of many of them who said that, while they supported arbitration, they did not believe in one-sided arbitration, and if they were returned to Parliament they would do their best to have the. Arbitration Court reconstituted so as to enable the workers to get a fair deal. Now those same honorable members, who were so eloquent when seeking the votes of the workers, admit frankly that, though sympathizing with them over their reduced wages and longer working hours, nothing can be done to help them. I hope that when the next appeal is made to the people they will tell the workers that they have no control over wages or working conditions. It has been said that if this conference is called, representatives of all sections of the community should be invited to attend. It has also been said that the mover of the amendment was not candid enough to state the reason for which he desired the item to be postponed. I have no hesitation in stating why I support the amendment. I propose to adopt every means in my power to prevent the wages of the workers in this industry from being reduced. I desire that the wishes of the workers be given effect to. </para>

                            <para>- Well, is the honorable member prepared to agree to the postponement of the item until we can find out what the workers desire in regard to the application now before the court? It must be quite evident that the workers do not desire that their wages should be reduced. I agree that if protection is removed from this industry, at the request of the men employed in it, by the workers' own elected representatives the workers themselves must accept responsibility for what is done; but if, on the other hand, the workers elected representatives, who owe their election to the funds subscribed by the workers, fail to do what they can to prevent wages from being reduced and hours lengthened, then the responsibility surely rests upon those representatives. They cannot have it both ways. </para>

                            <para>- I abide by your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman.</inline> When one has a strong case, on does not mind answering interjections. Every possible means will be adopted by the group of which I am a member to prevent the slashing of wages and the lengthening of hours. Many honorable members on this side of the House, when supporting proposals for protection at the request of employers, have said that it would help to provide employment. If that attitude is carried to its logical conclusion, they must believe, presumably, that work with no wages at all would be better than no work at all. No doubt, if wages were cut in half by the Arbitration Court, this Labour Government would still say - " We are sympathetic towards the workers; we are prepared to take their money when we desire to contest, an election ; but we are not prepared to make an attempt to help them by having the Arbitration Court reconstituted. We are powerless to do that ". It is strange that honorable members who support the Government should admit their powerlessness to do anything for the workers when considering tariff questions. All they are able to do is to discuss whether one set of capitalists are to have an advantage over another set. If the tariff is used to protect industry, so that a high standard of living can be maintained, we are prepared to support a high tariff. We shall agree to protect any industry which will provide decent living conditions for those employed in it; but the group to which I belong will be no party to forcing the standard of living in this country down to the level of that in the low-wage countries of the world. </para>

                        <para>.- Some of the statements of the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> do not meet with, my approval. I agree with him that it is not right for an industry, having received tariff protection, to apply to the Arbitration Court for a reduction of wages. That, to my mind, is an appalling thing.  Within  the last six months the Federal Arbitration- Court has varied 117 awards by reducing wages. The recent reduction of 10 per cent.  wa3  the most monstrous thing ever done by any court. At various times employers have asked for increased tariff protection giving as a reason the high wages they have had to pay, and the high overhead costs they have had to bear. Protection, was given to them, and now they turn round and apply for a reduction of wages. To that extent I am in agreement with the honorable member for East Sydney, but I disagree with him when he, as  a  new member, takes it upon himself to brand other honorable members on this side of the House as incompetent. He stated that during the election campaign we promised that wages would not be reduced, and that we would stand firm for industrial arbitration. Let me remind the honorable member that the leader of his party was in charge of the bill which this Government introduced with the object of giving effect to its promises. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> would like to abolish all our wage standards and wage-fixing tribunals. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> has pointed out that three parties must be considered in this matter, namely, the employers, the employees, and the consumers. I agree with him. Some time ago the employers in this industry made an application for an increase of duty, and it was granted; but during an abnormal period they are reducing the wages of their employees. In the circumstances the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge)</inline> should withdraw his amendment and allow the matter to be dealt with in another way. The duty should be agreed to; but the Government should take steps to protect the interests of the workers in the industry. </para>

                        <para>. -  The position of this industry has been grossly misrepresented during this debate. It has been alleged that the employers have been unfairly reducing the wages of their employees. This afternoon I read a letter to honorable members which was similar to the one read this evening by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> in which it was shown indisputably that all the employers in the textile industry in New South Wales desire is to bring wages and conditions in that State into conformity with those which obtain in the other States of the Commonwealth. To-day the workers in this industry in Victoria are operating under a 48-hour week, and they are receiving less wages a week than the employees in the industry in New South Wales are receiving for a 44-hour week. The employers in New South Wales simply desire that the conditions in their State shall be made uniform with those in Victoria and other States. </para>

                            <para>- It is obvious that the committee is in agreement with the view which I have expressed. The Minister has explained at great length the nature of the communications which he has received from the industrial organizations concerned, and has stated that the Government cannot do anything without the consent of the unions concerned. He has confessed that he is not a free agent in this House; that he is bound to pay regard to views expressed outside. The preparation and submission of a tariff schedule as an instrument of taxation is the responsibility of the Government. The conditions under which persons shall be employed in industry is a matter to be determined by the Arbitration Courts of this country. The two functions are separate and distinct. This is proved in the words of the Minister himself. He has admitted that, because of tie limitations imposed upon this Parliament bv the Constitution, he cannot enforce the principle of the new protection. He has also admitted, that, even if he convened a conference, as has been suggested, he could only make an abortive threat to lift the duties, because if he took such drastic action, he should be inflicting a hardship upon legitimate and honest employers for the purpose merely of penalising one or two employers who might not be observing the awards of the Arbitration Court. There is not the slightest justification whatever for supporting the amendment. I intend to vote against it. </para>

I should not have spoken upon this item but for the remarks of the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge),</inline> who conveyed the impression that he and one or two others were the only honorable members, particularly on the Government side, who were in any way concerned about the welfare of employees in the textile and subsidiary industries. The imposition of a tariff is a "matter of national concern. Even if arrangements were made for a conference it would be advisable to ratify the whole of the tariff schedule pending its decision. The proposal seems to be altogether too vague. No one can say how long it would take to summon the conference, and how long that body would take to arrive at a decision. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Instead of postponing consideration of this important item pending the decision of a conference, it would be much better to pass a measure ratifying . the tariff schedule so as to allow industries which have been working under the new tariff to continue in operation. It is significant that, although the honorable gentleman has been associated with the Government and its supporters ever since he has been a member of this House, this is the only occasion upon which he has raised any  objection.' to these' items'. Although -there are, in the Lang division, three of the largest woollen mills, and the1 largest knitting mill in the Commonwealth-, I have never had-, from individual unionists or' from union officials-, . complaints of- the nature indicated, by the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eldridge).</inline> In at least one' of the' mills' in my electorate, the' employee's are in1 receipt  of  wages above the award rates. In the tailoring a'n'd clothing, factories of New South Wales alone there are 11,571 employees, as compared with a total for' the Commonwealth of 26,953. The total amount paid in  wages  in the year 1929 was, in New South Wales, £1,583,000, and in Australia-, £3,524,000. In the  subsidiary dressmaking  and millinery establishments 'therewere employed in that year 3,384 and 14,778 persons  in  New South Wales and Australia respectively the amount paid in wages- being £335, 867 and £1,532,734. Those figures indicate the importance of the industry  and  the desirability of having the schedule ratified, not in the', interests of the employers, but in the interests of Australia. I desire that the wages paid, in all industries 'in the Commonwealth  shall  be kept on as high  a  &gt;plane as possible.- The mere fact  that  the Arbitration Court reduction of 10  per dent. -  with which I totally disagree - applies to this 'industry does not justify withholding the ratification of the "schedule. Consequently, I shall have no hesitation in voting against the amendment; </para>

                    <para class="block">I am satisfied that this duty has been imposed under a complete misapprehension on the part of the Government. The Minister seems to think that it will help an Australian industry, but what he is really increasing is the cost of raw material for clothing, which cannot be made out of Australian material. </para>
                    <para>This is another illustration of excessive duties defeating the purpose for which they were imposed, that of increasing the revenue and employment. They can have no effect on the production of cotton within Australia, as Australia's cotton is 95 per cent. of one class, and in the manufacture of these piece goods it is necessary to use various grades of American, Egyptian and Indian cotton. That this is a necessity is shown by the experience of the Australian Towel Manufacturers, who already find it imperative to import much of the yarn used to make their towels. This duty can only have the effect of increasing the price of goods to the consumer and is an unnecessary and unjust  tax on the worker. </para>

                            <para>- The workers in the textile industry claim that they are not sufficiently protected. If any bodies can speak authoritatively for them, they are the Australasian Council of Trade Unions and the Federal and State textile unions to whose letters reference has been made. The Arbitration Court has failed in that it has reduced wages by 10 per cent., and if the employers are to have the benefit of increased duties, something should be done in the interests of the employees. The protection of the textile industry and every other industry has reached only the initial stage. Our reason for protection is that it protects the wages of Australian workers against the lower wages paid in other countries. If I support increased duties to industries that do not pay the wages that protection is designed to provide, I am no longer a protectionist. The workers in the textile industry can be protected only through our present control of the tariff, and if they are not well paid the primary producers will be the chief sufferers. I trust that the Minister will not allow the other items to pass until the employers who enjoy high duties are brought to heel. </para>

                        <para>. - I sympathize with those honorable members who protest against the action of the Government in increasing duties when wages are being reduced in all directions ; but I suggest that a simple remedy  is available. Those members who complain of the policy adopted by the Government should join members on this side. If the wages in the textile industry have been reduced 10 per cent., the duties should be reduced to a similar extent, in order to let the public have the benefit of reduced prices. The policy of honorable members on this side, who have consistently supported the principle of federal arbitration, is that awards of the court should be obeyed, whether they increase or reduce wages. In the case under consideration, the court has reduced wages, and we now have the spectacle of a Labour government, of all governments, bringing clown successive tariff schedules which put duties up when wages are coming down, with the deliberate object of enabling manufacturers to maintain high prices. </para>

                        <para>. - In reply to the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> I may state that I have had from honorable members on both sides of the House a request such as he has made, to which I was not inclined to agree. I myself shall not be here next Tuesday, because I have to attend the Premiers' Conference in Melbourne. I shall tell honorable members to-morrow when the House will be called together next week. </para>
