The present system of credit and currency was an illogical compromise between old traditions and new needs. </para>

Certain interests have expressed a wish that the Government should hear them upon the matter, and I am holding the conference in order to meet their wishes.

The question arises whether the Government should, out of Consolidated Revenue, make refunds to persons who have paid duties which have since been reduced. That practice has not been followed in the past. </para>

The Government felt that the claim on behalf of the unemployed was as strong as that for the relief of our wheat-farmers. Both sections of the community are very greatly in need of assistance.We are still pressing for financial aid for the relief of our unemployed in conjunction with our proposals for the relief of wheat farmers. </para>

                        <para>- We propose next week to pass the Debt Conversion Agreement Bill and the Debt Conversion Bill, both of which relate to that portion of the Commonwealth public debt which was not converted recently. There is also a Wine Excise Bounty Bill which will be introduced this afternoon, and, J hope, passed through all stages. There are one or two other small measures including an amendment of the Financial Emergency Act. This will be distributed to-day and read a first time. Another is a bill dealing with the bounty on flax. When these are disposed of, the House will adjourn while another place is dealing with the tariff. </para>

As to the length of the recess, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should  be able  to assist me in formulating an answer to his inquiry. We shall have to make some estimate of the time which the Senate will occupy in dealing with the tariff, and after consultation I may  be  able to give the House some information  on the point. I hope, however, that it will not bc many weeks before we are back again. </para>

                            <para>- The Government has, for some time, been very much concerned about the price of petrol in Australia; but we are not in a position to say definitely whether it is or is not too high. To all appearances it seems to be very high, but we are not well informed upon the subject, nor have we been kept as fully informed as we believe we ought to have been. For this reason we have appointed to the directorate of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited one of the most reliable and trustworthy officials of the Treasury - and that is saying a great deal, since there are so many highly-qualified and trustworthy officers in that department - who will act as a liaison officer between the Treasury and the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. We are taking the same action in connexion with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and in future will have a liaison officer between that organization and the Government department controlling it. In this way we hope to be kept well informed about the activities of both organizations. As to the second part of the honorable member's question, we desire to get information, so as to determine whether a public investigation is necessary. If we find that it is, we will not hesitate to institute a public inquiry into the whole position. </para>

It. is the intention of the Government, at a later date, by an amendment of the excise tariff to provide for a specific duty on wine. It is not proposed, nor is it desirable, at this stage, to indicate what rate of duty will apply. In 1930 this Government appointed the  Hon.

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Previous to 1918 the rate of duty on fortifying spirits was a nominal one, and was imposed so that the amount collected would be sufficient to pay for the services of officers. It was necessary that the mixing of spirit with wine be closely supervised, and every operation was done in the presence of an excise officer. In 1918 the Government was in need of additional revenue, and a duty of 6s. per proof gallon was levied on spirits used in the fortification of wine. With the exception of dry sherry, fortifying spirit is only used in the manufacture of sweet wines of the port or muscat type. Fortifying spirit is not used in the production of dry wines of the claret or hock type. In 1925, in order to assist the growers of Doradillo grapes, the duty was reduced to 5s. so far as spirit made from this class of grapes was concerned. The duty on spirit made from all other classes of grape remained at 6s. per proof gallon. Since 1924 a bounty has been paid on fortified wine exported from the Commonwealth with a view to clearing some of the surplus production. Up to March, 1930, the payment of this bounty was made from the Consolidated Revenue. Owing to the fall in revenue and the heavy burden which the payment of this bounty placed upon the country, it was decided to ask the industry to pay the bounty. </para>

                            <para>-  The other system was becoming almost unworkable because of the volume of work that had to be done in bond. Although this system will require policing, I do not think it will be more difficult than the other system. Last year this Government was of the opinion that the necessary funds for bounty payments should be provided by the wine industry. The duty on fortifying spirit was then raised by 5s. per proof gallon, and it was provided that the amount collected at this increased rate should be paid into a trust fund from which payments for bounty would be made. The present rates of duty on fortifying spirit are as follow :  - </para>

                    <para>In 1918, when the duty was levied on fortifying spirit for revenue purposes for the first time it was considered that this form of collecting a tax on wine was as simple as it was efficient. At that time this was so. Later, however, there was a great change in the economic conditions of the wine industry. Returned soldiers were established in vineyards on the river Murray and on the Mumimbidgee irrigation area in New South Wales. When the vines in the river Murray districts in South Australia came into bearing the State Government assisted the settlers to process the grapes by financing the establishment of wineries on a co-operative basis. This led to a surplus production of wine, and caused many difficulties in the industry. Duty on fortifying spirit was at that time collected at the time of fortification. The co-operative companies found they were unable to finance the payment of duty on fortifying spirit at the time it was mixed with the wine. They approached the Government with a request to be allowed to fortify the wine in bond, the duty on the fortifying spirit to be collected when the wine was delivered for consumption. Their request was granted. Other wine-makers were soon attracted by this concession, and at the moment nearly all fortification throughout the Commonwealth is carried out in bond. Other concessions followed this arrangement, and ultimately such operations as racking, fining, blending, and other similar operations were allowed to be carried out in bond. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. As the export trade grew, wine-makers were allowed to export direct from bond. All these operations had to take place under the supervision of excise officers, and the conditions necessary to protect the revenue became so intricate and irksome that the wine-makers' business was considerably handicapped. </para>

                    <para>It has always been the practice when an article is exported to return any duty which has been paid on the article. When fortified wine is exported, therefore, the duty paid on the spirit used for fortifying it is returned to the exporter. This transaction is termed a drawback of duty. It is not possible, however, to arrive at the precise amount of duty which was paid on any particular wine exported. It was necessary in the circumstances to provide for a flat rate of  drawback which covered the average amount of duty cost of fortifying spirit in each gallon of wine. The flat rate provided as the duty cost of fortifying at the present rate of duty is 2s. 4d. per gallon of wine. In some cases this amount is more than the actual cost. In other cases the amount is less than the actual cost. </para>
                    <para>There are no less than seven different rates of drawback. They deal with the various rates of duty and with various classes of wine. Rebates on spirit extracted from lees of wine have to be provided for, and the department has always been on the lookout for possible revenue leakages. </para>
                    <para>Referring to this matter in their report, Messrs. Gunn and Gollan said - </para>

                        <para>These drawbacks, rebates, and remissions relating to wine exported are necessary in order that the wine-makers and distillers may receive equitable treatment in the matter of having the excise duty already paid returned to them when the wine is shipped overseas. It is very necessary that effective methods bo adopted to supervise the exact quantity of wine dealt with so that the correct amounts of drawbacks, rebates, and remissions may be given. All transactions have, therefore, to be carefully scrutinized by officers to make certain that the amount of drawbacks, refunds and remissions are properly due. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">With the removal of the duty on fortifying spirit as proposed in this bill, there will be no need for drawbacks, rebates, or remissions. This will be a great relief to the department as well as to the winemaker who finds that the drawback rates do not compensate him. </para>
                    <para>This bill provides that all persons who produce grapes for use in the manufacture of wine must be registered. No fee is to be charged. This practice is followed in. connexion with the producers of tobacco leaf, who have to register with the Collector of Customs in the State in which they live. </para>

Every grower will be asked to register as a grower under the act, and as the growers are getting some benefit in the form of a bounty, surely they will not object to registering. The tobacco-growers, who are not receiving a bounty, are all registered. Gold producers, also, have to register. </para>

The representations made by the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch)</inline> on behalf of the growers in the Great Western district will be considered. Provision is made for the licensing of persons who desire to receive and store wine for export. This will enable a merchant who is not a wine-maker, and who has built up an export trade, to prepare and bottle wine, which is subject to excise duty, and ship it overseas. This will be a considerable convenience to those who intend to bottle wine for shipment to Canada. Since the Canadian treaty, a trade in bottled wines with Canada has opened up, aud there is every indication that it will assume very large proportions. </para>

                    <para>In providing for the payment of duty on wine delivered for home consumption, it is intended that all duty shall accrue at the winery. Payments will be made weekly or monthly, as may be prescribed. The wine-maker will have to keep certain books, which will reveal details of all the wine sent out of the winery, and a penalty of £500 is provided for, should there be any irregularity in the removal of wine from the winery. At the moment there are large stocks of wine containing spirit on which excise duty has been paid. A quantity of this will be used for home consumption, and a quantity will be blended with newer wines. It is intended flint duty will not be again levied on these wines, and provision is made in the bill that if any of it is blended with wines subject to the wine excise duty, a refund will be made. Entries will be required when wine is removed, but an exception is made where a wine-maker wishes to transfer wine from one winery to another when they are both owned by him, also when a wine-maker wishes to transfer wine from his winery to his distillery or his vinegar factory. In order to simplify the procedure in these instances, provision is made so that these transactions may take place under permit. </para>
                    <para>This bill gives to officers certain powers which are necessary to carry out efficiently the provisions contained in the bill, and to protect properly the revenue. Officers will have access to the premises of persons licensed under the proposed act, and to the books kept by them. They will have power to enter and search premises where there is cause to suspect illicit practices are being carried on. On reasonable suspicion-, they may stop and search vehicles or boats suspected of carrying wine upon which duty has not been paid. They may also seize and secure any wine which they have reason to believe is forfeited. </para>
                    <para>In changing the incidence of taxation on wine, this bill has an important bearing on the wine industry. Previously wine-makers were much hampered in their operations on account of the restrictions necessary to protect the revenue when fortified wine was manufactured in bond. The part of the winery where this was done had to be kept under lock. Every vat containing this wine had to be securely locked, and nothing could be done excepting in the presence of an officer. An excise duty on wine will give the winemaker absolute freedom in making and preparing wine for home consumption There will be no bonds or locks, the obligation of the wine-maker being the payment of duty on all the wine which it delivered for home consumption, and also properly accounting for the wine which is delivered for any other purpose. There will be no necessity for the presence of an officer when wine is delivered, but the department will be safeguarded by the entries in the wine-makers' books. The provision for duty to be paid weekly will suit the convenience of the wine-maker. Of course, the department will see tha: in this respect all transactions are sufficiently covered by a substantial security. </para>
                    <para>Before proceeding with preparation of the proposals contained in this bill, the views of representatives of the different interests of those engaged in the wine industry were obtained. In every instance the proposals have been approved, and wine-makers will find that the provision of this bill are of the simplest kind, there being no unnecessary interference with the main essentials of their industry </para>

                            <para>- My present intention is not to push on with the bill next week if there is any desire to delay its passage so that the industry may have more time to express its opinion on it. The Government does not wish to rush through Parliament a bill that may dislocate trade in some way; I do not think this bill will do so; the broad principles of the measure meet with the general approval of the trade. The only point on which there will be a difference of opinion is the rate of duty to be charged. That matter is not dealt with in the bill; it merely provides the machinery for the collection of excise duty on wine on a flat rate basis instead of an excise duty on fortifying spirit. Dry wines are not fortified, and no excise is now paid on them. </para>

                            <para>- There is no such intention at the present time. That matter will be considered when the bill reaches the committee stage. One of the difficulties of the industry is that there is over-production. The State Governments have assisted thousands of persons to produce grapes for wine-making purposes, and the provision of an export bounty to enable the surplus to be marketed was necessitated. I do not consider it wise to put additional areas under vines for the production of wines that we have been unable to sell. </para>

                            <para>- I must have misunderstood the honorable member. I can assure him that the standard of wine-making will be raised, because, in the past, the use of fortifying spirit has been restricted on account of the high duty. The use of spirit is necessary in the manufacture of high-class sweet wine of such types as port or muscat, and wine-makers, on  account of the abolition of the duty on fortifying spirit, will be in a position to use the proper quantity of spirit required to make a first quality wine. In this way it is considered that the industry will receive substantial benefit. There is a tendency to-day to avoid using fortifying spirit, or to use as little of it as possible, and to employ substitutes such  as  concentrated must. This has led to a cheap class of wine, commonly known as "pinkie", being put on the market in order to avoid paying revenue charges to the Commonwealth. When there is a flat rate of duty at so much per gallon, it will apply to all wines, and there will "be no inducement to put a cheap and inferior wine on the market in order to avoid the excise duty. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Chablis is a popular light wine in which no fortifying spirit is used. It is largely produced in the Hunter River districts of New South Wales, and in the Great Western district of Victoria, and the imposition of a heavy duty per gallon on chablis, which is sold at as low as1s. 6d., and up to 4s. 6d. a bottle, would increase the price substantially. It has been pointed out to me by the growers in the Hunter River district, and in the Great Western district of Victoria, that the light dry wines cannot carry the same excise duty as, for example, sweet port, muscat and champagne. It has been represented that that difficulty might be overcome by exempting all dry wines with alcoholic content of 22 degrees and under, or by placing a very low rate of excise duty upon them, and applying to dry wines of an alcoholic content of from 28 to 28 the same flat rate of duty as will be applied to sweet wines. Those are matters that will be taken into consideration before the excise schedule is brought down. </para>

                <para class="block">The sole purpose of this measure is to alter one word in the definition of " flax " in the original act; that is, to substitute the word " scutched " for the word "combed." The present definition reads -  " Flax " means the cleaned combed fibre of the flax plant prepared by retting or by mechanical or other processes. </para>
                <para class="block">As proposed to be amended, it will read -  " Flax " means the cleaned scutched fibre of the flax plant,&amp;c. </para>
                <para class="block">It hus been found that, as the definition now stands, bounty cannot be paid on flax fibre as actually produced in the Australian flax mills. This fibre is merely scutched, and not combed, combing being a process that is carried out in all flax-producing countries by spinning factories after these factories have purchased scutched fibre from the flax mills. </para>
                <para>At the time that the Flax and Linseed Bounties Act was introduced, the department was under the impression that the Australian flax mills produced a combed fibre. This, however, has been found not to be the case. In the meantime, a considerable amount of fibre has been produced under the act, and the legal advice of the Attorney-General's Department is to the effect that the act should be amended as proposed, so as to enable the bounty, earned properly and in good faith by the mills, to be paid to thorn. </para>
                <para>To make the position quite clear, I may say that the fibre is produced by the flax mill from the stalk of the flax plant, which in appearance is much the same as wheat or oats. The mill produces a scutched fibre, on which it was the intention of the Government and Parliament to pay the bounty. As one of the conditions of the bounty, the act prescribes that the mill must pay to the growers of flax plants such prices as the Minister for Trade and Customs considers reasonable. I have just nominated reasonable prices for flax plants for the coming season, commencing in January, 1932. </para>
                <para>Hope and twine makers, spinners, and factories who or which may manufacture other flax' products, purchase scutched fibre, which is used by them either in scutched form or after combing, according to the purpose of the purchaser. <inline font-style="italic">"No</inline> good purpose would be served by compelling the mills themselves to perform the additional process of combing, so as to comply with the act. That would merely increase the market value of the product, as it would then be a more finished and valuable product. As the act provides that bounty shall be paid at ad valorem rates, calculated on the Australian market value of the fibre, the only result of compelling the mills to adopt the additional process of combing would be to increase the actual amounts of bounty payable by the Government. Moreover, this innovation in the established practice of the trade would take away the process of combing from the twine, rope and spinning factories, and doubtless cause justifiable resentment. The bill is non-contentious, and I hope that it will be passed without delay. </para>

                    <para>.- It is necessary for this bill to be brought down in order that the wish of this House, which was registered when the act was passed nine or twelve months ago, should be given effect. That act provided for the payment of a diminishing bounty - a proposal that is quite unlike what we are accustomed to in connexion with customs duties, which rather have the habit of growing. The bounties were to bc paid on a 15 per cent, ad valorem basis for last year and this year, 10 per cent, for next year and the year after, and <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> per cent, for the year 1935, when they were to cease. But in view of the fact that this House, by other legislation, has reduced all bounties by 20 per cent, - the gold bounty to an even greater extent - actually the 15 per cent, is reduced to 12 per cent, on the market value of the. flax and linseed for last year and this year, the 10 per cent, to 8 per cent, on the market value for next year and the year after, and the 7-J per cent, to 6 per cent, on the market value for 1935. As the act stands at present, while the growers can- obtain the bounty on the linseed itself, they cannot do so on the flax, because they are excluded from it by the presence of the word " combed " in the definition of "flax," which makes it impossible to pay the bounty on flax that is not combed. This measure will put matters right, and I support it. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to direct attention to a matter that vitally affects the wool-growing industry. Yesterday, I and some other honorable members, received a letter from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Clark, of Brisbane, in which he brought under our notice the injustice that is being done to this industry, which is contributing, and has contributed in the past, a large share of the taxation that is being, and that has been raised by the different governments of this country. There has been a considerable outcry regarding the wages that are paid in the industry, and the press have continually urged that the shearing rates had to be reduced if costs were to be lowered ; but not a word has been said about the freights that are charged by the overseas shipping companies. The leading Nationalist newspaper in Brisbane, the <inline font-style="italic">Courier,</inline> was sent a letter by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clark,</inline> in which he pointed out the injustice under which the wool industry was suffering, but that journal did not publish the letter in full. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clark</inline> has been nominated by the United Graziers Association to represent the wool-growers of Queensland on the Australian Overseas Transport Association. In his letter to me, referring to the communication that he forwarded to the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier,</inline> he says - </para>

Evidently, any reference to such a high personage as Lord Inchcape must not be made, although it is only since he appeared on the scene that our wool freights have increased from¾d. per lb. to 1 3-16d. plus6d. per bale for weighing. </para>

                    <para>Wool freights at present rates amount to four million pounds sterling yearly and this is the largest sum paid for outward cargo. Apart from this, wool bears a higher rate of freight than any other primary product, namely, 1 3-16d. per lb. Compare this with ¾d. per lb. charged on frozen meat, which requires refrigerated space. </para>
                    <para>We certainly have an Overseas Transport Association, consisting of ship-owners and shippers, operating under the Federal Government's sanction, but, in my opinion, this association is a farce.

Only a Parliament can deal with it, as the South African Parliament had to do on two occasions. </para>

                <para>This reduction cuts no ice, as little or no wool tops go from Australia. It is only camouflage to hoodwink the Government and the people. In the same paper the following rates of freight are quoted by ship-owners: - </para>

" A reduction of 5s. a ton in the freights on wheat shipped from Melbourne during September, October and November to the United Kingdom, the Continent and Colombo, was announced to-day by the Overseas Ship-owners Representatives Association. The new SeptemberOctober rate is 25s. a ton, and the new November rate 27s.6d. a ton.

                <para>Now, sir, I want you to think for yourself on this matter, and I ask you why shipowners voluntarily offer to carry flour to London during September-October for 25s. per ton while wool is 1 3-16d. per lb. or £11 per ton? Surely something is wrong, which I want you to right. Then again, why is wool carried by weight instead of by measurement. It is all placed in the same sized bales and dumped to the same measurements. Why are Sydney Harbour dues 9d. per ton on wheat, and on wool9d. per bale - seven times more? And again, why have our wool freights gone np so much since Lord Inchcape started out to eater for our welfare? </para>

                    <para>Howhas this been brought about - simply by Lord Inchcape getting control by merging a number of companies and acquiring dumping plants and wharfages wherever possible and dictating terms to all and sundry to the detriment of all primary producers, not only in Australia, but probably all over the world. In Java the combine is working.I put £50,000 into a plantation, lost 75 per cent. of my capital in fifteen years, never had a dividend on account of high rates of freight (about £6 per ton on copra), whereas if 1 had. put my money into a shipping company there, the K.V.H., I would have received 10 per cent. annually on my capital, viz., £5,000 a year, and would not have lost 75 per cent. of my capital. Then turn to New Guinea and the Solomons. Your readers will remember that after the war many of our returned soldiers bought a lot of the confiscated German plantations, when copra was £24 per ton. Last Monday week the <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> reported copra at £1 1 2s.6d. per ton in London, and your readers will scarcely believe me when I say that out of this £11 2s.6d. the freight is £7 per ton; yet I am assured by Captain Wm. Collin that he pays this rate of freight. Fifty years ago it was 35s. by sailer. The Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia is a very live body in Australia, and I invite their active co-operation in this scrap I am putting up trying to get their comrades a fair deal. </para>

                <para class="block">It is my wish to draw the attention of honorable members to the excessive freights being charged. We are told that a higher freight is generally charged for wool, yet wool is carried from Australia to Japan for 55 per cent. less than is charged from Australia to Great Britain. We will be told that Japan is nearer to Australia than is Great Britain, but it is a fact that all the ships trading outside the ring are carrying goods cheaper than those inside the ring. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clark</inline> asks why wheat and flour are carried cheaper than wool. </para>

                    <para class="block">The tramp steamers are allowed to carry wheat and flour, and produce other than wool and dairy produce, and are doing so at rates varying from 25s. to 27s. a ton. Wool is carried by weight, and a charge of6d. a bale is made for weighting. At seven bales to the ton, this amounts to 3s. 6d. per ton for weighing. Most goods are carried by measurement. It may be objected that a ton of wool would take up a great deal more room than a ton of wheat. That is so, but, even allowing for four times the space, it should not be charged more than £5 or £5 10s. per ton, if the charges were computed on the same basis as are freight charges on flour. The excessive freight charges on wool are costing the wool-growers of Australia £2,000,000 a year more than they should have to pay. It costs the Australian growers £4,000,000 a year to send their wool overseas. The growers have been told that their great difficulty is wages; that if arbitration court awards were abolished, everything would be all right. Shearing rates have already been cut by 22½ per cent., the station hands award has been suspended, and we will have more applications for reductions. The pastoral associations will tell the wool-grower that this is the way out. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> stated that there had been a 22½ per cent. reduction all round to meet the depression. Why, then, are not the shipping companies, at this time of national crisis, required to accept their share of the reduction ? Wool is, one of our chief primary products. It has provided a great deal of the national income for the last ten or fifteen years, and is entitled to some consideration. This is not the last word which I shall have to say on this matter. Next year there will be further applications to cut wages in the pastoral industry. Even under existing conditions, the wages of station hands are back to preharvester award days. The majority of small wool-growers do not wish to impose unfair conditions upon their employees. No one regrets more than they do that the stress of economic circumstances have forced a reduction of wages to employees in the industry. One or two small growers in my electorate who did not reduce the wages of their employees down to the award rate found when their wage sheets went to the banks, that the banker made a readjustment in accordance with the agreed pastoral companies' rate. In one case, the rate was reduced from 30s. to 20s. a week. It is strange that while conditions are so bad in the pastoral industry, this shipping ring should be allowed to exploit the people in this way. The fact that wool generally realizes more than wheat is no justification for a freight charge of £11 per ton as against 25s. per ton for wheat. </para>

This is a matter to which I have directed attention on more than one occasion in this House, but I regret to say that, up to the present, I have not been able to secure redress for our wool-growers. Without traversing the statements of the honorable member for Kennedy, I wish to emphasize the urgent need for government action in the interests of our wool-growers. The present freight charge was fixed at a time when wool prices were infinitely greater than they are to-day. The industry was than on a profitable basis. Latterly it has been passing through a period of depression, and there has been no corresponding downward trend in freights. It has been urged on several occasions that <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> is not possible for the Government to tafes action, until there is a united demand from the wool-growers themselves. </para>

Some time ago, a similar situation developed in South Africa, and as a result of government action shipping charges were substantially reduced.

Last Friday night he attended a community singing entertainment at Colac, in my constituency. I was not invited to attend the gathering, probably because I am not a humourist. The honorable member for Wilmot, however, took part in community singing, and later was given an opportunity to speak to those present. The speech which he is said to have made was not actually that delivered, as I find that the report which appeared in the press was handed in in typewritten form by some one else on his behalf. </para>

                        <para>The economic conditions of Tasmania during his boyhood were such that at the age of nine and a half years he was compelled to leave school and seek to earn something towards his sustenance.  His  thirst for knowledge was so evident, however, that two elderly aunts contrived to enable him to return to school and complete his studies. From very early years he showed an aptitude for imparting knowledge to others, and he was made a State school monitor. At seventeen years of age he had qualified as a teacher in the Education Department of Tasmania . . .  His  true interests, however, are his home and family . . . They have nine sturdy children . . . In his early days, however, he was a keen cricketer, footballer, tennis player and cyclist: indeed, a good all-round athlete. </para>

                    <para class="block">This statement was sent in type to all the newspapers published in the towns he was to visit. Is that not like a circus going to a town, beating the big drum, advertising, " Here comes the man who has nine children; here is the man who used to be a great athlete; here is the lad of uiue and a half years who became a school monitor " ? Is that fair politics ? Is it not an attempt to obtain a personal sympathy that the honorable member's politics alone could never win for him ? Is it not an attempt to assuage the public feeling due to his complete somersault from his previous political attitude? </para>

I have visited the districts of other honorable members opposite in speaking for my own party, and I have always either avoided mentioning the name of the member for the district, or I have done it solely for the purpose of making it perfectly clear that I have the greatest respect for him. In no case have I departed from either the one course or the other. No honorable member has evinced so much annoyance over my visits as has the honorable member for Corangamite. </para>

                            <para>- I am not worrying about that. I wish to deal briefly with the matter that the honorable member has raised in his wonderful contribution. He said that, when I interjected some days ago about somersaulting, I was endeavouring to show that he had supported the export duty on sheepskins. I deny that absolutely. I interjected because he first had made a statement charging me with somersaulting, and I throw the remark back at him, not suggesting that he has somersaulted, but that he is associated with a party that somersaulted in regard to thatduty. </para>

I was very glad, indeed, to know that the Government and the party supporting it had reversed its decision in the matter. The duty was imposed during my absence from Canberra. I was here when the party and the Government were opposed to it, but I was absent when the proposal was brought forward in this chamber, and I had no opportunity of protesting against it. as did the honorable member for Corangamite, who was present when the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> introduced the duty in this chamber. </para>

He referred to my statement that an offer of co-operation had been made by the then Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> and that I had supported the proposition. I gave away no caucus secrets in making that statement? Unfortunately I was misrepresented at that time. From that misrepresentation I entirely exonerate my ex-colleagues in the Cabinet. If I have been understood as having said that they were responsible for it, I am sorry. No words of mine were ever intended to convey that impression. I was misrepresented by the press, and said so in this House. Honorable members may recall that when I made my personal explanation I asked was there any honorable member on the Government side who had heard me advocate a coalition government? I invited any honorable member opposite, who claimed to have done so, to rise and say that he had ; but none did. </para>

                        <para>. - I am somewhat surprised at the tone of this debate, and cannot understand why ' any apology should be offered for what happened on the occasion under review. As I believe in the principle of an export duty on sheepskins, it is not my intention to apologize for that action. Had that duty been continued, thousands of men would have been employed in this country in the treatment of the skins. What has been the result of its discontinuance? Sheepskins have to be given away, because a price cannot be obtained for them on account of the absence of competition. Only the shipping companies who are carrying some of the skins overseas are deriving any advantage. </para>

Honorable members of the Opposition were considerably surprised to find that the then Acting Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> who up to that time had conducted all the business connected with the Department of Trade and Customs, did not table the resolution dealing with the export duty on sheepskins. </para>

                            <para>- The then Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> tabled it, but did so in his capacity of Acting Prime Minister. Although nothing was said, it was plain to honorable members on this side that, even within the Cabinet itself, there was not unity in regard to the matter. The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs may not have actually refused to table the resolution, but he certainly declined to do so as he himself was not in agreement with it. </para>

                    <para>There  -i3  only one point that I wish to make. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> know that when the question, " That progress be reported," Ls put from the Chair, ninety-nine times out of one hundred it is agreed to on the voices, being regarded as a purely formal motion. Why did the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> who was Acting Leader of the Opposition at the time, and those who were associated with him, call for a division? It was because that was the only way in which we could object to the tabling of the resolution, and demonstrate that as a party we were opposed to it. The honorable member for Corangamite has said that, despite his participation in the division, he was not present when the resolution was tabled. Was he one of the sheep from whom these skins were taken? Did he march into the chamber and record his vote without knowing what the division was about? He cannot run away from his responsibilities in that manner. The position is clear - the division was in the nature of a protest by honorable members of the Opposition against the tabling of the resolution, and the division list proves conclusively that the honorable member for Corangamite  was not prepared to vote with us, and thus insist upon the matter being then and there discussed, so that members of the committee would have an opportunity of expressing an opinion upon it. There can be no discussion. Once the Minister in charge moves that progress be reported, the question has to be put without discussion or dissent. The honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch)</inline> voted for it, which was tantamount to saying that he was satisfied with what the Ministry had done. Had he not been satisfied, he would have voted against progress being reported, and insisted that an opportunity be given to discuss the matter about which he is now so righteously indignant. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise, not for the purpose of adding anything to the discussion, which I hope is now concluded, but to call attention to a matter arising out of two questions which were asked during question time this afternoon. "With ali respect to the"5 members concerned, and to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I take exception to the practice of  introducing propaganda into questions asked in the House. Every member of the House is a propagandist at some time . or other, but not, I hope, in an undesirable sense. Honorable members opposite" may disclaim that assertion if they think iii, but the propaganda indulged in on this side of the House is, I can assure honorable members, entirely desirable. 1 do not wish to embark upon a party discussion - all honorable members are interested in this - but merely to point out that this afternoon the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> read a statement, by a clergyman dealing with the subject of banking. He then asked whether the Government proposed to introduce legislation to amend our present banking system in a certain direction. He could have asked that question without quoting the clergyman's statement, which had nothing to do with the question. The honorable member simply seized an opportunity for propaganda, for which there is a proper place' and time, but it is not question time. If this practice grows, it will become very difficult to conduct the business of the House. The honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch)</inline> this afternoon asked about the possibility of re funding certain money paid in duties on petrol, and he indicated that, in regard to the duty on sheepskins, such a refund was made. He went on to inquire whether that procedure, or something approaching it, could not be followed in regard te&gt; petrol. That was the substance of his question, but into it he introduced a statement that the duty on sheepskins was imposed at a time when the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> was a member of the Government. We all know that that was so- </para>

                            <para>- No, it was incorporated in the question. That sort of thing should be discouraged in the interests of all of us. Whether the honorable member for Wilmot was, or was not, in the Cabinet when the duty on sheepskins was introduced, is not relevant to the desirability or otherwise of refunding the duty paid on sheepskins or on petrol. The statement was introduced simply to score a point on a propagandist matter. I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> to consider - I do not ask that you make a statement to-day - whether it is not possible, in the interests of all honorable members of this House, to exclude obvious propaganda from questions, and to require honorable members to address themselves to Ministers only for the purpose of obtaining bona fide information. </para>

                        <para>.- There seems to be some misapprehension as to whether or not the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> ever made a suggestion that a coalition government should be formed. As a matter of fact, he did not.  His  suggestion was that if he and his party could in any way co-operate with the Government, of which I was at the time acting head, he would be prepared to do it. He made it clear that he had no desire to take office, but merely to co-operate with the Government. Naturally, I was called upon to reply to his suggestion, and I did so in very brief terms. I made my decision without, any consultation with Cabinet, knowing, as I did, the feeling of the party. I mentioned it the next day at the party meeting, and the matter was smiled out - I shall not say laughed out. On my own initiative I made a fuller statement next day. </para>

I took it on myself,  as  Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Customs, to lay on the table the motion imposing a duty on sheepskins, and I did it when the then Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> was absent in Tasmania. He was not at the Cabinet meeting at which the matter was decided ; he was not at the party meeting ; he was not even in the House. I wish to make that point clear. Those who look up the records will find that they bear me out. I have no desire to wash dirty linen, and I hope that we shall always fight cleanly, both inside the House and out. I do not want to accuse the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch)</inline> of being unduly nervous or excitable, but on several occasions lately he has seemed to be very anxious for a fight, and those who go around looking for fight, are bound to get something in return. </para>

                        <para>. - The subject raised by the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan-)</inline> is a very important one. I think all honorable members in this House have received copies of the letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Clark. In that letter <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clark</inline> refers to the increase in freights on wool since Lord Inchcape came into shipping. That is going back a good many years. I do not know of any increase in freight during recent years. As a matter of fact, shortly after this Government came into office, a proposal was made to increase outward freights by 10 per cent. We have no power, as a Parliament, to control freights - although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clark</inline> says that only Parliament can deal with the matter - but, nevertheless, the Government did take a stand and made representations to see what could be done to prevent a rise in freights. Prior to the accession to office of this Government, delegations representing overseas shipping companies met representatives of shippers in Australia and discussed with them the proposed increase in freights, which, they contended, was inevitable unless something could be done to regulate shipping in Australia to prevent the overlapping that was taking place, and to regulate space by means of an organization of shippers and ship-owners. When a decision was reached that there should be no increase in freights, if that could be done. an unexpected difficulty arose in connexion with certain legislation tha: had been passed for the control of monopolies. Accordingly, they approached the Government with a request to amend the legislation in question before they formed an association for the regulation of shipping. That amending legislation was passed, and that is the only power which we have in connexion with this matter. </para>

                            <para>- So far as I know there has been no increase of freights since then. The writer of this letter refers to the Overseas Transport Association, of which he is a member, representing the wool-growers. Mr: Tout is  chairman  of this organization, which is representative of overseas ship-owners, Australian wool-growers, the butter and fruit industries, and other sections of exporters. The writer states that the association is operating under the Federal Government. That is not correct. It is an organization entirely of shippers and ship-owners. The only action which the Federal Parliament took was to amend  its  legislation so as to enable the organization to operate, and I believe that it is doing good work. As we all know, wool freights have always been abnormally high as compared with freights on other exportable primary products from Australia. They have been higher because, in the overseas market, wool has always commanded a higher price than other primary products. Now that wool prices are down, these high shipping charges are a real hardship upon the industry. I have taken up this matter with the Transport Association, which is keeping me informed of every move or proposed move. At one of the conferences which I have had with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tout,</inline> it was pointed out that there was no guarantee in the agreement for the regulation of freights, and, on behalf of the Government, I refused to introduce the amending legislation unless that was provided for. After a good deal of negotiation it was included. I said that, as we had taken the responsibility of amending the legislation, if it would not prevent a rise in freights, we should have to consider what action could be taken. This question has been raised on more than one occasion by several honorable members, including, I think, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> and the Minister for Markets <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> is giving it his attention. I now have an acknowledgment of my letter to the association, informing me that it is considering the position with a view to avoiding an increase in freights. I think that this is rather an important accomplishment, because we have to realize that a decline in the volume of shipping means an increase in the handling charges, so that freight increases are difficult to avoid. I agree that probably some re-adjustment of freights should be made by ship-owners in view of the low prices now prevailing for wool. It is obvious that if wool prices are low, the industry cannot carry the burden of high freight charges. I think the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> has done good service in raising the matter this afternoon. </para>

                        <para>- The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> has referred to the practice which has grown up of basing questions upon newspaper paragraphs and which he suggests may be equivalent <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> political propaganda. He said that he did not desire from me a statement  on  the matter to-day, but I feel that I should at once offer a few observations in  regard  to it. For some time questions  based  upon newspaper reports have occupied  a  good deal of the time during which questions to Ministers are asked, and it has been quite apparent that the majority of those questions were asked, not with the object of eliciting information as required by the Standing Order, but with the deliberate purpose of giving it. The Chair has sought to check this practice. If honorable members were deterred altogether from basing questions upon newspaper reports it might be regarded as an undue curtailment of their privileges and rights. However desirable it might be to restrict the practice, I am reluctant to give a decision that might be so construed. I am desirous of giving to honorable members the widest possible freedom, but I do feel at times that many of the newspaper statements quoted when asking questions should not be used. In some cases the press paragraphs, upon which questions are based, are inordinately long. The reading of them occupies considerable time, and they certainly are more in the nature of statements or speeches than of questions. I promise the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> that I shall go carefully into the matter, and if I decide that there should be any curtailment honorable members will be given the reasons for that decision. </para>
