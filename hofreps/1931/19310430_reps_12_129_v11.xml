                        <para>- I have seen those labels. It is true that the Australian manufacturers of hosiery enjoy very high protection, the duties ranging up to 30s. a dozen pairs, or 50 per cent. ad valorem against the United Kingdom, and 50s. a dozen pairs, or 65 per cent. ad valorem against other countries. Owing to constitutional limitations, the Commonwealth has no power to compel the manufacturers to use labels printed in Australia, but it is almost incredible that firms which are receiving such high protection should do an injustice to Australian printers by obtaining their labels from abroad. </para>

                            <para>- I have received  a  complaint from a garage proprietor that he is being victimized because he is selling petrol other than the brands controlled by the major oil companies, known as The Big Five, namely, Shell, Plume, Texaco, Commonwealth Oil Refineries, and Union. Because this person is independent, and sells all brands of petrol, he is charged1s.11d. a gallon for the five brands I have mentioned, whereas other garages are charged only1s.10d. Will the Prime Minister take action against the companies which are imposing this penalty contrary to proper and correct business principles? </para>

                        <para>- A paragraph relating to the Anglo-Australian air mail service appeared in one of the newspapers yesterday, stating that it was understood that discussions were being carried on with the Prime Minister, " although he earlier indicated that the state of Australia's finances prevented the contribution of approximately £100,000 a year." Is the Government still considering the granting of a subsidy to this service, and, before such subsidy is granted, will the Prime Minister give the House an opportunity to discuss the matter? </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the honorable member refers to Imperial Airways Limited. I had discussions with representatives of the company when I was in London, and the Government has had correspondence with it since my return. I have also received deputations from the Dutch Air Mail Company. Both companies have submitted proposals to the Government; but I have given very little encouragement to either of them to believe that the Government will be in a position for some time to subsidize any such service. </para>

                </talk.start>
                <quote>
                    <para>Although he was in favour of every possible effort to reduce the debt, he held Gladstone's view that in times of national depression and unemployment, it was better to use resources to stimulate trade than to make new sacrifices. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I think that Gladstone's views are most applicable to the depression through which Australia is now passing. Of course, the economic difficulties which obtain to-day are world wide, and are, I suggest, due to a large extent to the drop in commodity prices, and particularly those of Australia's staple products. The difficulty has been greatly accentuated by the cornering of gold that has occurred both in America and France. The United States of America now possesses 42 per cent. of the monetary gold of the world. She has twice as much asFrance, and seven times the reserve held by the Bank of England. Conditions to-day indicate that the accumulation of gold in a few countries has had a very serious effect on world trade and commerce. Of course, it is well known that the war was responsible, to a great extent, for the flow of gold to America. The United States of America standing out of the war as long as she did, had the time of her life supplying the needs of the Allies: importations into America almost ceased, while exports grew enormously. The trade balance between the United States of America and the allied countries was adjusted, partly by the return of United States securities, partly by huge shipments of gold, and, finally, by the good old method of writing I.O.U's. All this has tended to develop a sort of clot in the veins of world commerce, and if we continue to cling slavishly to the gold standard, a major operation very shortly will be required to cure  out  economic disorder. Our own currency system is dependent upon the more or less mythical gold standard, and, unless the system is altered, it is obvious that we must have more gold in order to create more currency. Because of the practical sympathy extended to mining and mining prospectors by the State of Victoria, that State has, in the last twelve months, doubled its output of gold. The Commonwealth Government also appears  to  realize the need for more gold, both as a backing for our currency and for export purposes, but, so far, its interest has been centered in any and every part of the Commonwealth except that part which is directly under its own jurisdiction. There is no gainsaying the fact that the Commonwealth is urgently in need of more gold, and that the State governments  are  anxious to assist gold production in every way possible. The State governments are prepared to assist those who have invested capital in mining ventures, and also those who have the enterprise and courage to go in search of new gold. The Commonwealth Government recently introduced, and carried through Parliament, legislation authorizing it to pay a gold bounty, thus demonstrating its recognition of the fact that an increased gold supply is urgently necessary. The gold-mining industry in Australia assisted to a greater degree to populate and develop Australia than did any other industry, not excepting even the great pastoral industry. Nothing I know of would more quickly dispel the gloom which is at present hanging over our industrial and social life than would a revival of gold -mining in Australia. No other industry holds out such hope for the adventurous, or is more calculated to promote that pioneering spirit among our citizens which is so sorely needed to-day. No other industry has such an important reaction. Wo other industry can so quickly respond to stimulus. We all know what an important part gold played in the restoration of prosperity in the 'nineties. Not only did the discovery of fresh goldfields at that time add greatly to our national wealth, but it also had the psychological effect of restoring the self-reliance and independence of spirit which we have come to regard as an Australian characteristic. No more self-reliant men were ever bred in any part of the world than those who found and exploited our Australian gold-fields. They were full of initiative and enterprise. Given sympathetic treatment this class of men, which is still strongly represented in the country, will do more than any other to restore national prosperity. </para>
                <para>During the decade from 1880 to 1890 the production of gold in Australia amounted to £49,216,000. From 1891 to 1900, after the discovery and development of those" great fields in Western Australia, the total amount of gold won was £89,990,000, while during the next ten years, from 1900 to 1910, the gold won reached the amazing total of £142,090,109 ; or 48 per cent, more than the amount obtained during the golden 'fifties, when Ballarat, Bendigo and other fields were yielding their maximum. To-day, the total production of gold in the Commonwealth has fallen to about £1,700,000 a year. 1 could go on. to demonstrate the importance of the gold-mining industry,- but I think that all honorable members are well aware of the wonderful part it has played in the development of Australia's nationhood. What gold-mining has done in the past it can do in the future, if those engaged in it are given sympathetic encouragement. The other day I read that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gepp,</inline> and the Director of Geological Surveys of "Victoria, after an examination of the Bendigo gold-field, recommended that an expenditure of £50,000 be made on exploration work there. I presume that the Commonwealth will be expected to find the money. While not desiring to discourage the further development of old fields, I feel impelled to direct the attention, not only of the Government, but, of all honorable members of this </para>
                <para class="block">House, to the fact that we have in northern and central Australia great auriferous reefs which were discovered years ago, but which have since remained unworked. As gold plays such an important part in the economic life of the nation why, I ask, has not this or, indeed, any government done something to develop those great gold-bearing areas. The apathy of the Government in neglecting to exploit the potentialities of that great country, which is approximately six times larger than Victoria, is deserving of severe condemnation. Prospectors have operated in that region under conditions undreamed of in the southern States, but after they locate proved fields it is impossible to persuade the Commonwealth to send a metallurgist of standing to report upon the find. Yet it is claimed that the great need of Australia is additional gold. There are many fields in the Northern Territory which have been proved for the past fifteen years, yethave remained unexploited because of the indifference of the Government. The territory is at least entitled to have its discovered fields reported upon by experts. I know of lodes 28 feet wide, proved to a depth of 100 feet, from which samples assayed by the Government have disclosed 15 dwt. of free gold to the ton. I know, too, of huge auriferous belts in Central Australia where new discoveries of great value have been made. Yet we cannot get any assistance from the Government. It is the duty of the Government to stand behind the efforts of our pioneers who, because of their courage and tenacity, have made these discoveries. Only a few days ago the remains of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 
Lasseter.</inline> of the Central Australia Gold Exploration Syndicate, were found in one of the localities to which I refer.  His  pioneering efforts are representative of those of many others. Why does not the Commonwealth detail the expert who reported on Bendigo, the Commonwealth Geologist, or even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Horsburgh,</inline> the  chairman  of the North Australia Commission, to investigate these fields? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Horsburgh</inline> is admittedly an authority on mining, and is at present wilting under the ennui of inactivity. It is the right of the people of the Territory to expect the Government to take the action that J advocate. </para>
                <para>Apparently this and previous Commonwealth Governments fear that the statements that I have made in this chamber for the past ten years will be substantiated if an expert is sent to investigate them. It is unbelievable that a government in any other part of the world would neglect to test potential wealth such as that which exists in abundance in North Australia. </para>

                    <para>The Davenport Ranges north-east of Barrow Creek contains numerous gold-bearing reefs and veins of a payable nature. Numbers of these reefs and veins have been tested by prospectorsunder very adverse conditions. The erection of a battery at Whistle Duck Waterhole, situated between Kurrundi and Karranalli, would be in a most central position for treating stone from various reefs within a radius of 50 miles. This would give employment to a large number of men, who are at present idle, as most of these reefs are payable propositions with crushing facilities handy. The present holder of "Dempsey's Choice" lease can guarantee 10,000 tons of stone for immediate treatment. At present there is no encouragement to prospectors to give much attention to this district as he must locate a very rich reef to do any good. I am sure that an inspection of this district by a government expert would result in approval of this suggestion. I have written to the Minister for Home and Territories on this subject, and be very pleased if you would do what you can in this matter, </para>

                        <para>- He certainly is, of a type unknown in the south. That letter does not savour of get-rich-quick methods. It is a plain, unvarnished, statement of facts, and embodies an appeal to the Government to assist in developing that field. The Government has a battery in the vicinity of Alice Springs which is at present idle. In view of the possibility of this discovery absorbing a great number of unemployed, and of the slight expense that would be involved, the Government should transfer that battery to the new field. No other territory in Australia holds such possibilities as Central Australia, so far as the recovery of gold is concerned. I know of a dozen localities in the Territory quite as good as those to which I have referred. If they were in any other part of Australia they would be immediately exploited. Because of the isolated position of the Northern Territory it is very difficult to attract capital there. I noticed in the press that an exhibition was recently held in London which included a display of the various metals to be found in Australia. I was unaware that it was contemplated, and I was aghast when I read that the representative exhibits from Central Australia and the Northern Territory were a few pieces of copper ore and a little mica. The Territory contains tantalite, platinum and every other known mineral in abundance. If the Government is serious in its endeavour to populate the Territory and to encourage investors to spend their money there, a golden opportunity presents itself to stage a truly representative exhibition of the potentialities of the north. </para>

                        <para>- I am talking about the Northern Territory, not Mount Morgan. But let me remind the honorable member of what happened at the Wiluna mine in Western Australia. When the manager of the Wiluna Gold Mining Company, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Bernales, urged the Government to grant a bounty on the production of gold he said that wages would not be reduced by the company. In spite of the efforts that have been made by honorable members opposite to bring about a general reduction of wages, this company has refused to reduce the wages of any of the employees. It has made up its mind that the company must pay a decentwage. </para>

                <para>The letter to which I have referred is similar to a number of others that I have received. It reflects a genuine desire on the part of the miners to develop the mineral resources of the country. Mining has move than once been the means of extricating the country from a morass of financial difficulty, and it may well do so on this occasion. </para>
                <para class="block">At Marranboy we have one of the most valuable tin areas in Australia. The honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> need not interject about wages in this connexion, for all the miners working there are working for themselves. This is a "gougers"' field. The men do not want the dole - they want work. They made a reasonable proposition to the Government that it should pay them a fair price for the tin they produce, and store it until the world price of tin recovers somewhat. We know that all the great tin-producing countries of the world have made an agreement to limit the production of tin. Australia does not produce much tin, and is not a party to that agreement. The Government could, therefore, accede to the request of the Marranboy tin-miners. One of the partners of the late Honorable H. E. Pratten, who is well informed in regard to the tin-mining industry, has said, " There is no doubt that the price of tin will reach £150 per ton in the very near future ". The Government could store the tin until that time arrives. Tin does not deteriorate with storage. Unless something of this kind is done these men will have to accept the dole. I do not think one honorable member of the House will disagree with me when I say that the dole system is utterly degrading. It insidiously robs men of their manhood. If we persist with this system for very long we shall bring into being in Australia an army of men who have no incentive whatever to work. In view of the fact that these tin-miners are anxious to work I urge the Minister for Home Affairs to reconsider his decision in this regard. </para>

                <para>An obligation rests upon this Parliament to develop North and Central Australia, and it cannot excuse its inaction by saying that the States are responsible. I do not think any honorable member can accuse me of making party political speeches in this Parliament. Every address that I have delivered here has contained a plea for the development of the huge area that I represent. I am beginning to think that North and Central Australia are being neglected, because there is no political significance attached to them. That probably explains the apathy shown to the welfare of my constituents. It appears to me that many things are done in this Parliament for purely party political purposes. That is the only justification for the establishment of certain industries in Australia. </para>
                <para>I am firmly convinced that if the Government would do something effective to develop the mineral resources of North and Central Australia, it would inaugurate a new era of prosperity for the whole nation. The adoption of this policy would relieve unemployment and stimulate many secondary industries. Real wealth could be produced from the mineral fields of the far north. In certain industries, it is necessary to export  our surplus production, and sell it at a dead loss. There would be no loss incurred in the export of our minerals. </para>
                <para>I have no desire to embarrass the Government. My sole object in speaking this afternoon is to promote the interests of the territory which I represent. I am also actuated by a desire to help Australia in its hour of need. It is true that I have not had a great deal to say in this House, but I refuse to sit quietly in this chamber while a tragedy is being committed. We want real wealth - international wealth - and we have it in the Northern Territory. We have wealth, without political significance. Had we political significance probably we should be able to develop our wealth. How long are we to continue to pamper problematical industries and neglect real industries? It appears to me that so long as the representative of the people of the Northern Territory is prepared to remain quiet in this House so long will this condition of apathy continue. The political parties in this chamber, if they were sincere in trying to assist Australia in its crisis, would immediately focus their attention on the North of Australia and there open up new avenues of employment so as to absorb some of the great army of unemployed that is to-day stalking the land. How much better it would be for Australia if we were to transfer men from the street corners of tie capital cities into the great outback where wealth having an international value could be won; where men would be able to be men and to make good, and in the process assist to make Australia  greater </para>

                <para class="block">If governments are to function, and if their business is to be carried out satisfactorily, it is essential that cabinet secrets should remain inviolate. That this principle is recognized, and has been ever recognized, is shown by the fact that rarely do cabinet secrets leak out. I have been a member of this House since 1917, and in the fourteen years of my membership I know of only three instances in which cabinet secrets have been made public. The first instance occurred in 1917, and for the sake of brevity I shall refer to it as the " Ready " case. The second instance occurred in 1929, and the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker)</inline> referred to it briefly the other night. That was the occasion on which a memorandum that had been written by the then Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> for the perusal of the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> became public. It appeared in one of the Sydney newspapers, and was quoted by the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> in the House. I shall have more to say on that case later. The third instance occurred recently. It relates to the publication of cables that passed between the Prime Minister and the then Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> and the then Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons).</inline> As soon as it became known that these secret cables had been made public, the Government acted promptly and properly in an endeavour to find out where the leakage had occurred. Had it not done so each member of the Cabinet would have been recreant to his trust. It was the duty, particularly of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, to endeavour to ascertain who was responsible for that leakage. But the whole Cabinet vessel was leaking. The general public knew of the contents of those cables long before the 15th March, the date on which they were published in the daily press. Scarcely a day passed without particular references being made to them in the  newspapers. I have not collected all those references, but I have with me a few that were published throughout Australia. The <inline font-style="italic">Sun News Pictorial</inline> gave, on the 5th November, details of the Gibbons inflation resolution, which was carried by the previous day's caucus, and added these words - </para>

There is no authority for ruling that the word " victimization " is unparliamentary. It is used again and again in the course of debate, particularly by honorable members supporting the Government, and if your action is open to criticism an honorable member may properly allege " victimization " if it expresses his opinion. I submit that your action is not beyond or above criticism in any respect. </para>

Otherwise any criticism could be required to be withdrawn on the mere statement of a member that he regarded it as offensive to him. A Minister is in the same position in that regard as any private member. </para>

On that precedent alone, I feel confident that you are entitled to rule in the same way now, but I submit also that the words " deliberate victimization " as applied to the Government and inferentially to me as the Minister most directly concerned, amount to a charge that I have deliberately and vindictively done an injustice to an individual. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw the statement to which the Attorney-General has taken exception. The Government has singled out <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander</inline> from a number of journalists, each of whom had acted in the same way. Why should he be punished and his fellow pressmen be allowed to go scot-free ? I said earlier that on three occasions cabinet secrets have been published. The first occasion was the Ready incident which occurred in 1917. Certain Labour members of this House were responsible for the publication of confidential cables and memoranda. They appeared first in the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Gall</inline> and later in the <inline font-style="italic">Worker.</inline> At a still later date they were reprinted from those journals in pamphlet form and sent from one end of Australia to the other for the purpose of discrediting the Hughes Government and the Nationalist party. Members of the Labour party, who are members of the present Mi nistry, did not scruple to use cabinet secrets for their own ends. To-day they denounce a journalist who did the same thing in the performance of his duty. Any journalist who received the cablegrams honestly as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander</inline> did was justified in using them. I accept his word that he did obtain them honestly. </para>

                        <para>- He is possibly on the Government side of the House. The Government, in its pursuit of the culprit, has either failed to locate him, or, having located him, is not desirous of taking the action that the occasion demands. To evade doing that, it has descended to a process of victimization which I think is altogether discreditable to the Government itself, and to every member who supports it. The pressman who has been denied the rights and privileges of his profession in this House was doing what his employers expected of him, and what was considered thoroughly legitimate from the point of view of modern journalism. </para>

I can conceive of nothing more repugnant to the best principles of British justice than the attitude taken by the House towards this journalist. If there is one principle of British justice that we should treasure, above any other, it is, perhaps that which gives to every accused man the benefit of a doubt. When this case was. previously before the House, an even vote was recorded. The House could not come to a decision on the issue. There was clearly a most important doubt, and the House took upon itself the responsibility of refusing to this man the benefit of the doubt. He was denied the rights and privileges of his calling as a journalist, on the casting vote of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline></para>

                <para>During recent years, a number of cases have been recorded of the disclosure of cabinet secrets, and the mover of the motion has referred to a few of them. I should like to explore that aspect of the matter a little further. During the postwar years, and outside Australia rather than within it, there have been some rather remarkable cases of the disclosure of Cabinet secrets; but I know of no instance in which any parliament of the British Empire, or of any other country, has proceeded to the extreme measure of excluding from the precincts of the House a practising journalist in the gallery who made use of them. Going back further into history, the only serious cases that I can find have been dealt with by committing the offenders to the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms. If this case presented the serious aspect that honorable members opposite insist that it did, it was the duty of the House to have the offending journalist arraigned at the bar of the House, where we could have heard from him what we have been denied the right of hearing; but no such action was taken. No charge was made against this man, no case was proved, but this extreme course was taken. Punishment was inflicted without giving him the right to which he was entitled, including, first of all, the right to come to the bar of the House and state his case, giving honorable members an opportunity of judging from his own demeanour, and from his own defence, what penalty, if any, should be imposed. </para>
                <para>I have one more case to which I propose briefly to refer in support of the attitude assumed by me and the honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bayley).</inline> Some time ago there was a leakage of a very important Cabinet secret in the Queensland Parliament, and some high officers must have been involved. The secret was published in the press, and it stands to the credit of the Queensland Parliament that no action was t'aken comparable with that decided upon by this House against the journalist whose case is now under discussion. Because the precise culprit could not be found, the government of the day refused to allow itself to be associated with any action comparable with that taken by this Parliament. That Government was too conscious of its responsibility to penalize the pressman who had profited by the secret information. It is utterly unthinkable that this. House should be allowed to escape the condemnation due to it for its act of victimization of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander.</inline> The culprit, I suggest, is in the Public Service, or else he is in the ranks of honorable gentlemen opposite. If he has been located he ought to be punished. If he cannot be located, then the matter should have ended there. Vengeance should not have been displayed against a pressman who was following his avocation in a legitimate way. It has not escaped my notice that the victimization of this pressman involves the Government in no electoral odium, but the punishment of the public servant, or the supporter of the Government who may have been the real offender would have deliberately involved the Government in some electoral odium. Rather than risk that, the Government has selected this journalist, among others who were equally culpable, for its vengeance. The whole action of the Government in this matter is thoroughly reprehensible, and I hope the House will have an opportunity of reviewing the position  and placing itself in proper perspective with the people. </para>
                <para>It is a recognized parliamentary custom that, when the House is equally divided, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> should cast his vote in such a way as would leave the question' as it was before the vote was taken. That has long been the practice in British parliaments; but that procedure was departed from in  the case under discussion, and in that respect the House heaped contumely upon itself. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> used his casting vote to remove <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander</inline> from the House, and that denied this journalist the privileges of his calling. In justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander</inline> and ourselves, we should not leave the matter where it now standsIn departing from the custom, the House has stultified itself - and I regret that I am associated with a body that has carried this matter to such a stage-- </para>

What the honorable member has said may contain argument for voting against the amendment, but the contention that the amendment before the House does not accurately state facts, cannot be accepted as a reason why the amendment should be ruled out of order. If that were the case the  Speaker  would be placed in an impossible position. Honorable members would challenge motions on the ground that they were inaccurate in statement, and misrepresented the facts. </para>

Certainly its text does concern a matter which was determined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and which, up to this moment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has the exclusive right to determine. There is in the amendment nothing but what trespasses upon the decision that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has already come to and announced to the House. That being so, the amendment cannot be regarded as being properly *the business of this House. It concerns a matter which is the exclusive prerogative of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and I accordingly rule it out of order. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to a point of order. It is customary for the  Speaker  to call honorable members alternately from one side of the House and the other. Until the Leader of the Opposition moves his proposed amendment, you will not be in a position to know whether it has to do with the matter upon which you have already, given a ruling. It seems evident, however, that it is not his  intention to dissent from your ruling. Already in this debate two honorable members from the Opposition side of the House have been called in succession. I suggest that a member from the Government side of the House should now be called before a third member of the Opposition is heard. </para>

                        <para>- At all times it is the right of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to call any member desiring to speak, who, he believes, ought to be heard at any particular time during the progress of a debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is under no obligation to call any particular member - the matter is entirely within his discretion. But, so far as possible, he calls members in such order as he thinks will meet with the wishes of the House, and it has been customary, in order to allow all opinions to be expressed as fully as possible, to call speakers, first from one side of the House,, and then from the other. Further, it has been the practice to give priority to Ministers of the Crown, and, after them, to the Leader of the Opposition. If the Leader of the Opposition rises at the same time as another member, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> according to the ancient practice and usage of Parliament, feels that in courtesy he should see him first. That custom, I feel, justified me in calling upon the Leader of the Opposition just now. </para>

                        <para>- I trust that I have never abused the privileges which are generally recognized as belonging to Ministers of the Crown, and to the Leader of the Opposition. I rise now because I feel that what I have to say relates in a general way to the subject under discussion, but I do not desire to be associated in any way with a reflection on the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> It is possible, I suggest, to frame another amendment, which would allow the House to express in general terms its opinion as to the relations which ought to exist between Parliament and press representatives attending sittings of Parliament. Recent events associated with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander's</inline> case may be referred to by way of illustration, but my object in putting this matter forward is to afford the House an opportunity of expressing its opinion on a matter which has become one of some importance. Therefore, I move as an amendment to the motion - </para>

                    <para>That all the words after " That " be omitted with a view to insert in Hen thereof the following: - "this House is of opinion that as a general rule a journalist should not be excluded from the press galleries except in cases of proved misconduct affecting his relation to Parliament." </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That, I suggest, would be a safe general rule. There may be exceptions to its application. For example, an obvious exception would apply if the press galleries were so crowded that it was physically impossible for them to accommodate any one else. There might be other exceptions also. As a general rule, however, it would be proper for the House to lay it down that a journalist ought not to be excluded from the press galleries unless he were, in the first place, proved guilty of misconduct, and, in the second place, that misconduct affected his relation to Parliament. This House ought not, as a general rule, to inquire into, say, the private lives or characters of press representatives, any more than it ought to inquire into the private lives or characters of members of Parliament. That is why I suggest that exclusion should take place only in cases of proved misconduct affecting the relation of the individual to Parliament. This House is entitled to take cognizance of the misconduct of any journalist affecting his relation to the House. That must be regarded as one of the rights and privileges of the House, and should be maintained in order to govern properly the relations of the press to Parliament. Moreover, action should be taken only in cases of proved misconduct. There should be no doubt about the matter. There should be a clear case, and where the misconduct alleged is of a nature which, if proved, would constitute an offence against the laws of the country, the proper course would be to institute a prosecution. Where, however, no such offence has been committed, where it is not suggested that there has been an offence against the law, and where no such case has been proved, there should be no action in the way of denying a journalist the opportunity of reporting parliamentary debate - an occupation for which he requires special qualifications, knowledge, and experience. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may suggest some other rule. I contend that there is no ambiguity in it. There may be difficulty in applying it, because opinions may differ as to what is misconduct; as to whether particular misconduct is proved, and as to whether misconduct, if proved, affects the relations of journalists to Parliament. Those are all questions of fact, and do not show that there is any ambiguity in the line of argument that I have taken. </para>

Honorable members will observe that I have been drawn into a discussion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander's</inline> case by .honorable members opposite. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> gave a ruling on a standing order, and there was a discussion as to whether a particular function should be exercised by the House or by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> The consequent division resulted in an even vote, and on the casting vote of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> it -was determined that the function should be exercised by you, sir. Therefore, there was a decision by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> that this particular journalist should be excluded from the press gallery, the public offices, and the precincts of the House. That was not challenged. The Standing Orders provide a means whereby it may be challenged, but until that means is availed of, or the decision withdrawn by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> it stands. The carrying of this amendment would not be a dissent from the decision made by you, sir, within the meaning of the Standing Orders. </para>

The honorable gentleman further seeks to evade your ruling of a few minutes ago, that the amendment of the honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bayley)</inline> was out of order. When the proposed amendment is analysed it is seen that it differs from that of the honorable member for Oxley only because of the insertion of the words " as a general rule ". As to the words " except in cases of proved misconduct affecting his relation to Parliament ", I assume that the motion that you previously decided to be out of order related to a case that was " proved " to your satisfaction, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> The use of the word "proved" does not carry us any further.

                        <para>- Absolutely the same effect. There is only one proper way to upset your ruling, sir, and that is by an amendment of the Standing Orders. That cannot be done by an amendment to the question " That the  Speaker  do now leave the chair ". This is an attempt to establish what can be established only by a standing order, to upset your decision of the 23rd April and the decision of the House of the following day. If carried, the amendment will be ineffective, because the Standing Orders will have to be altered before those decisions can be upset. It, therefore, seems to me to be an abortive amendment, and an endeavour to re-introduce a question that was ruled by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> to be out of order. </para>

                        <para>- It should not be necessary for me to add anything on the point which has been so ably taken by the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch).</inline> If you, sir, are satisfied on that point, I shall not pursue the matter further. I submit that it is perfectly obvious that if this amendment is carried it will amount to a declaration that what you decided in your capacity as  Speaker  on the 23rd April was wrongly decided. Your declaration at that time, which I think was a perfectly sound one, was that you were guided and bound by the Standing Order, which is explicit in its terms, and lays it down that with you rests the prerogative of determining who, apart from honorable members, shall have accommodation in this House; and that pursuant to the terms of that standing order <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> may at any time order any person to leave the precincts of the House. That being so, there is no effective way to deal with the question other than by an amendment of the standing order. A declaration of the House along the lines indicated by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> would, therefore, be a nullity. It would not have any binding or decisive effect so far as the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander</inline> is concerned, and it would not bind you, sir, in regard to any other person. I submit with great confidence that the point taken by the honorable member for Corangamite is unanswerably strong. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether the honorable members who have spoken to the point of order are entirelyserious ; it is very difficult to believe that they are. It was extraordinary to hear the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> say that the amendment is out of order because, if carried, it would be a nullity. I ask honorable members to look at the business-sheet, and to select, say, the motion in the name of the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> concerning the initiative, referendum, and recall. If thatmotion were carried, it would have no legal effect; there would be merely an expression of opinion of the House. The same observation could be made with regard to every other motion on the business-paper. Not one would of itself produce any legal effect; it would not alter the law or the Standing Orders.We have carried motions - when the Government has been kind enough to allow time for their discussion - recommending the most far-reaching changes regarding all sorts of matters. Nevertheless such motions are in order. The point that because the carrying of a motion does not produce a legal effect, in amending a standing order, or a law, it is out of order, can scarcely be taken seriously. </para>

                <para class="block">Corangamite said that an amendment of the standing order could be effected to achieve my purpose. It obviously does not matter whether that is so or not. So far as one can disentangle the different points raised, it is suggested that the amendment would overrule the decision given by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> on the 23rd April. Many decisions have been given by different Speakers in the history of this Parliament, and it is amazing that it should be suggested that an amendment in general terms overrides a Speaker's ruling of last week, last year, or any other year. As I made plain in my reply to the interjection of the honorable member forFremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cur tin),</inline> the carrying of this amendment does not upset any decision of the Speaker; it leaves such a decision where it is. The Attorney-General contends that it suggests that a recent decision by you, sir, was wrongly given. By no means does it do so. This amendment does not refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander's</inline> case. It is perfectly consistent with the fact that you, sir, were satisfied that in the case of that individual there was misconduct. I presume that you would not have acted as you did unless you believed that there was misconduct, and that it was proved, and that that action had some relation to Parliament. You, sir, must have concluded that there was substantial evidence to support your decision. There is, therefore, nothing inconsistent between this amendment and any ruling given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> On these grounds I submit that the point of order raised by the honorable member for Corangamite has not been sustained by either of the honorable members who have spoken in support of it. </para>

                    <para>- That is not a point of order. On the point of order raised by the honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crouch)</inline> and discussed by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition, there are three ways in which honorable members may take objection in regard to the conduct of business of which the  Speaker  has executive control. The first is by the Standing Orders ; the second is by disagreement with the ruling of the presiding officer, from which ruling the House can dissent if it is not satisfactory to honorable members; and the third is by a substantive motion. Those are the only methods by which the motion in question may be raised by an honorable member. Because I am of the opinion that the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition infringes the authority vested in me under the Standing Orders, and is not in accord with the usages of Parliament, I rule that it is out of order. </para>

                <para>Mr.RIORDAN (Kennedy) [4.37].- I regret that our time has been occupied for so long to-day in discussing a matter that bad previously been discussed for practically two days. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> has directed attention to the advisableness of encouraging gold-mining, with the object of relieving the prevailing depression. On numerous occasions when Australia has been passing through a time of stress like the present the mining industry has come to her assistance. Our troubles have been alleviated not by mining experts or economists, but by prospectors. The mining industry first attracted the attention of the world to Australia. Subsequently, during the period of the bank crashes in the 'nineties, the discovery of gold again resulted in the rehabilitation of the country. It cannot be argued that the mining resources of Australia have been fully exploited. In many parts of this continent valuable deposits of ore are known to exist. This is true not only of the Northern Territory, but also of Queensland. </para>
                <para>An honorable member made an interjection some little while ago about the unemployed in the Northern Territory. He evidently represents a constituency within a few miles of the General Post Office in one of the capital cities. He does not realize that it is impossible for the unemployed in the Northern Territory, or in the northern parts of Queensland, to tramp put into the metalliferous districts without the provision of adequate supplies of food and water. </para>
                <para>What has been done by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gepp,</inline> the gentleman who was unloaded on to the Bruce-Page Government by the Broken Hill mining interests, or by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn,</inline> or by any other experts, to develop the resources of this country? A migration commission set up at the cost of many thousands of pounds, has left us with 200,000 or 300,000 unemployed. It is a serious indictment of the governments of Australia that they allowed thousands of people to come to this country without making proper provision to receive them. Men, women and children are starving to-day, and this could have been prevented. Many of the migrants who came here two or three years ago were the victims of misrepresentation of the worst kind. Only in Queensland were proper arrangements made to settle the newcomers on the land. In that State the Government made land available under the leasehold system. But there was no reason why people should have been settled on land a long distance from our railway lines. Hundreds of thousands of acres of first-class land adjoining our railway lines is to-day held out of production merely for speculative purposes. It should not have been necessary for the </para>
                <para>Government to force people to go to territories like New Guinea or North, and Central Australia. It could have provided them with suitable blocks of land in the coastal areas of Australia and close to the markets. There can be no doubt that the people are land hungry. In Queensland it is a common thing for 1,800 or 2,000 applications to be made for a few blocks of land. </para>
                <para>The British-Australasian Tobacco Company is responsible for the statement that it cannot obtain a sufficient quantity of Australian-grown tobacco leaf to provide the tobacco requirements of Australia. Yet in spite of the fact that huge areas of land near Mareeba are suitable in every way for tobacco culture, we go on importing millions of pounds worth of tobacco every year. That also is true of cotton. </para>
                <para>Let me remind honorable members that the depression through which the country is passing is not due to the mismanagement of this Government, nor to anything that has happened within the last eighteen months. It is due principally to the foolish policy of continual overseas borrowing by past governments and the bringing of people here without making adequate provision for their welfare. To-day many people in Australia are trying to obtain the wherewithal to return to the country from which they came. </para>
                <para>The way out of our difficulties is not to be found by the sending of experts to the Northern Territory, or elsewhere, to make reports on mining or other possibilities of development. Such reports are merely pigeon-holed. I suggest that the Government, through the appropriate department, should make available three months' supply of food and water to prospectors and allow them to go into approved country to prospect for minerals. Under the Gold Bounty Act it is necessary for a gold buyer to be registered if the prospector who is selling the gold wishes to obtain the benefit of the bounty of £1 an ounce. Previously a prospector could go to any station manager or storekeeper and purchase, without restriction, meat, flour, tobacco and other requirements; but to-day unless the station manager or storekeeper is a registered gold buyer the prospector cannot sell his gold, and at the same time obtain the bounty. It would be of some benefit if only £1,000 were spent in assisting prospecting in the territory. If gold were found there Australia would be  placed in immediate possession of what members opposite term real money, and we might have as much gold in our vaults as has the United States of America. There is nothing like the mining industry to provide employment. The Commonwealth Government, some time ago, made a grant to assist in prospecting for gold and precious metals. I understand that Queensland, under that grant, was entitled to £6,000, but up to date only £3,000 has been expended, the remaining £3,000 being unclaimed. I am continually getting letters containing requests for assistance from men who have done nothing but prospecting all their lives. Their work is on the surface. Most mines, such as those at Mount Morgan, Croydon and Charters Towers, become, from the point of view of the working prospector, unprofitable at a certain depth. When a shaft is too deep to permit of the use of a windlass or  whimhorse  and machinery is necessary to further develop it, the mine becomes useless to the prospector. His business is prospecting and locating gold, and he is the person who should be encouraged to search for gold. In some cases a grant of £2 a foot for sinking in deep shafts is made; but only in rare instances has the money been refunded. As lime is used to catch a bird, so the speculator uses this grant to catch the mug investors. The few persons who hold gift shares in the mining companies floated by speculators have nothing to lose, while the investors have everything to lose. In that way the speculators have done a great deal of harm to the gold-mining industry. The amount of £3,000 which remains unclaimed by the Queensland Government should be made available for prospecting in the far north of that State. A geologist bases his report as to the prospect of finding gold in certain areas on the formation of the country. The average prospector has that knowledge. The expert inspects a field, makes his report, and departs. The prospector inspects a field and stays for, say, three months. If he finds an indication of gold he sinks a shaft, because he knows  that the main lode must be somewhere in the vicinity. The geologist usually carries with him instruments which have to be transported by motor car, but, unfortunately, our unexplored mining fields cannot be approached by motor car. We must, therefore, rely upon the prospector for the discovery of gold. A few years ago, a prospector was backed by a business man in a western township of Queensland. The prospector went out and sent back certain specimens, but the assays were unfavorable. One day he visited the storekeeper and threw a bag under a table saying "I have no idea of the value of that stuff, but there is mountains of it". He obtained meat, flour and other requirements and once more departed. Some time afterwards the business man, when cleaning out his office, came across the bag and sent it to Charters Towers. The specimens were assayed and showed 75 oz. to the ton. A search was made for the prospector, and he was eventually found dead just on the border of North Australia and Queensland. The field from which those specimens had been taken was never found. Had that prospector been given some little assistance by the Government, it is quite likely that that field would have been exploited to the benefit of Australia generally. Cases have been made out for the wool king and the wheat king, but no case is made out for this industry which is dying for the want of a little assistance. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member has referred to Mount Morgan. Let me tell him that the shareholders took £12,000,000 out of that mine, and when the price of copper was £120 a ton a starvation wage was being paid to the miners. The owners exploited Australian labour as if it were coolie and black labour. Eventually all mines will be worked on a profit-sharing system. If, under the existing industrial conditions, mines like Mount Morgan cannot be worked profitably by their owners, then they should be taken over by the miners, and a royalty paid to the owners. The profits from the Mount Morgan mine went to shareholders who had never seen the mine, and had en dured none of the hardships of those who first discovered it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and the pest was imported here. It has been operating in the north of Queensland for some time. When the Government first attempted to restrict its spread, the big pastoral companies said that it was doing no more harm than were the blowfly and the sand fly; but later, in 1923, they discovered that the fly had worked its way to Burketown, on the coast, and that, in consequence, their herds were in danger of being destroyed. The Queensland Government put into force quarantine regulations which prevented 'cattle from leaving the infected areas. The Commonwealth Government then made inquiries from various station-owners and managers, who asked that the quarantine be lifted to enable them to get their cattle away. The eradication of the buffalo fly appears to be everybody's job, and we know that everybody's job is nobody's job. The buffalo fly to-day is operating throughout the Burketown district, which is carrying over 100,000 head of cattle. It attacks the eye and the brisket of the beast and generally plays havoc with it. The quarantine was first applied to areas embracing Camooweal, the head of the Gregory River, Fiery Downs, and the Leichhardt river. To-day the pest is further south. As most of the cattle from the Leichhardt district finds it way into Townsville meat works, it will not be long before the buffalo fly is operating in the coastal areas of Queensland. Another of our imported pests is the prickly pear, the eradication of which is costing this country millions of pounds. This imported pest, the buffalo fly, is to-day operating at the Leichhardt river. </para>

Once the fly gets a hold in the coastal districts we shall have to expend millions of pounds to eradicate it. This pest has been allowed to develop in spite of repeated warnings. In the Philippine Islands it was well recognized as a danger, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Youngerberg,  an American veterinary surgeon who visited the Northern Territory and north-western Australia in 1919, warned both officials and pastoralists that the buffalo fly would prove a great menace to the cattle industry throughout Australia unless it were promptly and determinedly tackled. The pastoralists did not see the danger, and it was not until 1923 that some official in the Northern Territory woke up and wrote to the Department of Home Affairs drawing attention to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Youngerberg's  warning. When I entered this House in 1929 I immediately took up the matter with the Minister for Home Affairs. He communicated with the Queensland Agricultural Department, and a conference was arranged. Meanwhile, the fly had spread from the Northern Territory into the Queensland cattle areas, and to-day practically the whole of the Burketown area is affected. Last year I met a pastoralist in Queensland, and asked him about the buffalo fly. He replied, " lt is not affecting me very much ; it is no worse than the march fly." To-day I received a letter from him stating that the fly has become a pest on his property. One can see the cattle standing in the lagoons to avoid the fly, and the sun is visible only through the haze of flies above them. In portions of the Northern Territory where the buffalo fly is particularly bad, the horses can be seen racing through the camp fires at night in an endeavour to rid themselves of the pest. The pastoralist to whom I have referred wrote to me - </para>

                <para class="block">It was because of the dilatoriness of government methods that the prickly pear got beyond control. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> M. Land, member for Ballone  in the Queensland Parliament, urged many years ago that a line should be drawn about the prickly pear country, and that the area within it should be treated; otherwise, he said, millions of pounds would be required to eradicate it. He was called a fool; people said he was not a scientist, and did not understand what he was talking about. He was only a practical man. No notice was taken of his warnings, but eventually the prickly pear destroyed his home and his fences, and in various parts of the State the Queensland Government, has expended over £1,000,000 in trying to eradicate it. We do not know yet what result will be achieved by the <inline font-style="italic">cactoblastus,</inline> the parasite that was imported to attack the plant. We are told that the parasite will die as soon as it has eaten out its host. I hope that it will. The persons responsible for first introducing the prickly pear and the buffalo fly into Northern Australia have much to answer for. I appeal not only to the Commonwealth and State Governments, but also to Parliament, and the people to see that preventive measures are adopted before the buffalo fly reaches the dairy herds. I suggest that meat works for the killing and treatment of cattle should be established in the gulf country. A good port can be made there, transport will be obtainable, and the pastoralists will be able to get rid of their cattle. The Government proposes that certain areas should be quarantined. That is all right for those who have sufficient power and influence to have the restrictions removed so that they can get their cattle away, but what of the smaller man, who has been growing cattle year in and year out since 1919, and cannot get rid of them. If quarantine areas are to be established, provision must be made for the disposing of stock, which are an exportable commodity. If necessary a levy should be imposed on the industry to pay for the necessary preventive and curative measures. One obstacle to effective action so far has been the conflict between the recommendations of experts - stock inspectors, veterinary sur-  geons, and pastoralists. The last named suggested a blockade at the affected area, but found that that was opposed to their own interests, because there was no outlet for their cattle. Some pastoralists say that it would pay the Government to sacrifice the whole of the cattle in the infected area in order to get rid of the pest. One man has written to me stating that if immediate steps are not taken to exterminate the pest a large proportion of my district, which is the largest cattle area in the State, will be affected. Places that were clean last year are to-day infested, and the pest is destroying the stock. The writer's property is quarantined, and he expresses a wish that somebody would pay to him the amount that he has expended on improvements and he would gladly walk off, leaving the cattle behind. The delay of governments and their failure to adopt concerted measures is another proof that we have too many governments. There is a lot of technical and scientific interference, but unfortunately very little practical result. </para>

                    <para>.- The important matter raised by the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> has caused the Government a good deal of concern, and has been the subject of almost continuous conference between the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McNeill)</inline> and the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway).</inline> In April of last year a conference was held at which representatives of the Department of Home Affairs, the Health Department, the pastoralists and various interested parties in Queensland attended. The conference lasted for two days and certain resolutions were arrived at which, however, were not accepted by the Queensland Government. The main proposal forcombating the buffalo fly was the crea tion of a buffer area from 20 to 30 miles wide by upwards of 100 miles long. To make this area clean the cattle were to be gradually shifted from it into the Northern Territory. The buffalo fly does not thrive where the rainfall is less than 20 inches, and the experts are of opinion that by the gradual removal of the cattle into the dry areas, they will be freed of the pest, and can be marketed. It is anticipated that two or three years will be required to clean the Queensland cattle areas. When that has been achieved a similar buffer area will be established in the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth would accept full responsibility for the cost of compensating the pastoralists in the Northern Territory, establishing a buffer area, and carrying out a campaign worthy of Australia. This Government is charged with being entirely responsible for the presence of the buffalo fly; but it is believed that the pest was present in Australia 70 years before the inauguration of the Commonwealth. It was introduced into North Australia from the Philippines or Java, when buffalo were first brought to Australia, and its presence in North Australia has been known ever since. Owing to the influence of climate upon its incidence and spread, it has been confined, so far, to the northern portions of the continent, including the northern part of Western Australia, and now it is extending rapidly south and east into Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- No, it affects horses as well. Possibly, as it extends further south, it may attack other animals; but, at present it affects only the buffalo and horses and cattle. The fly is very vicious. It is smaller than the ordinary house fly, and its attacks, which cause pain and panic among the animals affected, lead to loss of condition and raw sores. While certain plans were developed at the conference held about twelve months ago, no method was arrived at for meeting the financial outlay required to give effect to them. The Queensland Government refused to accept responsibility in the matter, and would not even confer with the Commonwealth Government regarding the allocation of  financial responsibility. From time to time, officers of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research were investigating the matter with a view to discovering a parasite of the buffalo fly, and they obtained reports from Queensland regarding the incidence and spread of the pest.  Five months ago, it was established that the fly was confined to an area west and north of the rabbit-proof fence; but recently word has come from Queensland that the fly is to be found on the lower Leichhardt river, and is working towards the Flinders river. But, prior to the latest development, and because of a real fear on the part of the Commonwealth Government that the fly, if not controlled, would ultimately spread through the whole of the cattle country of Queensland, affect the valuable dairy herds in that State, and possibly find its way as far south as the Hunter River in New South Wales, I communicated with the Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> and suggested that he should confer with the officers of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Department of Health and the Department of Home Affairs and myself. He consented to do that. The subject of finance was discussed at this conference with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> and I made the following observations regarding the programme, which I have outlined, of creating a buffer area, clearing it, compensating the cattle owners, and so on : - </para>

We have some most capable entomologists engaged in the investigation of the buffalo fly pest. One officer is now in Java, and he will later go to Timor to observe the buffalo fly under local conditions. He will see if it is possible to discover a suitable parasite in either of those countries. </para>

                        <para>- In addition to causing an investigation to be made for the discovery of a parasite, the Government agreed, at the conference which I have mentioned, to send two Commonwealth officers into Northern Queensland immediately after the rainy season. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mackerras,</inline> who has had long experience of the buffalo fly, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Campbell,</inline> who is also familiar with the pest. They will begin their investigations at Dobbyn and Cloncurry, and then proceed to Burketown and Normanton. Word recently came from Queensland, as I have intimated, that the buffalo fly had reached the Lower Leichhardt, and was working across to the Flinders river. It was also reported verbally to me by a pastoralist, whose station is situated west of the rabbit-proof fence, which was tentatively fixed some time ago as the main southern and eastern boundary of the proposed buffer area, that the fly was definitely on his property, and had even gone further south and east. While we have had many reports in the past regarding the incidence and spread of the fly, when the scientists have investigated those reports, and the veterinary officers employed by the Queensland Government have made inquiries, they have found them to be without foundation. Not until this investigation has been completed by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Mackerras</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Campbell,</inline> and it is determined whether the buffalo fly has spread to the area from Burketown down to the Leichhardt river, will the Government be able to reach a decision. If it is found that the fly has reached those areas, and is still coming south and east, the Government will have to consider seriously whether it would be justified in spending money for the creation of a buffer area, and on the compensation of pastoralists who would be removed from that area. I have not been into this region myself, but from conversations I have had with pastoralists and scientists, I have come to the conclusion that if the fly is found on the </para>

                <para class="block">Leichhardt or Flinders rivers, and in the areas east and south of Burketown, it would be almost a physical impossibility to create a buffer area which would prevent its further spread. Nothing can be done until the investigation has been concluded. If it is found that the fly is south and east of the rabbit-proof fence, the Government, as I have said, must consider whether it would be justified in incurring the expense involved in the creation of a buffer area. </para>

If it is decided by the Government that it would not be justified in spending money on the creation of a buffer area, our efforts to control the pest will probably take the form of promoting investigation to discover some parasite which would destroy the fly, or at any rate check its increase. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not prepared at this stage to reply to the statement of the Minister regarding the attitude of the Queensland Government towards the control of the buffalo fly pest.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> in what purported to be a ministerial statement, made an anaemic declaration regarding the action proposed to be taken by the Commonwealth Government in view of the further default of the New South Wales Government over its interest payments. He gave the House no indication of how the Government proposed to deal with this recurring trouble. It is evident that the Premier of New South Wales <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> is pursuing a policy calculated to break down the system of private ownership. </para>

                        <para>- This is a time when we are justified in becoming excited, particularly those of us who represent parts of the Commonwealth other than New South Wales. Australia as a whole has been called upon to foot an interest bill amounting to £1,500,000, which should have been paid by New South Wales. Already that State has secured credits to the extent of millions of pounds at the expense of the other States. She has obtained shortdated loans amounting to nearly £3,000,000 out of a total of £5,000,000 of such loans recently raised. While <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> was Treasurer he made provision for supplying New South Wales with no less than £2,900,000 for the months of November and December alone. Moreover, accommodation to the extent of millions of pounds has been granted to New South Wales through the Commonwealth Bank, backed by the resources of all the States of the Commonwealth. It is time that the other States lodged a protest against the action of the Premier of New South Wales. Their resources are being taxed beyond endurance to make good the promises which New South Wales has refused to honour. Honorable members have spent the best part of an afternoon discussing points of order relating to matters which do not concern the country one iota. We should realize that the one matter of supreme importance to Australia to-day is the drift in government finance. That constitutes a grievance which certainly ought to be ventilated. Evidently the Commonwealth Government is prepared to allow that drift to go on without making any effort to stop it. Things are so bad to-day, that the Government should accept the offer of the parties in opposition to assist in a united effort to rehabilitate the country's finances. It is time that some determined action was taken in regard to the refusal by the Premier of New South Wales to pay interest owed by that State. The Prime Minister should find out whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> intends to proceed with the policy upon which he has embarked. Evidently that is his intention. Is the Prime Minister prepared from time to time merely to announce to the House that the New South Wales Government has again intimated its refusal to meet  its interest obligation, and will he, after making such an announcement, be content to declare once more that provision lias been made for the Commonwealth to meet another million pounds or so of interest which has fallen due? If that sort of thing is allowed to continue, before very long the resources of the whole Commonwealth will be exhausted through the action of this man in New South Wales who is determined to drag down, not only New South Wales, but the other States as well, in his efforts to wreck the social system under which we live. The Prime Minister promised, while he was in Loudon, that every one of Australia's obligations would be honoured. In order to make good that promise he should now call together nil parties in the House, so that some united action may be decided upon to stop the present financial drift. Through the parties in this House, he would be able to secure the cooperation of all their followers throughout the country, and arrive at a common policy, untainted by party politics, and  unassociated  with the machine-made principles which animate honorable members opposite. </para>

                        <para>- This is not a time to assassinate anybody. It is a time for united action. The Prime Minister should accept the responsibility of his position, and give the country the lead for which it is looking. It is evident, however, that things will be allowed to drift in the future as they have been in the past. When the Prime Minister went to Britain, everybody hoped that he would be able to do something for us there, and his return was anxiously awaited. Soon after he got back, he addressed the Parkes electors, and revealed the fact that while in Great Britain he had done nothing to relieve the burden under which the country is groaning. After the Prime Minister's return, a member of the British Ministry stated in the House of Commons that he had received no communication from the right honorable gentleman with regard to the funding of our war debt. It was only after pressure was exerted on the Prime Minister that he took the action which resulted in Great Britain giving relief to Australia by extending our war debt payments for two years. </para>

                <para>The Prime Minister would have the people of the country believe that he and his Government are endeavouring to do something for them. Actually all that they are doing is to disseminate electioneering propaganda, and to advance what they claim to be the only solution of the problem, a system of inflation. As a member of a State which must bear part of the resultant burden, I protest against the Prime Minister's spineless attitude in meekly allowing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> to default in his obligations to the investors of Great Britain. We all believed when the right honorable gentleman first returned to Australia that he would set aside all party pettiness, and do something big for the nation in its time of crisis. He did nothing, and he still does nothing. By countenancing the default of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> he is really encouraging that gentleman to continue in his policy of repudiation, which involves my State with others in unforeseen expenditure. Against that I strongly protest. </para>

                    <para>.- First I shall endeavour to satisfy myself as to what was in the mind of the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bernard Corser),</inline> when he spoke of this Government doing nothing to rectify the present difficulties of the nation. I had no idea previously that the honorable member was a direct actionist I remind him that immediately the Premier of New South Wales intimated the inability of his State to meet its obligations in London, this Government made the necessary arrangements to protect Australia from the stigma of repudiation, and instructed its Crown Law Department to issue a writ against the Government of New South Wales for the recovery of the amount involved. The honorable member will recollect that the Commonwealth and the States became parties to a financial agreement. He must be aware that under that agreement the Commonwealth is bound to meet the obligations of any State which may default. Does he suggest that this Government should repudiate that obligation, and that it did an improper thing when it honored its undertaking? I suggest that no action other than that taken by the Commonwealth Government was acceptable in the circumstances. It would be in keeping with the honorable member's attitude if he suggested, as an alternative, that the Prime Minister or a  deputy  should have gone to New South Wales and knocked out the brains of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline> Whatever may be the policy of the honorable member, I assure him that this party stands for constitutional methods. Evidently he sponsors action of a different complexion when it is likely to give him a political advantage. </para>

                <para>Whatever the Minister may have said as to the buffalo fly menace, I assure him that I intend to pursue the matter further. I have given a considerable amount of time to a study of the problem, and only to-day I consulted <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Robertson,</inline> one of our scientists, upon it. That gentleman assured me that he believed that it would be impossible to cope with the buffalo fly now that it had been allowed to become so firmly established. I warn the Minister that if the pest penetrates south to the Clarence river irreparable damage will be done to one of the finest assets of the nation. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Robertson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> have assured me that as soon as the pest reaches territory which is more densely stocked, it will increase at an alarming rate. Reports indicate that it has already reached what may be termed the danger zone, and I should like to be told that that is not so. Those scientists informed me that three years ago an expenditure of £35,000 would have checked the trouble. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Robertson</inline> informed me to-day that it would be almost impossible to eradicate the pest. There has been a good deal of quibbling as to whether a State or the Commonwealth Government should provide the funds to check the spread of the buffalo fly. That is most regrettable, and later I shall ask that definite action be taken by the Commonwealth Government in the matter. The fly is a very small insect, the size of a sandfly, and about sixteen times smaller than an ordinary housefly. It first attacks stock about the eyes, then round the brisket and under the jaws, anywhere where the flesh is soft and unprotected; and there it hangs on. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, night and day. Sandflies and many other pests give a beast a rest at night, but this menace is with the unfortunate creature throughout the 24 hours. There is no doubt about its ability to travel. It deposits its eggs in the hot droppings of beasts, and could be carried 600 to 700 miles between Dobbyn and Townsville in a matter of about 30 hours. In that way it travels from the interior to the ' coast. On the Atherton Tableland, in North Queensland, remarkably fine herds of cattle have been built up at great expense. They are beautiful Jerseys, and other breeds, soft in flesh, and particularly susceptible to the frightful torment of such a pest as the buffalo fly. If the menace spreads to that area enormous losses will result. The fly may penetrate to the northern districts of New South Wales, where enormous sums of money have also been spent to build up herds of valuable cattle. The Minister must surely realize the disastrous consequences of the infestation of such country by the pest. </para>

                        <para>- No; the fly merely leaves the beast while it is in the dip, settling on it again as it dries. It might be possible to protect individual beasts; but that is quite impracticable with large herds. It could be attempted only by constantly keeping smoking fires alight, which is out of the question in the large areas of the north. If something is not done to arrest its spread the buffalo fly will do incalculable harm when it reaches the more closely settled areas. Already it is said to be 60 miles south of Burketown, and is steadily getting closer to the railhead. I urge the Minister to take prompt action in the matter. There are some who contend that the buffalo fly is not likely to extend to the colder and drier districts. It is a fact that it makes no progress in districts which have a rainfall of less than 20 inches a year. Its activities are particularly bad during the wet season; but, unfortunately, they are almost equally dangerous in dry seasons, because of the poor condition of the stock at that time, which reduces their powers of resistance. </para>

Even if it is not possible to get the State  Governments  to do very much preventive work, I sincerely trust that the Commonwealth Government will take the responsibility of endeavouring to counter the pest. It will be remembered that when the rinderpest appeared in Western Australia the Commonwealth Government took the view that the States should help to defray the cost of any combative measures, but in the end it had to provide most of the money that was spent in that fight which, happily, ended satisfactorily for Australia. If the buffalo fly comes far south, it will do vast damage to our stock industry. I assure the Government that the Country party will give it every possible assistance to protect our stock from the ravages of this pest. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>I desire now to direct the attention of the Government to a valuable, but hitherto almost unexplored, source of revenue. Most countries of the world derive a considerable income from the traffic  of  tourists to their various beauty spots. The tourist industry is worth about £60,000,000 per annum to Canada. Last year about £200,000,000 of outside money was spent by tourists in the United States of America. Switzerland derives about two-thirds of her total national revenue from tourists. Two years ago the Commonwealth Government made a grant of £5,000 for the purpose of developing tourist traffic in Australia. This resulted in the establishment of the Australian National Travel Association. An amount of £83,000 was also subscribed by interested parties, with the object of promoting travel in Australia by people from overseas. The shiping companies, the big motor transport companies, the railway commissioners of certain States, and other interested  parties have taken a considerable interest in this matter. Agencies have been established in Great Britain, America, New Zealand, and elsewhere, with the object of attracting tourists to Australia. New Zealand draws a very large revenue from visiting tourists, and there is no reason why Australia should not do likewise. </para>
                <para>One of the results of the efforts of this league has been the visit on two occasions of a holiday cruising vessel from America. On the first visit she called at six Australian ports, but on the second visit she called at Sydney only. An examination of the reasons why the second cruise in Australian waters was so limited shows that the various Australian Governments could do a great deal to assist in promoting tourist traffic. They could, for instance, reduce certain costs which such vessels incur while in port. If they did so, the tourists would be able to make a much more extensive and prolonged itinerary. This would mean that not only would a greater income be received in Australia from them, but they would be much better fitted to advertise Australia when they returned to their own country. In this connexion I have received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stuart</inline> Gardiner, the general secretary of the Travel Promotion and Development Association of Southern Queensland and Northern New South "Wales, in which he enclosed a letter sent to him from the Matson Steamship Line in connexion with port and other charges imposed on cruising vessels.

                    <para>Australia, in many respects, is isolated from the rest of the world, and is off the beaten track usually followed by most cruise ships. Still, she is doing nothing to attract vessels on world or other cruises. </para>

                    <para>It would seem, therefore, that not only governments but port authorities themselves would recognize the value of this trade and the desirability of assisting those trying to promote same by being prepared to make some concession to cruise vessels touching Australian ports. </para>
                    <para>I do know in Java that, if a cruise vessel ,does not embark or disembark any passengers while touching Javanese ports, port charges are waived. </para>
                    <para>On the first voyage of the <inline font-style="italic">Malolo,</inline> calling at Fremantle, the Harbour Trust were sufficiently interested and considerate to make- a refund of the tonnage dues incurred at that port, amounting to £66 Kia. No charges were waived at Melbourne or Sydney. </para>
                    <para>On the first voyage, in 1929, the <inline font-style="italic">Malolo</inline> paid charges as follows: - Fremantle, £454, Gs. 3d.: Melbourne, £384 ls. Id. ; Sydney, £352 10s. lOd. She disbursed for supplies at these same ports in the order named- £233 10s. lid., £459 10s. 5d., £1.891 18s. 4d. </para>
                    <para>On the second voyage, on which she called at Sydney only, her total port charges were £811 4s., and her purchase of stores, <inline font-style="italic">&amp;c,</inline> amounted to £1,064 13s. fid. </para>
                    <para>The difference in the amount of port charges at Sydney  for the first and second voyages is accounted for by reason of the fact that Commonwealth light dues, in the amount of £311 8s. Dd. on the first voyage, were paid at Fremantle. Also, included in Sydney charges for the second voyage is £70 lis. lid. for Queensland coast pilots. It would not be reasonable for any cruise vessel to expect consideration on this item. </para>
                    <para>In this connection, we would point out that the two largest items are the Commonwealth and State light dues. At the time that the Commonwealth took over the control and maintenance of the various lights on the Australian coast, the basis of charge made in New South Wales was 4d. per net registered ton, payable every six months. In other words, vessels trading to Sydney paid this charge twice a year, regardless of the number of calls made at this port. </para>
                    <para>The State contended when this charge was made that their organization cost them as much to maintain the lights of minor importance at the smaller ports as for maintaining all other lights, for their charge has not been meeting the total expense in connection with this service, and hence they made no reduction in this charge. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth, however, increased the rate for Commonwealth dues to Od. per net registered ton, payable every three months, and then at a later date increased the charge to 8d. per net registered ton, payable every three months. </para>
                    <para>Despite repeated promises on the part of both Commonwealth and State Governments that these charges would be reduced, this has never been accomplished. </para>
                    <para>As stated, the Commonwealth dues on the <inline font-style="italic">Malolo</inline> amounted to £3118s. 9d., and the State dues to £138 8s. 4d. You will undoubtedly agree that for vessels on long voyages engaged in the regular trade, or for a cruise ship, these arc exceptionally high charges, and, taken into consideration with charges at other Australian ports, which are the highest of any in the world, do not offer much encouragement to the ship-owner to send his ships to Australia. </para>
                    <para>Regret we cannot give you any information as to the amount of money spent by tourists in shopping and sight-seeing during ship's stay. I believe this information can be secured, however, through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Holmes, Director, Australian National Travel Association, Melbourne. He may be also able to give you additional information concerning other countries or ports where no charges are assessed, or, if so, greatly reduced in connection with the visits of cruise vessels. </para>
                    <para>We might also add that for stores consumed on the Australian coast from the time of arrival at Fremantle in 1929 to departure from Sydney, the <inline font-style="italic">Malolo</inline> paid the Commonwealth customs £173 12s. 7d. In 1930, during her stay in Sydney only, the duty on stores consumed in port amounted to £52 7s. 7d. </para>
                    <para>Our company last year spent no less than $50,000 in advertising the <inline font-style="italic">Malolo</inline> cruise in the United States, and it is needless to point out that Australia, as much as any other country visited, received her share of this publicity. In addition, we are spending a very large sum every year advertising Australian attractions to the American tourist, in connection with our regular service, and she also gets a great amount of free advertising by word of month from the tourists on the <inline font-style="italic">Malolo,</inline> who have come from every section of the United States, and a reduction, therefore, of say 50 per cent.in Commonwealth and State light duos, also berthage dues, which were paid in Sydney in the amount of £16111s. in 1929. and £188 9s. 6d. in 1930, would be of considerable assistance, and at the same time encourage our company in continuing these cruises, knowing in advance that we would receive some substantial support and recognition from Commonwealth, State and Harbour Trust authorities. I feel quite sure if yourselves, in co-operation with the Australian National Travel Association and business interests of the State, made representations sufficiently strong, that reductions of charges in question on cruise ships should he made. Such reductions would react to the advantage of all concerned. If any country in the world needs the tourist to-day it is Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- I urge upon the Government the necessity for expediting any assistance that it contemplates giving to the gold-mining industry. The honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> referred this afternoon to the need for developing North Australia, particularly in the direction of gold-mining. That industry, I suggest, affords the . best means for absorbing some of the unemployed, the ranks of whom are increasing daily, not only in this country, but also in every other country of the world. If wool and wheat prices were at their peak, and loan moneys were obtainable in Australia, we should still have an army of unemployed. Unskilled labour is fast disappearing from our industrial activities, as the result of the use of improved machinery, requiring little or no manual labour, and to some extent, as the result of the alteration of the whole of the transport arrangements of the Commonwealth. It will, therefore, be realized that in respect of unemployment we have a difficult problem to solve, despite the fact that we are likely, within a short time at all events, to have a partial revival of prosperity. To-day no loan moneys are available and probably none will be available for a long time. We have had to reduce expenditure on loan works from £43,000,000 to £14,000,000 in one year. Our railway systems are fast becoming obsolete, and there is little likelihood of more lines being built. That will throw out of employment some 12,000 men engaged in railway construction work. There is, in addition, less employment on road construction work. Whereas some three or four years ago we constructed roads that had to be renewed or repaired at least every two years, to-day we are building roads of bitumen and cement, which will not require any expenditure on maintenance for many years to come. I therefore, suggest that the Government should expedite any assistance that it proposes to give to the gold-mining industry so that we may absorb some of our unemployed. In the big depression of 1893, gold-mining in Western Australia undoubtedly saved Australia. From Victoria alone 36,000 people went to Western Australia. The gold discoveries of 1S54 were responsible for a vast migration to the eastern States. In that army of migrants were our fathers and mothers; those migrants were the cream of the citizens of Australia. They were attracted by the gold mines of Australia, and they introduced into this country a finer stock than that of any other land. To-day the spirit of our parents is alive in Australia. In May of last year I urged the Government to assist the gold mining industry because I considered that it would be well worth while to do so. According to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 2Sth of this month, the Minister for Mines in Victoria, speaking at the opening of the gold exhibition 'in Melbourne, said that there were 3,600 men seeking gold in that State. About 80 per cent, of those men had previously been out of work and had no hope of getting work. They did not want the dole, so they obtained from the State Government the appliances necessary to enable them to prospect for gold. Some have had good finds, and it is possible that discoveries may be made which will lead to a rapid absorption of our unemployed. </para>

                        <para>- There has been produced in Bendigo S2,0Q0,000 oz. of gold, and I am informed on reliable authority that there is more gold still in that district than ever came out of it. As a result of the encouragement given to this industry I find that in Victoria during the months of January and February of this year the gold yield increased by 2,157 ounces, representing £11,000 of added wealth to this country. In addition, the production of that gold has provided a livelihood for a number of our people. </para>

                <para class="block">I suggest that it is far better for the unemployed to prospect for gold than to toil in the city, and live under bad housing conditions. I refer particularly to the casual worker, who has no opportunity of making provision for periods of unemployment. Gold-mining is worth while. I do not mean deep gold-mining, because that has its drawbacks. It has a bad influence on the health of the worker, and I, therefore, do not urge a revival of abnormally deep mining. The industry saved Australia in 1893, and I believe that it can save this country in 1931. The aggregate value of the primary products of Australia has decreased by some £140,000,000, and it is futile to expect that loss to be made up in the next three or four years. Gold is a commodity which is dug from the ground. About 60 per cent, of the capital that is invested in gold-mining is absorbed by labour. The product is worth in the world market to-day £5 6s. an ounce. There is no reason why we should not produce sufficient gold to rectify our trade balance. In 190S, 70,000 men were engaged in gold-mining. In 1929 that number had decreased by 64,000. To-day the increase in one State is 3,600 in under eleven months. The yield of gold is increasing in every State, and as it still further increases, so will the position improve in regard to unemployment. The Bruce-Page Government appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gepp</inline> as a commissioner to inquire into the gold-mining industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gepp</inline> submitted a long report containing some excellent data, and he recommended a grant of £250,000 to the industry. No action was taken by that Government to give effect to the recommendations of the commissioner. As a result of representations made by me in. this House, this present Government deputed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gepp</inline> to investigate the mining areas in my electorate. That investigation was carried out, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gepp</inline> recommended a grant of £50,000 to enable side lines to main reefs, if any, to be opened up. If that grant were made now, hundreds of men would soon be employed, and probably thousands more at a later date. There is a proposition in Bendigo known as the New Red, White, and Blue mine. It is an old mine, and the departmental experts have pronounced it to be an excellent proposition. </para>
                <para class="block">The company is asking for a loan of £3,000, which, if granted, will enable 90 men to be placed in regular work for one year. What applies to that mine applies equally to all other gold-mining areas in Victoria. Leases are being taken out, and English capital is being invested. Men are searching for gold in every part of Victoria. An increase in the gold yield means an increase of employment wherever gold is discovered. From the point of decentralization the encouragement of the gold industry is well worth while. The figures shown in the current <inline font-style="italic">Tear-Boole</inline> in respect of the population of our cities are alarming. Of the population of New South Wales 46 per cent, is in the metropolitan area of Sydney. In Victoria the percentage of population in the metropolitan area is 56 per cent., and in Queensland, 33 per cent. In contrast, let me say that in New Zealand the percentage is 9 per cent.; in Japan, 3 per cent.; in Germany, 6 per cent.; and in France, 7 per cent. Anything that we do to assist the gold-mining industry, at the same time transferring workers from the cities to the country, must be in the interests not only of this nation, hut also of the individuals concerned. From 1S51 to 1927 the total gold yield in Australia was worth £626,000,000, whilst the total output of coal in the same period was worth only £200,000,000. In Victoria £390,000,000 worth of gold was Avon, and yet the total government assistance to the industry in that State does not exceed £316,000. That is in marked contrast to the treatment of the wine, flax, sugar, iron and steel industries which have enjoyed liberal aid, including bounties granted by this Parliament. Clearly the mining industry has not been fostered as other industries have been. I agree with the honorable member for the Northern Territory that there are auriferous areas which would provide profitable employment for many thousands of men. They could earn more than they earn in city avocations, each man would be his own boss, and the product of his labour would be assured at all times of a ready market. The present price of gold is £5 6s. an ounce. Every possible assistance should be given to the gold-mining industry immediately. </para>
                <para>The right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> spoke of the desirability of inducing tourists to come to Australia, and spend some of the money which they now spend in other parts of the world.  I have not been outside this country, but my own knowledge of it and information given to me by others who have travelled abroad convinces me that it has attractions for the holiday-maker equal to those of any other country. The association of which the right honorable member spoke, is doing useful work, for which it does not require very much money. The Government makes a small allowance to it annually, and other interested bodies have provided about £60,000. We are told that every overseas tourist who comes to Australia spends here on an average £3 each day, and the association estimates that if we do something to foster this business and increase the facilities for the enjoyment of Australia's natural beauties, a minimum of £20,000,000 of overseas money will be distributed annually through the railways, holiday resorts, hotels, and shops. We should take steps promptly to exploit this wealth. Let us boost our own land as a place well worth seeing, and look after visitors in such a way that they will not hurriedly depart. </para>

                    <para>.- I have twice mentioned recently, but without any perceptible result, the excessive valuation of land for taxation purposes. The very many land-holders throughout Australia who are affected have a real grievance. Although the actual value of land has decreased within the last couple of years by from 30 to 60 per cent., valuations for taxation purposes are being increased by up to 100 per cent.  Because  of droughts and the tremendous fall in the prices of primary products, the rural land-holder has experienced during the last couple of years the worst time that he has undergone during the SO years I have been on the land in New South Wales. In the past, droughts were usually followed by a succession of good seasons, which enabled the man on the land to make good some of the losses he had sustained, but he has been disappointed in that hope, because the prices of wool and wheat, the two main primary products of Australia, have decreased by 60 and 70  per cent. Wheat-growers are selling their products at considerably below the cost of production. That is true also of wool despite the fact that prices have advanced a little lately. Land-holders are appealing against the valuations, but that will involve them in considerable loss of time and expense, which they cannot afford and which they should not be obliged to incur. No reasonable defence to their claims can be advanced by the Taxation Department, which is more dishonest than the action of Shylock, for, whilst he could honestly say that he was entitled to his pound of flesh, the department can make no such claim. The increased land taxation is downright robbery. </para>

                <para>I was interested in the debate on the buffalo fly, because of the statement that it. may affect the dairy herds of New South Wales. If there is any such risk, the Government should instruct the entomological division of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research - sometimes less euphemistically called " the bug house " - to take the problem in hand. The saving of millions of pounds to the cattle-breeders of Australia would redound greatly to the credit of a Canberra institution. As a layman, however, I do not think that the danger to this part of the Commonwealth is so great as some people believe.

Since the recent earthquake New Zealand has been visited by many curious sightseers, and I believe that Australia would be similarly benefited if we could stage some sort of artificial earthquake. In the electorate of Macquarie recently a big landslide occurred which attracted many people to the spot. Kosciusko is in my electorate, and if an upheaval there increased the tourist traffic, my constituents would benefit. </para>

                <para>The honorable member's interjection reminds me of another grievance. We have in the press galleries of this Parliament a very creditable representation of Australian journalism. Not many months ago the newspapers were prolific of news regarding proceedings in the Labour caucus. They were able to publish not only the speeches of honorable members and the resolutions of the party, but the actual voting lists. </para>
                <para>During the last week or two, great work has been going on in the party rooms of honorable members opposite; but the press has told us nothing about it. It should have been able to draw on its imagination, as it did some time ago, regarding the proceedings in the Labour caucus. The garbled reports that were published in the press at that time concerning those proceedings were intended to damage the Labour party in the eyes of the people, by suggesting that it. was unable to carry out its programme. No doubt a most readable story could be  written concerning the" Lyonizing" that has taken place in the Opposition party rooms. </para>

We had seven parties in this House some time ago, but the word went forth from grandfather Gibson that there should be one fold and one shepherd. It is significant that the sceptre of the shepherd is a big crook. The seven shepherds, seven folds, and the seven big crooks have now entered one fold. Intellectual elephants have been seen marching two by two into the Noah's Ark reconstructed by the Tasmanian devil. I have seen the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> marching two by two into the one fold, under the one crook. I should like to have some information on this subject from the gentlemen in the press gallery. </para>

                <para>Honorable members opposite who are being " Lionized " now require a name for their new party. I thought of calling it an oligarchy or a phylarchy, but that would hardly do. Then it occurred to me that it might be styled a gynarchy. It is said that the new party is having some difficulty in inducing the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> to join it, but let me prophesy. I think that my words will soon be proved correct. One of these mornings, the leader of the gynarchy, when his valet opens the caucus room door, will find a flat object on the floor, with a label on it bearing these words - " With compliments from Hardy ". The object on the floor will be the Leader of the Country party, run over by the Hardy steam roller, and pushed under the door. Then the leader of the gynarchy will say, " Stone the crows, Hardy, now we have one shepherd, one fold, and one crook ; kiss me, Hardy ". </para>

We know that the leader of the new party in process of formation, whilst in our party, was perched on one of the longest branches in our forest. Our enemies shot at him, but when the smoke of battle cleared he began to smell real money, and he found that he had been shot at with golden bullets. He told them not to shoot and that he would come down. Now he is perched on the highest tree in the Nationalist forest. If he ever succeeds in leading a government in this House he will find a mountain of debt for which the party opposite is responsible. The mountain will follow him about. It will groan and bring forth mice, and one will be Mickey the Mouse, who will dance and play tunes on his bed" at night. He will have such a nightmare that he will be sorry he ever accepted the leadership of the political conglomeration represented by members opposite. I have not had time to cudgel my brain to study the tactics of the Opposition, but if it does not use its best endeavours to make the present Government's financial policy workable, by assisting to release credits, and helping the Government to discharge the financial obligations of the Commonwealth, this country has a bad time in store for it. </para>

Possibly at the next elections it will devote some of its space to the member for Eden-Monaro. There is no more dust in that portion of a room on which a sunbeam falls, than there is in any other part of the room. The press may throw their spotlight upon me, but I am not afraid of it. So far as the <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily</inline> is concerned, it seems that that newspaper and the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> are now one. If the leader of the new party opposite ever becomes Prime </para>

I have been accused of writing a vitriolic letter, but I can scarcely write a letter of any kind. I ask permission to have the letter referred to inserted in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> without being read. It was described by the <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily</inline> as " vitriolic." </para>

                    <para>I notice reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily</inline> the condemnationary criticism to which I have been subjected by your League. I would not like to strain your League's tolerance too much by asking to be permitted to address your League. I, therefore, prefer to address a few thoughts to you, so your anger may be appeased by tearing to pieces, not the writer, but his writing for a start. </para>
                    <para>I recognize my incapacity to be brief and intelligible, but here goes: </para>
                    <para>I went through a crisis like this in 1916 when we had a mad executive in New South Wales, which started cutting " heads off " indiscriminately, betrayed the Labour party, and gave anti-Labour a fourteen years' lease of Federal Governmental control. We have an executive in New South Wales now that has openly declared its desire to repeat the disastrous process. </para>
                    <para>The one action in my political career of which I am most proud is that in 1916 I sacrificed my political prospects in an effort to save the movement by refusing to violate my pledged principles at the dictates of an executive that was intoxicated with its prospects of climbing into Parliament over the dead bodies of the victims it politically beheaded. We soon saw then what is contemplated now, a party revolution, in which those who were cutting off heads to-day, are getting theirs cut off to-morrow. </para>
                    <para>The feeling was engendered then that it is no use electing a Labour Government as they have a penchant to destroy themselves by internecine fighting. </para>
                    <para>I remember the great stalwarts of 1916 who bolstered up the illegal machinations of the then executive. They would stand up in the caucus like giants animated with the ferocity of tigers, defying the decisions of caucus to which they were pledged, but when you saw them down in Goulburn-street where the power to expel existed, you would see them, so to say, being led around with darning cotton like domesticated poodles - the McGirrs, the Dooleys', the Brookfields, Mutches and Loughlins. What did these gentlemen say when their turn came to have their " heads off " V "To hell with the party," said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr... McGirr:</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dooley</inline> stigmatized the executive as a lot of " crooks and spoilers ", &amp;c, &amp;e. </para>
                    <para>The present executive want me to break my pledge by abandoning the policy adopted by our caucus and betraying the leader that we elected to lead us by the only body I know that has the right to elect a Federal Labour leader. Some years ago the New South Wales Executive assumed the right to elect the leader of the New South Wales Labour members, and elevated <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Greg</inline> McGirr thereto. That was resented and resisted by the then party. Now, however, we are told to accept leadership from one not yet even elected to the Federal Parliament. </para>
                    <para>If the New South Wales executive can do this, surely the other five State executives can similarly " butt in " and direct their members, and thus a Federal Labour Government becomes hopelessly unworkable. </para>
                    <para>It might bc my stupidity that is at fault, but the best way to help the Nationalists to win East Sydney is for the New South Wales members of Parliament to acquiesce in the dictates of a supercilious executive that takes its "belt off", so to speak, and drives us on the East Sydney battlefield as a detachment of " conscripted orators ". </para>
                    <para>The difference between the 1910 executive and the present one is that the name of the present " panjandrum " is more appropriate. When we look ahead we see our political graves, and when we look behind we see a despotic Graves trying to drive us to same. We risk expulsion if we refuse to break our pledge as decreed by the State authority, and we risk the same fate if we break our pledge. </para>
                    <para>I may not be pardoned if I presume to use my judgment in a crisis like this, and to assume that the electors of Eden-Monaro elected me - consistent with my pledge - to deliberate with my colleagues at Canberra, and to loyally support the policy adopted by the federal caucus. </para>
                    <para>I am not aware that anything to which I pledged myself compels that I should only support my party's decisions, when such decisions harmonize with the decisions arrived at in Goulburn-street. </para>
                    <para>Apart from my personal predilection, I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> stands in higher esteem in my electorate than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> does. He has been confronted with unprecedented difficulties, and to combat these difficulties the least he and his Ministers may expect is that Labour members should give loyal support instead of which Leagues are applauding those who captiously criticize our Ministry. Garbled and untrue reports appear in the hostile press and the <inline font-style="italic">Labor Daily</inline> that must be supplied by some traitor in our party. Iri the latter paper we read the same disruptive falsehoods as to what happens in . caucus as appears in the hostile press in Australia. If Leagues would stimulate their representatives to be loyal to their Ministers, their leaders, and to stand foursquare with their colleagues in facing the stupendous power of our enemies, instead of making heroes of members who embarrass the Government at every turn, and hearten the </para>
                    <para class="block">Opposition, let them demand 100 per cent. loyalty in the interest of the workers that needall that a sympathetic Federal and State Government can give. </para>

                    <para>made a statement this afternoon regarding the measures being taken to control the buffalo fly pest, and referred to the campaign being at present conducted by the Commonwealth Government in alliance with the Government of Queensland. I am not in a position to say what attitude the Queensland Government is taking on the matter, but in common with the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bernard Corser),</inline> I am convinced that the Queensland Government is so fully seised of the importance of preventing the further spread of the pest that it will do everything in its power to further the preventive measures now being considered. The fly at present is confined to the beef herds of northern Queensland, and the Northern Territory. If that pest is not countered before it makes further south, it will become a terrible menace to the State of Queensland. If it reaches the Wide Bay and Moreton districts it will cause losses comparable to those suffered as a result of the spread of red water fever following the invasion by the cattle tick of the southern districts years ago. I remember that the same warnings were issued at that time, and they were ignored. The full extent of the danger was not realized until red water fever broke out in the dairy herds of southern Queensland. Great as was the damage done in the northern part of the State, it was only a circumstance compared with what occurred in south Queensland and to a lesser extent in northern New South Wales. I am con- vinced that the Queensland Government will take what action is necessary to combat the buffalo fly pest. </para>

                <para>Some honorable members opposite referred this afternoon to the need for encouraging the mining industry which, they said, was an avenue into which the energies of many of our unemployed might be turned. Nobody could have more sympathy with that proposal than I have. I realize the possibilities before the industry, and I hope that something will be done; but I think that honorable members opposite, when addressing themselves to this matter this afternoon, were speaking to some extent with their tongues in their cheeks. There was, I think, an element of insincerity in their attitude. The mining industry in Australia generally is at present in a deplorable condition, not so much because of reduced prices of metals, but because of the industrial conditions that have made it impossible under existing circumstances to make the mines pay. Honorable members opposite appear to resent that statement. Why, I wonder, should they jump like startled fauns whenever mention is made of this matter? Honorable members on the other side know as well as I do that the present condition of the mining industry is due largely to arbitration awards, and other restrictions which have been forced on the industry. This afternoon I mentioned Mount Morgan. </para>

                        <para>- The mining industry is in its present unsatisfactory state  because of the conditions imposed by arbitration awards, and because of actions of Labour Governments. Mount Morgan is a mining field with great historical associations. It has produced a great deal of wealth in the past, and there still remains £12,000,000 to £16,000,000 worth of surveyed ore awaiting exploitation. These resources cannot be worked, because of the industrial conditions imposed upon the industry. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members opposite have been speaking with their tongues in their cheeks when they say that it is impossible to find work for men who are now on the dole. If the mining industry were relieved of the conditions imposed upon it by mining awards, arn T,le  work  would be available for all the miners who are unemployed to-day. That it is not, is due entirely to the restrictive industrial conditions that have been imposed. I have cited Mount Morgan. I could just as well cite the case of Broken Hill, of Tasmania, or half a dozen others in support of my argument. "What reliance can be placed on the statements and sincerity of honora'ble members opposite when they claim that the mining industry is languishing for the reasons that they have advanced? The reasons are as I have stated them. It is ridiculous to refer to deep sinking, depressed markets, speculation, and so forth. I submit that those are very minor difficulties. </para>

                <para>I agree with the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson),</inline> to some extent. I believe that something very substantial can-be done to assist the mining industry in Australia, but I doubt whether it would be successful unless existing industrial imposts were lightened. In this, at least, help might be forthcoming. Some time ago our governments went to the expense of importing geophysical experts with their paraphernalia ; the present would be a very opportune time for the nation to avail itself of their services. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that it would be wise to employ those geophysical experts to locate and survey- auriferous areas, known and unknown. Those around Mungana might be exploited with some very considerable degree of usefulness to the community. The possibilities of Mungana are historic, and if these geophysical experts and their paraphernalia were employed in that area they should achieve something worth while for the country. I contend that the riches of Mungana ought not to be left for the exploitation of individuals; they should be developed by the Commonwealth. The mineral wealth of Australia, and particularly that in the Mungana area, appears to be regarded as the especial preserve of individuals, with the result that great riches have been acquired by them. If we diverted some of that wealth into the Commonwealth coffers we should be doing a useful community service. The exploitation of the Mungana mining areas by private individuals has proceeded far and wide, and it is time that we saw that those individuals were limited in their activities in that area, and that the Commonwealth has some opportunity of acquiring some share of those riches. </para>

                <para>This very naturally brings me to the subject of the Treasurer of this Commonwealth. "We were told with some emphasis by the Prime Minister that the honorable the Treasurer is an overworked man at the present time. I do not wish to direct any carping criticism to the statement of the Prime Minister. The fact that the Treasurer is at present conducting electioneering tours throughout Australia when his presence on personal business is desired in Queensland is particularly clear evidence to all of us that he is an overworked man. It is patent that the Treasurer's arduous electioneering is preventing him from attending in Queensland, where certain onerous duties devolve upon him at this moment. The urgent private affairs of the honorable gentleman in that State are being neglected so that he may conduct an electioneering tour throughout the States of Victoria and South Australia. I understand that it has been extended even across Bass Strait, into Tasmania. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems that even in this time of crisis in our national life, honorable members opposite find it difficult to get away from those irritating subjects which cause Parliament to neglect matters of national importance. That was made particularly apparent by the remarks of the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan).</inline> Unfortunately, this nation has been fighting over the distribution of its wealth, with the result that a condition of affairs has developed to the detriment of the common weal. </para>

                <para>To-night the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Killen)</inline> brought under the notice of the House a matter of very grave importance, which should receive tie serious consideration of this Parliament. Unless it receives that attention there must develop in the general administrative functions of the States and the Commonwealth many inconsistencies, which will result in hardship to the wealth producers of the country. In the administration of our land boards and other departments that adjudicate as to the valuation of land, we have slavishly followed certain procedure which has been laid down by the High Court, adhered to by those who hear appeals, and also followed by taxation and local governing authorities, so that the average person now believes that we maintain our services by taxing the people rather than developing the wealth potentialities of the country. The position that now confronts' the man on the land is serious, and the subject developed by the honorable member for Riverina demands immediate consideration. Unless some uniformity is brought about to govern the valuation of our lands, it is inevitable that our condition will become  worse. </para>
                <para>Recently we witnessed the unfortunate spectacle of a Premier of an important Australian State taking upon himself the responsibility -of trying to make a part greater than the whole, and of attempting to develop a financial theory that has proved disastrous to the nation. In indicating that he intended to turn the financial position of Australia topsyturvy that Premier brought about a state of instability which eventually caused a State savings bank to close its doors, and caused the dreadful disorganization that now obtains in that State. </para>
                <para>The Government of the State of New South Wales is giving consideration to a system of land taxation intended to revolutionize the existing methods, and which will, if carried into practical effect, have results just as disastrous as those resulting from its Premier's financial policy. It is time that we realized that the nation can meet its obligations only by the creation of wealth, and not by consistently imposing burdens of  taxa-tion  upon the people. The nation depends to a great extent upon the pastoral industry. I have heard a good deal said of other industries, and their possibilities, but it has been definitely proved that if our pastoral industry is properly administered, it will assist the nation to overcome even its present difficulties. </para>
                <para>There are many inconsistencies in the existing situation. The section of the community which is being called upon to bear excessive taxation will also be expected to increase the output of wool next year in order to enable the country to meet its overseas commitments. But unfortunately the very fact that heavy taxation has been imposed upon the primary producers has made it impossible for them to find the wherewithal to maintain their flocks and herds in a proper condition. In the north-western district of New South Wales I recently saw many sheep badly infested with flies. When I spoke to the owners about it they said that they were unable to find the money to employ men to care for the sheep. For this reason I say it is essential that steps should be taken by this Parliament to remedy the position. </para>
                <para>Another aspect of the problem which seriously affects the small graziers, has to do with the marketing of our wool. I thought a few weeks ago that certain honorable members opposite were waking up to the fact that the provision of a proper, nation-wide, scheme for the collection and distribution of our wool was urgently needed, but it seems as though certain press reports have caused the enthusiasm of those honorable members to wane. Under existing conditions the small graziers can have no sense of security. It appears definite now that the zone system has failed. I believe that a meeting of representative persons is to be held in Melbourne shortly to consider the  advisableness  of inaugurating a scheme for the collection and distribution of our wool; but the subject is of such far-reaching importance that it should, not be left to the determination of selfappointed representatives. The national parliament should take some step in the matter. It will be remembered that during the war, when the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was Prime Minister, he took a large part in inaugurating a scheme for the marketing of our wool which was economically sound, and gave the producers a sense of security. While that scheme was in operation, gambling and speculation in wool was practically eliminated. There is no reason why such violent fluctuations should occur in the price of wool. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Devereaux,</inline> the joint representative in Great Britain of the Australian Government and the graziers, recently made the pertinent remark that the fluctuations in the price of our wool were due to fright. He said that the lowness of the price realized some months ago could be attributed to fearfulness, just as could the remarkable upward tendency in price that occurred a little while ago. </para>

                        <para>- On the part of the buyers. In my opinion that is. hardly the true explanation of the price fluctuations which have occurred. In any case, the graziers are justified in looking to the national parliament to take some step to ensure the orderly marketing of their wool, seeing that the solvency of the nation depends to a large extent on the price obtained for this commodity. According to figures published some little time ago in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> Australia would have been £7,500,000 better off this year had our wool-growers received a proper price for their wool. In the present economic condition of the country it is surely beyond argument that everything possible should be done to stabilize the wool market. Our climatic conditions are such that we can grow first class wool in Australia, and it is surely not too much to ask of the national Parliament that it shall provide a sound marketing scheme. </para>

                <para>Many people in the community who are in close touch with the wool market were surprised by the recent operations of the Japanese wool-buyers. I suppose that the Bradford operators were as surprised as any one else. Not much information was available in Australia about the actual requirements of other countries, and it seems to me that we could do a great deal to stabilize the position by constituting a proper authority to collect information of this nature. For instance, if it were known that, certain countries required a large quantity of our lowest quality of spinning wool at a certain period, we could market the wool accordingly. Properly tabulated information of this description would be invaluable to the graziers. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest, in the first place, that our Australian wool should be properly classified. When B.A.W.R.A. was inaugurated, Australian wool was scarcely classified at all, but B.A.W.R.A. eventually made nearly 1,000 different classes. This was all to the advantage of the wool-growers. I would also advise that a general pooling system should be provided in accordance with the proposals made to the Prime Minister by a recent deputation which waited upon him in Melbourne in connexion with this subject. Certain countries require certain qualities of wool at different periods of the year. A judicious and proper handling of our wool by competent  authorities would enable us to supply these requirements. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable member. 'One of the greatest mistakes ever made by Australian wool-growers was to allow that scheme to lapse. But it is of no use for us to cry about that. In my opinion the situation which faces us to-day is just as desperate as that which called B.A.W.R.A. into being. Consequently, I appeal to the Government to give some consideration to the advisableness of taking steps to establish some similar organization. If that is done the manipulators of Australian wool will not next year get the rake-off from our clip that they got this year. </para>

                <para>It is regrettable that certain firms which had never previously operated on the Australian wool market purchased large quantities of wool this year with the object of overcoming the difficult exchange position that has been created. They made the purchasing of wool an indirect means of setting their money out of the country, lt is not fair that the primary producers should be made the cat's-paw of financiers. This industry is of supreme importance to the nation. In the past there has been a striving on the part of certain people to get the biggest possible profit out of the products of our pastoralists and graziers. Such people have secured far more than their fair share of the wealth in circulation. That situation should not be allowed to exist. We should encourage our primary producers to take steps to obtain the full value of their products. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Killen)</inline> has brought under notice a subject which merits the earnest consideration of all the Parliaments in the Commonwealth. Our taxation methods should be revised so that the burden will fall equitably on all classes of the community. It is extremely important that our lands should be valued according to a uniform system which has relation to productivity. I trust that the Government will take some steps to give effect to these proposals. If an equitable system of taxation were enforced, our primary producers would be encouraged to persevere in even these difficult days; but at present it appears as if everything possible is being done to discourage them. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the remarks of the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Killen)</inline> and, to some extent also, the remarks of the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibbons).</inline> There is no doubt that in many cases our land tax assessments are inequitable. Increases have recently been made in certain assessments in spite of the generally admitted fact that land values have fallen tremendously in the last twelve months. Rightly or wrongly the graziers and farmers feel that the Government valuers must have been instructed to try to get the utmost taxation by means of revaluations. One case, which came under my notice recently, is that of a man who farms and grazes some 1,600 acres. For federal taxation purposes, the valuation of his land has been increased by some £850. That is an extraordinary and unjustifiable action at a time when the earning capacity of all kinds of land has fallen tremendously. The time is ripe for the Government to consider seriously the advisability of having only one body of valuers for assessing land values for taxation purposes - Federal, State, and, possibly, municipal. At present we have three bodies of valuers making different assessments, and it frequently happens that those assessments vary for Federal, State, and municipal purposes. </para>

                </continue><para>I wish to refer briefly to what has been said to-night by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> whose remarks were supported by the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Keane),</inline> in regard to the tremendous importance of fostering the tourist traffic in Australia, particularly the traffic from overseas. I do not think that we in Australia sufficiently realize the great importance of that tourist traffic as a factor in bringing about a favorable trade balance. Some countries depend to an enormous extent upon their external tourist traffic for balancing the national ledger. It was mentioned this afternoon  by the right honorable member for Cowper that Canada obtained each year from tourists visiting that country a revenue of £60,000,000. The United States of America obtains from external tourist traffic an amount in excess of the value of the iron and steel industry of that great industrial country. These figures are startling, and should make us realize the extent to which the national solvency of some countries depends upon their tourist traffic. It may be said that we are too far away from the world's stream of tourist traffic to profit by it; but it must be remembered that New Zealand is just as far away from the great centres of tourist population as is Australia, and yet New Zealand obtains £6,000,000 each year from that source, while we obtain only £2,000,000. Great Britain, Italy, France, Switzerland, Japan, and many other countries obtain huge revenues from tourist traffic, and we can do a great deal more than we have done in the past in trying to divert part of that stream of traffic to Australia. It is true that we are doing something in that direction. It is being very well done, I believe, by an organization that was set up some two or three years ago - the Australian National Travel Association. The then Commonwealth Government gave that association the modest sum of £5,000 or £6,000, but that amount has since been added to by subscriptions - some of them fairly large - from the shipping companies, the railway departments of the various States, hotel interests, municipalities, and private individuals who are interested in tourist trade. I understand that the association has set itself to expend £100,000 :.n the first five years in advertising the attractions of Australia from the  points  of view of scenery and investment. The Australian National Travel Association has established trained journalists in Great Britain and America. These men know Australia well, and they are doing their best to interest the people of those two countries in Australia. One important fact which came under my notice in respect of the Canadian tourist traffic is that it is calculated that out of every ten visitors to Canada one of them either becomes an investor in the country, or decides to reside there permanently. It is quite possible that if we could divert a larger portion of the world tourist traffic to Australia a considerable number of tourists, who are at present mildly interested in us, would remain here, or become investors in our industries. There are four prominent Australians connected with the Australian National Travel Association, indeed they form its executive. The  chairman  is the Victorian  chairman  of the Railways Commissioners, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clapp.</inline> The ship ping interests are represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dowdell,</inline> the Australian manager of the Orient Line. The hotel and accomodation interests are represented by the proprietor crf a large Melbourne hotel, and the commercial interests are represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones,</inline> of David Jones and Company, Sydney. The Australian National Travel Association has already done something to attract to Australia tourists who would otherwise have gone elsewhere. When we examine the possibilities in that direction, we come to the conclusion that the publicists who have been sent to Great Britain and America, are working in a field in which there is great scope for their activities. We are told that some 500,000 citizens of America leave that country each year to tour the world. If we could obtain only one in twenty of those 500,000 tourists, and if each of them could be induced to stay sufficiently long in Australia to spend, say, £300, which is not a large sum for some of the wealthy Americans to spend, it would leave in Australia £7,500,000, an amount practically equal to the average sum obtained annually by our export of butter. If we could attract to Australia an equal number of tourists from Great Britain and other countries, that would raise the revenue from the tourist traffic to £15,000,000. Again, if we could induce, say, 10,000 of our wealthy Australians, who to-day go overseas to tour Europe and other countries, to see Australia first, and to spend here the money which they would otherwise spend in steamer fares, hotel charges and transport overseas, our tourist revenue would increase by another £5,000,000. That would mean a total of £20.000,000 added to the value of our present tourist traffic. I do not say for one moment that we could expect to increase all at once our revenue from £2,000,000 to £20,000,000; but I believe that in a short time, with an efficient organization, we might obtain a tourist revenue of at least £10,000,000. The exchange position should assist us both in retaining our own tourists who are inclined to go abroad, and in attracting overseas tourists to Australia, in which country £100 in British money will buy £130 10s. worth of Australian travel and hotel accommodation. It is expected that the Sydney harbour bridge will be completed next year. That wonderful engineering work will, no doubt, attract overseas visitors. We should do everything within our power to induce tourists to come to this country and to prolong their stay. I strongly support what was said this afternoon by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> He suggested that the Government could do a great deal by prevailing on the State authorities to exempt vessels which are purely tourist ships, from the payment of the heavy port duties that are now levied, and by exempting them from light dues, which are levied by the Commonwealth Navigation Department. If it were less costly for overseas tourists vessels to berth in our ports, they might stay here for some weeks, or perhaps months. That would have a big effect in inducing tourists to expend more money in Australia. Every pound in the pocket of a tourist from overseas, which is spent in Australia is, so far as our trade balance is concerned, equivalent to an Australian export of that value. Scenery is one of the few things which we sell and yet retain, and sell again. On the other hand, every pound that is spent by our own people on sight-seeing and accommodation within Australia, and which would otherwise have gone overseas, is equivalent to a sale of our own goods instead of an importation of overseas goods, when we examine it from the trade balance view-point. I appeal to the Government to do its utmost to remove any obstacles in the way of an increase in our tourist traffic. We have beautiful scenery, and we are rapidly providing better roads all over Australia. The roads in Victoria are extraordinarily good as compared with what they were a few years ago, and easy access has now been given to many of our beauty spots which were previously unapproachable except by foot or in saddle. The improvement in our roads has brought the beauty spots of Australia within reach of any one travelling luxuriously in a motor car. I strongly support the remarks of the right honorable member for Cowper and the honorable member for Bendigo in regard to this matter and hope that the Government will give to it the attention it deserves. </para></speech>

                    <para>.- i endorse what has been said by the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Killen)</inline> and the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson),</inline> in regard to the land tax assessments and the effect which the high valuations and the taxation they entail must have on the land industries. A few days ago the Treasurer when speaking of the sacrifices which the present depression was entailing on various sections of the community mentioned particularly the primary producers, and said that land values had fallen 50 per cent. That statement was made when the honorable gentleman was booming a proposal for a fiduciary currency, and how he can reconcile it with the assessments now being issued by the Taxation Department is beyond my comprehension. It is one of those contortions which only a politician df his long experience could perform. The heavy land taxation is having a serious effect on the wool industry, which is the biggest industry in Australia. I have perused the accounts of many sheep stations during the last twelve months; in all instances the expenditure has had to be reduced from 50 to 60 per cent., and in respect of at least three of twelve stations that I particularly remember the taxation is a bigger item than wages and general working expenses combined. Assessments on the present scale when land values have, on the testimony of the Treasurer, fallen 50 per cent, is unjust and also very bad business for the nation. What I have said of the wool industry applies in a slightly less degree to wheat. I understand that tentative estimates regarding the area to be seeded for wheat this year have been received by the Statistician for transmission overseas. They indicate that the area under wheat will be reduced by approximately 5,000,000 acres. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Assuming that the reduction will he mainly in respect of lands of lower productive capacity, it means a lessening of the possible production of wealth during the next twelve months by from £3,000,000 to £5,000,000. One of the factors which is making it very difficult for farmers to raise money to seed their land and buy fertilizers is the heavy taxation which is being levied on assessments which the Treasurer has declared to be 50 per cent, above the actual value of the land. "While endorsing the protests against the excessive land taxation, I dissent from the views expressed by the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibbons)</inline> regarding the control of wool so that it may be held off the market in order to secure a better price. </para>

                        <para>- I understood the honorable member to say that with a more orderly system of marketing it would have been possible to prevent the rake-off which dealers enjoyed this year through being able to buy cheaply the wool that was marketed early. To-day wool is the only Australian commodity the price of which is showing an upward tendency. In that respect it is in marked contrast to wheat. The Treasurer speaking in Adelaide on Tuesday said that he had received a cablegram from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Harvey, of the Bank of England, in which he predicted an improvement in the prices for all primary products, except wheal;. The Bank of England lias a very fine service of research for estimating the yields and price prospects of commodities in various parts of the world. Wheat is at a disadvantage as compared with wool in that for a long time it has been the victim of attempts to control marketing when prospects appeared to be favorable for a rise. That has not been done by merely a few organizations; similar action . in a desultory way has been taken in many countries. As a result there is a big carry-over of wheat all over the world. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and that is one of the consequences of holding wheat off the market. Prices were kept at a level higher than the economic position justi fied, and that induced still further production. Thus the industry became more and more entangled. Wool, on the other hand, has nearly always been sold when it was ready for the market, if there was a genuine demand for it for manufacturing purposes. </para>

                        <para>- Not during the war, but even under Bawra control so long as there was a genuine demand the new season's clip was not held back. The most valuable service performed by Bawra was in controlling and gradually feeding on to the market the large quantity of wool that had been commandeered during the war and not used because it was not suitable for war-time manufacture. If there was no demand for the accumulated wool it was not offered. But the only attempt in recent years to control the marketing has been by delaying the offerings when the demand was poor. Because of that there is to-day practically no carry-over of wool and prices are showing an upward tendency. The wool industry is in a more hopeful position than the wheat industry, and Australia is likely to have at the end of this year a record number of sheep. On the other hand, there is a possibility that the acreage sown to wheat will be reduced by nearly 5,000,000 acres. Prom that setback the industry will take some time to recover. </para>

                <para>I regard with absolute fear any scheme for price fixation or starving of the wool market. I agree with the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibbons)</inline> that there are other directions in which the marketing system may be improved, and the information available to growers increased. He indicated some admirable avenues for progress and nothing but good could come from their successful exploration. But I believe that attempts to maintain prices artificially by holding wool off the market will be as disastrous to the wool industry as they have been to other industries. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not, but it did prevent the big accumulation of wool from causing the market to collapse. It only offered contributions from the carryover when the market was able to absorb  them. Most of the wool with -which I have been, concerned this year was sold when prices were low, and it is because wool has been quoted- in- that way that market prospects have improved. Unless the wool- is sold when it is ready for market, there is likely to be the same uncertainty as in connexion with rubber, metals, and other commodities, in respect of which- there has1 been a general and fairly successful control of marketing. The rubber industry furnishes the classic example of the evil effects of pride control. In the heyday of the rubber trade that control was probably more complete than that of any other commodity. I read the following cablegram in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 23rd April- </para>

                    <para>London. April 21. - Rubber fell to-day to- n new record low price of 2-18/10ths per lb. on the London Exchange. This is 1/lGth lower than yesterday. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> month ago the price was 3-7/Stiis. and a year ago 74.

                <para>Under control the price' was raised to several shillings per lb. and the industry has been brought practically to bankruptcy by over-production stimulated on that account. Australia would probably have been a great deal better off than it is to-day if the price of wool had not risen so high during the brilliantly successful period of B.A.W.R.A.'s administration. Those increased prices, probably more than anything else, were responsible for the increased wool output of South Africa, Argentine and the United States of America. Elaborate schemes for pricefixing, or rigid control,' can lead only to ultimate disaster to the wool-producing industry, as it has spelt ruin to the rubber industry, and has led to the serious difficulties experienced in the wheat industry. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to refer to a matter which may appear to be of little importance ; but, if prompt action is not taken, the practice adopted may have, serious consequences. I have in mind the activities of the Munitions Supply Department in entering into trade in competition with the commercial world. Personally,; I would have preferred to see the tariff debate continued to-night, because a series of irritating and perplexing schedules have been brought down, which, together with the sales tax, have caused dislocation of business and hand-to-mouth- buying and manufacturing, with consequent increased unemployment. When a government department enters into competition with private business firms which are already harassed and over-taxed, it is, to say the least of it, distinctly unfair. I admit that this practice has been followed under various governments, but the evil has greatly increased under the regime of the present Ministry. </para>

                <para>In response to deputations from motor body builders,- I asked' the previous Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> itf iti was fact that the Munitions Supply Department was making motor bodies in- competition with private manufacturers, and I was informed that certain truck bodies only had been built by that department. Nevertheless, work to the value of £1,500 has been carried out for a company that has American headquarters. That company should have placed its business in the hands of private firms. We all know that a government department can quote almost any price in order to secure trade, and it can force other firms out of business, thus increasing unemployment. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member knows full well that whenever a government department undertakes work that properly belongs to a private firm, it makes a mess of it. One need only recall the failure of the Commonwealth  Government  Shipping Line. Although such activities may he permissible during a time of national crisis, such as war, the sooner government departments go out of business of this kind the better it is for the community. The reason advanced for the building of motor bodies by a government department is that the Government has a number of skilled men in its employ, and desires to find work for them. I admit that something may be said in favour of that argument, but those men should not be kept in employment at the expense of the business community. The department which rolls sheet brass has probably the only mills capable  Of  doing that class of work. A previous government always insisted on a certificatefrom outside firms that the work undertaken by the department could not be done by outside firms, but the present Government has altered that procedure. The Munitions Supply Department is now rolling sheet brass for outside firms, and the Government has appointed a private firm as agents for the products of the department. How much further does the Government intend to interfere with the business community? </para>

                        <para>- No. Why did not the Government appoint agents for the government clothing factory and the Lithgow small arms factory? I do not suggest that Noyes Brothers is not a reputable firm; they arc, undoubtedly, capable of doing the work; but I object to the principle involved. The department could make sure of selling all its products, and obtaining the best possible price, without appointing an outside agent. The Government might as well appoint an agent for the Commonwealth Railways, or any other Commonwealth activity. The department could simply announce that sheet brass would be sold at a certain price for spot cash, and was purchasable at the works. It is unnecessary to send the commodity to the cities, and pay a firm a commission on the sale of it. I urge the Minister to investigate this matter with a view to minimizing government trading. The hands of the Government should be fairly full, since it tries to fool the public with its policy for a fiduciary currency to make ends meet. Already for this year there is a deficit amounting to £20,000,000, and further business ventures will only aggravate the situation. </para>
