      <para>Mr.SCULLIN (Yarra- Prime Minister &#91;2.32&#93;. - It is with very deep regret that . I announce that the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. P.G. Stewart)</inline> died last night. He was with us only last week. We knew that he had long suffered a physical ailment, but to those of us who came into close contact with him lately, he appeared in better health than he had enjoyed for some years, and to have recovered some of his old-time vigour. Therefore, the news of his sudden death caused a shock to everyone of us. How bravely he bore his physical disabilities is known to thosewho knew him intimately. He stuck to his work when many a man would have given in; he carried out his duties tohisconstituency and to the country at largewith unflagging zeal. I think that every member of this Parliament could claim him as a friend. </para>
      <para>The parliamentary career of the late honorable gentleman reflects creditupon him and upon the legislatures of which he was a member. He was first elected to represent Swan Hill ins the Legislative Assembly of Victoria in 1917. Two years later he entered this Parliament as member for Wimmera, and he represented that constituency continuously until his death. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Stewart</inline> held office as Minister for Works andRailways, and was  President  of the River Murray Waters Commission from the 9th February, 1923, to the 5th August, 1924. It was. his privilege to turn the first sodin connexion with the laying of the foundations of this Parliament House. By every one of us he was recognized as an. excellent debater, bringing to bear on. every subject a keen analytical mind, and never speaking unless he had something; worth while to contribute to the debate. Many a shrewd and forceful blow hestruck in political warfare, but never a foul one. He was an energetic man. despite his illness, and was ever ready to promote the cause of the primary producers, whom he specially represented in. this Parliament. He served the public in many ways, and set a fine example to his fellow citizens, both in and out of Parliament. Apart from his merits asa public man, he had personal qualifications which won for him the respect and admiration, and even the affection, of all who knew him intimately.  His  death is a national loss, and a great personal loss to each one of us. This chamber will know him no more; but. though men may come and men may go, few will leave such a lasting impression in the hearts and minds of the members of this Parliament as the gentleman whose passing we mourn to-day.

          <para>.- I second the motion which has been so eloquently moved by the Prime Minister, and desire to associate all the members of the Country party, which has been  bbereft  of the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart,</inline> with <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> expression of sympathy with his &#34;widow. We deplore the loss which his death has caused to the councils of this nation, and especially the councils of the country movements. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart</inline> was an outstanding country figure. Ho was one of the founders of t&#34;he Country party in both the Victorian and federal spheres, and a pioneer member of it in the Victorian and Commonwealth Parliaments. With burning eloquence, which was expressive of his personal experience of the hardships that are life along the frontiers of civilization, he organized the pioneers of the Mallee, and brought their plight before his colleagues in Parliament, and the public of Australia, in a way that has never been equalled.  His  home farm at Carwarp was tin object lesson to his neighbours. It was d model property, on which cultural experiments were conducted by the Department of Agriculture, with a , view to demonstrating to the farmers in the district the results that could be achieved &#34;by the adoption of scientific methods. The physical ailment from which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart</inline> suffered for many years- would have deterred an ordinary man from entering public life, but his indomitable will pud energy drove his frail body to bear the strain of travelling, public speaking, and research, which would have killed one of  less spirit and resolution. &#39;I had the  privilege of being his colleague in  Cabinet and in the Country party, and his  partner in private business. In all his activities he displayed great vigour of mind, a quick intelligence, and a broad outlook, and always he had the courage of his convictions.. Every one who knew him personally, and all in the country who knew him by repute, will recognize that the rural interests of Australia have lost a champion, this Parliament an orator, and the nation at large a distinguished an indefatigable servant. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to associate the members of the United Australia Party with the motion and the sentiments expressed by the two previous speakers. Being a comparatively new member of this Parliament, I had not the privilege of a long acquaintance with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart,</inline> but in the last two years I learned to respect his great ability as a parliamentary representative, and developed an affection for him, because of his charm and outstanding personality. Our late colleague has given  his life in the service of his country. Against heavy physical handicaps he was indefatigable in serving those whom he specially represented in this Parliament, and the Commonwealth as a whole. An outstanding characteristic of the honorable member was his detestation of the display of personal bitterness in the debates of Parliament or on the platforms of the country. Although today his voice is stilled, the precepts that he preached, and the example that he set, remain with us, and I hope may influence us in the future. He rendered great service to his district and his country. </para>

          <para>. - I sincerely associate myself with the remarks that have been made concerning the late member for Wimmera, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> G. Stewart, Like the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> I am a comparatively new member of this Parliament; but I learned to respect the opinions and outlook of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart</inline> from my early association with him.  His  outlook on political questions, having regard to the corner of the House in which he sat, was rather unusual. I say that with no intention of disparaging honorable members who &#39;belong to the Country party, for, after all, I suppose that our views are moulded largely by our&#39; circumstances. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart&#39;s</inline> attitude towards the wants of rural districts and the needs of struggling farmers was similar to that of others of us towards the wants and requirements of the industrial movement and the trade unionists of this country. I have been told that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart,</inline> in his early life, had a severe struggle to make both ends meet, and, doubtless, therefore, understood to the fullest extent, the troubles and difficulties of the great mass of the people. He was able, I am sure, to impress upon the people in the rural districts that, after all, their interests and those whom I represent in an industrial constituency, were identical, that the forces with which they had to contend were similar. Every speech that he made in this House impressed me with the fact that he realized that the rural workers could not obtain redress unless they organized and formed themselves into an association similar to that of &#39; the trade unions, and thus became able to demand from the forces, which really control this country, proper consideration for  their circumstances. For that reason I have always liked to hear his views on important subjects, and I, and those who are associated with me at the moment, held him in the highest respect. We mourn his loss as other honorable members do. He was a valuable asset to this Commonwealth, and particularly helpful to those who live in its country districts. </para>

          <para>.- As a Victorian colleague of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart</inline> I express my deep personal regret at his unexpected and untimely death. Only last Saturday I travelled to Melbourne in his company, and he was then, apparently, in his normal state of health. I little thought at the time that we should never meet again. I knew him for some years before he entered the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Federal Parliament in 1919. He was reared in a very hard school of experience, and, no doubt, that had much to do with his being ever sympathetic with those whose lives, too, were hard. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> man knew better than he the difficulties and problems of the men and the women of the Mallee, whom he more particularly represented; none could speak so convincingly on their behalf as he. As one who differed from him on certain questions during the period when he <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> estranged from the party to which I belong, the removal of those differences and his re-entry to the party gave me the greatest personal satisfaction. His health was never robust, but, as has been said, his will was indomitable, and carried him through on many occasions when he was really physically unfit. His voice will be missed from the debates in this House. His speeches were original, arresting, and, indeed, often picturesque, as well as full of practical knowledge and common sense. As the Prime Minister has said, his place in this House will, for many reasons, be difficult to fill. I deeply deplore his early death, and join in the expression of regret contained in the motion of the Prime Minister. </para>

          <para>. - I, too, associate myself with the motion before the House. By the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart</inline> Australia has lost one of its noblest sons, and to his widow goes out the sympathy, not only of this chamber, but also of the whole nation. He was a shining light and a model of behaviour; but with his greatness he was at all times humble. He was straight, honest, and full of sympathy, particularly for the class from which he had sprung. In far away Central Australia to-day, the people will mourn the loss of the  Hon.  P. G. Stewart. To him they gave the credit for having brought the railway line which links that lonely out-  post of civilization with the rest of Australia, and which to-day means so much to them.  His  memory will ever be revered in the far-flung spaces in the remote cen&#62;tre of the continent. In all things affecting the welfare of the people of the Northern Territory the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart</inline> was my adviser and mentor. &#39; When I spoke in this House on matters affectingmy constituents, . I always knew and felt that there was at least one honorable member in this chamber who understood and sympathized with me in my efforts to improve their conditions. He was a fearless fighter, and at all times a clean fighter. He commanded the admiration of all who knew him. He has now passed over the Great Divide, but his spirit will remain to remind us of what the Great Creator intended all men to be. On the other side, be will be greeted with- the words, &#34; Well done, thou good and faithful servant.&#34; </para>

He was aman who had the courage of his convictions, who was not afraid to allow hip convictionsto cost him something. He did not offer sacrifices which cost him nothing. </para>
        <para>I found the. late honorable member one of the soundest counsellors I have met in this House.  His  interests and concern were not confined to the welfare of the Wimmera district; he had a keen interest in the development and advancement of his native country us a whole. As the right honorable member forCowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has indicated, be spent much time and money in agricultural experiments with the object of increasing the production of wheat. The valuable and unselfish work which be performed in this way was recognized by the Government of Victoria,and field days were held to enable surrounding farmers to profit by the experience thus gained. The remarks which have fallen to-day from the lips of the chief citizen of Australia, the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> as well as from those other honorable members who have spoken, are evidence of the genuine feeling of this House, andwill,I feel sure, prove some consolation to the wounded spirit, of his wife. </para>
