                <para>I wish to say that this report results from the visit made by the Australian trade delegation to India, Burma and Ceylon late in 1985 and early in 1936. The delegationwas a combination of business men representing secondary and primary industries, with an ofScer of the Federal Department of Commerce. Its report is an excellent example of the results which can be achieved by such a form of collaboration. It is a most valuable document, containing authoritative information on a great variety of matters which will be of the utmost assistance to Australian producers and manufacturers who are anxious to secure markets in the countries visited by the delegation. The members of the delegation are to be congratulated on the thoroughness with which they have compiled their report, which will be regarded for many years as a text-book on trade opportunities in countries which, while close to Australia, have heretofore been inadequately exploited as markets for Australian products. </para>

                    <para>.- In seconding the motion, I regret that so much delay has occurred in the presentation of the report, and in the making of any reference to the subject of the delegation in this Parliament. As a matter of fact, the. season will be commencing at about the present time, and any action arising out of the report which the. Australian industries concerned or the Government might contemplate taking should have been taken in time to admit of this: season's trading operations being conducted. Unfortunately, there appears, to be too much delay generally between the submission of reports to the Government and the notification to Parliament of their having been received. There is also much longer and graver delay in connexion with the consequential action which usually the Government evidently intends to take. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - The following is a <inline font-style="italic">resume</inline> of the available information in regard to the missing Monospar Croydon aircraft :  - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Australian representative for thu Monospar firm, Mr. H. Rigby, telephoned to the civil aviation authorites about4 p.m. yesterday, stating that the Monospar had not been heard of since 7.50 a.m. A message from Darwin stated that the last message was to the effect that the Monospar's latest known posi- tion was 460 miles from Darwin on its course. No further word was received of the aircraft, but additional messages covering the above were later received from Darwin. This information indicated that the aircraft would be approximately 70 miles from Koepang, and about 30 or 40 miles off the coast of Timor. The Air Force wireless telegraphy station at Darwin was then instructed to keep constant watch on 900 metres, the operating wave length of the Monospar. The Administrator, Darwin, also passed known information to the Department of the Interior and stated that the patrol boat <inline font-style="italic">Larrakia</inline> had been instructed to proceed to Koepang. Wireless and cable contact with Singapore, Sourabaya, Batavia,  Rambang  and Koepang was made, to ascertain if any news had been, received, but with negative results. At 10.50 a.m., Greenwich mean time, Darwin heard the Monospar calling on bearing 291 degrees from Darwin, and it was heard intermittently afterwards. This seems to indicate that the aircraft landed on Timor Island, to the east of Koepang, and apparently was not badly crashed as the wireless functioned. No information' has been received as to the condition of either the personnel or the aircraft. Attempts were then made to open up the Koepang wireless telegraphy station in order to obtain details of messages from the aircraft, which were unintelligible at Darwin, but, up to 6 a.m. to-day, Melbourne time, without result. </para>
                    <para>Messages were sent by cable to the Administrator. Koepang, containing available information, and requesting him to conduct investigations, and to the British Consul-General, Batavia, requesting him to do anything he could to facilitate an early search and to endeavour to have Koepang wireless station opened. Constant wireless telegraphy communication was maintained by the Royal Australian Air Force wireless station, Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, with the Air Ministry, London j Singapore; and Darwin. Information was received during the night by wireless telegraphy, that two Dutch flying-boats were to leave Singapore early this morning for Koepang, and that a Boya! Air Force flying-boat was _ to leave 'Singapore at dawn this morning in search of the missing Monospar. </para>
                    <para>The representative of the Monospar firm, the Royal Australian Air Force Staff Officer for Signals, and the Controller of Operations, Civil Aviation Board, were standing by in the wireless room at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, until 5.15 a.m. this morning. Up to that time, no further information from the Monospar had come- through. </para>
                    <para>This morning, the Royal Air Force, Singapore, advised that they were holding up the departure of their flying-boat, as the Dutch were leaving and were so much closer. </para>
                    <para>Koepang came on the air at 6 a.m. this morning, but had not heard the Monospar. </para>

That investigation is not yet complete, but I have every reason to believe that the manufacture of engines and other motor car parts will be successfully inaugurated at  ;i  relatively early date. </para>

That discussion did not disclose any very widespread desire to effect an alteration of the Covenant, and it closed with the possibility of the whole matter being referred to a sub-committee for further consideration. It is intended that a full opportunity for the discussion of the matter in this House shall be provided as soon as certain urgent bills which are now on the notice-paper have been disposed of. </para>

                            <para>- They are made persistently only by persons ignorant of the conditions. It is unnecessary and impracticable to place Commonwealth products before the public in all parts of the United Kingdom. "We must recognize that Australia supplies only a small part of the foodstuffs consumed in Great Britain, and it would be folly to advertise our goods all over the United Kingdom, when we can supply only a small part of the market. The policy of the trade section of the Department of Commerce in Great Britain is to advertise sufficiently in those areas which will ensure that the full quantity of goods sent will be absorbed, but not to advertise in order to create a demand in centres which cannot be supplied. I challenge Mr. Sanders or anybody else to put forward a better policy. </para>

The point which the honorable member raises is one of great importance, but, as I tried to impress upon the House, it is impracticable. The position is actually very different from what  the honorable gentleman assumes. </para>

                        <para>- In reply to the first part of the question, I believe that there has been a moderate increase of alien migration figures since economic conditions have somewhat improved. In the great majority of instances, the migrants are close relatives, such as wives and children, of people who are already in Australia. Great precautions are taken to ensure that aliens entering Australia will not displace those persons who a rr already in employment here. In most cases, the nominator is the prospective employer of the alien nominee, and unless he can show to the satisfaction of the Department of the Interior that in employing new aliens, no one will be displaced from employment, permission is not granted to the nominees to enter. </para>

                        <para>.- Honorable members were much interested last night by a speech which the honorable member for Darling. Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> delivered on this bill, which dealt with the question whether, in fixing the amount of grant proposed to be voted from any State, regard should be had for all the disabilities which a State suffered. The honorable member adopted a contention made on page 68 of the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, that even if regard were paid to the disabilities which the States suffered, mainly through the tariff, such disabilities were balanced by the benefits which they received through the allocation of Commonwealth moneys. The figures set out on page 68 of the report seek to establish that the claimant States have received substantial benefits. It is stated that the people resident in Tasmania, for example; have received an advantage of nearly £1 a head as between the Commonwealth and the State. The argument in support of this contention is very plausible and I noticed that it was apparently accepted by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> who nodded his head during the honorable member's speech, and also by several honorable members who seem disposed to cavil at the amount of the grants to be made to the States. An examination of the position will not bear out the view enunciated by the commission. The commission sets out that the adverse effects of Commonwealth policy in respect of "Western Australia aggregate £1,188,000, while the benefits to it in the allocation of Commonwealth moneys amount to £1,117,000 showing a nominal disadvantage to "Western Australia of £71,000. The report states that those figures are compiled from data supplied in the claim presented to the commission by the Government of Western Australia. The claim made by the State Government, however, was simply in respect of excess costs, which, it was calculated, the people of "Western Australia had to pay in consequence of the operation of the Commonwealth policy of protection. A balance was made between the cost of Australian goods and the estimated cost of similar goods if imported from Great Britain; but the commission was fair enough to admit that possibly many items could be obtained at a lower cost from other countries than Great Britain. I wish to remind the House, however, that the disadvantage to Western Australia through the operation of the Commonwealth policy of protection is not to be measured merely by the excess price which the people of that State have to pay for their goods. That is only one factor. To my mind a far greater loss has been inflicted onWestern Australia, because of the loss of factories and other secondary industries which were operating successfully there prior to the consummation of federation. If those industries had been able to maintain operations during the period of federation, with the moderate tariff protection that was in operation in 1900, they would no doubt have continued to develop, and other industries would also have been established ; but because of the limited market available in Western Australia, the industries I have in mind were not so well organized as similar industries in the eastern States. It is all very well to speak of the beneficial effects of competition, but it has been established again and again that certain manufacturing concerns operating in the eastern States sell their goods for a lower price in Western Australia than in the States in which they are manufactured., the object being, of course, to crush the </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Western Australia industries. That, in my opinion., is unfair competition. If Western Australia had been able to continue the tariff that was in operation at the time of Federation, it would have been in a far better position to-day than it is. The people of the eastern States admittedly pay more for some locally manufactured goods than they would have to pay for similar imported goods, but they pay cheerfully because they believe that the advantages of our national policy of protection more than outweigh its disadvantages. That argument has often been advanced by protectionists in this Parliament. I have often heard the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> speak on this subject, and he has visualized hundreds of factories growing, up  like mushrooms and providing employment for our people. Unfortunately that is not true of Western Australia. The excess cost of the goods our people have to buy is not by any means such a great disadvantage as the loss of their factories. Last year, the people of Western Australia bought from the eastern States goods to the value of £11,000,000, but the people of the eastern States bought Western Australia goods to the value of only £1,000,000. That position has arisen because we have free trade  within  Australia, but protection against manufacturers of other countries. </para>

                            <para>- I remind the  honorable  member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> of the situation in Victoria at the time of Federation, when the population was about the same as the population of Western Australia to-day. Under the policy of protection with which the people of Victoria were at that time enamoured, substantial manufacturing industries had been established although the conditions may have been somewhat uneconomic1. That would be the position of Western Australia to-day if it were able- to free itself from Commonwealth policy and adopt its own customs procedure. At present, although we pay extra for the goods which we buy from the eastern States, we do- not enjoy the compensating advantage which comes to people of the eastern States who also pay more for their goods than they would pay for similar imported products. The idea hai been expressed in other words. If we buy our goods abroad, we have the goods and our suppliers have our money, but if we make the goods within our own country, we have both the goods and the money. That is a summary of the policy of protection so favoured by the honorable member for Fawkner, but I do not think he should deny to Western Australia the advantage of a policy WhICh proved so effective in Victoria years ago. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>Another disadvantage to Western Australia of our national policy of protection is that it deprives us of the opportunity to do profitable business with such countries as the Netherlands East Indies, Ceylon, and Java, which are in close proximity to us, and with which, if w were free agents, we could establish profitable trading relations. Under our Australian system, these countries may buy our goods, but Ave exclude their goods from our shores. We are therefore not in a position to trade on reasonable terms with our best customers. Our worst traders are, of course, the people of the eastern States. Considering the subject from the purely local angle and not from the broad Australian point -of - view, protection is a good thing for the eastern States but a bad thing- for Western Australia. Whilst I am prepared to admit that we- should consider the greater and wider interests- of the people of Australia and accept the policy of protection, I claim that it involves the adoption of a compensating principle. We in Western Australia should not have to pay the extra cost of goods and also suffer the loss of our factories and local industries without some compensating advantage. </para><para>The Commonwealth Grants Commission clearly recognized the position of tha claimant States., It admits, that the burden of the tariff falls very severely on each of the claimant States. In this respect, it points out that Western Australia produces a very much greater proportion of goods which might be described as unsheltered goods, than <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> the other States, and <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> concludes that on that ground. Western Australia is entitled to much greater consideration than either of the two other States. </para><para>A third, and perhaps equally important, ground on which all three States, and particularly Western Australia, are entitled to claim compensation from the Commonwealth is that the policy of protection, adopted as a national policy, had the effect of forcing them as outside States to adopt the policy of encouraging primary industry. Factories in those States were closed as the result of the  breaking  down of internal tariff barriers and there was nothing left for them to do  but  to resort to the development of primary industries, such as wheat and dairying. They did this, and in order to do it, they were obliged to borrowheavily. </para><interjection>

The fact remains, however., that the three outside States wore forced into this position. The Commonwealth at the same time pursued a policy of encouraging the manufacturing industries, and thus during almost the whole of the period since federation two systems of protection have been operating concurrently - the one applied by the Commonwealth which required no capital, but was simply a policy of tariff protection, and the other, that forced on the States, that of protecting primary production by means of borrowed money. The Commonwealth Grants Commission discusses this position at considerable length on pages 36 and 37 of its report under the heading of "Problems of State Development." It refers at length to the necessity for these two systems, and says - </para>

                            <para>- Strangely enough, that calculation agrees with the estimate mad? by a commission in 1926 which estimated that Queensland was the greatest  benefac-  tor and Western Australia the greatest loser from the tariff policy of the Commonwealth. I mention these facts to show that if Queensland were in a position similar to that of Western Australia, honorable members from that State would be heard very much on this matter, and would probably make claims on behalf of Queensland higher than -those which are now being made by honorable members on behalf of Western Australia. Disabilities have, from the first, been recognized as the proper basis upon which grants to the States should be calculated. Since the inception of these grants, all governments have adopted that basis, and it is still accepted by this Government. </para>

                            <para>- That is true. But, in the meantime, Professor Giblin has been imported into the discussions of the Grants Commission. In 1930, that gentleman prepared the "Case for Tasmania." Of course, it did not suit Tasmania to base it3 claims on the ground of disabilities; it was then in a position to get better results by relying on a basis of needs, and for that reason, apparently. Professor Giblin evolved his basis of needs. </para>

                            <para>- I think it was evolved first by Professor Giblin in his " Case for Tasmania ". At any rate, that was the genesis of the doctrine of needs, and through his subsequent appointment to the Grants Commission Professor Giblin was able to influence the other commissioners to adopt this basis as the proper method of deciding these claims. Incidentally, it did not adopt as a basis the needs of the community; it adopted the needs of the State government, and it fixed its standard of governmental needs as one which would enable a State to function on a level not appreciably below that of another State. My first objection to this basis is that it is in the nature of a dole. Before a State can qualify for it its government must be " hard up ". The ground of the claim is thus one of poverty, and not one of right; but Western Australia claims that it is entitled to com pensation as a matter of right, as compensation for losses which it suffers through federation.- That State accepted federation as being in the general  interests  of the Commonwealth, and surely when it asks for compensation for losses suffered by reason of that fact its claim on that ground should 'be heard. </para>

Comparing the grants to Tasmania and Western Australia during the last two years, we find that the grant to Tasmania this year will be £600,000, or an increase of £150,000 over the grant to that State for the preceding year, whilst the grant to Western Australia this year represents a decrease of £300,000 compared with its grant for the preceding year. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I do not think so. I believe that Tasmania's losses would be truly represented by a larger stun. I bear in mind the fact that, at. the inception of federation, Tasmania, in comparison with the other States, occupied a much more important position than it does to-day. Ever since federation, it has stagnated, the best, of its young people have left it, its industries are restricted, its people are much poorer, and its economic conditions to-day are much worse than they were at the inception of federation. I believe that the main cause for all this is the fact that Tasmania is within the federation. South Australia is in a similar position. Before federation, it was one of the most prosperous parts of Australia. It had a considerable amount of established wealth, but, to-day, generally speaking, its prosperity has decreased. Of course this has been due somewhat to drought. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Commonwealth policy has forced South Australia to enlarge its wheat areas into marginal country; otherwise the State would have stagnated. If the high costs at present prevailing had not to be faced agrarian development in marginal districts might be carried on profitably. Those high costs have made farming operations in the marginal areas unprofitable. It is late now to blame the States for settling people on the land in those areas, because they were driven into nutting them there. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I did not join the secessionist movement in Western Australia. Although I took considerable political risk in the attitude which I adopted, I remained loyal to the Commonwealth, and I think I shall always do so; but I ask the Commonwealth to be loyal and fair to Western Australia. I believe that the grant of £500,000 proposed for this year does not represent fair compensation to that State for the disabilities suffered by it on account of federal policy. </para>

                            <para>- No, but there is a limit to honest stupidity. We must acknowledge the large amount of research undertaken by the commission and the erudition which characterizes its reports, but, in its latest report, it might, I think, have been more careful. Some members of the commission have contracted the habit, which is a growing one, of going abroad. Consequently, the report is premature. The commission prepared it on the basis of figures two years old. </para>

We had hoped that the Interstate Commission would be revived. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> in his policy speech, made a definite pronouncement, that the Government intended to reconstitute that body. This, of course, would' be a more suitable body than the present commission to deal with the claims of" the smaller States, and it would be guided by the principles set out in the Interstate Commission Act 1912. One of those principles is that the Interstate Commis-  sion should take into consideration the effect of the tariff on the financial stability of the States. That principle has been recognized by the Parliament and the Government itself, and if the Interstate Commission were reconstituted, it would inquire into the disabilities of the States due to the tariff. Of course, the smaller States mav be given something in the nature of an eleemosynarygift, but the underlying principle should be a desire to compensate them for disabilities caused by federal policy. The Australian Labour party has recognized the need for the recognition of this principle. The Leader of the Opposition quoted last evening the decision reached at a conference of the Australian Labour party to the effect that step3 should be taken to compensate the States for disabilities due to federation. The Government has already supported this policy. The Treasurer himself has written protesting - in a very mild way, however - against the Commonwealth Grants Commission adopting the policy of needs, pointing out the danger of taking that policy as the basis for compensation. He recognized how easy it would be for a profligate government to pile up a large deficit, because the more profligate it were,, the better chance it would have to secure a large grant from the Commonwealth. There is no doubt that if the Government of Western Australia this year spends money freely and increases its deficit, it will have a greater claim next year for a large grant. I notice that Tasmania has obtained an increase of its grant this year, to the amount of £600,000, largely because its Government has been extravagant. </para><interjection>

I hope that the Treasurer will not be influenced by what appears to be expedient. One of the advantages of having the services of such a commission is that it relieves the Government of the very unpleasant task of deciding between the claimant States, and the Government is in a satisfactory position in being able to say " There is the report of the commission and we will follow it whatever it is." It is admitted, however, that the Government disagrees with the principle adopted by the commission in framing its report. The Opposition also disagrees with that principle and I appeal to the Treasurer on this occasion to make the honorable choice between expediency and principle. Principle tells him that the commission is wrong. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I shall be interested to notice how the Minister executes his reverse, for his opinion is definitely set out in the report that the commission is not pursuing the proper course in applying the method of needs, and that he recommends the adoption of the old method of basing the grants on the disabilities of the States. When the measure was introduced for the appointment of this body, it was described as a disabilities commission. I well remember that the question was submitted to the former Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham, now Chief Justice of the High Court, as to whether the commission should consider needs as well as disabilities. The ex-Minister replied that the commission could very properly consider disabilities, although these were not the only matters to be taken into consideration. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but the commission refused to follow the advice. Its report, which runs into nearly 200 pages, is unnecessarily verbose. Much fruit is seldom found in an abundance of words. Western Australia would have appreciated a shorter report. The commission need not have indulged in mental gymnastics. It could have said in fewer words, "This State is already in deficit, and needs increased assistance. " </para>

                    </continue><para>Since the report of the commission was presented new circumstances have arisen which the commission could not have  foreseen. Western Australia is now suffering from a drought much worse than that of the last two years. The wheat industry is in a worse position than last year, and the plight of the wool-growers is disastrous. The clip is not half so great as in normal years and there has been very short lambing. Evidently the Treasurer of the State will have to find relief for settlers to prevent them from being thrown on the unemployed market. lt would be better to prevent the State from falling into a condition of bankruptcy by coming to its rescue immediately. Obviously the State authorities will, need further assistance from the Commonwealth. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> and the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> have apparently entered into a competition to see who could tell the most woeful and depressing story about the conditions obtaining in Western Australia, and 1 do not know to whom the prize should be handed. Yet their remarks are of concern to honorable members generally, because, when the files of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> are received in other countries, their speeches will prove a very bad advertisement for Australia. If their qualifications as representatives of their constituencies are adjudged by the facility with which they i el ate a story of depression, difficulty and hopelessness, it will be found that they are exceedingly well equipped. Their speeches remind, me of the gramophone record " Down on Misery Farm ". A determined effort to remove any little disability, due, not to federation, but to other causes, would soon place Western Australia in line with the more progressive 'States, with, the result that population would be attracted to it instead of being driven from it, industries would be established, and a stimulus would be given to the efforts of those who are endeavouring to make this country what it should be. The honorable members I have mentioned claim that the whole of the disabilities from which Western Australia suffers are due to the policy of protection, which was adopted by Australia to give employment to our people, develop our secondary industries, and provide an outlet for our raw materials. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Forrest commended the Government for the appointment of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, and said that members of that body would do what was right and equitable. Last year, he was pleased to adopt its recommendation, but to-day he criticizes it. because, after examining the finances of the State along similar lines, it has recommended a lower Commonwealth grant. There are States on the eastern seaboard which are as much entitled as is Western Australia, or any other State, to concessions from the Commonwealth for losses supposedly sustained on account of federation. The honorable member for Forrest must realize that the smaller States are being assisted by reason of the fact that the importation of goods from Great Britain and other countries enables them to export. Owing to the purchasing power of the eastern States, Western Australia and the other smaller States enjoy the largest proportion of the exports of the whole of this young continent. Great Britain would not stand for Western Australia's present export figures as a separate entity.  In  1934-35, that State imported from Great Britain £1,800,000 worth of commodites " and exported to it £5,218,000 worth. Such a position could not continue were it not counteracted by the greater purchasing power of the Eastern States. In the year that I have mentioned, New South Wales imported from Great Britain goods to the value of £12,500,000, and exported to that country only £11,000,000 worth. South Australia purchased £1,600,000 worth, and exported £5,500,000 worth. Queensland was fortunate in having practically the same favorable balance. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that the honorable member voted for the sugar agreement in this House. The sugar industry is supporting the Tasmania^ canning industry. Queensland takes in manufactured goods from the southern States three times as much as they take from it. I do not believe that the effects of federation have been properly expounded by those honorable members who have already spoken. Take, for example, the case of South Australia. Upon entering the federation, the Commonwealth took over from that State its greatest burden, namely, the Northern Territory. </para>

In common with the other States, Western Australia shares in the pensions expenditure which the Commonwealth disburses every year. Under this head, Queensland gets £1,600,000 and South Australia £1,160,000. But, by means of direct payments, Queensland receives only £2,021,000, compared with £2,722,000 in the case of South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable member for Barker that South Australia has not been so greatly blessed by nature as has Western Australia, which possesses rich timber resources, wealthy gold enterprises that are booming at the present time, and extensive coal and iron deposits, none of which natural advantages are enjoyed by South Australia. That State has more cause to tell a tale of woe than has Western Australia. I am giving these figures not complainingly, but merely with a view to showing what has been done for South Australia.. During the last six years, that State has received from the Commonwealth by way of grants no less a sum than £7,250,000. In direct payments to the States, Queensland has received £1,884,000 and South Australia £2,739,000. In assistance to prima reproducers, £195,000 has been paid to Queensland and £7S0,000 to South Australia. In connexion with, works and other payments the figures are respectively £2,250,000 and £3,500,000. The estimate for 1936-37 provides for a payment of £2,300,000 to Queensland and £3,247,000 to South Australia. Those figures prove that South Australia's disabilities are recognized. A commission having been set up to do the fair thing, is it not right that the States assisted should continually ask for more than is recommended. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, the people of Western Australia balanced their budget, but that was a misfortune ; something went wrong with their calculations. It may not be allowed to occur again. The premier of South Australia said that the State would have to readjust its budget. The Commonwealth grant to South Australia represented 20.12 per cent, of its total revenue, while the proceeds of taxation represented not more than 29 per cent. The public debt of South Australia had been reduced during the previous year, while that of Queensland had increased. The <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> rate of taxation in Western Australia is the lowest in the Commonwealth. Yet Queensland with the highest is called on ro subsidize that State. </para>

                            <para>- In South Australia, railway freights have been reduced, and I congratulate the people of that State upon the fact, but I cannot believe that the Government is financially us badly off as we are told. It is unfortunate that the Commonwealth ever adopted the system of paying doles of this kind to the States. If, as we have been told, the  primary  producers in the claimant States are in dire straits, let us give the money direct to the producers. Producers and dairy farmers in Queensland are entitled to drought assistance to-day. </para>

                    <para>Ki-. BERNARD CORSER.- I cannot agree that Queensland is in such a wonderful position as the result of federa tion, that it should provide revenue to be handed over to any of the other States in compensation for disabilities which I claim do not exist. The three claimant States are represented by eighteen senators in this Parliament, while the  three  larger States are represented by only the same number. Moreover, while we hear much of the principle of one man one vote, the fact remains that some Western Australian members of this Parliament represent few electors in comparison with members representing constituencies on the- eastern sea-board. In my opinion, federation has been very kind to the smaller States, and I cannot see w\v States with deficits of £1,000,000 or more should be called upon to make contributions to other States which have balanced their budgets. </para>

                        <para>. - When considering this subject, we must give adequate attention to those facts always found in operation in any federation. If honorable members will look up the debates which, took place at the time the Constitution was being drafted, they will see that everybody who attended the conventions agreed that the Commonwealth Government, by the very nature of its constitution, would be bound to collect revenue in excess of its requirements, and the provision was actually made at that time for a rebate to the States of no less than three-quarters of the total customs revenue to be collected by the Commonwealth over a period of ten years. Members of the convention properly raised the point that there were objections to the proposal that the States should be charged with the expenditure of revenue which they did not have to collect. Every one will admit that money, which is easily obtained, is often easily disposed of, and parliaments, being composed of human beings, are inclined to pay less attention to the expenditure of money which they do not have to obtain by direct taxation of their people- </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>One of the most important points in this discussion was that raised by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> namely, the abandonment by the Commonwealth of the principle of recognizing the disabilities which the States suffer under federation. A study of the convention debates reveals that the best minds of the six colonies were agreed at that time that the smaller States would necessarily suffer disabilities under federation. There is nothing peculiar in that. The situation is common to every federation throughout the world, and some re-allocation of revenue collected by the federal authority on behalf of the constituent states or provinces is a ic-gular feature of all federations. Consequently, in providing constitutionally for some repayment to the States of excess revenues collected by the Commonwealth, the convention was only acting in the light of common-sense. It stood to reason that, as soon as the Commonwealth was formed, the greatest source of revenue available to the States, namely, customs and excise, would be taken away from them altogether, but the same responsibility would rest upon them to develop the territories which they controlled. No less a person than the late Governor-General of Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Isaac</inline> Isaacs, referred, at the convention, to the possibility of the States, if some provision were not made to secure their future independence financially, being left with a load of debt around their necks and their revenues just out of reach. That is the position of the three smaller States to-day. They have been obliged to go on with the development of their territories, but the tariff policy of the Commonwealth has resulted in the aggregation of secondary industries in the three large eastern States. The great manufacturing industries are centred chiefly in New South "Wales and Victoria, while Queensland is in an excellent position in regard to its primary industries. Queensland obtains the great bulk of the benefits of whatever butter marketing scheme happens to be in operation; it obtains almost all the benefits of the sugar embargo, and it enjoys the undisputed benefit of the protection afforded to cotton, bananas, peanuts, &amp;c, commodities which can be produced only in that State, and which, therefore, do not have to face competition from other parts of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The high rate of taxation may be due to the tact that there is only one House in the Queensland Parliament, and to the policy of Labour in raising as much money as possible by  taxation  to expend on so-called social services. Queensland is one of the wealthy States of the Commonwealth in regard to its pastoral industry, being practically on the same footing in this regard as New South Wales. The value of pastoral products raised in New South Wales and Queensland is more than double that of those products in South Australia and Western Australia at their best. I do not desire to minimize the difficulties which the pastoralists of New South Wales and Queensland have to meet, but they are nothing like so great as those which confront the pastoralists of South Australia and Western Australia. No honorable member from the State of New South Wales, and certainly not the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clark),</inline> would be prepared to claim that the country west of the Darling, and up to the Queensland border, could support any considerable country town, except to the extent it might be supported by the mineral industry. The conditions which prevail in the western part of New South Wales extend right across to Kalgoorlie, becoming very much worse in South Australia right up to the border of the Northern Territory. The eastern States, which have much better opportunities for primary production, much greater mineral resources, and very many more manufacturing industries, should take a broader view of this matter, and we should not hear from their representatives talk about the "misery farm" attitude of the claimant States, as we did from tin honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bernard Corser).</inline> I admit that he was good enough to say some kind things about South Australia, and to point out that that State lacks supplies of coal, timber and water power. Those are the natural disabilities under which we suffer, and they cannot be remedied by legislation. </para>

                        <para>The tariff threw unequal strains upon the different State Treasuries, and resulted in embarrassment of States producing proportionately the smallest amount of protected goods, hut encouraging the greatest development of primary industries, e.g., South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> I am grateful to the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James),</inline> for having called attention to the state of the House because J. am about to refer to the address on State disabilities which his leader made to this House last night. In this connexion the Labour party has broken out in an entirely new direction. Hitherto, the policy which I have heard enunciated by honorable members of the Labour party has been one of straightout, downright unification, but now it seems that there is a little change, in the possibilities of looking to the country. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> whether with the consent of his followers or not, indulged in what one might term a " political flirtation waltz " in this House last night, and he departed entirely from the usual orthodox attitude of the party of advocating unification as a remedy for the ills of the smaller States. For once in his life the honorable gentleman got down to a recognition of the fact that there is such a thing as a disability affecting the smaller States of the Commonwealth. This disability is traceable fo three" major actions of Federal Labour policy: first, the federal tariff, secondly the Arbitration Court, and thirdly, the Navigation Act. Some honorable members of the Opposition representing Tasmanian constituencies have had much to say in regard to the Navigation Act and sometimes, after having said it, they have voted in favour of it. I suppose that they spoke in accordance with their personal inclinations, and voted in accordance with the decision of their party. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing at all, except that I thought that it would be just as well to introduce that subject because of the observations which the Leader of the Opposition delivered last night. I wonder whether his  atti-  rude was concerned so much with the,. desire to right the wrongs of the smaller States, rather than to protect certain very doubtful seats of honorable members, who represent constituencies in the smaller States. I have to face that position, and some of my friends who sit in the Opposition will also shortly be obliged to face it. The policy enunciated last night by the Leader of the Opposition who openly in this chamber referred to his approaching translation from the Opposition benches to this side of the House was not the policy contained in the official publication of the Labour party as I have understood it for a considerable number of years. </para>

When the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> was addressing himself to this subject, he made extensive reference to the "misery farms of Western Australia." I accept his correction in regard to South Australia. Recently I paid a. flying visit to Western Australia, and I believe that if the honorable member for Wide Bay were transferred to some of the farms which I was shown on the marginal areas of the Western Australian wheat belt, there would indeed be misery. </para>

                            <para>- lt applies to every State. Since the dawn of federation, and particularly since the conclusion of the war, the tendency has been to contract State debts in accordance with the hopes of the State governments rather than in accordance with a strict business valuation of the landed resources of the States. In common with the other States, South Australia has been guilty in that connexion. Possibly it has been, to a degree, more guilty than the others, because it has a greater proportion of poor land than any other State in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I claim no authority to speak on behalf of Western Australia, but if we are . to accept the conditions which are laid down on page 13 of the commission's report, the Commonwealth Government will shortly face a most remarkable set of conditions, and will be called upon to make some difficult choices. Not so very long ago, this Federal Parliament decided in the matter of the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">v.</inline> J. T. Lang, that it was responsible for all State commitments, and that if a State government, through any cause whatsoever, failed to meet its commitments, the Commonwealth was bound to intervene and accept the responsibility on its behalf. That is the position as I understand it. But the recent report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission sets out that henceforth the position is not to be as it was in the past; no longer is the question of the disabilities of the States, due to the incidence of federal policy, to be taken into consideration; the sole condition in arriving at the determination of the amounts of those grants will be the necessity of the States. In years past some State governments have been what one might honestly call " a little careless" in the manner in which they have expended public moneys, and the time may come when similar governments will again be in office. So far as I can see to-day, there is nothing to prevent any State government from going ahead with any wild and woolly scheme whatsoever, let it be called land development, the increase of social services, &amp;c, and if, thereby, it gets into financial difficulties, the Commonwealth will, according to the principle laid down by the commission in its report, decide that it is entitled to a grant on that account. An entirely different attitude should be adopted by this Parliament in that connexion, and I should bc extremely sorry to see this Government agreeing to the proposition that such a contention as has been submitted by the Grants Commission should be the accepted policy of the Commonwealth. It is a policy which will lead us into serious difficulties before we are much older. If this is the policy of the Commonwealth Government and the guiding star of future commissions which will deal with the financial disabilities of the States, New South Wales is to-day the most deserving State of the Commonwealth, because it is called upon to contribute more than half of the total of the deficit of the other States. </para>

                            <para>- I do not agree with the commission's viewpoint. Probably Mohammed said that there was  no truth in the Bible, but I do not agree with him, and I assume that the honorable member for Wentworth also would not agree with him on that score. But the commission's report is only for the guidance of this chamber. I will never accept the position that, because Parliament appoints a commission to inquire into a certain matter, honorable members are bound to accept everything that it adduces. If the honorable gentleman desires to argue from that aspect, I refer him to section 668 of the report of the Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry, and he will see that the commission calculated that the average cost of establishing a farm of 1,280 acres, due solely to the incidence of the federal tariff, was no less than £500. Examining the matter from the viewpoint of South Australia, I also refer him to the report of the former Director of Agriculture in South Australia, Professor Perkins, who recently retired. That gentleman's association with the department extended over a period of 30 years, and in his report he recommended the closing up for wheat production of no fewer than 1S6 hundreds in South Australia, which is due to the fact that over a period of years they have failed to return an average of six bushels an acre. I have not attempted to work out the number of farms which would be included in those 186 hundreds, but if they are closed down it, will be a very serious matter for the State. According to the calculations of that royal commission, each of those farms has, on an average, paid into the Commonwealth revenue £500, through the medium of the tariff, and the Commonwealth has therefore been the beneficiary. That is why I say that originally the smaller States have provided the money which is now being returned to them in the form of a grant. It is not  being  provided by the taxpayers of New South Wales. For years since the war, parliaments have been continually increasing the tariff, and, at the same time, the standard of wages has been raised, through the operation of the Arbitration Court. In many instances, the Federal Arbitration Court has stepped in and increased wages in State instrumentalities over the heads of State parliaments and governments who, of their own free will, would not have taken that course, because they were not able to bear the additional burdens. In many instances these extra wages have had to be paid out of loan moneys. Nobody except a few persons associated with certain institutions would suggest that under the existing system of Commonwealth administration a State gets 20s. worth for every £1 of loan money it expends. Actually it only gets a proportion of the amount nominally made available to it, for a large proportion of the total is expended in customs duties on imported goods used in the construction of public works. </para>

                            <para>- If the money does not revert to the Commonwealth in that way, it is used to pay artificially inflated prices for the locally manufactured goods which have had to be used and which cost much more than similar imports of the same kind. It stands to reason, therefore, that going back over a period of years, every State has paid to the Federal Government in the guise of tariff taxation, or by taxes on incomes made in secondary industries, a considerable proportion of the loan money which it has received. </para>

I declared years ago, when I was a member of the House of Assembly of South Australia, that the continuance of the existing financial system was bound to end in trouble, for it was unsound and, in my opinion, politically immoral to tax the loan expenditure of one government to provide revenue for another government. It stood to reason that, during the years that loan commitments and expenditure were highest in the States, the Commonwealth revenue from customs was correspondingly buoyant. I am not able under this bill to criticize the Commonwealth Government's use of its revenues, but I believe I shall not be going beyond the scope of the bill when </para>

At that time Commonwealth Ministers appeared to bo incapable of contemplating any other state of affairs than those then existing. In my opinion, the Bruce-Page Government was extremely fortunate to get out of office when it did. </para>

                    <para>Notwithstanding these remarks, "South Australians have been ready to admit certain faults in their loan expenditure, but we also contend that extenuating circumstances were present. In States like South Australia, large areas of submarginal dry country were provided with water conservation schemes and extensive reticulation services, the cost of which was not light. Then, of course, South Australia has had problems in regard to its railway systems. Although I cannot place the ultimate responsibility, it is a fact that the railway systems of South Australia are under three different ownerships. We have Commonwealthowned, State-owned and privately-owned railways, and we have in operation all the gauges to bc found anywhere in Australia. This also has bad its adverse effect upon our railway finance, and the position must become increasingly difficult, until the standardization of our railway gauges is achieved. I regret that this Government, instead of giving effect to its election policy for the standard 17.a. ti on of our railway gauges, has made confusion worse confounded by building the Port Pirie to Port Augusta railway, and so added another strip of entirely useless railway to those already to bc found in South Australia. I understand, however, that the Commonwealth Government is prepared to accept some responsibility on that account. </para>
                    <para>In common with other States, but I think to a greater degree, South Australia has had to face problems connected with soldier settlement. These Iia ve been due chiefly to the wholehearted way in which that State put in hand irrigation projects along the Murray River in the days immediately following the conclusion of. the war, and we are far from out of the financial wood in that regard. I have always held the opinion that soldier settlement should have been solely a Commonwealth liability. The State governments were foolish to undertake any financial responsibility in connexion with it. As things have worked out, the Commonwealth has enjoyed all the benefits from the expenditure of loan moneys in the States, and has, in fact, been heavily subsidized on that account through its tariff revenue, whereas the States have been left to carry the heavy load which should have been the burden of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>I have no desire to compare the merits of the three claimant States to the grants proposed to be made to them. For that reason I have had very little to say about the position of Western Australia or Tasmania. I have admitted certain faults in South Australia in regard to loan expenditure which was particularly heavy and unjustifiable in some years. One government, expended £24,000,000 - about a quarter of our public debt - between J 924 and 1927, but it is fair to inform honorable members from other States that South Australia has made every effort- to put its financial house in order. Taxation has been increased with what I may call a savageness which has been unknown in the other States. All licence-fees have been substantially increased. In this connexion it may bc said that we have done our best to bear our own burden. The rate of income tax increased in South Australia from 5d. to ls. 6d. in the £1 within two or three years. </para>
                    <para class="block">No other State of the 'Commonwealth imposed such a high rate of income tax. The general exemption was reduced to £100 in South Australia and a flat rate of 2s. 3d. in the £1 was imposed on the incomes of all single persons, with a minimum of £1 in respect of any person who had any income at all. These taxation measures have been in force for some years. I could give enlightening figures, also, in regard to the increases of land tax, and could point out that the increases of railway freights and fares were such as to make them the highest in the Commonwealth. Water rates were increased and hospital taxes imposed at a time when other States were doing no more than to talk about such things. I claim, therefore, that the Parliament of South Australia has gone to the limit in increasing taxation in order to meet the financial requirements of the State. We have also, as I have confessed, been overoptimistic in judging the value of certain land resources, and have pushed our wheat belt too far out into the marginal country. Owing to political agitation, it is unfortunately true that good sheep  stations were  cut up to make bad farms. The wickedness of that policy has become apparent to-day and through the menace of drift and erosion is being brought home even to people in our capital cities. Professor Perkins's declaration that 186 hundreds in South Australia will have to be abandoned for wheat growing and turned back to grazing purposes is a further indication of the trend of things in South Australia. If the sheep stations to which I refer had been left alone, many graziers who were actually ruined through the loss of their properties would have remained good taxpayers, and many farmers who were ruined through settling on unsuitable country would doubtless have been engaged in more profitable occupations. It is undoubtedly a grave mistake to attempt to apply land to purposes for which nature has unsuited it. </para>
                    <para>I notify the Treasurer that I intend to support the amendment of the honorable member for Swan, and I should like to hear him announce that the Government is prepared to. regard a favorable vote" on it as an indication that the, House wishes a similar provision to be incorporated in the bills to provide grants for the other claimant States. I do not desire to obstruct business, but I plead with the Treasurer to accept the proposition that disabilities due to federal policy should be taken into consideration. I urge the recognition of this principle with all the sincerity of which I am capable, and I declare emphatically that if necessity is to be the only test, a grave financial situation will arise in this country. I shudder to think what the position of the claimant States will be in a few years time if that policy is continued. We shall get into such a state of financial chaos as between the Commonwealth and the States as will present this Parliament with a problem, the solution of which T will not, at this stage, attempt to discuss. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened with a good deal of interest to the speech of the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> and I find myself in a measure of agreement with him when he says that State disabilities due to Commonwealth policy should he taken into consideration in assessing the amount of any proposed grant. The honorable member was correct in his statement that some State 'Governments have expended loan moneys on works which cannot make a commensurate return in the form of additional productivity, 'but I dissociate the Government of Tasmania from any guilt in that connexion. Very little work of that kind has been done in the island State. It is apparent that the Commonwealth Grants Commission has given patient and exhaustive consideration to the various problems which confronted it, and has made a strenuous endeavour to discover a permanent basis upon which grants may bc made automatically to °the various claimant States. Whilst it is true that the commission to some extent has shifted its ground in respect of the basis upon which it first assessed these grants, it has explained generally the reason for this change. I confess that, to some degree, I sympathize with the Government in its difficulty in determining its future policy of assistance to the smaller States. The honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bernard Corser)</inline> attempted to make out a case against the smaller States, and endeavoured to show why they should not be given grants, but the fact remains that the honorable gentleman, together with other honorable members from Queensland, is always anxious to support any proposal to this chamber to give assistance to Queensland. He is very anxious to have protection for industries in Queensland, which policy, in the main, explains why the smaller States to-day find it necessary to appeal to this Government for financial assistance. This is clearly borne out in the report of the royal commission which inquired into the wheat industry, and also in the report of proceedings at a conference of State Ministers on the wheat industry. At that conference the Queensland representative did not ask for anything, as, evidently, Queensland was satisfied with what it was receiving. </para>

                    <para>As undoubtedly the smaller States are suffering disabilities due to federal policy, they are entitled to financial assistance by way of compensation. All of the States are members of the federation for better or for worse. The Commonwealth Constitution was accepted for good or ill by its founders on behalf of all the States, and to-day each State must accept its fair share of responsibility as an integral part of the Commonwealth. In my opinion, it is quite outside the realms of practical politics to say that any State can withdraw from the federation. Our only alternative, therefore, is to. see that States which suffer disabilities arising from the policy of the Federal Government of the clay should be compensated. </para>
                    <para>It has been said that some of the States have borrowed unwisely and expended loan money on schemes which have not shown a commensurate return. The Grants Commission, after very mature consideration of the matter, has come to the conclusion that great economy has been exercised by the Government of Tasmania, and that its loan expenditure has been very low. This refutes the claim made by certain honorable members from South Australia. But this policy has reacted to' the detriment of Tasmania. Every one accepts the theory to-day that a policy of economy in Government expenditure is detrimental to the State that applies it. Those States which have been prepared to spend money in the development of primary and secondary industries have gone ahead by leaps and bounds, whilst those which have not adopted so vigorous a policy in this direction have lagged behind. That this position has arisen as one of the results of federation cannot be denied on  behalf of  the larger States. To the honorable member from South Australia who spoke about the extravagance of Labour Governments I point to the results of the Labour administration, which has been in office in Queensland for twenty years, and which, I contend, has been very largely responsible for the progress of that State. </para>
                    <para>It is very pleasing to note that the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its current report congratulates the Treasurer of Tasmania on his method of compiling his budget, and on the statement which he presented to the commission. Several years ago, when the commission visited Tasmania, it was found that whilst a certain financial statement had been submitted to- the State Parliament, a different statement was submitted to the commission.  When  the commission visited Tasmania in 1935, the  Chairman,  referring to this fact said - </para>

                        <para>The commission views with great satisfaction the reforms by the Tasmanian Treasurer in the 1934-35 budget, and the attempt made to present a true picture of the State finances. For, it is true, as your Premier pointed out recently, that several States' budgets are seriously at fault in not presenting an accurate statement of accounts ... In the year 1934-35, Tasmania made a revolutionary change in financial policy. Expenditure and losses were shown in the budget, instead of being postponed or concealed in trust accounts. Tasmania now presents a budget which is a complete statement of its finances for the year in question. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>While in respect to South Australia and Western Australia we fee'l convinced that 9.he grants recommended are sufficient to give these States full opportunity to redress their financial inferiority, we tlo not feel the same conviction in respect to the Tasmanian grant, though we believe it to be ample for the immediate purpose of budget adjustment. This is on account of her longdepressed conditions, some degree of exhaustion of her natural resources and a cumulative wastage of her capital assets, which, of course, cannot be remedied by full provision for depreciation for a year or two. We think, therefore, that there is occasion for special help or encouragement beyond the scope of special grants, and we recommend this need to the consideration of the Commonwealth Government and Parliament. The form such help should take would require technical examination, and we do not consider it our province to recommend it except in general terms. An example, however, may make our meaning clearer. Tasmania has great forestry possibilities, but her assets have been depleted. A long-term forestry policy involving considerable expenditure over a term of years is needed. Such . a policy has been worked out and described to us in evidence, and the Commonwealth Director of Forests commented on it very favorably to us. This policy has now been initiated with the help of the Commonwealth grant for forestry, but it is hampered by uncertainty as to the necessary funds in future years, which prevents, for example, the recruiting of an adequate technical staff. An undertaking to finance some such scheme, approved by the Commonwealth's technical advisers, seems to us the kind of additional help that Tasmania now needs. </para>

                    <para class="block">The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> described the form of assistance to the States as " temporary " and urged that this Government should deal with this matter on a permanent basis thus obviating the necessity for claimant governments to come cap in hand to the Commonwealth Government year after year. That suggestion should be carefully considered. In respect of forestry development, to which I have just referred, the Premier of Tasmania has written to the Prime Minister propounding a scheme of assistance to cover a period of several years which it is considered would remove the necessity for special grants in future years. There can be no doubt that, forestry in Tasmania presents great possibilities. This matter has been dealt with in this chamber on more than one occasion, and suggestions for  the  fullest development of Tasmania's forests have been approved by the forestry advisers of the Commonwealth Government. </para>

I myself have made similar statements in this chamber on previous occasions, and not even the Treasurer has questioned them. This aspect of the problem, was mentioned last year, when the claim for special assistance to Tasmania was under discussion. Since then, the Treasurer has indicated, in reply to a question, that the matter is under the consideration of the Government, but that no further action has been taken. The Treasurer will not deny that a fairly complete scheme  ha3  been submitted to the Government. I hope that before this debate concludes he will indicate to the House whether any decision has been reached in the matter, and what the Government proposes to do to remove the necessity for annual applications by the smaller States for grants to assist them in balancing their budgets. The long-range policy for Tasmania recommended in the report of the commission should be considered by honorable members generally. Indeed, the recommendation is made for the consideration of the Government and the Parliament., I regret that when proposals for the making of grants to the claimant. States are submitted to the House, there is a tendency on the part of some honorable members, to ridicule them. I hope that the House will assist in the framing of the necessary long-range policy now recommended. </para>

                    <para>Tasmania has been particularly unfortunate in regard to recommendations made for the granting of financial assistance to the smaller States. .In .1.926, a case was presented on behalf of Tasmania, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir .Nicholas</inline> Lockyer was appointed by the Commonwealth Government of the day to investigate the disabilities of that State, but the recommendation which he made was not given effect. He recommended that a loan free of interest be granted by the Com- mon wealth to Tasmania of such amounts as might be required from time to time for a period of ten years, but not exceeding the total sum of £1,000,000, for the purpose of developing the agricultural and horticultural resources of the State. That recommendation was not accepted, and last year the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission in regard to forestry was also ignored. I urge the Government to give full consideration to the latest recommendation of I ho commission on this matter; it is substantially the same as that made last year. This Parliament should consider the claims of the smaller States, not merely having regard to their immediate needs, but also desiring to help them to discharge their important functions as sovereign. States instead of having to depend on animal grants from the Commonwealth. The commission states that it has explored the possibilities of the Commonwealth , taking over, from the States such activities as the administration of railways, State debts, health and education matters and the like. It seems to me that owing to the loss of revenue-producing departments consideration will soon have to be- given to relieving the States -of some of their liabilities. </para>

Yet, notwithstanding what he had said in 1932 and .1933, we find that during the intervening period the grants made to the smaller States had steadily increased up to 1935-36. In 1932-33, the grants totalled £1,S30,000, and in 1935-36, they amounted ' to ' £2,750,000. The present bill proposes to reduce that total by about  £300,000.  " But even so, the special assistance to be awarded is approximately £600,000 in excess of what it was in 1932, notwithstanding the fact that the commission itself has stated quite unequivocally that it has found no ground which would warrant the compensating of a State for disabilities due to federation or any other cause. The commission has said that disabilities due to federal policy may be the cause of the inferior position of a State's finances, and that a variety of other causes may 'have the same effect. I emphasize those two points: That the commission has found that no special assistance is due to a State in respect of disabilities due to federation or any other cause. </para>

                            <para>- Substantially, I do. Those, as the honorable member for Swan has said, are the only grounds upon which any claim for assistance was made. But, having admitted that there are no grounds whatever for special assistance on account of disabilities under which the smaller States may suffer because  of  federation, the commission  cast about for other reasons for the  granting of assistance, and finally awarded an amount of £2,430,000, which one may describe- as a consolation prize to the smaller States for having failed to establish a case. That is virtually what the commission's report amounts to. I suggest to honorable members that that is a  Tory  dangerous precedent for either the commission or this Parliament to accept. </para>

                            <para>- I agree that there are grounds for criticism of the commission. In its third report, at paragraph 164, the commission stated that special grants are justified when a State, through financial stress, or from any other cause, is unable efficiently to discharge its functions as a member of the federation. I ask the House to think for a moment what that would commit this Parliament to if it were accepted. It would undoubtedly commit the Parliament to provide relief, not only for the smaller States, but also for any State which suffered from a devastating drought, because inevitably such an event must affect the finances of a State. It would commit the Parliament to the provision of relief for States which suffered from fire,' flood, faulty finance, had government, unwisely-planned land settlement, or - to quote the very words of the commission itself - " any other cause ". I say that this Parliament should think very carefully before committing itself to a principle having such a wide and all-embracing character. I am wholly unable to see any reason why the Commonwealth Parliament should accept responsibility for conditions over which it has no control. It has no control over the finances or the policy of any given State. It would be extremely dangerous for it to accept responsibility for any set of conditions that might arise at any time in a State. </para>

                            <para>- Nor  have I been convinced. Apart from the dangerous precedent that the Government is establishing, it is placing itself in an even worse position by committing itself to such an undertaking without demanding of the commission a more reasoned statement in justification qf its recommendation. The commission admits that there are no disabilities due to federation, lt agrees, of course, that there is financial stringency; and merely on that account it proposes to award au amount of £2,430,000, without giving any reasons for the existence of the financial stringency. While I admit the originality which lias enabled the commission to find, not a reason, but an excuse, for making this recommendation, I must confess that I have not been able to follow its logic. I say most emphatically that financial embarrassment does npt, of itself, necessarily place on the Commonwealth Parliament the obligation to give financial relief. That cannot be given by the Commonwealth until it is established, in some degree at least, that there is a definite obligation upon it to alford such relief. Honorable members from Western Australia and other States have had the wit to attempt to establish a case, but the body which this Parliament has set up to adjudicate in the matter has never made any attempt to prove that it is obligatory for the Commonwealth Government to provide financial relief. </para>

                            <para>- Not always. While admiring his eloquence, I consider that the plausibility of the claim which he made last night was equalled only by the utter spuriousness of the arguments which he advanced. For example, he quoted facts concerning the commodity balance as between the smaller and the larger States, and asked the House to accept his dictum that the more statement of a commodity balance indicated the prosperity of one State as compared with another. I venture to assert that no more ridiculous proposition has ever been put before this -House. The statement of a commodity balance is as meagre and as small a fraction of a statement of the general economic position of a country or a State, as one could well imagine. The honorable gentleman further asked us to infer that, because of the overwhelmingly^ rural character of the occupations followed, the inhabitants of Western Australia were in a most disadvantageous position compared with the inhabitants of a State like, for example, New South Wales, in which consider a blf wealth is represented by manufacturing and other industrial concerns. I challenge that statement. I have yet to be convinced that the fact that- a State is overwhelmingly industrialized, rnakes its citizens wealthier on the average than the citizens of another State, in which industry is predominantly rural or primary producing. </para>

                            <para>- f do notclaim to have a very great knowledge of economic history. Nevertheless, I ask the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> to toll me whether he believes that, because Shanghai is a highly industrialized city, the average dweller in it is any wealthier or better off than the average dweller in Western Australia. I ask honorable members, also, to consider whether the mere fact that England is highly industrialized rnakes the. average standard of well-being among its citizens higher than the average standard enjoyed by the citizen of New Zealand or Australia, in which rural industries predominate over manufacturing industries. Yet that was the theory advanced last night by the Leader of the Opposition, in his endeavour to establish a case for Western Australia. I suggest that arguments of that nature are utterly futile and spurious. But even if there were  any merit in what the honorable gentle^ man put forward, the million or so rural dwellers in New South Wales, who receive no special grants are at least as badly off as are the few hundred thousand persons who arc engaged in rural industries in Western Australia, and. who will 'benefit under this bill. That argument, if it has any merit at all, which I deny, applies equally as much to the man on a small grazing proposition at Bourke or Longreach, as to the average farmer or grazier in Western Australia. Again., if one compares the savings bank deposits in New South Wales with those in Western Australia, or in the smaller "States generally, we find that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> average is rather less than in the smaller States which are to benefit under this bill. In New South Wales, the savings bank deposits <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> amount to £29 9s. 2d., whereas in South Australia" they amount to no les;than £41 7s. 2d. I think that that is a sounder basis 11Don which to compute thu relative wealth of individuals, to determine whether or not grants should be made, than that employed by the Grants Commission. In Western Australia, the average taxable income for Federal purposes is almost identical with the average taxable income in New South Wales. I rely upon the 17th  Report  of the Commissioner of Taxation for this information. Facts of that kind make it quite  clear that the case put forward, by certain honorable members for increased grant5 is, to say the least,.very much more biased than is the commission, which has made the recommendations embodied in these grant bills.' </para>

                    <para>I should like to set out just how the grants offered by the Commonwealth benefit a .State like South Australia, and in taking out these figures I tried to effect a comparison between South Australia mid New South Wales. It is proposed that the Commonwealth shall grant to the three claimant States a total of 0,430,000, of which £1,330,000 has been awarded to South Australia. I speak subject to correction but, so far as I have been able to ascertain, of the total sum of £2,430,000. New South Wales will contribute, roughly, £1,000,000. </para>
                    <para>The sum of £1,330,000, winch is to be made available to South Australia, is equivalent to the complete remission  by the Commonwealth Government of all the excise collected from South Australia, the whole of the federal land tax, the entire proceeds of estate duties, the whole of the federal income tax, and 20 per cent, of the sales tax. If we continue the comparison further we find that, after making allowance for all ordinary and special grants to the two States of South Australia and New South Wales, the net contribution by South Australia to Commonwealth revenue amounts to only £1 15s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> each, year, while the comparable figure for New South Wales is £6 15s., almost four tunes as much. </para>

                    <para>In my opinion, the Grants Commission * should prosecute a very much more searching inquiry as to the underlying causes of the financial stress which these bills aim to relieve. It is not sufficient for the commission to say that, because there exists financial embarrassment in a State, the Commonwealth Government should offer relief. There is a duty upon the commission, hot merely to say that there exists financial embarrassment, but also to state clearly and unequivocally the underlying causes of the embarrassment and, if possible, to suggest remedies, f think myself - and I offer the opinion with diffidence, because of the difficulty of the problem - that the cost of administration in the smaller States is the heaviest burden that they have to bear. T believe that, at the present stage of development and population, it is impossible for us to hope for financial stability in the smaller States. Some of the gentlemen who have been so enthusiastically advocating the secession of Western Australia from the Commonwealth would be better advised if they sought to merge the administrations of South Australia and Western Australia, and the representatives of Tasmania should consider the  advisableness  of linking up the Government of that State with the Government of Victoria. I have never been a unificationist, but I believe that there is a strong case for the merging of the Governments of the smaller States with a view to achieving economies in administration. </para>

                        <para>.- The bills before the House at the present time present a suitable occasion for us to review the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States rather more fully than has been done by those honorable members who have so far spoken. I, as a new member of this House, have been astounded to discover the magnitude of the contributions by the Commonwealth to the States, and not merely to the three claimant States. I believe that my astonishment in discovering this would be shared generally by all the citizens of Australia if they knew the extent to which the Commonwealth is raising taxes to hand over to subordinate governments. I have been in this Parliament for just two years, and have seen three budgets introduced. When the legislation now before Parliament ha? been passed, there will have been voted £46,175.493 of Commonwealth money to State Governments during the brief period that I have been a member of this Parliament. I do not think that the citizens of Australia generally have the slightest conception of the extent to which the Commonwealth is used as a taxing machine to provide money for the States to expend, nor that they have any idea of the percentage of Commonwealth revenue so handed over to the States. The estimated revenue of the Commonwealth from taxation for this financial year is £.61,580,000, of which it is proposed to disburse in grants to the States no less than 25 per cent. As the proposed grants by the Commonwealth to the States this year, and its statutory commitments to them under the financial agreement total £15,322,000, I regard this as a fitting occasion for this House to review more fully the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, aud to consider whether we should be content to allow the present state of affairs, under which the Commonwealth really acts as a taxing machine to a very large extent for the States, to continue. I am in no sens8 offering criticism of the State governments, but I allude to the system which makes it necessary for one parliament to levy taxes, the proceeds of which other parliaments expend; and I am offering criticism of the division of constitutional authority which makes it impossible for this Parliament to spend its revenue in giving to the people certain services, which must be given, but which can only be constitutionally given by the State parliaments. At the same time, I point out that in addition to those direct grants and statutory commitments which the Commonwealth has entered into with the States, the States are actually receiving certain other financial advantages of considerable magnitude, which are not generally realized by the public or even by honorable members of this House. </para>

                            <para>- At the moment I am referring not to the disabilities aspect of the State grants, 'but to the general financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, and saying that the time is appropriate to review them. In addition to the specific grants and statutory commitments of the Commonwealth, the States are deriving certain other financial advantages. For instance, the Commonwealth has committed itself to find 5a. per cent., or one-half of the necessary sinking fund upon all State loans raised subsequent to the financial agreement. "Under that agreement, when the States borrow money through the Loan Council, backed  by the Commonwealth, and re-lend it to extra-governmental authorities, they compel those authorities to pay the full rate of interest, and to. contribute to a sicking fund which will eventually repay them in full for their borrowing. At the same time, the Commonwealth is committed to pay one-half of the capital ii mount of those borrowings into the National Debt Sinking Fund. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that, and I am not attempting to differentiate between the States, because that is inherent in the financial agreement; but I am pointing out that on all the capital borrowings which are re-lent to the semi governmental authorities, the States make actually a profit of 50 per cent, of the capital. They gain that financial advantage at the expense of the Commonwealth, and the existence of the practice is not generally realized. I believe that such an advantage was not contemplated when the financial agreement was drawn up, and 1. cannot conceive that it was in the minds of those who devised that agreement that the States should be able to profit by their borrowing, or that the agreement itself should bo of such a nature as to permit the States to make substantial profits upon money which they re-lend to semi-governmental authorities. The position to-day is that if a State government re-lends, for instance, to a sewerage authority a sum of £100,000, which it has borrowed through the Loan Council, that authority becomes committed to pay to the State the full rate of interest, and to contribute to a sinking fund which will recoup the State of the full amount of the capital lent. In this manner, the State will eventually be recouped by the full £100,000, but, in the meantime, the Commonwealth will have assumed and discharged one-half of that total commitment on account of the State. Under the financial agreement, therefore, all those moneys which are borrowed by the States for re-lending to semi-governmental authorities actually show a profit of 50 per cent. The States gain that advantage from the Commonwealth cumulative upon the tremendous grants which have exceeded during the last three financial years an amount of £46,000,000. </para>

                    <para>Again it seems rather surprising that the Commonwealth should make annually non-recurring grants to the States while it has an accumulated deficit of nearly £17,000,000. A review of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and Status therefore discloses that the States are not doing badly at the expense of the Commonwealth. Yet, rather than acknowledge that. they are getting a faildeal in the way of financial assistance, while the Commonwealth bears all the odium of being the authority which levies the taxation, the States, as such, never miss an opportunity to vilify and decry the Commonwealth. Such a situation is most unfortunate, because it has a. very definite, tendency to weaken our national spirit. </para>

Totally disregarding any party aspect, I regret that State governments have' found it profitable, both politically and financially, to vilify the Commonwealth, and to blame it for all of the shortcomings which are unavoidable under our present system of administration. This tendency gives rise to a degree of antagonism towards the Commonwealth which has a definite weakening effect on our national spirit. If we can do anything to raise the prestige of the Commonwealth, and to eliminate the feeling of antagonism against it, which is in all the States generally, and the smaller ones in particular, we shall be contributing something to the future welfare of Australia.

We should bend ourselves earnestly to try to break down that parochial atmosphere and that tendency to encourage a feeling of disability which is present within certain of the States. It is far more important for us all as Australians to direct our attention to an endeavour to devise a system which will give an equal opportunity to all Australians, rather than attempt to encourage the feeling that certain sections of our people are placed under definite disabilities. There is existent among the representatives of certain of our States a feeling towards the Commonwealth that is quite analogous with the economic nationalism which we so strongly decry when it is found between the nations of the world. State parliamentarians are not lacking who do not scruple to exploit this readily-aroused antagonism of the people against the Commonwealth. I have observed upon occasions instances in which that exploitation, or the tendency of State parliaments to cultivate a feeling of antagonism against the Commonwealth, has come perilously near to what may be described as " political blackmail ". National problems arise which are problems, not of the people as living within certain States, but of people who should know no State boundaries. To-day, producers in Australia generally are confronted with a situation in  which  the constitutional position debars any governmental authority from establishing a system of home-consumption prices for the products of the exporting industries. Instead of Australians bending their attention in an endeavour to devise some scheme to overcome this disability, rather do we find certain representatives of State governments viewing the matter as one more opportunity to belittle the Commonwealth. Instead of endeavouring to devote their attention to making some constructive suggestion for overcoming the disability, certain politicians in the State arena are saying that, whatever is .done, the Commonwealth must not be given any extra power. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The most important factor which contributes to that feeling, or which makes it so easy for certain politicians to arouse a feeling against the Commonwealth, Ls the real or alleged financial disability which the State governments are experiencing at the present time. This occasion, when the Federal Government is again disbursing Commonwealth money to the States, should be used aa an opportunity to bring under the notice of the general public, and this Parliament as well, the need for some revision of the constitutional relations of the Commonwealth and States. To-day, we have a new generation of Australians who are not concerned with the protection of the sovereign rights of the States. It is easy to understand the desire which existed in the minds of the founders of our Constitution, who were State politicians, to frame it in such a manner as to preserve to the utmost extent the sovereign rights of the States; hut, so far as I personally and many thousands of other young Australians are concerned, the Constitution was framed before we were born, and I for one care nothing for the sovereign rights of the States. I am concerned, however, with the future of Australia and with the best mean3 which can be adopted to advance the welfare of our Commonwealth. I believe that this Government should take an early opportunity to consult with the States for the purpose of reviewing the constitutional relationship of the Commonwealth to them, and that there should also be a reversal of that relationship in the sense that the  Commonwealth  should be vested with sovereign authority, while the powers of State governments, rather than those of the Federal Government, should be confined within the written limits of a Constitution. </para>

Several years ago, when a certain bill to grant financial relief to a State was under discussion, we were pressed to pass the motion for the second-reading without delay, but the committee stage of the bill was not proceeded with until 2 a.m. two or three days later..

                <para>The purpose of this bill is to appropriate from the Consolidated Revenue Fund the sum of <inline font-style="italic">£12,000,000</inline> for invalid and old-age pensions. It is the usual practice to seek parliamentary approval for periodical appropriations for this purpose. The last such appropriation was £12,000,000, in October last. That amount is now almost exhausted, and it thus becomes necessary to ask Parliament to appropriate a further sum. </para>
                <para>It is estimated that the £12,000,000 now asked for, will meet pensions expenditure for about ten months. The total amount appropriated by Parliament since the inception of the invalid and old-age pensions system is £183,250,000, and the actual expenditure until the 31st August of this year has been £180,500,000, leaving a balance of only £2,750,000 to meet future expenditure. This is sufficient for the requirements to the end of October. </para>
                <para>The bill, as usual, provides for the payment of this amount to the credit of the invalid and old-age pensions trust account as required. The bill has no relation to the rates of pensions or to the conditions under which they are payable. </para>

                        <para>.- In July, of 1933, the Commonwealth Grants Commission was set up to consider applications made by State Governments to the Commonwealth Government for financial assistance. The commission consisted of three members: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> W. Eggleston, Chairman;. Professor L. E. Giblin, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wallace</inline> Sandford. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline> who is a South. Australian, has recently felt compelled to resign his membership of the commission owing to the pressure of private business. I wish to place on record the appreciation of the people of Australia of his excellent work as a member of the commission. I regret that another South Australian has not been appointed te take <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford's</inline> place, though I do not propose to argue, at the moment, that that will be another disability to- South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> has, however, rendered valuable service to the whole community, and it is proper that we should express our appreciation of it. I hope that the gentleman who has been appointed to take <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford's</inline> place will carry out his duties with the same efficiency as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> did. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I propose to confine my remarks to the circumstances of South Australia, for I do not profess to know much at first handabout the affairs of either Western Australia or Tasmania. Moreover, I feel it my duty, as the representative of a South Australian constituency to emphasize the justice of the case submitted to the commission by the Government of South Australia in support of its claim for a grant of £2,000,000' in this financial year on the ground that serious financial difficulty has been occasioned to the State by the impact of federal policy on State policy and finance. </para>
                    <para>Section 96 of the Constitution provided that the Commonwealth Parliament might grant financial assistance to the States during- the first ten years of federation, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provided, and it is under that section that necessitous States may seek financial aid from the Commonwealth. Section 90 of the Constitution gives the Commonwealth exclusive power to impose duties of customs and excise, but it should be mentioned that the Commonwealth and State Parliaments have full power over taxation in other respects. It was provided in section 87 of the Constitution that at least three-quarters of the revenue derived from customs and excise duties should be paid to the States during- the first ten years of federation, and, thereafter, until Parliament decided otherwise. All surplus revenue not required by the Commonwealth was to be paid to the States monthly, and, I understand, that for a number of years tha various Commonwealth Governments which ha.ve been in office honoured that arrangement. At the time the Constitution was. framed grave doubts were entertained as to the financial results of federation from, the view-point of. the States. </para>

                            <para>- No. Several honorable members have suggested in this debate that the Commonwealth Government should cease giving financial assistance to the States. South Australia could not very well carry on without it. In asking for such assistance, the State doe* not feel that it has to come cap in hand! to the Commonwealth, but contends that it has a right to it. In that respect, there&gt; fore, I make no apology for South Australia. The Commonwealth is- obliged  to  pay these grants as something- justly due to the States. Under- sections 87., 89, 93, and 94 of the Constitution, the Stateshave a right to expect the Commonwealth to pay to them a share of its surplus, revenue. Thus, when the  Commonwealth  enjoys buoyant financial years, it is only natural that necessitous States should, apply for a little of that money to help them over difficult times. Under federation, the Commonwealth Government enjoys a wonderful source of revenue in customs and excise duties, and, as thisrevenue is denied to them, States in need  are compelled to ask the Commonwealth from time to time for what may be termed a "' hand-out." It is only fair, in such circumstances, that the weaker States financially, should receive benefits from the Commonwealth Treasury. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and I hope that this improvement will continue, not only in South Australia, but also in the other States. But the fact that that is the general trend throughout the Commonwealth is no real reason why the States should be denied their just share of any surplus revenue enjoyed by the Commonwealth. For 1935-36 there was a general improvement of revenue in South Australia, which exceeded the estimate by £191,303, whilst expenditure exceeded the estimate by £43,678. The chief items in which revenue failed to reach the estimated figure were - Succession duties, which fell £66.000 short, and income tax, which fell £64,000 short. Expenditure was kept down to a minimum, the principal items in which the estimates were exceeded being - Railways, £61,000; roads and bridges, £54,000; reserves for drought relief, £19,000; centenary celebrations, £8,000; maternal welfare fund, £S,000. Notable cases in which the expenditure was less than the estimate were - Unemployment relief, £50,000 ; public debt, £30,000 ; child welfare and public relief, £22,000. It is pleasing to note that, owing to improved economic conditions generally in South Australia, it has been possible for the Sta,te Government to relieve the unemployment, situation very materially, and it hopes that, in the near future, it will be able to say that there is no unemployment in South Australia. </para>

                    <para>In presenting its balance-sheet, the South Australian Government subdivides revenue and expenditure, and shows clearly the financial gains and losses of its principal activities. As I was a member of the Sta te Parliament' of South Australia for a number of years, I cun appreciate the value of such an improvement., and 1 congratulate the Government on its new method of keeping its accounts. They can now be easily understood by the average person, and it is a method that should be followed by the other States. In fact, I should like to see the Commonwealth Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> adopt a similar method.  His  accounts would then be presented in a more simple way than is the case at present, and would bc understood by all taxpayers. It is the duty of every government to simplify its accountancy methods. Net receipts from direct taxation in South Australia last year were as follows: - </para>

                    <para>In respect of community services, education, including interest, on sinking fund on loans to schools and grants to the Adelaide University and School of Mines, accounts for £970,000; and hospitals, child welfare and public relief, unemployment and health, cost £838,000. </para>
                    <para class="block">These services, including roads, absorbs the whole of the Government's income from land and income tax and stamp and succession duties. The whole of its taxation revenue was spent on education, health and other community services. If the Commonwealth Government were to assume the responsibility for the education of the people of Australia, it would relieve the State of South Australia of an expenditure of £S55,000 annually. In view of much that has been said by honorable members in this debate, I feel obliged to emphasize these facts, in order to show clearly how South Australia is spending its revenue. A few years ago the State was in the unfortunate position of being the heaviest-taxed State in the Commonwealth. To-day Queensland occupies that position. It should be noted that the Commonwealth Government has power to take over the whole of the State railways; but it is a significant fact that this Government is loath to assume any further liability, and State railways to-day are definitely liabilities. This matter has been debated for many years, but I doubt whether we can postpone much longer the time when the Commonwealth shall have to take over State railways. Meantime, however, as this Government does not want anything that does not pay, the State governments are obliged to bear the full post of running their railway systems, although these arc rendering an essential service of a purely national character in transporting primary products to the seaboard. From time to time, requests are made to the various State governments to reduce railway freights, and the cost of these reductions usually falls on the taxpayers. Last year, the losses of South Australia on its railway system totalled fi ,000,000. I hope that the grant to South Australia for 1937-38 will amount, not to £1,330,000, as for 1936-37, but to £2,000,000. The Commonwealth can afford to hand over that sum to the State, and. South Australia deserves it. The Commonwealth collects in petrol tax about £8,000.000, and some of this money should be used to reduce the capital cost of the railways, which have a strong competitor in road transport. </para>
                    <para>The annual losses of South Australia include £2,600 on irrigation works and the locking of the river Murray, and £2,460 on soldier settlement. Irrigation schemes could not have been successfully carried out without the locks. The total annual losses in connexion with the locking of the Murray and with soldier settlement approximate £500,000. The aggregate losses on loan works for the last three years are as follows: - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">From these figures it will be seen that the aggregate loss, though still heavy, is £480,000 less than it was two years ago. Last year, 20 per cent, of the total revenue of South Australia came from Commonwealth grants. The total indebtedness of South Australia for the years ended the 30th June, 1935 and 1936, was as follows: - </para>

                    <para class="block">The actual increased indebtedness was £1,173,981 for the year 1935-36, which meant an increase of £1 3s. 4d. a head of the population. </para>
                    <para>In June, 1936, a loan was floated in Loudon,  which  converted £1,996,335 of 3$ per cent, stock, maturing on the 1st July, 1936, into a new' loan bearing interest at 2;,; per cent. The loan was floated at an issue price of 99 per cent., and the new loan will mature on the 1st January, 1.943. with the right of repayment at any time after the 1st January, 1941. As the result of the flotation of this loan, South Australia will save in interest approximately £15,000, and allowing for exchange, say £3,750, the total savings can be set down at £18,750 per annum. Owing to a change in the incidence of interest on the new loan, this saving will not be fully effective until 1937-38. Although, the loan was satisfactory and further reveals the confidence which people in Great Britain have in our securities, the saving is not very great this financial year. It will not amount to more than £3,000. The real benefit of the saving in interest will be felt in future years. .It is pleasing to note that our  stocks  are maintaining a good price in Great Britain and it is to be hoped that this confidence will be maintained. </para>
                    <para>I have endeavoured to give the House full details of the financial position of South Australia, and I hope that every honorable member will recognize that the State's finances have been wisely and carefully managed. </para>
                    <para>Having studied the various reports published by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, I consider that its work on the whole has been well done. Each year since 1928, I have spoken in this chamber on the need for the payment of grants .to the smaller States. If the present .system is not continued for a considerable period, as I hope it will be, T trust that some other equitable arrangement will be made to enable those States to balance their budgets. The Commonwealth, as a great revenue tax collector, will always have money that it can hand out to the smaller States. The special grants received by South Australia from the Commonwealth since 1929-30 are as follows : - </para>

                    <para class="block">The people of South Australia are thankful for the grants that have been made to the State in the past, and nothing would please them better than to be in the happy position occupied by those States which need no financial assistance. They believe that, side by side with primary industries, it is necessary to have secondary industries, and they are hopeful that, as time goes on, South Australia w;ll have a large number of secondary industries in operation. Tt is pleasing to know that at last the alkali industry has been established there. When I was elected to this Parliament in 1928, I brought prominently under the notice of the Government of the day the necessity for such an industry, and I did no* cease drawing attention to the matter until last year. </para>

That is very hard to swallow. In effect, it means that the claimant States are mere dependants on national charity. With that I disagree, and I would describe it as sheer humbug. South Australia has never made a specific claim in relation to which it has not received compensation. Its burdens have been enormously added to by high protection. Because it has striven to develop its resources with loan moneys, the commission seeks to penalize it. A portion of its loan money was borrowed to pay customs duty on imported articles used in its development. It has contributed millions of pounds towards the maintenance of industries in the eastern States. Does any one deny that? </para>

                        <para>.- 1 have very much pleasure in joining with my colleagues from Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania, in advocating the claims of the smaller States, by which I mean those that are smaller in relation to financial capacity or are less favoured by Commonwealth policy than are the eastern States. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Price).,,</inline> in his closing remarks, stated that Western Australia had received a grant from the Commonwealth nineteen years prior to the first claim for assistance by South Australia. That correctly states the position. The big- Australians who were in the Parliament of the Commonwealth in those days were animated by the true Australian spirit. They recognized that a primary producing State which had very few manufactures was" at a disadvantage compared with the eastern States; with their highly-developed industrial enterprises. Western Australia was given a sliding tariff which it was- thought would enable the State to overcome its temporary disabilities in a period of 25 years. Unfortunately, however, that was not the- result, though I believe the- time will come relatively soon when it will' have: a- population of 1,000,000 persons, and with it secondary industries which will, make it independent of any assistance from the eastern' States: The- claim for a larger amount' than the Government proposes to make this year cannot be regarded as peculiar. In 1933-34, the grant was £600,000; in 1954-35, it was the same amount ; in 1.935-36 it was £800,000 ; and this year it is to be only £500,000. Honorable members who,, like the honorable member for Wide. Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bernard Cosser),</inline> say so  glibly;  that the people o£ "W&lt;i stern. Australia oe always whining, would do well to spend' a  month  or two ins the distant parts of that State, as was suggested by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> so that they  might  see. whether the condition of the people there is; as  happy;  as that of Queenslanders- who are engaged- in heavily subsidized prosperous primary industries. I am sure that even, the honorable member foc Wide.' Bay would agree that the position of the. primary producer in Western Australia) is- a sad one indeed. I agree that. SouthAustralia needs assistance; I probably see as much of that State as- the- majority of mert who live in <inline font-style="italic">it.</inline> Those- who come fa-em Western Australia by train are able to follow the progress of its crops, upon which it largely depends' for ite' pl'03,perity. It is known that South Australia's belated application for- assistance from, the Commonwealth was; caused by four very bad crop failures which reduced almost to the bread line a large body of the citizens of Adelaide who previously were considered to be  financially  solid. Many retired farmers had to resume their properties from the persons to whom they had sold them, because of the inability of these men  to continue  their payments. The Scullin Government freely made a grant of £1,000,000 to the State, at a time when conditions were very parlous. Now there is an overflowing Treasury, and times are prosperous. Of this we are continually reminded by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)..</inline> As late a-s yesterday the right honorable gentler  man,  addressing  a  commericial gathering in Sydney, pointed out that in the near future millions of pounds would' come into Australia foi: the establishment, of  new  industries, and expressed the hope that the manufacturers of Victoria and New South Wales would not begrudge the primary producers- a share of the: wealth produced. That. fell from the lips of the Prime </para>
                    <para class="block">Minister of this country, and yet we find that his government, perhaps because it has unduly reduced taxation in preparation for the coming elections, is insisting upon its pound of flesh from Western Australia in order to placate the interests in the east of Australia that may be affected by its financial policy. I agree with the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. John Lawson)</inline> that the basis upon which the Grants Commission has made its recommendation cannot be justified. Tasmania's greatest disability is its isolation from the mainland, and that disability must always exist, unless manufacturers take advantage of the cheap water power available in Tasmania ana establish secondary industries there. I hope that this will happen, just as I hope that secondary industries will he established in Western Australia. I remind honorable members that it is not simply out of caprice that one-third of the continent is being developed by only 450,000 people in the west, while there are over 6,000,000 people in the east of Australia. Western Australia suffers from great natural disadvantages. Even if it were a fertile area from Cape Londonderry in the north, to Cape Leeuwin in the south, which it is not, the extent of the State is so great that it would cost an enormous sum of money to provide it with, railways, and other means of communication. As it is, less than one-third of the Stale is served by railways of any kind, while the relatively small area suitable for wheat-growing when marked ou the map, makes the rest of the State appear to be unsuitable for close development. Western Australia has proved to be a hard State to develop, and the men who have gone into the outback, cutting themselves off from the amenities of civilization, are now faced with drought, so that they will probably lose 60 per cent, of their sheep and lambs, and will be worse off after ten years' struggling than they were when they began. I am not parochial in my outlook, and I am anxious that Australia should develop its own industries, even if, for the time being, they must be located largely in the eastern Sta"tes; but I do ask that those in the eastern States, who derive all the benefit from those industries, shall take a sufficiently Australian view of this matter to see that a. fair deal is given to those parts of the continent less favorably situated than their own. </para>
                    <para>I cannot understand, why the Grants Commission should have any doubt regarding the disabilities suffered by Western Australia under federation. There was certainly no doubt of it in the minds of the members of the royal commission which was appointed by the Commonwealth Government to inquire into the matter, and whose report was presented to Parliament in 1925. The commissioners, although they did not bring in a unanimous report, certainly found that the State was suffering definite disabilities under federation. Dealing with the subject of the Commonwealth customs tariff, a majority of the commissioners stated - </para>

Up to 1924, the Government of Western Australia had spent £3,680,000 on the development of this northern section. No doubt some people will ask why Western Australia does not follow the example of South Australia and hand it over to the Commonwealth, but the people in that area believe that they will get more value for their money by remaining under the State government, especially in view of the lack of success achieved by the Commonwealth in the development of the Northern Territory. They have all their commercial relations with those in the south, and Perth provides a market for their products. There is no doubt that this northern area constitutes a grave responsibility, and every few years the Government is put to the expense of renewing jetties and harbour facilities destroyed by occasional storms. Only recently a storm destroyed the jetty at Onslow, which cost £40,000 to build, and had to be replaced al a similar cost. </para>

                        <para>It is difficult in a community such us Western Australia, with its relative isolation from the seat of government and also from other States, to prevent the creation and growth nf the belief that, other States are somewhat indifferent to Wenton) Australia's peculiar problems and difficulties. It is, indeed, very desirable that a greater knowledge of Western Australia should lie attained by the residents in other States, and ably directed propaganda, having that object in view, should, in our opinion, be undertaken. Some reasonable degree of assistance by the Commonwealth, on the lines indicated in other sections of this report, would, in our opinion, go far to put an end to the dissatisfaction with federation which has  been  sedulously fostered by at least one Western Australian journal of wide cir culation, and which has obtained a degree of acceptance that cannot hu dismissed as insignificant. 1 make bold to say that, if the people of Western Australia could have heard the taunts flung by some honorable members in this Hou3e at those who are asking for justice for the claimant States, whatever federal spirit they still retained would have been dissipated. Commissioner Entwistle expresses himself in these terms - </para>
                        <para>In my opinion . Western Australia should never have entered the federation, but, having done so, there is, I feel convinced, only one complete and satisfactory remedy for her present disabilities, namely, secession. If that event occurred, all other recommendations in this report would become unnecessary. As, however, it cannot be taken for granted that secession will take place, I have joined in recommendations having the object of relieving (at least to some extent) the present financial disabilities of the State of Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- In 1925. The report was called for by a government of the same political colour its the Minister. It was presented, and was conveniently shelved, just as other similar reports have been. The vote in favour of secession in Western Australia was carried by a majority of two to one. I am not a secessionist, even iti the face of that majority, but honorable members should recognize that the secession sentiment in Western Australia is not mere bluff. Probably the most enthusiastic  toderationists  in Australia were the 40,000 gold-fields residents who signed a petition of great length and sent it to Queen Victoria demanding that they be given an opportunity to vote on the proposal for inclusion in the federation. When the vote was finally taken, the proposal was carried by 44,800 votes to 19,600. At that period, Western Australia was only an infant State, but that vote was an emphatic declaration for the federal principle, and T hope that this Parliament will not utterly destroy the spirit then evinced, because much of it has already departed from Western Australia. Many people in that State are firmly convinced that without secession it will never progress. As a keen Australian I hope that Western Australia will never be parted  from the federation. Apart from any benefit or 'otherwise that Australia might receive from retaining Western Australia despite its depleted finances as part of the union, if the Commonwealth had been dismembered by the secession of one of its States, there is no man but -would regret it deeply. 1 regret that I am unable to paint the rosy picture of the finances of Western Australia that was painted of South Australia by the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Price).</inline> In Western Australia, the debt <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> was £172 on the 30th June, 1934, hut to-day it has increased to £196, the highest in the Commonwealth. Such a staggering burden cannot be borne by the small population of that State if it is to prosper. The position has not been brought about because the people revel in exorbitant expenditure, and whatever the administrative capacity of its successive State governments, they ' have not spilt largesse as lavishly as the Commonwealth has done for a number of years past in innumerable ways. The suggestion of the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. John Lawson)</inline> that, to overcome disabilities of the smaller States, Tasmania should be tacked on to Victoria, and South Australia and Western Australia should merge is a ridiculously fantastic method by which to settle their troubles. How could .the people of Western Australia, for instance, expect, a government 1,000 miles .removed from them to understand and appreciate their difficulties'.? The truth is that the three smaller States have been obliged to exercise -particular caution in connexion with their finances. The country railway stations in Western Australia, in nine cases out of ten, are unattended. </para>

                    <para>According to the latest Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Year-Booh,</inline> the value of imports into Western Australia from the eastern States was £9,500,000, compared with its exports to the .'eastern States of £1,333,333. I am not for the moment dealing with the adverse balance. I am merely endeavouring to show that Western Australia is a valuable customer of the eastern States. At the present time, the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett)</inline> and other members of the Cabinet are undoubtedly worried in connexion with matters of trade with a country inhabited by another race and by people who are not white, and yet slighting references are made to our own kith and kin in Western Australia, who are actually one of the best customers in the world of the eastern States. The exports from Australia to various countries are set out in the latest Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Year-Booh.</inline> Of those of British nationality New Zealand buys £3,000,000 worth of goods from the 'Commonwealth and, with the exception of Great Britain, is our best customer. Malaya purchased £1,000,000 worth of commodities from .Australia; Canada £1,267,170 worth, and the other seven British possessions listed a littleover £1,000,000 in all. It will, therefore, be seen that Western Australia is assisting the eastern States by way of trade to the extent of £9,500,000 annually, which is equivalent to three times as much as New Zealand buys from the Commonwealth and more than the purchases of all the other British possessions combined. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Archdale Parkhill)</inline> recently made a special trip to that dominion, and I suggest that he pay a special visit during the recess to Western Australia, which as a customer of the eastern States is three times as valuable as New Zealand. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware that the Minister is not slothful in his duties, and for that reason I suggest that he should pay another visit to that distant state, and on his return use his influence with his colleagues in connexion with its claims. Australia exports to eighteen foreign countries, but the purchases of only one of them - Japan - exceed the value of the goods that Western Australia buys from the eastern States. Japan buys £14,000,000 worth of goods, most of which is wool, and which it must bare for its manufactures. Its purchases of wool will probably decrease now, because it is obtaining its requirements from other sources, although at a higher cost, but I have no doubt that Japanese business men are sufficiently keen to endeavour to operate again on the Australian market. I shall not refer to this aspect, however, because, as the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> and I would call it, the matter is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> Germany, which buys £9,500,000 worth of goods from Australia, ranks next on the list, but its purchases are not more than those which Western Australia makes from the eastern States. Belgium takes £7,500,000 worth, and France £6,000,000 worth, and the rest taper down to the United States of America, with £2,500,000. Many other countries, which are considered to be of importance in world affairs, take a trifling percentage of Australia's exportable goods, compared with the purchases of Western Australia from the eastern States. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Altogether, the disabilities of Western Australia have been investigated by three bodies. Honorable members may remember that a commission was appointed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> in 1927, composed of Professors Brigden, Copland, and Giblin and Messrs. Dyason and Wickens, to deal with the effect of the tariff upon the people of Australia. They adduced figures which appear in <inline font-style="italic">The Australian Tariff,</inline> showing that the amount received from the tariff in Australia was approximately £36,000,000. In other words, the tariff cost the people of Australia £6 a bead. For the moment I am not finding fault with our tariff policy. I refer only to the benefit which the people of the different States obtain from it, as indicated by this commission, which was inquiring into the special disabilities of the States, and was not composed of special pleaders on behalf of any particular State. Out of the £6 New South Wales received £5.5 a head of the population, which shows that something was being lost to the people of that State. Victoria received £7 a head. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bernard Corser)</inline> dubbed us small-minded Australians because we ventured to criticize the sugar bounty. According to the figures of the commission, Queensland received £8 a head of the population, or £2 more than the amount to which it was entitled. Based on its population of 876,000 persons Queensland profits from the tariff by £1,752,000. Before any warmhearted member from Queensland interjects, let me inform the House that the sugar embargo is a sore point with many Western Australians and I am frequently questioned about it. In the country districts of Western Australia the price of sugar is increased to 5d. and 6d. a lb., and Western Australians are prone to ask the reason why they are being robbed of £6,000,000 a year in order to maintain a population in northern Queensland. 1 always endeavour to show them that they take a narrow-minded view, that sugar growing has settled 180,000 persons north of the tropic of Capricorn, and that they have established an industry, the only one of its kind in the world to be carried on by white labour. Of that fact  I am particularly proud. The sugar-cane growers of Queensland form a barrage against any invader. Where it is necessary for coloured labour to do the work in other parts of the world, hardy white men are doing it iu northern Queensland under conditions which hitherto were regarded as impossible for white men to endure. I would not sacrifice the industry, but do the honorable member for Wide Bay and the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom),</inline> an old campaigner, whom one would expect to be absolutely fair in considering the matter of making grants to States to compensate them for their difficulties and to assist people who are really suffering, suggest that those people are being fairly treated when they ask " When will the payment of this dole finish ?" My reply fo those honorable gentlemen is that in view of what the rest of .Australia is doing for Queensland, they should forever keep silent on the matter. </para>

                    <para>Continuing an examination of the commission's figures 1 find that South Australia receives- a benefit of £3.7, and. Western Australia £3.6 a head, which is considerably less than each State's share. On this basis, as the commission showed, Western Australia should be receiving a grant of £926,000 instead of the paltry sum which this Government is desirous of giving to it. It is vain for the commission to say that any disabilities from which the claimant States suffer have been counterbalanced by advantages. No monetary grant can compensate Western Australia or the other claimant. States for the loss of the large industrial population which has settled chiefly in New South Wales and Victoria, and which, obviously, is of such tremendous benefit to them. Practically the only effect of the tariff wall in Western Australia has been that the manufacturers of the eastern States have beenable to dump goods in Western Australia for sale at a lower price than, that obtained for similar goods in the place of manufacture. I am not opposed to our policy of protection. I- know that it has been beneficial to the eastern States, but unfortunate repercussions have occurred in the States which are now seeking financial assistance from the Commonwealth. In this connexion, 1 direct attention to the final paragraph in the volume <inline font-style="italic">The Australian Tariff,</inline> which reads as follows: - </para>

                        <para>. - It seems to me that this debate has really developed into an excursion into the field of relativity. To the uninformed mind relativity simply means that Newton has been overthrown by Einstein, who says that nothing can be known positively, and that science itself is ignorant. But the fact, is that as soon as the cause of the relativity or variation is known and the amount measured, we have its co-efficient. Actually, what wo need is a co-efficient. When we have its co-efficient, relativity 'becomes a positivity as far as that operation or activity is concerned. We have simply to take an ordinary surveyor's chain or steel tape to ascertain that relativity is an undeniable fact, for it contracts with cold and. expands with heat. By careful comparison, the amount; of variation is measured per degree per chain, and,  adopting  a standard temperature for all chains we obtain a standard, or invariable, length, and a puzzling variation becomes a fixed or positive value. In this debate wo are seeking a co-efficient to deal with relativity. Otherwise such a debate as this could not have occurred. I am personally seeking a co-efficient. </para>

                    <para>To put it in another way we are seeking a common yardstick. A common yardstick was postulated in 1900, when Australia was girdled with what we now know as our White Australia policy. A common yardstick implies that the various activities of the Commonwealth have to he maintained on an equal basis, or, in other words, that there must be a levelling up to achieve equity. To my mind, the achievement of this sense of equity as between the various conflicting interests of the Commonwealth is the most important task that faces us at the moment. We are seeking, so to speak, a standard temperature, otherwise this debate would not have occurred. </para>

They have their root in soil and climate and a concentrated commercial complex. I do not think that that can be denied. I do not wish, to deliver a lecture on physical geography, but it is well for us to realize that while the currents of air that come down to the southern hemisphere from the equator, anti-clockwise, on our eastern seaboard and bring heavily laden moisture with them to the high basalt ranges of the Pacific coasts of the continent, and so cause the heavy rainfall that occurs in those regions making Queensland in particular remarkably luxuriant, the cold air currents which come up from the South Pole due to this anti-clockwise motion on the western coast of the continent are not moisture laden, and do not cause rain, with the result that large areas in that part of Australia are arid and must remain so. I mention this merely to illustrate my point that our troubles are due largely to the physical geography of the country. </para>

It must be realized that those who go out into the arid areas of Australia are, to a notable degree, supermen. They must be adaptable to extraordinarily varied conditions, and it should really be axiomatic that move favorable treatment should be accorded to them than is accorded to people who live in more settled and civilized surroundings, and enjoy the greater amenities associated with them.

                    <para>In reply to the chorus we have heard to-day  from  honorable gentlemen representing constituencies in Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania, I feel disposed to remark that spendthrift habits bring their own rewards and punishments. I do not wish to say any hard words about Western Australia, for I finished my education in that State, and walked many hundred miles within its borders as a young surveyor. 1 can claim to know Western Australia better than most honorable gentlemen who represent Western Australian constituencies in this Parliament, but I am obliged to say that large sums of money have been foolishly Spent in Western Australia in connexion with migration schemes, group settlement plans, over-capitalized buildings, roads in Perth and its environs, and the like. I do not wish to mention any names in this connexion, but there is no doubt that certain persons have left the State a very unhappy legacy in this connexion. Ninety per cent, of the State's debt is due to incompetency. The same thing applies in South Australia where an attempt was made to carry on farming operations beyond the Goyder line, as the result of which the people settled there now have to be brought to more suitable locations. As a matter of fact, a forceful policy of eviction similar to that employed in the United States of America to take the farming community from arid and semi-arid regions might be necessary. In the United States of America the people are assigning the real value to land, and are departing from the policy of trying to convert grazing land into farming land. </para>

It is overstepping the mark for Queensland members to decry other honorable members of this House for pleading the mendicancy of their States. As a matter of fact, Queensland has been for twenty years the biggest spendthrift in the Commonwealth, and has been saved from the consequences by the natural resources that it possesses. It has been able to hide its mistake's. If any other State had been guilty of the spending of which Queensland lias been guilty- </para>

                            <para>- I bow to your ruling. But surely if honorable members would only admit the facts I have stated and appoint a competent fact-finding body to arrive at the solution they would agree to my co-efficient as a means of measuring the disabilities of isolated areas. The co-efficient as I see it, and which this Parliament as a national assembly should also seek, is allocation of rights to produce things, primary or secondary, away from the capital cities, and in other inland chosen geographical areas. <inline font-style="italic">\Quorum formed.]</inline> Soil and climate will, of course, govern the activities in the chosen regions. To attain this objective we must have some fact-finding committee to locate these regions. Some of the money could be made available from the defence vote. This disabilities committee known as the Commonwealth Grants Commission, in my opinion, - I think many other honorable members agree with, me - has failed to do the job that this Parliament appointed it to do. because it has not the training in fact finding and is therefore unable to assess or acutely observe. In seeking the solution of the economic ills "which confront us to-day, which is necessary to bring about contentment among the people, we shall have to break down the artificial State boundaries. This will enable the people of Australia to get together as members, not of State communities, but of one great Commonwealth of economic regions, and the money which this Government year by year shovels out to the States, and does not control, will be distributed among the geographical regions to which I have referred, and will be under Control by the Commonwealth Government after vesting in local authorities power to advise and actually to control their own domestic policies. Why is this Commonwealth  harrassed  by the capital cities of the mendicant States to provide funds over which this Government has no control? Simply because the commercial complex has captured unreasonable powers from the people. The real criticism of the granting of these funds by  this Parliament should, not be directed so much to the States themselves as to the bureaucracies situated in the capital cities. These bureaucracies have been so unmindful of their responsibilities that they should be forced to give an account of their stewardship. The capital cities take great bites out of the money granted, and the people who are really in need of it suffer in consequence. The Commonwealth has been charged with imposing upon the States disabilities which have caused them financial loss; but that charge should be sent right back to the States. Unless the policy which I have urged is adopted there will never be any hope of obtaining a unified Commonwealth, or of preventing the smaller States from coming forward year after year for more and more money. I sincerely trust honorable members, when they a;o back to the capital cities, will try to show the people that we should rid ourselves of the artificial State boundaries and dispense with State governments altogether so that the Common wealth may be divided into geographical areas or economic regions on the lines I have suggested. </para>

                        <para>. - I am surprised at the antagonism that has developed in this House over these bills. I agree with the States that claim disabilities, but contend that they have attacked the question from the wrong direction. It is necessary for the Commonwealth to have a unified policy, under which those best situated should help less fortunate sections of the community. The debate which has taken place in this House, and its percolation throughout the Commonwealth, will awaken the people to the need for one Commonwealth Parliament to guide the destinies of the whole of the country. To-day we have six State Parliaments and six State Governments, whereas it would be more efficient to have one Commonwealth legislature looking after all the people as equal units. To-day we have one State blackguarding the other. Every one is at each other's throat. Wchave heard representatives of country constituencies in this House, notably the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> laying the blame for the disabilities of the smaller States on the tariff, the Arbitration Court, the Navigation Act, and other aspects of federal policy, all of which have been of great benefit to the Commonwealth as a whole, although they admittedly have brought disabilities to certain sections of it. For those disabilities those sections should be recompensed. I agree with the analysis of Australia's tariff policy contained in the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. I also agree with a system of provinces tinder which the central government would collect the revenues and allocate them according to needs. That that will come is inevitable. On the tariff question the Commonwealth Grants Commission has reported - </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>These facts led to the phase of policy which  the  Stores contend is the main cause of their disabilities - the policy of protection. In the circumstances we have noted the demand for a substantial tariff to ensure the manufacture of a considerable proportion nf the requirements of the people was practically certain to be accented bv a  progressive  community. Tt is not within the province of the commission to make any pronouncement as  to the propriety of the policy of protection, ft has been accepted as the settled policy of Australia; but, as it has been relied upon by the claimant States as the main cause of their disabilities, it is necessary to place it in its proper perspective. </para>
                        <para>The Tariff Committee of 192!) came to the conclusion that this policy had enabled an increase of population to take place. lt seems certain that the population so encouraged was greater than could have been absorbed on marginal land with a diminishing scale of returns. The policy of protection was, therefore, in every sense a development policy. This method of development involved increased  cost3  for other production, and the main burden settled upon export industry. The chief export industries, wheat and wool, had been able to bear this burden, but there was evidence at the time of the report that the burden of excess costs of the tariff was becoming oppressive. </para>
                        <para>It will thus be seen that the policy of protection has been adopted by the people as a means to making the full use of resources of the continent. From this point of view the cost it involves must be regarded in the same light as running railways or supplying irrigation water below cost. There is little doubt that it has played its part in securing some development of the type aimed at.  [ agree with that statement of the position. Each State has built railways to develop the country, which will not be payable for years to come and all parts of it have had to pay for them. It is the same with protection. As railways are necessary for the development of the country, so is protection necessary. The people of Western Australia complain about the protection given to the sugar industry in Queensland, and Queenslanders, on the other hand, contend that too much money is paid 'by way of grants to Western Australia. I believe that the smaller .States are entitled to the sums claimed by them as compensation for disabilities due to federal policy, but it is regrettable that the debate in this chamber has shown that one State is jealous of another. The people of this continent speak one language, and have common ideals. We cannot agree among ourselves, yet we send delegates to Geneva in an effort to help the League of Nations to reconcile the differences between other countries speaking various languages and having different ideals. The commission remarks - </para>
                        <para class="block">Though the heavy losses which make up State disabilities at present are partly explicable on the ground of the unsoundness of the financial methods and control, and partly on the ground of the fall in prices, it is obvious that a tariff which extracts from export industry a substantial subsidy  must  add seriously to the burdens of States attempting to develop such industry. Moreover, as one developmental activity, that connected with land settlement, is in the hands of the States,  and  (he other developmental instrument, the tariff, is controlled by the Commonwealth, there is a lack of consistency and co-ordination in the two policies. There is almost  a  competition between the two factors of development; each frustrates the effect of the other; the burdens created by the one make the protection required for the other the greater, so that the clash we noticed earlier becomes more intense as each protective effort grows. There is an increasing amount of protection to primary industry in the Commonwealth tariff, hut the broad distinction set out above still remains. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I consider that the commission has given a remarkably good exposition of the inter-action of protective policies, and their bearing upon State disabilities, and the House would do well to study the report from the broad aspect. If the people of Western Australia were asked to vote for unification at the present time they would flatly refuse because of the treatment they had received, but I maintain that until one national Parliament completely controls the destinies of this country the fight over the grants made to the smaller States will occur annually. </para>

                        <para>Change is indeed inevitable, and in order to suit varying conditions it seems necessary to draw a financial scheme on the broadest lines . . . This must be accounted as one of the weaknesses of federation. It rendersit difficult to apply the principle of financial responsibility necessary to sound politics. In a federation each member insists upon pursuing its own policy independently. If the members were prepared to pool their functions and resources they would not federate, but form a unitary State. A State which claims to be sovereign should accept the financial consequences of the policy U determines to pursue, and if it is entitled to call upon another State in bearing those consequences its responsibility is weakened. </para>

                    <para class="block">Out of that assurance have arisen the complications of to-day. I agree with the main contentions and analysis of the position made by the Grants Commission; it is it wonderful analysis. I am addressing myself not to the point, that the commission has shifted its basis of recommending grants from disabilities to needs, but to a general examination of the relations existing between the Commonwealth and the States. The only solution of the present difficulty will be. found when our primary and secondary production is  harmonized  under one control, and the present system, under which the States control primary industry and the Commonwealth, through the tariff, controls secondary industry, is abolished. Under a system of unified control of the Commonwealth, as I have indicated, Western Australia's claim for assistance as a State consisting of a large area, -with only a small population, and, therefore, unable to compete with eastern States like Victoria and New South Wales, would receive proper consideration. This is impossible to-day. I contend that each State, or province, should give to the Commonwealth according to its abilities; but, furthermore, each State and province should also receive from the Commonwealth according to its needs. Unless such a system is evolved, we shall always be confronted with the complications which exist to-day. I am surprised to hear certain honorable members reviling other honorable members because they happen to press the claims of particular States. Honorable members have been criticized in the past because, for instance, they favoured assistance being given to the sugar industry in Queensland, and now honorable members, who are pressing the claims of Western Australia, South Australia-, and Tasmania, for increased grants, are being subjected to similar criticism. This "State Right" fight must be eliminated, and this can only be achieved by the abolition of all State parliaments, and having in their place one Commonwealth Parliament, with full .authority. It is said that these honorable members are holding out their hands for all they can get from the Commonwealth. If any State needs assistance, it is the duty of the Commonwealth to give that assistance. I hope that we shall have a unified Commonwealth in fact, and that this will be achieved through the abolition of all State governments and State governors and the like, and that we shall have one Commonwealth operating under one uniform system of taxation and one system of -extending benefits to the various parts of the Commonwealth, according to their needs. </para>

                        <para>.- In the zeal with which honorable members have pressed the requests and requirements of the States from which they come, and the warmth which these considerations have engendered, the fundamental issue involved in this debate has become somewhat obscured. I propose, therefore, to recall to the recollection of honorable members some aspects of that issue. If justice is to be clone to all parts of the Commonwealth, it is essential that honorable members should, as far as possible, sink purely State considerations and prejudices arising from their representation of electorates in any one State or part of the Commonwealth. Under this measure, which arises out of section 96 of the Constitution, the States are entitled to approach the Commonwealth for financial assistance, and, taking advantage of that right which the Constitution gives them, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania have made such an application. This House has now to determine what financial assistance, if any, should be given to the three States now concerned. In coming to that decision, we have to make an examination along defined lines. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> First of all, can the Parliament lay down any definite formula which, spread over the years, will decide, from year to year, the grants to be made for each State? Thus the first consideration of the Commonwealth Government in this matter was to decide whether any automatic  formula  could be laid down which it could adopt in deciding the grants to be made to these States, and to make an investigation for that purpose it appointed a Commonwealth Grants Commission. The commission was asked, first, to find if such a formula could be evolved. No such formula has been suggested by any individual State, and the commission itself has not been able to suggest one. Dealing with this matter in its report, it states - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Our conclusion is that the relative position of the States and the Commonwealth fluctuate* so considerably that any mechanical formula or constitutional change may speedily become inapplicable and unjust. </para>
                    <para>Some principle of adjustment is necessary, and as conditions change considerably from time to time the adjustment should be elastic. </para>
                    <para>In the course of this debate no honorable member has been able to show that any automatic formula will suffice for the fixing of grants to be made to the States from year to year. That being so, it becomes necessary to determine what body of men should inform this Parliament as to the grants to be made from time to time, what principles should govern the determination of the grants, and, finally, what amount should be granted as the result of the principles upon which that determination is made. It has not been seriously suggested at any stage of this debate that the Grants Commission is not a suitable body for the determination of this matter. In fact, general approval has been expressed concerning the ability of the present members of the commission, and compliments have been paid to them for the industry and thoroughness with which they have compiled their various reports and particularly their third report. This has been referred to as a monumental work, and any honorable member who peruses it will agree that it represents an exhaustive and painstaking .analysis of Federal and State finance and Governmental statistics generally. This being so, the really fundamental matter for consideration is the determination of the principle upon which these grants are to be made, and the early speakers in this debate concentrated on this argument. It has been stated by the commission itself that the principle which it has adopted is as follows: - </para>
                    <para>Special grants are j  justified  when a State through financial stress from any cause is unable efficiently to discharge its functions as a member of the federation and should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States. </para>
                    <para class="block">The commission is of opinion that the grants should be made according to needs in order to bring the general standard of living in the particular State to which a grant is made not appreciably below the minimum standard prevailing throughout the whole of the Commonwealth. This basis has been attacked by speakers from what may be termed the Swan and the ' Macquarie camps. The Swan camp, who would represent the position of the majority of the claimant States, claim that these awards should be made on the basis of disabilities arising from federal policy, and should not be based merely on needs. On the other hand, the Macquarie camp contend that the basis of needs is a very dangerous one, and that on that basis one, at least, of the non-claimant States would have a stronger claim for a  grant than  any .of those States now making such a claim. If we examine the matter of disabilities, however, we find the interesting fact that, according to the investigation of the commission itself, the net benefits of federation virtually equal the net disadvantages of federation or federal policy. </para>

                            <para>- I. propose to deal with that point later. I recollect that the honorable member for Darling Downs in quoting the figures which I have men.tioned showed that Western Australia has suffered a loss of £1,188,000 and has received a benefit of £1,117,000, or a net loss of £170,000, as the result of federal policy. That did not take into account the benefit of exchange, which was computed as having a beneficial effect of £800,000 in respect of Western Australia. Later, I propose to show in some detail various other ways in which that State has benefited directly from, federal action, but at the moment I shall deal with the principle involved. Representatives  of  some of the claimant States have said that the allocation should be made on the basis, not of need, but of disabilities. Ou the other hand, the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. John Lawson)</inline> said that, according to the finding of the commission, had the basis been that of disability, no grant would have been made to those States at all, and, therefore, in recommending a grant, the commission has virtually given a consolation prize to them. I dispute that statement, because the commission has taken the stand that, even if a State is unable to show that it is suffering disabilities as a result of federal policy, but is able to show that its citizens arc neverthe less not enjoying a standard of living which is reasonably comparable with that of the other States, it is entitled to financial assistance. The commission takes the view that a State may suffer no disability at all as the result of federal policy, and yet if, because of the poverty of its natural resources, or for other reasons, it be unable to maintain its citizens at a standard comparable to that obtaining in other States which are more favorably situated naturally, it is entitled to assistance in order to bring it into, line with the other States. That is the only fair test to be applied in a large territory like the Commonwealth, of Australia. I do not think that any honorable member desires that persons living in some portions should enjoy higher standards of living, because of better natural resources, than others in le,ss favoured portions of the Commonwealth enjoy. That is virtually the view of the commission, and I sug gest that the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> is doing his State a great disservice in suggesting that the only criterion should be the disabilities suffered by a State. I repeat that the figures given by the commission have not been seriously disputed in this debate. </para>

                    <para>As to the burden of the tariff, which was the main disability claimed by Western Australia, the commission accepted the figures supplied by the State. It then took into account specific amounts granted to the State under special acts, the Federal Aid Roads Act, and financial agreement, and found that, the benefits were practically equal to the disabilities. The State of Western Australia has not seriously claimed that the Arbitration Act or the Navigation Act has had any serious effect on it from the point of view of disabilities. Honorable members should not imagine that we who support the Government in this matter are not sympathetic towards the States seeking assistance. We believe that the fairest method to be adopted is that which the commission has, in fact, adopted, and which, moreover, shows the most favorable result to States concerned. </para>
                    <para>On page 1S1 of the commission's report, are. set out the advantages to the States arising from Commonwealth policy. In view of the criticism which has been voiced during the debate, it might be well if I were to refer to some of those general advantages which obtain to the States arising directly from federation. As set out by the commission those advantages include the operations of the Commonwealth Bank and the Australian Loan Council; the general effect of the Financial Agreement; a common policy in banking currency and credit; common representation abroad; a common policy in external affairs; Commonwealth control over territories; immigration policy leading to uniform standards such as a White Australia; a common defence policy; a common civil aviation policy; a common tariff policy; exchange benefits to exporters; a progressive policy of postal, telephone, telegraph, and broadcasting development, through an Australiawide control; and services and investigations of the Health Department, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and other departments. </para>

                            <para>- Another advantage arises from the Migration Agreement under which Western Australia received interest concessions amounting to £1,700,000, spread over ten years, compared with similar concessions to the other States totalling £1,109,000. Western Australia benefited also in respect of soldier land settlement in that the Commonwealth assumed liability for £1,470,000 on account of losses found by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Pike to have been incurred by the State. Miscellaneous  payments by the Commonwealth to Western Australia in 1934-35 totalled £2,851,000, of which £474,000 represented a contribution by the Commonwealth towards interest on State debts, and £473,000 represented the federal aid roads grant. There was a special grant of £600,000, and a special non-recurring grant of £133,000. In addition, relief granted to wheat-growers in Western Australia amounted to £869,000. </para>

                            <para>- I did not previously take all of the items into account when I said that benefits amounting to £1,170,000 should be set oft' against the £1,188,000 represented by the burden of the tariff. If I were to adopt a parochial attitude, I could point out that, in respect of the federal aid roads agreement, Victoria contributed £5,790,000 towards the amount distributed, and received hack  only  £3,814,000. Put in another way those figures mean that Victoria contributed 30 per cent, of the amount dis bursed, and received bade OnlY <inline font-style="italic">j.6</inline> per cent. Direct taxation of Victorian citizens is a contribution in part to the special grant made to the other States. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> Coming now to the actual amount which the commission recommended should be granted to Western Australia this year, I refer to the statement of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green),</inline> that for the three years 1933-34, 1934-35, and 1935-36, the grants to Western Australia were £600,000, £600,000 and £800,000 respectively. The honorable member said that this year the amount recommended was only ' £500,000. He did not- give the figures for previous years. The grant paid for 1932-33 was £500,000, and for six years before that the annual grant was £300,000. Those figures indicate that the amount now recommended exceeds the normal figure for the six years prior to the depression. </para>

                    <para>The House must decide what guidance it is to seek in this matter. An unbiased person listening to the speeches of members of all parties, and from all States, would realize that an impartial body to deal with these matters is essential if justice is to be done to all the component parts of the Commonwealth. A?, one who has read with pleasure and interest the masterly report presented by the commission, and its exhaustive analysis of every phase of the problem dealt with, I am of the opinion that the only just method is to have a body such as the Commonwealth Grants Commission to undertake investigations and present reports for the consideration of Parliament. The principle outlined by the commission has been adopted. I agree with that body that the only fair principle is that which is based on the needs of the respective claimant States. On the question of disabilities, I adopt the finding of the commission that no possible correction will successfully modify the conclusion that the major cause of the relatively inferior financial position of the claimant States is not to be found in federation or in federal policy. I, therefore, repeat that the honorable member for Swan will be doing a disservice to his State if he moves his proposed amendment, because that State has not suffered, any substantial disability as a result of federation or of federal policy, and yet it will receive a grant on the basis of its needs, as recommended by the commission, and adopted by the Government, and which, I hope, will be approved by this House. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with other honorable members who have spoken that the so-called smaller States have many disabilities, but I disagree with those who say that those States are naturally poverty-stricken. However great the wealth of the claimant States may be, they still have their disabilities. When Professor Giblin was about to leave Tasmania, in order to accept a position on the mainland of Australia, he said that the disabilities from which Tasmania was then suffering would always exist. I did not agree with him. I know Tasmania as well as most people; it is a fairly wealthy State. Though small in area it possesses some of the best mines in the world- -its copper mines are the third largest in the world. It has ample water supplies which, if properly harnessed, could produce electric power sufficient to supply the requirements of the whole of the factories on the mainland. It can produce a greater quantity of potatoes to the acre than any State in Australia. It produces the heaviest crops of fruit. It has a perfect harbour amply supplied with cheap power, and it enjoys good climatic conditions. Yet in spite of all these advantages Tasmania suffers disabilities as the result of federal policy. It has to compete with the products of the mainland States, and the high freight rates operating between Tasmania and the mainland frequently rob the Tasmanian exporter of his margin of profit. Both Tasmania and Western Australia suffer the further disability that they do not share in the expenditure of Commonwealth money. It is proposed to spend a great deal of money this year on defence, but very little will be spent in Tasmania or Western Australia. When the majority of the younger people in Tasmania reach an age at which they must strike out for themselves they turn to the mainland States where the avenues of profitable employment are much greater. Though all of the States have to contribute their share towards Commonwealth revenue, most of the money raised by the Commonwealth- is spent in Victoria and New South Wales. It isproposed to spend a large sum of money in New South Wales for the construe tion of sloops and war-ships. I do not object to that, but I urge it as an additional reason why Tasmania continues to be so poor. </para>

                    <para>The Commonwealth Grants Commission has recommended that mortmoney should be- spent in the  smaller  States so that later on they will not have to approach the Commonwealth every year for a grant to enable- them to carry on. It was suggested by the commission that money should be spent on forestry in Tasmania. Although at present there is a shortage of timber throughout the world, the Commonwealth has wasted large sums of money in New South Wales and Victoria on forestry schemes on land unsuitable for that purpose. To recompense Tasmania for its disabilities the Commonwealth should be prepared to spend large sums to conserve its natural forests. In the southern and western portions of Tasmania there are large areas enjoying climatic conditions suitable for the growing of timber. In those areas tree? grow much quicker than in any other part of the world. It is the duty of the Commonwealth to assist the State Government to develop those areas. In Australia to-day we are depleting our forests and planting in unsuitable areas merely to provide work for the unemployed. Much more benefit would result to the Commonwealth as a whole if the natural forests of Tasmania were conserved. </para>
                    <para>Several speakers have said that we should have one Parliament for the whole of Australia. I feel sure that if another vote were taken on the secession question in Western Australia it would be carried by an even larger majority of people. Tasmanians would vote two to one iu favour of secession. I feel sure also that that would be the experience in other States. Some honorable members will say, I have no doubt, that the vote taken in Western Australia some time ago did not reflect the earnest convictions of the people of that State; that it was carried on a  popular wave. All I can say is that almost everybody I have met from Western Australia has expressed dissatisfaction with the present state of affairs, and that the secession vote in that Stale waa one of the worst advertisements that Australia has ever had. When I was in England last year in company with the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory ), we were frequently asked why the people in Western Australia were dissatisfied with their position in the federation. Those who put this question wondered "why Western Australia had not been treated fairly. If the Commonwealth does not treat the smaller States fairly, it would be far better for the States to secede.</inline></para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> accused the smaller States of asking for a dole. They are asking only for "what is their rightful due. I remind the honorable member that it costs Tasmanians nearly £1,000 a day to subsidize the Queensland sugar industry, and that they could import their sugar requirements from other countries at a much lower price. It is true that I voted for the sugar agreement when it was last before the House, but I did so in order to keep the people in the northern State in employment. Tasmanians resent the suggestion that they are living on the dole. Practically every industry in Queensland has been protected. Protection has been granted in respect of cotton, bananas, butter, wheat, peanuts, and sugar. I defy the honorable member for Wide Bay to mention one industry in Tasmania which has been subsidized </para>

                            <para>- The smaller States should be given, not a dole, but a fixed grant over a number of years to compensate them for their disabilities. The Commonwealth Grants Commission has recommended that the grants should he fixed for a period of at least ten years. If that were done, it would go a long way towards helping the smaller States to compete successfully in the markets of the mainland States where the hulk of Commonwealth money is spent. The whole of the States have had to contribute towards the cost of the building of the national capital at Canberra. Again, the Hume Reservoir has been constructed largely with Commonwealth money. Munition factories are established in certain States which cost the taxpayers large sums of money; but allof the States must contribute towards their support. The result of all  thi3  is that the young people of Tasmania naturally drift to the States in which secondary industries are established, and in which the prospects of finding employment are brighter. </para>

                        <para>.- The claims of the States for compensation for disabilities suffered as the result of federal policy should be dealt with on their merits. I am glad to notice that this year Tasmania is to enjoy a larger grant. One of the most serious disabilities suffered by Tasmania is in connexion with the high freight rates charged on the export of goods to the mainland. Very often the freight charged for transport to the mainland represents the margin of profit to the grower or manufacturer. In respect of those commodities which we are unable to produce in Tasmania, the Tasmanian people have to pay high freight rates which increase the price of goods in the  local market. Tasmania should be compensated for the disabilities created by its geographical isolation. In contrast to  the  position of Tasmania, Western Australia has railways which were constructed by the Commonwealth. I am very much surprised by the attitude adopted by the honorable members for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> and Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> in regard to this bill. Last year they made no complaint against the grant recommended by the commission, but, at the same time, they made no protest on 'behalf of Tasmania which was then given a very shoddy deal by the commission. To-day, when the State which they represent  is touched in its pocket, theirs is a very different story. Tasmania has never benefited from, bounties, which have been granted to South Australia and Western Australia to an aggregate amount of millions of pounds; nor has it participated to any extent in Commonwealth expenditure from revenue and loan accounts. If honorable members from other States regard that as fair, I cannot understand their psychology. A State which has no disability is not entitled to compensation. The commission has adopted the budgetary basis in calculating the grant that should be made to the claimant States. That will have a bad effect upon Tasmania. I predict, that the grant will be substantially reduced next year. I shall support the amendment of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> as a protest against the reduction made this year, and hope that when Tasmania occupies a similar position, it will receive support from the representatives of South Australia and Western Australia. </para>

I hope that he will be more precise to-night. 1 should also like to know whether the provision of relief for damage caused by droughts or floods is in future to be regarded as a Commonwealth responsi- bility. When a big flood on the northwest coast of Tasmania caused tremendous damage, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cosgrove,</inline> Minister of Agriculture, made representations for Commonwealth assistance, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Lyons) said that every breeze which blew was not a Commonwealth responsibility. If that principle is universally applied, the relief of farmers in drought-stricken areas in other States will not, so far as I am concerned, be any longer regarded as a Commonwealth responsibility. Tasmania has suffered to a greater extent than any other State by reason of Commonwealth policy. I offer jio objection to the Navigation Act or the Arbitration Court, because they have been the means of raising the standard of living of our people. </para>

Act. Those who produce goods in Tasmania and market them on the mainland should be compensated for the adverse position in which they are placed. That would adjust one of their most severe disabilities. Although Tasmania is not a big State, it has some stouthearted citizens who, in grubbing out its tremendous forests, have endured hardships equal to those suffered by men who have gone into the distant parts of Australia. Neither the mining industry nor the timber industry of the State has been assisted, and its potato-growers have not been compensated for losses suffered by reason of seasonal damage or the New Zealand blight, which wiped out thousands of tons of their product. Thos, growers struggled manfully against the ravages of that disease, the blame for the introduction of which rests upon ineffective Commonwealth quarantine administration. I hope that the Treasurer will continue the grant to Tasmania for a further ten years, at an amount of £600,000. </para>

The question of needs was an invention of the commission, and no. one had thought of that in determining grants based on the financial needs of the .States until the commission was appointed. The honorable member might thank the commission for having introduced grants on that basis, because, had that principle not been adopted, Western Australia's position would be very different from what it is to-day. The Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, who each year has given evidence before the commission, has on every occasion stressed the desirability of assessing disabilities due to federation, and the commission has just as consistently professed that it is completely unable to assess disabilities under that heading.

                    <para class="block">That aspect of the subject is then enlarged upon. It may be thought from the speeches of some honorable members to-day that the commission has entirely ignored disabilities, and submitted its own theory concerning financial needs.

                            <para>- I think that it can be assumed that the members of the commission have taken all the obvious, and not so obvious, points into consideration. It has given, three years almost continuously to a special consideration of these problems instead of dealing with them only intermittently, and I venture to suggest that, with the exception of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> there are very few honorable members who have given more than a few hour? study to the subject. To suggest that the commission, having given three years to a study of the financial position of tinStates concerned, should have omitted any consideration of consequence would be ludicrous. In another portion of its report the commission sta.res that grants based on the question of needs cover the net effect of federation and a great deal more besides. </para>

                            <para>- Some honorable members representing South Australia and Western Australia suggest that the grants should be based on disabilities due to federal policy, while others say that the grants should be based on financial needs. What is the basis of financial needs ? In attempting to assess the position of three States, the commission must discover how much money must be provided by other States in order to bring the general standard of the three claimant States to an average level, which they postulate is the average of Queensland and Victoria. On this basis the argument for financial grants is founded essentially on the relatively lower natural resources of the claimant States, and their consequent lower taxable capacity compared with the whole of Australia. I think the commission has done well. If this is to be a federation, the States which have derived the greatest benefit from it - and they are generally admitted to be Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, but particularly the two former - should be prepared to give something to the States which have been least generously treated by nature in the first place. It is to this question of natural disabilities, rather than to disabilities under federation, the commission has addressed itself, and I think it has taken a broader, more high minded, and more generous view than the limited one of some honorable members who have addressed themselves to the subject. For instance, the Leader of the Opposition made some play on the complicated system of adding and subtracting indulged in by the commission in arriving  at  its result. I submit that the complication is only on the surface. It is logical to take the budgets of all the States- </para>

It is a definite advantage to the claimant States to leave out of consideration the budget of the rich and populous and powerful State of New South Wales. </para>

Thus, there is no chance of a State, as the result of extravagant administration, obtaining a higher grant.

Although the Treasury has stated consistently that it believes it would be fairer and more reasonable to take as a basis the disabilities of the States under federation, we cannot answer the commission when it says that it is unable to assess those disabilities accurately enough to base recommendations upon them. We have had to confess that we have not  the wit or the ability to suggest a commoi:gen:c and reasonably fool-proof way in which payment on this basis of disabilities can be arranged. The commission made an attempt to do so, and reached the answer of " nought ". I have, myself, tried, and the officers of my department have devoted a still greater amount of time to the matter, but we have been unsuccessful. </para>

                            <para>- None of them attempted to go into the matter as scientifically as the present commission. Their recommendations were made on a broad, sweeping basis. They worked on the principle that if the grant was £200,000 last year, and things were a little worse the next year, the grant should be increased to £300,000. The amount of a grant rose or fell in accordance with fluctuations in the general economic situation. There is revealed in the Grants Commission's report a degree of scien tific investigation never previously attempted. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot see how we can avoid it. As the honorable member knows, the Government has been anxious to arrive at a long-range formula - some simple method of calculation by which we might determine the amount of the grants for the next three, four, or five years. The commission says that it is is impossible to do this. It says, however, that as the years go on the intensity of the investigation will lessen. During the first two years a tremendous amount of labour was involved, but this year the work was much lighter. Unless the Government instructs the commission to proceed on a different basis, it is probable that, in future, it will require only a few weeks' work to prepare a report and recommendation. I have no other plan to put forward to take the place of this basis of needs, based on budgetary results. I do not particularly like it, but I cannot suggest anything better, and, having some claim to a logical mind, I must accept the basis suggested by the commission, unless it is possible to advance a better method in its place. I say with the greatest of respect that I have heard no arguments in the course of this debate to lead me to alter my opinion. I wish that some simple long-range plan could be devised to enable the Government itself, after a short, investigation to determine what would be a reasonable grant to a particular State. I should be tremendously grateful if any honorable member could propose a workable plan of that nature. </para>

                            <para>- It is true that the commission made a recommendation to the effect that the Commonwealth Government inquire into the question of the inauguration of a comprehensive forestry plan in Tasmania, which, in the course of years, would lead to a revival of prosperity within the State, and so justify either a substantial reduction or a complete discontinuance of grants-in-aid; but this would probably involve making loan moneys available to the State, and it must be remembered that the amount of loan money which the Commonwealth Government has available is limited. The Commonwealth Government has itself accepted this position so as to afford the State governments the fullest access to the loan field. Moreover, the loan programmes of the States and the Commonwealth have already been determined for this year. Any additional money that the Commonwealth might obtain by loan would involve a corresponding reduction of the amount of loan available to the various States. The amount of loan money available at present has been considerably reduced by reason of the fact that private enterprise is operating on the loan market to a considerably greater extent than formerly. </para>

                            <para>- That is true, but where else could money for this purpose be obtained? That particular proposal of the Grants Commission has recently been revived by the Premier of Tasmania, and a technical adviser of the Commonwealth Government is now preparing a report on the subject. "When it is received the Government will give further consideration to the subject. The position is, however, that loan moneys are not now available for this purpose, and our loan programme has been restricted to the narrowest limits, with the result that many public works which in the ordinary way would have been provided for from loan are being paid for out of revenue. The honorable member may rest assured that the fullest consideration will be given to this subject in due course. </para>

                    <para class="block">I had intended to move in accordance with the notice I gave a few days ago the object of which was to provide that financial consideration should he given for disabilities arising from Commonwealth policy and enactments, but I have reviewed the matter and although I have not altered my opinion in any respect, I wish to do the best possible thing thai I can for the State that I represent. Many of the arguments used in the course of this debate have made me feel that the Commonwealth Government's position in this matter might well be likened to that of a publican who in the old days used to fleece the shearer of his cheque and then give him a bottle of whisky to go out and earn another cheque of which he could be fleeced in due course. Any person who could do other than believe that Commonwealth policy, with its high protection, its Navigation Act, and its industrial arbitraton system could do other than operate injuriously in respect of States wholly dependent upon primary production and having to sell their products on the world markets at world parity would surely be a fit inmate for a lunatic asylum or else be capable of completely distorting the facts of a case. I have on a previous occasion directed attention to the fact that in the course of the debate on the Commonwealth Grants Commission Bill the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> in reply to an interjection, gave an assurance that the commission when constituted would have regard to the disabilities which claimant States suffered under Commonwealth policy. The honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> also expressed himself emphatically at that time on the desirableness of that liberty being granted to the commission, yet he also has, in the course of this debate, changed his ground. Unfortunately, the people of Western Australia are becoming accustomed to inconsiderate treatment at the hands of this Parliament. Some years ago I moved a motion in this House to provide that the Commonwealth Constitution should be amended to give Western Australia tariff autonomy for a period of 25 years. If, according to the commission's report, and according to the Treasurer, Western Australia receives as much by way of special grants as it loses because of disabilities due to federal policy, surely it would be wise to give it a concession of this kind. If it enjoyed tariff autonomy for a period such as I have mentioned, it would soon outstrip the rest of Australia, and show the advantages of having such a power. A definite promise was made to me by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> that nothing would he done by the Commonwealth Government to prevent this Parliament from coming to a decision on that matter. He said that he would see that no undue delay occurred in having the matter debated in this House, but the discussion was not permitted. I claim that a breach of faith was committed on that occasion, and now there has been a further breach of faith. </para>

                            <para>- I feel strongly in regard to this matter, because of many of the remarks that have fallen from the Treasurer to-night. He gave the House an exhortation concerning the merits of the members of the commission, and contended that every phase of the subject had been considered. I interjected that Western Australia, over a five-yeal period, had exported goods to the value of £48,000,000 more than the value of its imports from overseas. What compensation is given to the smaller States for the huge sums brought into Australia for its exports of primary products, although they are compelled to pay high prices for the' goods purchased by them from Australian manufacturers? Why did the commission recommend the payment to Western Australia of only £500,000 for tha year 1936-37, when the grant for 1935-36 was £800,000? In view of the conditions obtaining throughout Australia, how can it be said that South Australia is suffering to a greater extent than Western Australia, considering that the tariff and the Navigation Act impose a far greater penalty upon the western State than it does upon South Australia? It is difficult to imagine how any person with common sense can contend that Western Australia is not suffering greater hardship on account of federal policy than any other State. I refrain from again pointing out the many injustices the State suffers. I leave the question to honorable members, hoping that they will see that justice is done to Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not intend to make a lengthy speech in support of the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> and I do not propose to raise any of the issues that have been controversial in this debate since the first measure was discussed yesterday. I merely point out that the commission's recommendations, as far as they apply to Western Australia, are based upon an examination of the budgetary position of that State two years ago, though the grant recommended is for the ensuing financial year. I claim that the conditions in Western Australia this year are not similar to those in the year which the commission investigated. It has recommended a reduction of £300,000 in the grant for this year on the facts of two years ago. I put it to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey),</inline> and the House, that, if this budgetary criterion is to be the permanent method of assessing grants for the future, Western Australia, two years hence, will get a very large increase by way of special grant, because of the position that 110W confronts that State. The year before last, it experienced a partial drought, and serious losses occurred. Th* commission allowed approximately £40,000 as a throw-in to help the State out of its difficulties. Last year, a partial drought was again experienced, and this was reflected in reduced railway revenue and tax collections. I remind the honor-  able member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stacey),</inline> who, when the honorable member for Swan was speaking, interjected that the tax collections make a difference, that if he refers to page 163 of the commission's report, and studies the table showing State taxation collections for 1934-35, he will see that, after allowing for various adjustments, the taxation <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> in Western Australia amounted to £5 10s. 7d. as compared with £5 10s. 3d. in South Australia. There was not the very substantial difference that the honorable gentleman would suggest. Revenue from lotteries and also motor taxation has been omitted and a motor taxation adjustment figure has been produced. It is true that these taxes are less in Western Australia than in Queensland but they are not substantially less than the average for the Commonwealth. I just mention that fact in passing and base my arguments upon the necessities of Western Australia as presented to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> by honorable members from Western Australia on last Monday week. It was stated in that interview, as the Treasurer is aware, that, owing to the prolonged drought in the pastoral areas, 40 per cent, of the sheep would have been lost and the wheat yield, instead of being something like from 28,000,000 to 30,000,000 bushels, was estimated at that time to be not more than 16,000,000 bushels. Owing to a- fortunate rainfall a week ago it is now estimated, I am informed on most reliable authority, that there will be an improvement in the yield to 20,000,000 bushels. By and large that seasonal disaster which has overtaken Western Australia is bound to have a serious effect not only upon Western Australia generally, but also, and more particularly, upon the budgetary position of that State. Revenue in many departments must fall and in addition the expenditure of the Government must be substantially increased as it will have to come to the relief of wheat-growers and pastoralists. Furthermore, increased costs will be incurred in maintaining railway services and ensuring water supplies. If_ the Grants Commission had made any 'kind of prognosis of the position of Western Australia during the two years which have elapsed since the statistical year it has so minutely analysed it would have resisted the temptation to clip £300,000 off the total previous grant of £S00,000. It has, in effect, taken three-eighths off the total. That is a staggering cut and the effect on Western Australia has been most grievous. </para>

                        I speak in this Parliament at this moment as an Australian. I believe in this federation and have fought for it in places where it has been most difficult to support the case for the federation and have borne not only the sins of administrations formed from my own party, but also the sins of every other Commonwealth Government, in order to maintain some support for th'e preservation of the unity of this nation; and I say that the reduction of this grant at this time is a major political calamity to the preservation of Australian unity. It will fan to flame again the fires now dying out which led to the secession campaign and the referendum which took place on that question in Western Australia. It constitutes a grave disservice to those mcnand women in Western Australia who stand up for the federation, and it will be seized upon by every malcontent who is ready to make a scapegoat of this Commonwealth for things for which the Commonwealth should not be blamed. In addition those sincere-minded people who really believe that there is no future for the State except in secession will be reinforced in their previous advocacy, and a new wave of emotionalism which will be destructive of the best interests of the Commonwealth can easily emerge from this legislation.
                    </para>
                    <para>The Treasurer may say that I am disputing the umpire's decision in that the Grants Commission has given its verdict. My only answer on that point is that the verdict has been given on the facts of two years ago and that as a responsible member of this Parliament I am confronted with the factual position of the present and the immediate future. I invite the Treasurer to consult with his colleagues as to how far it would be wise to examine the effect of this decision upon the public life of Western Australia, and how far it would be a contribution towards the order and good government of Australia to say to the commission, " We respect your verdict, but the circumstances have profoundly changed since the year upon the figures of which you based your recommendation for this year." As I have said before, the honorable gentleman must know that two years from now, or next year, on this year's budgetary basis, something else may emerge. For the present from this maelstrom of statistics, this almost intolerable congestion of data, there has emerged a vast bulk of calculations. No man can know what it means except that it is a most exhaustive and exhausting labour to follow the commission through the infinite variety of computations it makes. Whenever it gets into difficulties itself it says that it is theoretically impossible to measure disabilities, and when it is asked to face up to the fact that there are disabilities it finds that there are disabilities, but that those disabilities are cancelled by advantages. Although this report, allowing for the scholarship and knowledge of the men who compiled it, and I have paid tribute to their very great ability more than once, and no one will question their utter impartiality, should be looked upon as a most valuable one, this Parliament ought not to look upon commissions and experts as authoritarians whose decision it is bound to accept without question. In the last resort this Parliament is responsible for the amount of the grant to be given to a State. We may look to the gentlemen who form these commissions for the best advice that they can give, but their advice on this occasion is based on the facts of two years ago, and constitutes no service to the political and economic position confronting Australia to-day. Taking it by and large I recommend the Treasurer to reconsider the matter. It will be no affront to the commission to say to it, "The situation in Western Australia is so pressing and so serious that some variation of your recommendation is deemed to be wise, having regard to the necessities of the State and also having regard to the major political consequences that must follow to this Commonwealth if we remain inactive or negligent or too formally acquiescent in your recommendations while allowing the people of Western </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia to suffer." Last night I argued for a general reconsideration of the merits of the commission's report. It is true that I appeared before the commission on two occasions, on each of which the grant recommended was substantial. This year I was not able to appear on behalf of Western Australia. I do not say that its case suffered because of my absence, or because of any failure on the part of those who submitted its case; but I do say most definitely that the commission could not have been human if it had not been influenced by considerations which were political in their nature. When the secession campaign was in progress it would have been suicidal for the commission to recommend any reduction of the grant then being paid to Western Australia, and no reduction was made. But now that the secession campaign has finished, or appears to have been finished, a reduction is made so substantial that it appears to me to be founded on a most, erroneous calculation. I have no more to say at this hour; if I had risen earlier I should have spoken at greater length. </para>
                    <para>I return to a point which is distinctly relevant to this matter, -although to many honorable members it may not appear to be germane to the subject. The great majority of honorable members of this House come from the more densely populated States. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> said to-night that one-third of the territory of this vast continent is occupied by one-sixteenth of its people. Western Australia sends to this Parliament eleven representatives out of a total of 110. Those members are dis.tributed in two chambers, five of them being in the House of Representatives, where 74 members are entitled to vote. That is to say, Western Australia has about one-fifteenth of the voting strength of this chamber. Although the members from that State speak for only onesixteenth of the people of the Commonwealth, they represent a vast State whose resources are widely distributed over its territory. Communications between the areas capable of immediate settlement are costly to maintain. Vast distances have to be traversed by rail and road to connect those small settlements which, although poor at present, none the less make an important contribution towards the security and safety of Australia. I say to this House, from the very depth of my being, that although that onesixteenth of the population of the Commonwealth who reside, in Western Aus-" tralia may not be able to return to the Commonwealth as much revenue as the Commonwealth expends in that territory, as set out in. the table of allocation of Commonwealth revenue in the commission's report, there is another side of the subject which ought to be considered. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie put it plainly when he said that the people of Western Australia purchase each year from the eastern States goods to the value of £9,000,000. Western Australia provides a better market than does Belgium or Czechoslovakia, with which countries trade treaties have recently been made. It represents also a better market than does the dominion of New Zealand, with which, so far, it has been impossible to negotiate a trade treaty. It is as good a market as is Canada, with which a trade treaty was entered into some time ago, and is, I understand, about to be renewed.  With the exception of the United Kingdom and Japan, Western Australia provides for the rest of the Commonwealth a market as valuable as that in any other part of the world. </para>

                            <para>- This Parliament should keep clearly in mind that Western Australia is the greatest market that has yet been found' by manufacturers of the eastern States for processed goods and manufactured articles. Outside of their own home-consumption market in Victoria and New South Wales, the secondary industries of Australia have no market anywhere in the world as good as that provided by the 450,000 people of Western Australia. I go back to my point. If needs are to be the basis of these grants, then the needs of Western Australia this year are such as to warrant the amount of the special grant being maintained at the figure at which it stood last year. Disregarding all considerations of party politics and my objections to the. report of the commission,  I  invite the Treasurer most, seriously to  consider  whether it would not be a supreme act of sagacity on the part of a government which has the best interests of Australia at heart to increase the amount of the grant to £800,000, the figure at which it, stood last year. </para>

The Commonwealth Government should not lose sight of the fact that soon the electors of these States will be asked to grant additional power* to the Commonwealth. The cutting down of the grants in the way contemplated by these hills is not likely to create a favorable atmosphere in which to conduct a referendum seeking additional powers for the Commonwealth. The feeling in Western Australia is bound to be fairly hostile to the Commonwealth; aud I know that the case against the Commonwealth in South Australia will be that the only reward which the people of that State are to receive for submitting to heavy taxation for a number of years, thereby enabling its budget to be balanced, is a reduction of the grant by £170,000. That consideration alone should have been sufficient to cause the Commonwealth Government to think a little more deeply before committing itself to the recommendation of the commission. </para>

If certain persons with anti-federal tendencies seek to make capital out of the present situation, they must indeed be on a sharp lookout for arguments to be used against the Commonwealth. The report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission must be regarded as a whole. The commission's latest report is based on figures for the last financial year available to it, namely, 1934-35. I point out that,. instead of the time lag being two years, as has been stated to-night, only ten months had passed when the report was prepared, and even now only fifteen months have elapsed since those figures were made available. The commission made its report on the basis of the figures for the last financial year available to it. </para>

                            <para>- The amount recommended for this year is certainly less than the grant for last year; but I ask the Leader of the Opposition to compare the budgetary results on which the two recommendations were made. Although the budget of Western Australia shows an improvement of £900,000 compared with the previous year, the grant has been reduced by only £300,000, namely, from £800,000 to £500,000. </para>

                    <para>If some of the honorable member's potential anti-federalists in Western Australia make capital out of this situation, I suggest that Western Australian members on both sides of the House should make more of the facts known in common honesty, and in keeping with some of the high ideals that the Leader of the Opposition has expressed in his Australianism. I do not think honorable members on this side of the House have any reason to apologize for their degree of Australianism. It is possible to make an emotional appeal on almostany subject. The Leader of the Opposition has made an emotional appeal this evening, which I venture to think disregards the essential facts of the situation. If the honorable gentleman's speech is reported in the Western Australian press - and I hare no doubt it will be almost verbatim - it will do a great deal of harm in Western Australia, and a great deal more harm to the federal cause than the potential anti-federalists in Perth. It is not a question of party politics. I remind the honorable member that the drop from £800,000 to £500,000 is based on the drop of the deficit from £1,800,000- that is, the deficit adjusted on a basis comparable to that of other States- to £905,000. These facts should be made known to the potential antifederalists in Western Australia at the same time as these people are made aware of the emotional appeals made by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>
