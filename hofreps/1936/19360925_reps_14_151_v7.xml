                        <para>- I ask the Acting Leader of the House whether the attention of the Government has been drawn to the remarks of the Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stevens,</inline> published in yesterday&#39;s Sydney Sim, to the effect that he had been told that the extraction of oil from coal by the hydrogenation process now presented no further difficulties, and that it was merely a matter of constructing the necessary plant? How does the right honorable gentleman reconcile this statement with that which the Prime Minister made in this House on the 30th April last, that approximately twelve months, and possibly longer, would elapse before Imperial Chemical Industries Limited would  be able to determine whether it was practicable or desirable to establish a unit in Australia? Was the Premier of New South Wales invited by the Commonwealth to make investigations into the production of oil from coal during his visit abroad? If so, why is the Commonwealth spending a considerable sum on a visit by the chief executive officer of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett, to England and Germany to investigate the problem? Of whom are we to take notice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett or the Premier of New South Wales? Does it not appear that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stevens</inline> is convinced that this industry should be immediately established, and that he proposes to establish it in New South Wales? What assistance does the Commonwealth intend to give? </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen the report to which the honorable member has directed attention. I refer him to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett as to the procedure which should be adopted. That gentleman, who is at present making inquiries in Great Britain and Germany into processes for the production of oil from coal, has intimated that Imperial Chemical Industries Limited is not yet in a position to design a plant for Australia. He has urged, therefore, that Australia should wait until certain essential improvements have been made to the plant before concluding any arrangements with Imperial Chemical Industries Limited. He has also advised that the results of investigations into the German process known as the Fischer-Trobsch  process should be awaited before any decision is made in regard to the establishment of a plant in Australia. He is impressed with the possibilities of this latter plant, and is prosecuting further inquiries in regard to it. Honorable members will readily realize that, because of the revolutionary nature of the circumstances surrounding the production of oil fuel, it is imperative that Australia should start off on the right foot. That is what the Government is attempting to do. </para>

                        <para>- In the existing federal aid roads agreement no restriction is placed upon the States as to the roads upon which the money shall be spent. When the matter was discussed at the recent Premiers Conference in Adelaide, it was agreed that the existing agreement in its present form should be renewed for ten years. An additional amount, representing one half-penny a gallon on petrol, is to be made available to the States for general purposes, to be used by them on roads or public works or for forestry purposes. </para>

                            <para>- It would be difficult and invidious to place a restriction on the States as to what proportion of the money should be spent on main roads, and what proportion on other than main roads. The policy of the Commonwealth Government has always been to place as few restrictions as possible on money grants to the States. At the present time, no restrictions are imposed in respect of this grant. The States may spend any proportion they like on local roads, or may have the work carried out through the local shire councils. It is proposed in the new agreement to place an obligation on the States to maintain roads in the vicinity of defence and other Commonwealth establishments situated within the States. At present, there is some doubt as to who is responsible for this work. </para>

The Treasurer, who replied, promised me that he would take the matter up with the Minister for External Affairs, and furnish me with a reply. I should like to know whether he proposes to do so, or whether the somewhat flippant reply he gave me on the previous occasion is to be regarded as final? </para>

                    <para>.- The Opposition does not intend to oppose this measure. The sales tax is a most unpopular impost which was introduced at a time of national emergency when Australia was at the depth of the depression, and it was generally understood at that time that reductions would be made in the rate of the tax from time to time as finances permitted. The sales tax has been a prolific money spinner for the Treasury, its yield in each financial year that it has been in operation having been as follows: - </para>

                </para>
                <para class="block">Et has been suggested in various quarters that the sales tax should be entirely discontinued, and I should like to see the state of the Commonwealth finances so buoyant as to enable that to be done; but at present I quite appreciate that, the Treasurer would find difficulty in securing an additional &#163;9,432,000 m taxation from other sources. We have to remember that, so far, the financial emergency cuts have not been completely restored. Probably had the Labour party been in office, the form of taxation as well as the nature of the tax remissions would have been entirely changed from those favoured by this Government. I am sure that the financial emergency reductions would have been fully restored long before this. </para>
                <para class="block">The Labour party is always anxious to lift the burden of taxation from the shoulders of the poorer sections of the community who are least able to bear it; but the policy enunciated by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> indicates clearly that this Government stands for the remission of taxes to the wealthy section of the community in preference to the lifting of the burden from the poorer people. Since this Government has been in office the volume of indirect taxation has been increased substantially. In 1930-31 indirect taxation yielded &#163;31,768,000 to the Treasury, but by 1935-36 the total had increased to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;52,021,000, or</inline> an increase of about &#163;20,300,000. The total <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> imposition advanced from &#163;4 18s. Id. in 1930-31 to &#163;7 14s. Id. in 1935-36. Taking direct and indirect taxation together we find that since this Government has been in office the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> impost has advanced from &#163;7 los. Sd. to &#163;9 8s. 5d. </para>
                <para>A small measure of relief will no doubt be afforded to certain people by the passage of this bill, and for that reason the Labour party does not intend to oppose it ; but the reduction of the sale3 tax from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent.- </para>

                        <para>- The Government is proposing that certain items should be added to the list of exemptions, but there has been a general exemption which represents about 2&#163;d. in the &#163;1. Has the Government considered the  advisableness  of making a much steeper general reduction in preference to increasing th? list of exempt goods? It is hardly probable that the small general reduction of 1 per cent, will be passed on to the general public as completely as it should be. </para>

                        <para>- I was suggesting another way by which the Treasurer could lift the burden of taxation. I ask whether the Government has seriously considered the desirability of further tapering down the general rate of tax in preference to granting additional exemptions? It appears to me that the honorable gentleman is finding increasing difficulty in satisfactorily defining the phrase &#34; aids to manufacture.&#34; Could not a varying rate of tax be applied to what might be called luxury lines as against other lines? </para>

                    <para>When we do reach the position when reductions are possible, I should prefer to see the rate of sales tax reduced rather than the number of exemptions increased. My Government granted certain exemptions for a special reason. This Government is increasing the list of exemptions merely because it has received requests from various influential sources. One would-imagine that great concessions were being granted to those people who have to exist on thu production of food supplies. I point out that the basic foods of the people were exempted when the sales tax was originally imposed. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>The views enunciated by the right honorable member on the occasion are worthy of the most serious consideration. Under the policy which the Government is now pursuing, a boot and shoe merchant who has just bought largely will be obliged to pay sales tax at the rate of 5 per cent, on his purchases; whereas another person in the same line of business who makes purchases after the passage of this bill will be relieved of the obligation to pay any sales tax. Those two traders will be in an unfair position in relation to each other. I should like the Treasurer to explain why boots and shoes have been exempt from sales tax, while other wearing apparel has not been <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> treated. The average man will now have to pay sales tax on, say, his singlets, while his boots will be exempt. I should like to see both classes exempted. </para>
                <para>Undoubtedly quite a considerable proportion of the relief that is being granted from sales tax by this measure and the one which granted a general reduction of the rate of tax will not be passed on to the consumers. Has the department gone into this aspect very carefully?- </para>
                <para class="block">What guarantee is there that this small reduction of the rates of sales tax from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent., which is equivalent to a reduction of <inline font-style="italic">2$i.</inline> in the &#163;1, will be passed on to the consumer? The Government should have made a much steeper general reduction of the rates with a view to ensuring that the concessions would be passed on to the consumers. </para>

                    <para>.- As the result of the system of making exemptions, it must follow that the position in regard to sales taxation generally must become more and more complex to the business community. For this reason I am pleased that the Government has seen fit to issue an explanatory book covering the various amendments and decisions in respect of this tax. Furthermore, as the result of these various amendments, it will be more difficult for the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> to make an accurate estimate of the revenue to he expected from sales tax, and, in that direction, I sympathize with him. I notice that the New South Wales Auditor-General, in his last annual report, criticized the Government of New South Wales for over-estimating its revenue, whilst the other day a university professor of economics criticized the Federal Treasurer for under-estimating his revenue. This is perhaps another illustration of the fact that economists, like medical doctors, sometimes disagree on fundamentals. If any criticism  can be levelled against the Federal Treasurer, it is that he errs on the side of conservatism; and, in financial circles, that is considered to he a virtue. </para>

                <para>Two items which I should have been glad to see in the latest list of exemptions from sales tax are biscuits and materials used by professional photographers. It is apparent that biscuits are becoming increasingly used among the middle classes and the poorer sections of the community. They can now he regarded as a basic foodstuff and should have equal claim for exemption as pastry and cakes which are free from tax. If it is not possible to include them in this list I hope that the Treasurer will exempt them on the next occasion. </para>
                <para>The Government has been requested repeatedly to exempt material used by  professional photographers. These have suffered serious loss of business over the last few years, mainly because of the increased price of their materials due to sales tax. In many instances photographs are necessary for business and private records. </para>
                <para>I am pleased that the Government has been able to allow further exemptions, as proposed in this legislation, and I cannot agree with the argument of honorable members opposite that the benefit of these exemptions cannot be passed on to consumers because the reduction is infinitesimal. I point out that reductions affecting the general incidence of  sale3  tax amount to 20 per cent. Whereas the sales tax previously was 6 per cent.&#34;, it is now 4 per cent., a reduction of one-third having been made in the rate of tax. This is a substantial reduction. I again appeal to the Treasurer to give consideration to exempting biscuits and photographic materials when the next list of exemptions is being compiled. </para>

                    <para>. - lam glad that the Government has been able to exempt further goods from sales tax, as proposed in this legislation. Complete exemption is the best way to give relief to the consuming public, because there can be no doubt that the benefits will then be passed on to consumers. On the last occasion when exemptions from sales tax were under consideration, I pressed for the exemption of macaroni, and it appears to me that it is because of some mistake that this product has been omitted from the list now before the House. In recent years macaroni has become an article of common diet. I have been informed by people engaged in its manufacture that, owing to the high price of potatoes, it has largely supplanted potatoes as a food. Furthermore, people are developing a taste for macaroni. </para>

                <para>Three large factories in Victoria, three in New South Wales, and one in Western Australia, are now engaged in its manufacture. These are equipped with efficient plant, and the manufacturers are now able to procure in Australia wheat of the special quality which they require. South Australian growers have overcome many difficulties to produce this special quality, with the result that macaroni made from their wheat is as good as any that can be procured in any other part of the world. Ninety per cent, of the macaroni consumed in Australia is made in this country, and, as I have already said, the price is steadily decreasing as the result of the increasing demand. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weston,</inline> of Hancock&#39;s Golden Crust Proprietary Limited, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spry,</inline> of Macaroni Products Proprietary Limited, two of the leading firms engaged in the manufacture of this food in Australia, have assured me that, if relief were given by way of exemption from sales tax, it would be immediately passed on to consumers. Not so long ago, macaroni, spaghetti, and vermicelli were regarded as restaurant lines, but now they are included on the daily menu in nearly every home in this country. I press my request, particularly in view of the statement by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> that the more common foodstuffs should be the first to be exempted. Last week I endeavoured to persuade him to give immediate consideration to ray request; I have not yet received his answer, but I anticipate he will be able to give it during this debate. Four thousand bushels of durum wheat are used every week in the manufacture of macaroni in Australia; this is no small consideration. Furthermore, employment is given directly to 500 or 600 mcn, and to many more indirectly, and all of the raw materials required for the manufacture of this foodstuff are grown in the* country. Durum wheat is mostly grown in. the electorate of Wakefield, and it is the hardest and clearest that could possibly be procured for the manufacture of transparent flour essential in the manufacture of macaroni. </para>

                    <para>. -  I congratulate the Government on the numerous exemptions it has made from sales tax, not only on this occasion, but also on others. I ask, however, that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> strain a point on this occasion to include two other items - biscuits, and machinery required by local governing &#39;bodies for road-making. Almost every honorable member- has requested that machinery used by municipalities and shire councils for roadmaking be exempted. Sales tax on such machinery is most unfair as machinery used for similar purposes by governments is exempt. It is really a case of one government authority taxing another government authority. This tax has proved a serious drain on the finances of most local governing bodies. Along with other honorable members, I have pressed this request for several years. We were successful in having the material used in road-making exempt from sales tax, but the Government should now go a step further and exempt road-making machinery. With regard to biscuits I put it that this is a common foodstuff and I ask the Treasurer to exempt this item also from sales tax. Biscuits are not a luxury food. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jennings)</inline> expressed the opinion that, as the result of the amendments made to sales tax legislation, the business community was  becoming more and more perplexed. That is true, but I also point out that, for the same reason, the general public are not only perplexed, but exploited as well. I doubt whether the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> is sincere in his optimism that the benefits of these exemptions will be passed on to consumers. The proposed concessions are so small that it would be impossible for the consumers to benefit. Business men in small shops will certainly not be anxious to tell customers that slight reductions of sales tax have been made on articles about to be purchased. Consequently, while it may be intended that these concessions should be passed on to the purchasing public, I have not the slightest doubt that that will not be the case. The sales tax was imposed at a time of financial stringency, and it has been taken necessarily from the purchasing public. The bulk of the revenue has come from the pockets of the people whose purchasing power is low, because this section is the largest in the community. Therefore, it would be immoral not to give the poorest classes the benefit of the proposed reduction of tax. Care should be taken that the present proposals do not result in further exploitation of the people. General recognition is given to the principle that taxation should be placed on the backs of those most able to bear it, but the sales tax does no operate equitably. Although it is gratifying to hear that boots are to be exempt, I should like to know the reason why the wearing apparel of the poorer classes is still to carry the tax. It would be much more healthy for a person to go without boots than without clothing for the body, and blankets with which to ward off the cold. I do not care how much sales tax is placed on the highpriced clothing that is commonly purchased by the wealthy, because it imposes no hardship on them; but people on relief work, and all others who are suffering a reduction of their purchasing power, should be completely freed from the impost. I suggest that all clothing, from the cheaper to the middle classes of goods, should be exempt. I hope the Treasurer will explain why the Government intends to exempt boots, but not wearing apparel. </para>

                    <para>. -  In view of the representations made to the Government during the last eighteen months, the time has arrived when machinery, including tractors, used by local governing bodies, should be exempt from the sales tax. I am entirely in agreement with the remarks of the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stacey)</inline> in this regard. I hope that at a later stage the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> will indicate the Government&#39;s attitude; otherwise I shall be obliged to te3t the feeling of the committee by submitting an amendment. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> has drawn attention to the position with regard to semolina and macaroni. An industry of this description should not be penalized. I realize that the exigencies of &#39;governmental finance still make the collection of sales tax on some items necessary, but favorable consideration should be given to the removal of the impost from foodstuffs and clothing. I do not consider it right in principle for the Commonwealth authorities to collect sales tax on purchases made by local governing bodies, which, in turn, have to recover the tax by means of increases of local rates. This is an undignified procedure on the part of the Commonwealth, and it should be unnecessary. </para>

                    <para>.- Certain mixed biscuits made in Hobart are consumed extensively by people of .the poorer classes, and it is desired that these articles should be exempt. I refer to biscuits largely purchased in feeding children in somewhat delicate health from the age of two years upwards. Their malnutrition has resulted, <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> doubt, from the fact that their mothers have been under-nourished. </para>

                <para>Blankets purchased by the poor should not carry sales tax. These people require more warmth than members of the wealthy classes, because they are not so well fed. All the foodstuffs ordinarily purchased by the poorer classes, particularly in the cities, should be exempt. Taxation proposals are often submitted as the result of information supplied by officers who have no intimate knowledge of the hardships suffered by the poor. All sales tax legislation should be abolished. The only way to rectify anomalies, if the tax is to be retained, is to place the impost upon the wealthy, and, as far as possible, exempt the poor. </para>
                <para>Although the Government has relieved the wealthy class of the obligation of paying taxes amounting to millions of pounds, it has not removed the sales tax on many of the articles required by the poorer section of the community. The poor wear out more clothes than the middle and wealthy classes, because  the  &#39; kind of material which they purchase for wearing apparel is necessarily of inferior quality. Such a consideration should not be disregarded if justice is to be fairly given to every section. The continuance of the sales tax upon commodities where required by the poor is a deterrent to their having large families. If the tax were removed, their economic position would be improved and they would ba encouraged to rear more children, until eventually it would be found that the natural increase of population rendered unnecessary the reintroduction of a policy of migration. </para>
                <para>In. view of the magnificent budget which the Treasurer has presented and the hidden reserves, which I believe that he has, I hope that Le will exempt the necessaries of life from sales tax in the direction that I have intimated. </para>

                    <para>.- This is one of the bills to which I feel that I can give my hearty support. On numerous occasions in the past I have expressed my antagonism, to the sales tax, which I regard as a real tax on industry. Although  the  Government derives tremendous sums of money from this source and they are easy to collect, the tax itself weighs heavily upon industry. The proposed exemptions will receive my wholehearted support, and I shall be gratified when the last vestiges of this legislation are removed from the statute book. At the present time, despite their reluctance to lose such a fruitful source of revenue, the governments of other countries are remitting their sales taxes. I support this measure, which is similarly designed, feeling that it is along the right lines. Nevertheless in view of the fact that tha Government did not consider the time opportune to repeal the sales tax legislation completely, I think the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> could have reduced &#39; ti <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> rate to 3$ per cent., which would  have  facilitated the calculation of returns by the business community. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I am gratified that the Government has seen its way clear to exempt from sales tax materials which are required by the building trade. When the tax was reduced from 6 per cent, to 5 per cent., u. substantia&#93; improvement was reported u&#62; the building trade, and I consider thai  this further concession will be reflected in a continuation of that improvement. Throughout the Commonwealth at the present time, there is a great shortage of houses, and the relief that the Treasurer has been able to give to the industry should give another stimulus to the trade. I do not agree altogether with the action taken by the Government regarding the importation of oregon. I consider that it has acted unwisely. In order to create employment, the Government decided that it would reduce the general tariff on oregon logs entering Australia </para>

                        <para>- For a considerable time honorable members on both sides of the House have advocated that road-making machinery, which is used by municipalities and shire councils, should be afforded some relief from sales tax. In this connexion an anomalous position exists, because road-making machinery, the property of State governments, is not subject to the tax, whereas plant owned by municipalities and -shire councils is subject to it. These bodies are carrying out most important work, and should be granted the same privilege in this connexion as State governments. If the Treasurer does not see fit to accede to this request, I shall be obliged to vote against the particular item when it is considered in committee. I do not make that statement as a threat, but I emphasize that honorable members have frequently advocated the adoption of this proposal and the time is now opportune for it to be done. </para>

                <para>I am surprised that the Treasurer has not exempted all foodstuffs from the obligation to pay sales tax. &#34;When the Government finds itself in a position to reduce the burden of taxation on the public, one of the first items to be exempted from any impositions should be foodstuffs. Honorable members have referred to biscuits of certain types still being subject to the sales tax. The manufacture of biscuits is an important industry in South Australia, and portion of the output is sold in other States. Even at this late stage, the Government should take action to include this foodstuff in the list of exemptions. </para>
                <para>In the main, I am entirely in accord with the bill, and shall support it if only on the ground that I consider that the sales tax should never have been imposed, although it is a great source of revenue. Whenever an opportunity presents itself, I shall vote for a reduction of this tax with a view to its ultimate removal from the statute-hook. </para>

                    <para>.- In view of the fact that the sales tax was introduced as an emergency measure, I had hoped that it would have been repealed before now. When the tax was imposed in 1931, the administration received numerous requests to exempt certain articles, and in this connexion foodstuffs received particular consideration. I am gratified that the Government has removed sales tax from certain articles, such as spray guns, pumps, &#38;c., which are of immense value to the primary producer in assisting him to combat many pests, but I am disappointed that the exemptions do not include biscuits. They are a commodity which is extensively used by all sections of the community. I understand that the tax has been removed from .biscuits which are used in the nursery and from the more expensive types, but those which are bought by the workers and the middle-class generally are still subject to this imposition. Everything used in the manufacture of biscuits is grown in Australia; consequently the primary producer also is taxed. Only a small crop of wheat is grown in Tasmania, and the bulk of it is sold to biscuit manufacturers on the mainland, because it has been proved to be superior to other wheats for -the manufacture of biscuits, by reason of the fact that it is grown in a moist climate. The biscuit manufacturers are penalized, because they are unable to pass the tax on to the consumer and, in addition, have to compete with imported  biscuits. They have written to honorable members in all States, asking to be relieved of this tax, which haa been a burden on them ever since it was first imposed. The Government would he well advised to include all biscuits in the list of exemptions. I congratulate it upon having exempted such items as boots and machinery. </para>

Cold storage is a matter of considerable importance in connexion with primary production. In Queensland, the cold stores handle not only butter, but also other exportable commodities such as meat, pork, lard, egg pulp and fruit. The particular items on which the removal of sales tax is sought, are - ammonia, calcium chloride, ammonia piping, multivane fans, oil and machinery such as motors, gear drives, &#38;c. It is pointed out that ammonia purchased for use in butter factories is exempt from the sales tax, but in other cases is subject to the tax. </para>

                <para>Mr.NOCK (Riverina). &#91;12.5&#93;.- Twelve months ago I criticized the Government for having failed to give the measure of relief from emergency taxation which I considered was then justified. The surplus which the last budget revealed showed that my complaint was well founded. A larger measure of relief could have been given last year. I welcome the proposals this year for the reduction of the rate of tax and the enlargement of the list of exemptions. But there are still some items which should have, and I hope will be given, consideration. Several honorable members have referred to road-making machinery used by shires and municipalities. In one or two cases, from &#163;70 to &#163;100 has been collected from a country shire as sales tax on a tractor required for roadmaking purposes. The shire council is really being made a tax gatherer. It collects rates from the people on the land for the purpose of making roads, and portion of the revenue thus received has to be paid to the Federal Government in the form of sales tax on the tractor required for that work. That is an anomaly into which the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> might well look. I recognize that there isa limit to the relief which can be given, and that there may be some factor which has prevented the granting of an exemption in this particular case. I am pleased that the tax has been removed from bitumen and practically all other road-making material. I am sure that all honorable members are delighted to find tea, coffee, cocoa, piping, oils, and footwear included in the list of exemptions. In the rural industries, the tax on oils has been heavy, and has been felt considerably. The whole of the community will be relieved by that exemption. Footwear is needed by every member of the community, and the Government is acting wisely in exempting that item, as well as tea, coffee, and cocoa. The Government is wise in seeing that the relief from this emergency taxation is being spread justly and reasonably throughout the whole community. </para>

                    <para>.- There are two matters which I wish to raise. Before doing so, however, I commend the Government for having substantially reduced the rate of sales tax and increased the range of exemptions. The Government which imposed this tax in the first place stated that it was an emergency measure, and the present Government has adopted throughout the attitude &#39;that, with the passing of the financial crisis that engendered it, the burden of the tax should be lifted. Consequently, there has been a gradual lightening of that burden. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In respect of bespoke tailoring, the Government proposes to reduce from 66f per -cent, to 50 per cent, the proportion of the sale price on which the tax is levied. I should like the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> to state whether, in the case of a tailor who purchases Australian cloth  on which sales tax has been paid, the tax has also to be paid on the manufactured article. </para>
                <para>Tea, coffee, cocoa, and other drinks of a like nature have been included in the list of exemptions. I hope that the Treasurer will take the earliest opportunity to add aerated waters to the list. They cannot logically be classed *as a luxury, any more than can tea, coffee, and cocoa. The cost of a bottle of aerated waters is no greater than that of a pot of tea. Unquestionably, the poorer sections of the community are responsible for the largest proportion of the consumption. Aerated waters are virtually a foodstuff, and in the warm weather particularly, considerable quantities are consumed by the Australian public. For different reasons, the sales tax is particularly burdensome on this particular industry. In the first place, it is almost impossible to pass on the tax, because the article has a small cost price. In the second place, the tax is particularly vexatious to the wholesale manufacturer, because he deals with so many customers in the ranks of grocers and sweets-shop proprietors who purchase, relatively small quantities. To him, the administrative cost is very heavy, and the inconvenience very great. I know one manufacturing concern which considers that, in its case, the administrative costs in connexion with collection and additional accounting, amount to &#163;700 a year. I therefore urge the Treasurer to remove aerated waters from the incidence of the tax as soon  as  that course is practicable. </para>

Recently, I communicated with the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> at the request of the Queensland Cold Storage Co-operative Federation Limited. This company has cold stores on the Brisbane River, in the Lilley electorate, which are probably as modern and up to date as any in the Commonwealth. It has communicated with me, urgently requesting the exemption from sales tax of practically the same items as have been mentioned by the honorable member for Darling Downs. It is pointed out that ammonia which is used in butter factories is exempt from sales tax, but that ammonia which is purchased for cold-storage purposes is liable to the tax. That would appear to be a most definite anomaly, which should be rectified immediately. These cold stores are used for the storing of butter for shipment, and are really leased to the dairy companies of Queensland, which are responsible for their running and upkeep. </para>

                    <para>. - Any measure that has for its object the reduction of sales tax will meet with my support. In my opinion, sales tax is probably the most burdensome tax which the community has to bear, though it is one which I know any government would be loath to abandon because it is such an excellent money-spinner. I realize-that it is possible for honorable members to bring forward innumerable requests for exemption, and to support them by convincing arguments, but I also realize that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> must draw the line somewhere, and, on the whole, he has done a good job. </para>

                <para>I am of the opinion, however, that favorable consideration should be given to the request for the remission of sales tax on machinery, &#38;c, used by municipalities. A municipality has to collect revenue from its ratepayers, and it seems extraordinary that part of that revenue should have to be handed over to the Government in the form of taxation. Some   extraordinary anomalies existed in the past in this regard. For instance, there was the case of one municipality in my district which was called upon to pay sales tax on road metal, which it took from its own quarry, crushed with its own machinery and spread on its own roads. That position has since been remedied. Only recently, however, the same municipality bought a power grader upon which it had to pay between &#163;30 and &#163;40 in sales tax. No doubt the argument will be put forward that the ratepayers would not benefit in the form of reduced rates even if the sales tax were remitted, and while that may be so the fact remains that sales tax paid by a municipality in the course of a year might be just enough to make all the difference between a settler having a road made to his property or not. </para>
                <para>I desire to support the request of the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> that sales tax on aerated waters be remitted. I cannot see why aerated waters should be subject to this tax any more than tea is. They are not a luxury, and are consumed largely by the poorer sections of the community, particularly by children during the warm weather. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to learn from the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey j whether sales tax is collected on helmets used by miners. These helmets were first used in the Broken Hill mine, and their use has now become general throughout Australia. They are really necessary for the safety of the miners as a protection against falling rock. The remission of sales tax on this item would be a small matter to the Treasury, but would be of considerable importance to the miners, who have to pay as much as 12s. 6d. each for the helmets.</inline></para>

                <para>I join with other honorable members who have requested that sales tax be remitted on machinery used by municipalities. In the more remote parts of Australia, municipalities have the greatest difficulty in maintaining roads at all. They are usually too impoverished to metal the roads, and must try to keep them in order by the use of road formers and rollers. It is not right, therefore, that they should be taxed on the price of these necessary machines. </para>
                <para>A very wide list of exemptions has been granted in this bill, many of them .to manufacturers who, I presume, will pass on the benefits received. Tax remissions have also been made in connexion with the dried fruits industry, fishing and&#39; irrigation works. It is gratifying to observe that sales tax has been remitted on foodstuffs, as well as on building materials and footwear. There is one remarkable omission, however; no&#39; remission whatever has been made in respect of materials used in the mining industry. It is evident that an attempt has been made to please everybody of importance to the Government, but nothing has been done for the gold-mining industry. The schedule to the Sales Tax Assessment Act shows that with one exception, tax is still imposed on chemicals for use in research in mining laboratories; on clocks for time-keeping and other purposes, often of a most elaborate kind, used in the mining industry ; and on locomotives for general &#39;hauling, which I presume includes locomotives used in mines. The old practice of putting in only  a  small drive just large enough for a man to pass has been abandoned in big mines, and drives, big enough to carry a set of rails for a locomotive and trucks, have been constructed in most of the large mines in Australia to-day. In this way a great deal more material can be shifted in the same time. I make this appeal not so much for the benefit of the established and profitable mines, as far those that we are trying to bring about profitable production. </para>
                <para>Sales tax still applies to machinery and apparatus used for scooping sand from river beds, &#38;c, <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> that I presume it also applies to machinery used in connexion with the manufacture of lime from shells recovered from the soil.. This is used, in many parts of &#34;Western Australia as an aid to agriculture. No exemption has been granted in respect of motor vehicles fitted with wireless apparatus and photographic equipment for geophysical survey work in connexion with prospecting for minerals. No one knows better than the Treasurer, who is a mining engineer, that this is one of the branches of mining which offer great promise. Oxygen used in cutting metal for mining operations is not exempt, nor are paints which are used in large quantities on mining plant. Equipment for the production of zinc shavings used in the recovery of gold by the cyanide process should be exempt, particularly as such a small amount of revenue is involved. Power cranes for the erection of engines and overhaul purposes are also still subject to sales tax, and so, apparently, are rubber waders. </para>

As the Treasurer is aware, mine managers always have their private residences connected by telephone with the underground workings of their mines so that the underground managers may keep them informed as to the safety of the workings. Surely such equipment should also be exempt. </para>

I ask the Treasurer to give this subject more careful attention. </para>

                    <para>.- As  the  Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> knows, I have consistently opposed the method that has been adopted to collect sales tax. It would have been far better had the sales tax been imposed on all sales other than sales for export, for that would have permitted the imposition of a lower rate of tax for an equivalent revenue to that which we are now receiving, and business people would have appreciated the simpler procedure that would then have been possible. However, the existing system has &#39; been developed, and even though  the  Treasurer himself were to-day favorable to the method I suggest, &#39;it would be almost impossible to make the change over. </para>

                <para>It is strange to me that  Bales  tax should still be imposed upon articles used by people who are taxing themselves in certain  ways  in order to overcome pests of one kind and another. In Western Australia,  for  example, rabbits, foxes, and  even  eagles and emus lately, have become serious  pests,  yet in consequence of the restrictions imposed by the Customs Department, people are unable to obtain ammunition for use in the Remington rifles that have been purchased to kill these animals and birds. There is an absolute embargo on the importation of such ammunition. It is unreasonable, also, that sales tax should be imposed on ordinary ammunition used to destroy pests, for the eradication of which the settlers impose levies  on  themselves. I  a3k  the Treasurer to consider whether ammunition used  for this  purpose may  not  be exempt from sales tax. I believe that 40,000 foxes were killed in Western Australia last year. A bonus of 5s,  a  scalp - the amount may vary slightly from time to time - is paid from the State vermin destruction organization in respect of all foxes killed. </para>

No reasonable doubt exists as to what the intention of the Government is. If manufacturers are in doubt on the subject, and send to the department the names of the items they consider should be exempt, together with a definite description of them, and also indicate the manner in which the particular materials are used, no great difficulty should arise. It must be made clear, of course, that none of the materials will remain in the finished article. </para>

                        <para>- To indicate the nature of the trouble that I fear will arise, I direct the attention of the Treasurer to certain articles which seem to me to offer scope for divergence of opinion. Take, for example, cotton filter cloth which is used in certain processes where filtration takes place after the treatment of materials with chemicals. Woollen filter cloth is used for the same purpose from time to time in cases where the action of the chemicals is severe on ootton. Coir matting and camel hair press cloth used for enclosing oil seed during the process of oil expression under hydraulic pressure is also likely to cause difficulty. Roller composition used for the manufacture of inking rollers for printing machines may present a problem and so may bishops&#39; lawn, a fine muslin material used for filtering finer oils and other products in the preparation of cosmetics, &#38;c. Compressed air - hydrogen, oxygen, acetylene - is used as an aid  to  manufacture or in the process of carrying out repairs to plant and buildings. How will it be affected? The position in regard to acetio acid used as  a  lubricant for soap dies in the process of stamping tablets of soap should also be clarified. Considerable difficulty will inevitably arise in dealing with some of the articles to which I have referred. I  do  not expect the Treasurer to be. able,  offhand,  to give me a definite reply  as to  whether these particular articles will be exempt or not. </para>

                    <para>. -  Seeing that it is clearly impossible for Parliament to pass this measure hefore the week-end, and that trade will be dislocated somewhat if a definite date is not specified from which these exemptions will operate, I inform honorable members that the Government has decided to introduce an amendment  at  the committee stage of the bill to provide that the provisions of the bill shall become operative as from to-morrow morning. Consequently, except in respect of times in the bill to which a specified date is already attached, the exemptions will operate as from to-morrow morning. <inline font-style="italic">Sitting suspended from 12.45 to2.15 p.m. &#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline></para>

Furthermore, any information which the Treasurer can give in these matters will be helpful to honorable members in dealing with queries raised by their constituents from time to time. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the remarks of the honorable members for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> and Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street),</inline> in respect of the omission from the list of exemptions of aerated waters, which are virtually a foodstuff. Aerated waters fall practically within the same category as biscuits as a. children&#39;s food. They are much sought after by children holidaying on our beaches, and, although I am concerned in this matter with the interests of the smaller manufacturers of aerated waters, many of whom are established in the electorate of Robertson, I also point out that some of the finest beaches in the Commonwealth are situated in that district. I suggest that children frequenting them should lie given every opportunity to purchase- aerated waters as cheaply as possible. Owing to the fractional difference it would make in cost on individual purchases, sales tax on aerated waters cannot be passed on. Therefore, this tax simply adds to overhead expenses, and particularly affects the smaller manufacturer. It causes intricacy in the accounts of smaller firms, who are not in a position to employ accountants. I point out, also, that one of the main ingredients in cordials is sugar, the price of which is fixed by Commonwealth legislation. </para>

                <para>I support the request for the exemption from sales tax of road-making machinery used&#39; by local-governing bodies. In New South Wales - and I take it that a similar state of affairs exists throughout </para>
                <para>Australia - the people are well catered for so far as main roads are concerned, but local authorities are finding it more and more difficult to secure the necessary finance to enable them to attend to important arterial roads, which are used for the transport of a considerable portion of our primary products. Thus any relief given in this direction will no doubt be reflected in improvements of these roads. </para>
                <para>Dealing generally with sales tax legislation, I compliment the Government on reducing the rate by 1 per cent. I do not agree with honorable members opposite that this relief is so infinitesimal that it is impossible to pass it on to consumers. On the contrary, this concession will give a fillip to trade generally. Although the present list of exemptions does not include a couple of items which I should have been glad to see included, I congratulate the Government on its foresight in exempting machinery and fuel used in irrigation projects. Much public money has been spent on the Hunter Valley irrigation scheme which I consider is not before its time. I contend that if we are to be enabled to keep up our exports of mutton, lamb, beef, butter and other products, we cannot look so much to the large land-holders as to the smaller land-holders who, to-day, are intensifying culture and adopting scientific methods of production. The Hunter Valley irrigation scheme will play an important part in this direction, and I am very glad indeed that this work will be greatly assisted through the exemption from sales tax of machinery and fuel used in the undertaking. </para>
                <para>I do not agree with the argument of the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> that sales taxation falls most heavily on the poorer sections of the community. I have always held the opinion that this class of taxation most affects those people who are best able  to  bear it, namely, those who can afford  to  pay for luxuries ; and this is the case in respect of all indirect taxation levied by this Government. The business community and the consumers generally  will  welcome the concessions to be afforded under these exemptions, and I am very pleased indeed that this Government has taken the vanguard in providing relief from this class of taxation. </para>

                    <para>.- I congratulate the Government on exempting bo many more articles from sales tax, and I am particularly pleased that in doing so it has removed a number of anomalies created by previous exemptions. In this connexion I refer to several items mentioned by the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Donald Cameron),</inline> such as ammonia, sodium chloride and calcium chloride used for refrigerating purposes. When used in butter factories, these items were exempt, but when used in cold stores or meat works they were still subject to sales tax. The meat trade has been agitating for the removal of this anomaly, and I am glad to learn that that request is now being granted. </para>

                <para>I join most emphatically with other honorable members in asking that roadmaking machinery, such as tractors, motor trucks and graders, used by local governing bodies, be exempt from sales tax. Until this is done a serious anomaly will remain in this legislation because bitumen and other road-making material has already been exempted. It appears to be most incongruous that the Crown, through this Parliament, should tax itself in the municipal sphere; this is entirely wrong. During the last few years the Commonwealth and the State Governments have made money available to municipal councils with the object of relieving unemployment, these bodies being regarded as the best avenue for the spending of such money. Although this Government subsidizes such bodies, it hampers them through the imposition of sales tax on machinery .used by them. I join with other honorable members in urging that this anomaly be remedied. </para>

                    <para>.- The. taxing by one authority of the material required by another authority, when both authorities collect and administer public funds, is very difficult to justify. This matter has been brought up so frequently in this House that I do not propose to recapitulate the arguments in support of the discontinuance of such a practice, but I should like the Treasurer to state why this practice is followed by this Government in relation to sales tax on machinery used by local governing bodies. The position, in this respect, is that a superior taxing body imposes a tax on a subsidiary taxing authority.  1  do not know of any good reason to justify such a practice and I feel sure that honorable members would be glad to hear what the Minister has to say on this point. </para>

                <para>I should like to see biscuits exempted from sales tax. Last year a report of the Tariff Board on this industry waa tabled, in which the board recommended the removal of duty on biscuits on the ground that the Australian trade wai able to carry on without any tariff  protection.  The House adopted that recommendation although at the time a good deal of apprehension was expressed by manufacturers that if they had not protection large importations of biscuits would result. I do not know  to  what extent those fears have been realized. The removal of sales tax on Australian-made biscuits would give the industry some slight protection, and would have the further virtue, which is hot common to tariff imposts, of giving protection without adding to the costs of the purchasers of the goods. </para>

                <para>Biscuits have been the- subject of representations by a large number of honorable members on both sides of the chamber during this debate and in the discussion twelve months ago, and I think I need&#39; hardly assure the House that this matter has received the serious attention of &#39; the Government in connexion with this bill. There is still a large collection of foodstuffs of a fairly wide variety, which are the subject of sales tax, including biscuits, ice cream, condiments of almost all kinds, junket materials, jelly crystals, certain breakfast foods not made from processed grain, orange and lemon peel, cornflour, salt, tinned fish, meat and vegetable extracts, and almost an interminable, list of items of this kind, which the Government thinks cannot be classed as essential foodstuffs. Of course, these items are used, in some degree, in almost every household, but, considering the small sum of money spent on them by each household, they can hardly be said to be essential items of food. </para>
                <para>The wholesale value of the biscuits consumed in Australia amounts to about &#163;2,000,000 a year. Between &#163;250,000 and &#163;500,000 worth are already exempt, in the .form of children&#39;s food. Shortbread biscuits were exempted some time ago by reason of the fact that they bear an analogy to shortbread made by pastrycooks, and it was impossible to distinguish between the two. Thus shortbread biscuits and many others which could be classed as baby foods are already exempt, leaving about &#163;1,500,000 worth still taxable. As there are almost exactly 1,500,000 families in Australia it means that &#163;1 worth of biscuits is used on the average by each family in Australia every year. That, I think, provides all the refutation that need be furnished of the statement that biscuits are an essential article of food. It means that on an average each family consumes only a few pence worth every week, and I do not believe that removal of the tax on the small quantity of biscuits used by a family would enable it to buy much more food. The tax ou &#163;1 worth of biscuits per annum would be only about 9d. in every family. </para>
                <para>I have disposed of the argument that the burden which the people bear by reason of the tax on biscuits is severe. The wholesale price varies from Cd. to about ls. 6d. per lb., but the average price is about 9d. per lb. The amount of tax probably represents about <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> per lb., and the Government thinks that, as biscuits generally cannot be classed as an essential item of food, they must take their place among the fairly wide range of foodstuffs that still bear the tax. The Government claims that it would be invidious to select particular items for exemption. The removal of the tax on these items, which amounts to about &#163;250,000 a year, will be considered when the Government considers that it is in a position to carry on without the revenue now being raised. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say. Competition usually makes it necessary for traders to pass on the benefits of relief from&#39; taxation. The Government says that all the articles of food which are not essential items must be considered together, and T. can give the House an undertaking that this group will be dealt with <inline font-style="italic">en Mcc</inline> at some future time with a view to its complete exemption, when the Government is able to do without the revenue now collected. </para>

                <para>Macaroni was particularly referred to by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway).</inline> The macaroni consumed in Australia has a wholesale value of about &#163;75,000 a year. A larger quantity than that is manufactured in this country, but the balance is exported, and does not bear sales tax.&#39; On the basin of &#163;75,000 a year, we find that about ls. worth of macaroni is consumed by the average family in a year, and again I maintain that this cannot be regarded as an essential item of food. The amount of ta.x involved is only about &#163;3,000 a year, but all these foodstuffs have to be considered together. Competitive anomalies would be brought about by the arbitrary selection for exemption of individual items, and not others that are in some way connected with them in the matter of trade. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom&#34;)</inline> and the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Donald Cameron)</inline> both referred to a request from Queensland for a remission of the tax on ammonia, calcium chloride, ammonia piping. multi-vane fans, oil, and  machinery, such as motors and gear drives. Ammonia, calcium chloride, ammonia piping and oil will be exempt under the provisions of this bill, the first two items being refrigerating materials. Oil is specifically exempt and ammonia piping comes under the general exemption granted to piping. The two other items referred to are multi-vane fans, and machinery such as motors and gear drives. These are not exempt except when used for specific purposes, and the Government will not increase the exemption in regard to them. </para>
                <para>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> asked why had not the Government considered the matter of differential rates of sales tax between luxury goods and essential goods. That aspect has been given attention by the department and particularly by myself during the last six months. We made a definite attempt to distinguish between, and make a schedule of, luxury and essential goods; but as other countries have found, we had to come to the conclusion that it was only on a limited range that we could say with any assurance what goods were luxury or what were essential. Going up the scale from essential to luxury, we found that each item merged with another. It is therefore quite impossible in practice to draw a line of demarcation between luxury and essential goods which would enable the department to state whether the rate of sales tax should be 5 per cent, on some goods and 2&#163; per cent, on others. The department made a definite effort to distinguish between luxury and essential items in an attempt to do justice to the principle that taxation should be imposed on various sections of the community in proportion to their ability to pay it, but it was not found possible to make a clear-cut division between luxury and essential items, which could be administered without considerable confusion and difficulty. For those reasons the scheme was reluctantly put aside. </para>
                <para>The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition referred to the position of business people who were in possession of large stocks of a particular range of goods, such as boots and shoes, and he claimed that they would be placed in an inferior position competitively to those who had no accumulated stocks. One must readily admit the truth of that contention, but when a tax is being increased the position is reversed. For instance, -when changes in the rates of customs and excise duties are being made a similar situation to that contemplated by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition naturally arises. Business people on an average keep a certain stated stock, and unless some business man has the good fortune to anticipate by guesswork the extent of the downward trend of the tax, the concessions operate in reasonable fairness to all traders. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> and others, asked why the tax has been lifted from boots and shoes, while singlets, shirts and other items of apparel have not been exempted. At first sight there is some justification for the criticism, butT submit that upon examination, it is not justified. The Government, having made a study of the items most in use by the majority of the Australian community, decided that boots and shoes were an easily definable item of wear, which could be administered. In granting such a concession the Government desires, above all things, to avoid creating competitive anomalies. The exemption of footwear, whether it be leather, rubber or canvas, from sales tax, can be simply administered by the department. With, however, a range of wearing apparel, such as suits, men&#39;s and women&#39;s singlets, sox  and other articles, it is difficult to define what classes shall he exempted and what shall not. Only a limited amount of revenue could be yielded in order to grant concessions, and the Government had, therefore, arbitrarily to select certain items and reject others. </para>

In adopting that course it was actuated by the desire to do something to relieve the unemployment problem by making conditions easier for the building trade.

It is a matter that has been under consideration for a considerable time. During the last two years I have received numerous representative deputations upon it, and the matter has been considered most carefully indeed. The local-governing bodies have the benefit of all the general exemptions from sales tax that the rest of the Australian community enjoys. </para>

                        <para>- Twelve months ago the local-governing bodies were also given immunity from tax on road-making materials. The list has been, slightly extended by the unconditional inclusion of bitumen and bituminous emulsions in this schedule. They are also exempt from the tax on all gas and electricity which they make and supply, and on timber, building materials of all descriptions, and practically all forms of road-making materials. Further a large number of specific exemptions from tax on requirements that local-governing bodies have to purchase have been made. &#39; But because tractors used in the primary producing industry and the timber industry are being exempted in this bill, honorable members suggest that local-governing bodies should be given a similar exemption. Some honorable members would go further and exempt from tax all roadmaking implements and machinery, and a third section would go further still and exempt every requirement of local governing bodies. First of all I point out that there are no less than  2,000  local governing bodies, shires and municipalities in the Commonwealth, and that  by  no means completes the list, because there arc also in the capital cities, such corporations as the Sydney Water and Sewerage Board and the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, and at the leading ports, harbour trusts which must also be taken into consideration. In short, some honorable members contend that  2,000  local-governing bodies should be exempt from taxes. The combined contributions of local-governing bodies to Commonwealth revenue through the medium of the sales tax is between  &#163;80,000  and  &#163;100,000  a year. Already  a  greater part of the materials which they are called upon to purchase is exempt from sales tax. To any deputations that have approached me upon this subject T have always asked this question: &#34;By how much could you reduce your rates individually or collectively if you were freed partially or wholly from sales tax on your purchases?&#34; To the inquiry I have never received a reply. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that that would have been an alternative question, but it was not submitted to me  in  reply to my query. Taxation  is  an unfortunate necessity and nobody likes paying taxes. The amount of taxation levied in  Bales  tax on local governing bodies could not possibly  be  reflected in the rates charged to private individuals. If the requirements of these bodies were completely exempted from sales tax,  it  could make no appreciable difference to the rates levied by them. If one looked for a tax which could  be  equitably spread over all sections of the community, he could not get a fairer group to tax than local governing bodies. But  in order to indicate that the Government is not by any means indifferent to their position, I point out that last session Parliament passed a measure whereby for ten years the Commonwealth will contribute &#163;100,000 per annum, which is rather more than it collects in sales tax from local governing bodies, to the. States for distribution among the local governing bodies, the objective being to assist them in carrying out their works, and practically no definition is stipulated of what those works shall be. This was done in an attempt to decentralize expenditure on works and to improve the financial status of local governing bodies. The Commonwealth Government is thus returning to these bodies considerably more than it collects from them in sales tax. It would be quite anomalous and it would introduce complexities into the sales tax which the Government in this measure is endeavouring to avoid, if we were to give a qualified exemption to local governing bodies in respect of certain items of machinery, road-making and otherwise. </para>

                        <para>- The timber industry on account of its relation to primary industry generally is a logical applicant for exemption in respect of tractors. The Government is attempting completely to exempt primary interests by extending the exemptions from a limited range of articles to include timber-getters who can be logically included among primary producers. That they were not included in the exemptions previously was an unfortunate oversight. The tax is like a house of cards and every claim for exemption on almost any article can be logically defended. But every claim for exemption must be carefully examined, otherwise, if accepted without close scrutiny, anomalies would be created, and it might be difficult not to extend the privilege to a fairly wide range of related articles. I agree that there is a definite case made out in this chamber by honorable members for the exemption of road-making materials. As the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stacey)</inline> said, a superior taxing authority is taxing an inferior one. But that is not the end of the story. The </para>

It is not illogical to maintain the present position which is not an onerous one in respect of local governing bodies.

                        <para>- These items will be sympathetically examined, particularly if the claim for their exemption is accompanied by logical reasoning. Just as it does not matter to an individual whether his shirts or his boot3 are exempt, so it does not matter to a local governing body whether the exemption applies to one or another of the items of road-making machinery. I think that we are faced with the adoption of one of two alternatives - to leave the situation as it is, or at a cost to the revenue of &#163;100,000 a year to remove the tax from every item which a local governing body has to buy. What is done for shires and municipalities would also have to be done for a harbour trust, such as the Rockhampton Harbour Trust, referred to by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline></para>

The claim of the Rockhampton Harbour Trust for the exemption of cranes used on its wharf has as much force as that of any local governing body for the exemption of a road-roller. What the Government has in mind are the semi-public bodies which discharge certain functions for the community. Shires, municipalities, water and sewerage boards, metropolitan boards of works, harbour trusts, and the like, must be considered conjunctively if we are to act logically. The Government  could  not exempt road-rollers without also exempting cranes used on the wharf at Rockhampton. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> mentioned the sales tax on leather used for the repair of harness and the like, and very rightly pointed out that this is one of the few uses to which leather is put in which sales tax is attracted. I give to the honorable -gentleman the assurance that when the next list of exemptions is being arranged, this item will receive the most sympathetic consideration. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> has questioned me in regard to the sales tax paid by tailors. About 40 per cent.  of the tailors of Australia are not under the necessity to register a&#187; sales tax payers, because they have a turnover of less than &#163;1,0001 Not being registered, they cannot quote certificates when purchasing cloth or other material, and, therefore, have to buy the cloth, tax paid, because the factory or wholesale merchant charges a price which includes the amount of the tax. On the other hand, when the tailor who is registered and has a greater turnover than &#163;1,000 a year purchases cloth or other material, he quotes his certificate, and thus is legally entitled to obtain it for an amount which does not include tax. Under this bill, the total sales figure on which tax is imposed is to be reduced from two-thirds to one-half, the result of which will be to bring the position of the registered sales taxpayer very close to that of the unregistered sales taxpayer, because on the average probably 40 per cent, of the cost of a suit or a garment of any description is represented by the cost of the constituent material. The position of the bespoke tailor, or woman&#39;s garment-maker, therefore, will in future be very little different from that of his unregistered competitor. </para>

                        <para>- That is- so. This is a problem into which many factors enter. There are the unregistered tailor, the registered tailor, and the large establishments in the capital cities which supply ready-made and semi-ready-made clothing to the so-called bespoke tailor, who, in many cases, makes slight alterations and sells the suit as that of a bespoke tailor. The competition between the different factories has to be taken into account in considering what may be done for the industry as a whole. The Government came to the conclusion that the reduction From 66&#167;- per cent, to 50 per cent, was probably the fairest action that could be taken. </para>

                <para>The item aerated waters has been mentioned by the honorable members for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street),</inline> Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gardner),</inline> and Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt).</inline> The position of this industry is, I think, somewhat comparable to that of photographers, and several other industries which have not kept pace with the general recovery of prosperity in Australia. It would, I think, be wrong to say that they are languishing; but, at all events, they have not responded to the general increase of prosperity which has been witnessed, particularly in the last two years. I suppose it is only human nature for those who are in charge &#39; of them to ascribe to the sales tax a larger measure of responsibility for their condition than is actually the case; in other words, to ascribe to taxation what, in effect, arises almost entirely from economic causes. The Government maintains that neither the portrait photographer nor the aerated water manufacturer contributes an essential of life. It would be wrong to say that they provide luxury items, but, on the other hand, they are articles which are not essential to life, and it is with respect to those essential articles that the Government has been at great pains to afford the first measure of relief. In the United States of America,  where sales tax is fairly widespread, the aerated water and cordial manufacturers are regarded as persons who are carrying on a luxury or semiluxury industry, and have not been granted the exemption which has been given to a wide range of other manufacturers. </para>

                        <para>- It is competition which it would be extremely difficult for the Government to overcome. The Government has first to direct attention to essential items in the consumption of the average Australian household. It has frequently given consideration to photography and aerated waters, but there are still a number of items which it believes should first be relieved of the tax. It has not yet managed to provide for the exemption of all the items which are consumed. The attempt to do so is being made in fairly logical order. for that reason, the two principal items in the present schedule of exemptions are footwear and tea, which have to be bought at frequent intervals. 1 believe that honorable members are unanimous in agreeing that they should be in the forefront of the Government&#39;s proposals. </para>

In fact, practically all of the essential materials now escape the tax. Machinery, implements, and apparatus for use in the industry are exempt. Those are articles which are used in the actual mining operations, and in the treatment of the products of those operations in the metallurgical aud milling side of the industry. Practically everything used in milling, mining and metallurgical processes is exempt. Explosives are also exempt, together with substances used in the recovery of metals by the flotation, cyaniding,  electrolytic and similar processes. </para>

                        <para>- The matter of the exemption of cartridges used for the extermination of pests has been under consideration. It was raised previously by the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. F. Harrison),</inline> particularly in connexion with cartridges used for the destruction of hares, but I presume that the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> desires that the exemption be made wider. I remind the honorable member that an exemption of that kind would have to be conditional, which would make it exceedingly difficult to police. Of the sporting ammunition used in Australia, only a relatively small amount is used for the extermination of pests, and I ask honorable members to imagine the complexities which would confront a trader if he were required to find out before selling ammunition whether or not it was to be used for the extermination of pests. An exemption of that kind would merely create further anomalies, and our object is to simplify the law rather than to complicate it. </para>

                <para class="block">I have taken the trouble to look up the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of the Treasurer&#39;s reply last year to the request that sales tax should be remitted on machinery used by municipalities, and it is a singular thing that it was almost the same, word for word, as the speech he made to-day in reply to similar requests. He expressed the same desire to avoid anything in the nature of oppressive taxation, and made the same promise that he would consider the request sympathetically with a view to seeing whether relief could be given in the future. Evidently the Treasurer does not realize the situation in many country districts. I represent a fairly large area, where the district councils, as they are called., have been passing through a particularly trying time. Many of them are owed thousands of pounds in rates, and if the Treasurer will look up the report of the Wheat Commission dealing with the finances of municipal councils, he will see that practically none of those in the wheat-growing areas are financial. Thus the Commonwealth, with abundant revenues, is forcing the municipal councils, who have not been able to pay their way or keep the roads in, order within their borders, to pay taxes which the Commonwealth can do without. I realize that there are other items beside tractors in respect of which remissions should be granted, but they can be dealt with as we come to them. It has been objected that, if we extend the remission to local governing bodies as such, it will automatically include such bodies as harbour boards, hospital boards, sewerage authorities, etc.,  but  I do not agree with that. The term &#34;local governing body&#34; has a a definite meaning when used in State legislation. It means those local governing bodies, elected by ratepayers, and having the right to levy rates in the areas they serve and control. </para>

                    <para>.- I  support the amendment, because it will give relief to a large number of local bodies throughout Australia who are at present in financial straits. We know that a most important work is being done by those who serve, usually gratuitously, on these local bodies. Many of these local authorities find the greatest difficulty in paying the salaries of their staffs and the few persons employed on the maintenance of roads, etc. This refers particularly to the large number of country local governing bodies, and much the same thing applies to many of the municipal councils in the more remote districts. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has explained that when this request was placed before him by deputations he asked whether, if it were granted, local bodies would be able to make any remissions of rates to their ratepayers. He has said that he received no reply to that question, but I remind him that while local governing bodies may not be able to reduce rates if they receive this concession, they may be able to keep men in employment for a month or two months longer in the year. I propose, at a later stage, to move as an amendment to clause 5, paragraph  a c,  that exemption be granted in respect of machinery, implements and apparatus for use by municipal corporations, or by other local governing bodies, or by public authorities, I am aware that the granting of this concession might result in a loss of revenue amounting to approximately &#163;100,000 a year, but it would afford necessary relief to many local authorities such  bb  the Rockhampton Harbour Board, which is a semi-Government body assisted by the Government of Queensland. Its finances are in an unsatisfactory condition, and it has a debt of over &#163;500,000. </para>
                <para>When representations were made to the Treasurer some time ago for this concession, he replied in the following terms - </para>
                <para>Similar  representations have been made on behalf of many other quasi-Governmental bodies, e.g. municipal councils, water and sewerage boards, and trusts, harbour trusts, fire brigade boards, health boards, milk boards, etc. </para>
                <para>I have gone carefully into this matter, and am well aware of the &#34;case for the exemption of goods acquired by these quasi-Governmental bodies. The question will be considered when the terms of the proposed exemption are being finally settled. </para>
                <para>Unfortunately, the decision has gone against the harbour board. I am prepared to support the amendment before the committee, moved by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A.</inline> Cameron), and I hope that he, in turn, will support me when I move my amendment. </para>

The reason was that certain Tariff Board reports referred to in the annexure, although in the hands of the Government, had not been considered  by  it. Naturally, as such reports contained recommendations  by  the board they could not be printed at that stage.
