We say that King George V. was ft truly great King, and that he personified thq aspirations of the people of the British Commonwealth of Nations. We believe that his rule gave symbolic fitness to the Throne, in that it indicated a leadership of peoples who believe in selfgovernment, and at the same time can reconcile what in other parts of the world might be conflicting ideas, but which in our system of government unite the Throne and the people in a common fealty to the ordered instruments of democratic government. </para>

            <para>.- I beg to second the motion.  The  people of Australia have had knowledge of the personality of King Edward VIII. I am certain that the affection that they held for his Royal father will be entertained for him in full measure. We hope that his rule will be beneficent, and lengthy. We also are inspired hy the belief that his reign will be marked by great changes for the betterment of humanity. King Edward VIII. has already manifested attributes of deep sympathy with the best instincts of humanity. He has, we believe, an intimate knowledge not only of the exacting dutieswhich have come to him, but also of the lives of his people, including those who are numbered among the most lowly of his subjects. We are confident that, however great has been the sympathy which in the pasthas existed between the Throne and the people, it will  be  even greater in the future. </para>
