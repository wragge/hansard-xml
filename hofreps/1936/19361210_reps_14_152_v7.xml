                    <para>.- This is the second day on which the House has assembled and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has immediately moved " That the House do now adjourn." The right honorable gentleman has made no informative statement, other than that the Parliament was recalled in order to deal with a certain matter. Apparently that certain matter has not yet arisen. . Obviously, however, steps have been taken somewhere, and may be taken by this Government, which may lead to a decision that will be definite and irrevocable. Surely this Parliament, since it was called together, has had time to deliberate upon whether or not that decision is one with which it agrees or to which it is opposed ! </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I would submit, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that the. Parliament of Australia cannot be blind to the statements that have appeared in the newspapers; nor can its ears be deaf to the rumours that are even now in circulation. We are as good as told, unofficially, that there is to be effected, either to-day or to-morrow, a certain event of which this Parliament will then be called upon to take cognizance, but without any competence to advise as to whether the course chosen is desirable or undesirable. </para>

                        <para>- Furthermore, the opinions which other dominions have apparently expressed upon this matter are recorded in the newspapers, whereas there appears to be no information concerning whatever opinion the Commonwealth of Australia may have in regard to it. Yesterday, I asked the Prime Minister to make available to the House and to the country the whole extent of the communications or intimations that have passed between himself, as the Prime Minister of Australia, and the Government of the United Kingdom. There has been no response to that request. <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> do not know what advice this Government has tendered to the Prime Minister of England, or to His Majesty the King - who, I would point out, as far as this Parliament is concerned, is the King of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I therefore suggest, that, by reason of the course which the Prime Minister is taking, this Parliament is being silenced in regard to a matter of major importance to the Throne, to the succession to the Throne, and to Australia's membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations. It is idle for us to say that this Parliament is to be silent while discussions and negotiations are proceeding, and presumably advice is being tendered to  His  Majesty in this connexion, and tendered in circumstances which make it impossible for  His  Majesty to intimate to this Parliament his personal wishes in the matter. I have to record that the Opposition is very much dissatisfied with the whole situation-. </para>

                <para>Mr.CURTIN. - The members of the Opposition feel that there is a great distinction between reticence on a grave and delicate matter, and the discharge of that major responsibility which rests upon this Government and this Parliament, and that the Prime Minister owed it to the Parliament to-day, to perhaps a much greater extent than he did yesterday, to make known what advice he has tendered to  His  Majesty, and what  His  Majesty has had to say in response to that advice. Furthermore, the right honorable gentleman owed it to this Parliament to make known the origin of the present difficulty - whether it was the result of representations made to  His  Majesty, or the outcome of representations or suggestions which  His  Majesty made to the Government of the United Kingdom and, so far as we are concerned, to the Government of Australia. I object to the Parliament of this self-governing dominion - this Commonwealth of Australia - which, in every major matter that pertains to this Commonwealth, has the right directly to  advise His Majesty, being reduced to the status of having merely to legalize whatever action may be taken in another parliament, and without reference to this Parliament. </para>
