          <para>.- I second the motion, with exceeding regret. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> was well-known throughout Western Australia as a citizen who endeavoured to do his very best for all sections of the community. He was a man who held very strong convictions, but with an intense sense of justice.  His  controversies wore always marked by fair dealing towards those who differed from him. He is held in memory in Western Australia as a good citizen and a fairminded man, who was animated by the highest ideals of public service. Although he was better known in another place than in this chamber, I feel confident that all of those who were acquainted with him respected him for  his  sterling personal worth. I express to  his  widow and children the deepest sympathy of honorable members who sit on this side of the chamber. </para>

He represented that division from  1901  to  1906,  and Maribyrnong from  1906  to  1910.  The record of his parliamentary service indicates that during his early association with this House he served on several select committees and royal commissions.

          <para>. - I  second the motion. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Samuel</inline> Mauger belonged to a generation of Australians who played a conspicuous part in the evolution of this Commonwealth. He was animated by the humanities to an extent probably greater than that of the normal man. Certainly he identified himself more keenly than did the great mass of the community with the lot of those who felt the oppression of society; he did his utmost in his endeavours to succour the weak; he was the friend of those who were in distress. The late honorable gentleman played a most prominent part in those movements which ultimately led to the enactment of legislation for the regulation of industrial conditions, and was a determined opponent of injustice as between employer and employee.

Although I have  no  personal recollection of the late honorable gentleman at that time, none the less, I have no doubt that those who  sat in  that first Parliament were notable, not only because they composed an historic band, but also because they could not have come to this Parliament without the highest public credentials. </para>

        <para class="block">Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons).</inline> I was particularly pleased to hear the tribute paid by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> to the memory of one who, in his time, was a very conspicuous figure in this Parliament and in Victoria, and who, during the whole of his life, was devoted to the service of humanity. He was a most remarkable man. Personal interests were sacrificed for what he believed to be the public good, and in the cause of those who were in distress he stinted no effort. Always he was actuated - by the highest and noblest motives. One most noteworthy thing about the late honorable gentleman was that his views upon the public questions of the day were always coloured by his deep Christian beliefs and principles. ITo call for his services was disregarded. He spoke on Saturdays, Sundays and all other days of the week to uphold the causes to which he had practically devoted his life. In this Parliament he was respected as a courageous fighter, and a vigorous and practical debater, who was conspicuously fair in all that he said and did. During his membership of this Parliament, after the federation of the Australian States had just been established, he showed a deep concern for the well-being of the whole of the Commonwealth of Australia, having in mind both its primary and its secondary industries. Naturally: being a Victorian, and the representative of Melbourne Ports, which is the centre of many large factories, he was particularly in touch with the conditions of manufacturing concerns, but he stood not only for the interests of the people who possessed the factories and made profits from them, but also for the persons employed in industry throughout Australia. In their interests he made many sacrifices. In his private life he was exceedingly amiable. He was a wonderfully loyal friend. In the early debates in this House, it was frequently said, &#34; Oh, that emanated from 66 Bourke-street.&#34; That was the number of the premises then occupied by the late honorable gentleman. Surely it was a compliment to &#39;his activities and energies and a tribute to the interest he took in the great questions of the day which affected the life and well-being of all Australians ! <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>
        <para class="block">Mauger was a worthy representative of his constituency. That he was held in the highest esteem by the community was shown by the fact that when the first representatives to this Parliament were being elected, he was returned unopposed. That his abilities were appreciated by his fellow members was shown by the fact that he was a member of four or five of the early select committees appointed by the Parliament, and in connexion with which he did notable work. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> has left behind him a very fine record of service, and it must be a source of great consolation to his widow and family to know that he is rememberedso distinctly in this Parliament. And he will continue to be remembered as an honoured, beloved and worthy citizen, and a great statesman who did notable work in the foundation of the Australian nation. </para>

          <para>.- I desire on behalf of many Labourites throughout Australia, and particularly many in Melbourne, to speak a few words concerning my beloved friend, the late Honorable Samuel Mauger. He was a man in a thousand. If only one man in every 1,000 inhabitants of this country were like him, Australia would be a better place. I believe I was his oldest friend. We were friends long before he entered politics. For a time we were members of the same political party, but afterwards we separated insofar as parties were concerned. Throughout his life <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> did nothing but good, for which he deserved the love and regard of his fellow men. Our friendship with one another endured to the last.I was associated with him in the fight against sweating, and he did wonderful service in connexion with that cause. As the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> has truly said, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> always sacrificed his personal interests to the interests of others. He never considered himself when any conflict arose between his own interests and his duty to his fellow men.  His  association with the fire brigades of Melbournewill also be long remembered. He was a true lover of God. and there was no strain of bigotry in him. I hope that the few words that are being said to-day in honour of his memory will bring solace to his dear wife and the members of his family.I have long held the view that those whom we love and lose in this life will be among the first to welcome us when we pass through the shadows and join the majority. One of those whomI hope first to greet will be Samuel Mauger, my beloved friend and fellow-worker for humanity in this life. That we have not many like him is, I think, largely due to to the fact that we lack opportunities to see the miseries of life. I know that every member of this Parliament would wish to do his best to provide every child, woman and man with proper food, shelter and clothing, and yet a feeling is abroad to-day that parliamentarians do not do all that might be done in this regard. There are still people who go hungry and still children who lack shelter, although Christ Himself, 2,000 years ago, took the little children in  His  arms and blessed them. I am not speaking against any one in particular at the moment, and I know how sympathetic the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has been in every case which I have brought before him, but we should make it our first duty to see that every mas, woman and child in the community has proper food, shelter and comfort. I refer to this subject because in the last conversation I had with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> reference was made to the milk supply, and he said to me, &#34; Doctor, is it not astonishing that we do not do our duty in the halls of Parliament as we should do when we are there?&#34; When the cry for war arises millions of pounds can be found. Why not find them when there is need for them to feed the hungry and give them shelter? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> was a great lover of peace, and it was his delight to do his best for the countless millions for whom Christ has ordained that there shall be life and peace. I hope that many will follow in the steps of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline> and that the sorrow of his wife and family will be solaced by the realization that his memory is revered. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - It is with regret that I refer to the death, in Sydney, on 27th July, of another member of the first Commonwealth Parliament, the Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> Gould. He first entered Parliament in 1882, being elected to the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, and was a member of that chamber until the year 1898. He attained ministerial office in the Government of New South Wales, holding the portfolio of Minister for Justice from March, 1889, to October,1891, and again from August, 1894, to August, 1898. The late honorable senator was a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales from April, 1899, to June, 1901, in which year, at the first general election for the Senate, he was elected to represent the State of New South Wales. At the three following general elections he was re-elected. From February, 1907, to July, 1910, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> was  President  of the Senate. He retired from that chamber on the expiration of the Sixth Parliament, in 1917.  His  public services were recognized by the King in 1908, when he was created a Knight Bachelor.  His  name was familiar to many of the present members of the House of Representatives, but few of us had the privilege of personal association with him in this Parliament. We know, however, of his intellectual gifts, his marked ability as a member of the legislature, and the distinction with which he occupied the office of  President  of the Senate. Evidences of his sincerity of purpose and devotion to the cause of public service can be found throughout his long association with the public life of Australia. In inviting honorable members to express their deep sympathy with the members&#39; of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> Gould&#39;s family, I move - </para>

          <para>Mr.CURTIN (Fremantle) &#91;3.23&#93;.-I second the motion, and I do so with exceeding regret, because one more of the members who shared in the establishment of this Commonwealth has gone to his last rest. I doubt sometimes that the people of Australia to-day really appreciate the importance that belonged to the establishment of the Commonwealth, and the great privilege enjoyed by those who, at that time, had, by their public service, sufficiently earned the confidence of the people to justify their return at the first federal election either to this House or to another place. Before the establishment of the Commonwealth, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> Gould had served for eighteen years in the public life of New South Wales, and the fact that he was elected on four occasions to the Senate is evidence of the very high regard entertained for him by the electors of his generation. As the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has said, he was elected  President  of the Senate, and must unquestionably have impressed the members of that chamber with his high personal qualifications. I regret exceedingly the passing of another founder of the Commonwealth, and extend to his family my deepest sympathy. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - Following the decision of the Privy Council in the James case, the Ministry has given the most careful consideration to the best course to be taken by the Commonwealth to safeguard the interests of primary production, the joint Commonwealth and State schemes for the orderly marketing of primary products having been rendered unconstitutional as the result of the decision. </para>

        <para>The Government feels that it is expressing the view of the large majority of the people when it says that it would be disastrous for Australia as a whole if the system of orderly marketing of a number of important primary products were allowed to lapse into chaos. </para>
        <para>It is assisted in this conclusion by the fact that the Privy Council decision has disclosed a gravely anomalous position, viz., that there is no power in any Parliament, Commonwealth or State, to provide for the effective and stable control of marketing. This gap in the constitutional powers of the parliaments can be filled only by popular vote at a referendum. The Government, therefore, after an exhaustive examination of all the possibilities, has decided to seek an amendment of the Constitution. A pronouncement as to its exact nature will be made to Parliament as soon as possible. </para>

I did not submit to that conference any private or confidential documents whatever. One telegram was made available to it. It came from a member of this House who at that time was in the East and who in the last words of his telegram said that the Government might make the contents of the telegram available to representatives of the Graziers Association. That is the only document which I submitted to that conference. I certainly gave information to a body of men who represented those who were directly concerned with the negotiations that were proceeding, but it was given in the strictest confidence. As I said publicly some time ago, I would be pleased to give the same information to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> but details of negotiations so delicate as these could  not be broadcast to the world. </para>

              <para>- I gave information as to the discussion that had taken place between the Japanese Government and ourselves, and I have no apology to offer for having done so. These graziers represented the .people who would be directly affected by any arrangement made with Japan in regard to the wool trade, and they were entitled to know from time to time what was taking place. The only complaint that I have heard on other occasions is that the Government should have consulted the bodies directly concerned at an earlier stage. Therefore, I feel that there is no need for an apology. </para>

            <para>- On a previous occasion, as the honorable member is aware, the Government endeavoured to have an investigation into the merits of a shorter working week. It was first suggested that a conference be held between representatives of the various parties that would be affected by any change, but that suggestion was not accepted by the representatives of the workers. Later it was suggested that a comprehensive investigation might be held by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but that suggestion also was rejected and a deputation from the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, which met in Melbourne, made it quite clear that it did not desire any investigation whatever to be made into this matter. The Commonwealth Government, therefore, as it later outlined to the Premiers Conference, had to take the stand that the only bodies that could deal with the question satisfactorily were the industrial tribunals of either the Commonwealth or the States. When the matter was brought to the notice of the Premiers in Adelaide, as was promised to Hie deputation from the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, the proposal was defeated by a majority of the States. </para>

            <para>- When the House rose at the end of last session the position was that, at the instance of a group of Australian industrialists prepared, at the request of the Government, to take up the important work of manufacturing aircraft in Australia, a delegation had been despatched to Great Britain and various other countries to study certain aspects of the manufacture. At the present time it is only after very great delays that the necessary supply of aircraft for defence purposes can be obtained from overseas. It is equally apparent that, in the event of hostilities occurring, it is unlikely that we should be able to obtain any supplies of aircraft at all. For defence purposes, therefore, it is absolutely essential that Australia should manufacture its own aircraft. Accord ingly, arrangements have been made with certain industrial firms to carry out this work. This delegation has now returned, and the company which is now about to be formed is seeking a site for the erection of  a  factory. As soon as it has been built the company anticipates that within  twelve months it will be able to manufacture planes both for defence training purposes and for civil aviation. </para>

              <para>- The matter of the establishment of an airport at Fishermen&#39;s Bend has been given consideration by Cabinet, but I have yet to obtain certain further details before a definite statement may be made in regard to it. I expect to be able to make that statement to-morrow. The choice of a site for the establishment of a factory for the manufacture of aircraft is entirely within the province of the manufacturers themselves, and I have not interested myself in the matter. I understand, however, that sites are being inspected in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales, but that a determination has not yet been come to. </para>

If the Minister is aware of these facts, does he not consider that an inspection of these plants should be immediately undertaken for the purpose either of assisting the enterprises financially or of advising them to discontinue wasteful expenditure in further boring? </para>

            <para>- I am afraid that the commission must take its own time in this matter. We cannot expedite its deliberations, but I point out that it has held its public sittings in all States, and the taking of evidence is practically completed. It is not expected that its report will be available for some time. The evidence is now being arranged in its proper classifications, for example, banks, insurance companies, &#38;c. Portion of the evidence so classified has been placed in the Parliamentary library, and the revised proofs of evidence have been in the library for some time. Nevertheless, the Government has no information as to the actual time that the commission will take in completing its investigations. </para>

Many years have passed since these negotiations were commenced. The Prime Minister of New Zealand recently made a very definite statement with respect to the matter.

            <para>- On two occasions  recently the Minister in charge of War Service Homes promised the Municipal and District Councils Association of South Australia, that he would meet it in conference in Adelaide with respect to matters affecting war service homes, but apparently he has not yet been able to fulfil that promise, another gentleman who is not a Minister having deputized for him. Can he afford some satisfaction by agreeing to visit Adelaide at an early date to hear the representations that these persons wish to place before him ? </para>

            <para>- It is not my fault that I was unable to fulfil the promise that I would receive this deputation in Adelaide. In response to a request from the Prime Minister to attend a meeting of Cabinet in Melbourne, I was obliged to pass through Adelaide without stopping on my return from Western Australia; instead of spending two days there, I spent only three-quarters of an hour. The Commissioner of War Service Homes, supported by the Deputy Commissioner, acted for me on that occasion. While in Adelaide during the Premiers Conference, I had not the time to receive a deputation. I have, however, promised that at the first favorable opportunity a Minister will receive this deputation in Adelaide. </para>

          <para>Before giving the budgetary results for 1935-36 and the Government&#39;s proposals for 1936-37, a short review of conditions in Australia may appropriately be made. </para>
          <para>In practically every direction, the position of the people of Australia has materially improved in the last twelve months. Evidence of this is to be found particularly in the improvement in employment, as well as in the almost general rise of export prices, in statistics regarding overseas trade, in the steady growth of savings bank deposits, and in the continued and increased confidence of the people as expressed in investment and the inflow of money from abroad into Australia. </para>

        <para>In 1933-34, when wool prices averaged 15.84d. per lb. theclip yielded &#163;63,000,000. In 1934-35 prices averaged only 9.75d. per lb., and the value of the clip was &#163;40,400,000. Last year prices recovered to 14.01d. per lb., and the clip produced over &#163;58,000,000. </para>
        <para>Last year export prices for butter were on a higher level than in recent years. The present outlook, as regards both the season and prices, is promising. </para>
        <para>Seasonal conditions in overseas exporting countries have been responsible for a. marked increase of the price of wheat. For the seven months ended July, 1936, the average price was higher at 3s. 7|d. a bushel than for any similar period since 1928. Wheat produced in 1935-36 was of the value of &#163;26,740,000 as compared with &#163;20,970,000 in the previous year. Even if the recent high level of 4b. 7&#38;d. a bushel be not maintained, wheat-growers have a very much happier prospect than in recent years. </para>
        <para>The general position of export prices as a whole may be seen from the following table of index numbers at half-yearly intervals (base 1,000 in 192S) :- </para>

        <para>The steady increase of employment, which began shortly after the previous Lyons Government came into office, has been maintained throughout the year. The percentage of unemployment reported by the trade unions to the Commonwealth Statistician reached its highest level - 30 per cent. - in the second quarter of 1932. The improvement since then is indicated by the following figures: - </para>

        </para>
        <para>It is estimated that about 335,000 persons have got back into full-time employment in Australia since early in 1932. </para>
        <para>There has been a greater percentage full of unemployment in the year just ended than in any previous year since the depth of the depression. </para>
        <para>Although these percentages are based only on a proportion of employable persons, the improvement they indicate is confirmed from other sources. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>A feature of the overseas trade position for 1935-36 was the recovery of the export trade as compared with the previous year. Under the influence of an all-round improvement in world prices, especially wool and wheat, and of the continued expansion of gold production, exports reached a new high level since 1929-30 of &#163;stg. 108,000,000, as compared with &#163;stg. 90,000,000 for 1934-35. </para>
        <para>Imports in 1935-36 reached &#163;stg. 85,000,000 as compared with &#163;stg. 74,000,000 in 1934-35. The increase continues to reflect revival of the purchasing power of the Australian community, and indicates the continued demand for further raw materials and machinery. </para>
        <para>Of the &#163;stg. 11,000,000 increase in imports, &#163;stg. 9,000,000 is accounted for by increased imports of non-competitive goods, mainly machinery, motor vehicles, and petrol. The prominent position of metal manufactures and machinery indicates rapid growth and improvement in the equipment of secondary industries. </para>
        <para class="block">This movement, in turn, accounts for appreciable shrinkage in the rate of growth in imports of finished goods. </para>
        <para>The steady increase in the number of factory employees in Australia over the last five years is of interest in this connexion and affords further evidence of expansion - </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="151331193609105_17_0.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para>The favorable commodity balance increased from &#163;stg. 16,000,000 for 1934-35 to &#163;stg. 22,000,000 for 1935-36. The slight extent to which the trade balance failed to provide the &#163;stg. 23,000,000 necessary to meet our overseas interest bill, was made good by the migration of capital from overseas to Australia. </para>
        <para>The last several years have seen progressive betterment of the Australian economy. In many directions we have caught up with and passed the peak of activity of the pre-depression decade. The economic future of Australia and of the world appears to be brighter than at any time since 1929 - although this happier prospect is unfortunately accompanied by a serious deterioration in the international situation. </para>

          <page.no>30</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The series of London conversions initiated by the Government in October, 1932, and carried through with such conspicuous success by the High Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> was completed last year when two further operations - of &#163;21,657,0.00 and &#163;16,551,000 respectively - were arranged on the London market. All maturing and optional redeemable loans have now been converted, and there will be no need for further conversion operations in London until towards the end of 1937. </para>
        <para>London debt amounting to &#163;198,513,275 has now been converted, with resultant saving in interest and exchange of approximately &#163;4,000,000 per annum, of which &#163;850,000 accrues to the Commonwealth and &#163;3,150,000 to the States. A striking feature of these conversions is the progressive improvement of the rates of interest at which the conversion loans were floated. The first short-term issue in October, 1932, gave an effective rate of interest of &#163;41s. 2d. per cent. The last short-term issue in June, 1936, gave an effective rate of interest of &#163;2 18s. 6d. per cent. The first long-term loan was issued in February, 1933, and yielded 4 per cent. The last long-term loan was issued in January, 1936, and yielded &#163;3 5s. 9d. per cent. The average rate of interest on all the loans dealt with was reduced from &#163;50s.11d. per cent. to &#163;3 10s. 2d. per cent., a reduction of &#163;1 10s. 9d. per cent. These highly satisfactory results were made possible by the action of the Government in steadfastly adhering to a policy of prudent and sound finance. They reflect the improved standing of Australian credit in London. </para>
        <para>Particulars of this series of conversions are shown in the following table: - </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Two new loans were issued during 1935-36, on behalf of the Loan Council, making a total of eight new loans floated in Australia since the national debt con version in July, 1931. Particulars of the two loans raised in the last financial year, and of the six previous loans, are as follows: - </para>
        <para>Thus, on the average of the last four financial years, the Commonwealth has not claimed the 20 per cent, of loan moneys to which it is entitled under the Financial Agreement. The average has been 11.3 per cent. The policy of the  Commonwealth  has been to keep its loan requirements to a minimum in order to allow State governments as free access as possible to the loan market. </para>
        <para>Although the yield to the investor of the loan raised in June, 1936, was higher than that of any of the loans issued during the past four years, the loan was not fully subscribed by. the public, &#163;1,800,000 having to be provided by the underwriters. This was due in large measure to the increased demand for capital by private enterprise and to renewed confidence of investors in industrial stocks. </para>

        <para>Included in the aggregate Australian public debt at the 30th June, 1936, is &#163;80,388,000 of short-term unfunded treasury-bills and debentures, of which &#163;33,375,000 is held in London by the Commonwealth Bank and &#163;47,013,000 is domiciled in Australia and is held in approximately equal parts by the Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks. </para>
        <para>Loan services of the Commonwealth and States, and revenue deficits of the States, are now being financed by funded loans. New treasury-bills are being issued only to meet the lag in revenue. in the early part of the year. All such bills are repayable before the 30th June in each year. The total volume of treasurybills is thus practically stationary, being affected only by temporary transactions. </para>

        <para>In the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, the revenue exceeded the estimate by &#163;165,000, whilst the expenditure was &#163;22,000 below the estimate - a net improvement of &#163;187,000. </para>
        <para>Increases of expenditure over the estimate were, apart from small variations, as follows :- Federal aid roads &#163;279,000, which was offset by increased revenue from the petrol tax, and relief to primary producers, &#163;1,275,000. Of the latter.  &#163;1,016,000 was due to payments to wheat-growers, and &#163;259,000 to payments to other primary producers for fertilizer bounty and the like. </para>

        <para>In the four years ended the 30th June, 1931, an aggregate deficit of &#163;17,216,000 was incurred in Commonwealth accounts. It is now proposed to apply &#163;1,068,000 of the excess receipts of the Commonwealth in 1935-36 towards the reduction of this deficit. This is in addition to the sum of &#163;213,000 applied in reduction of the deficit in 1935-36. </para>

          <title>Budget Proposals 1936-37</title>
          <page.no>34</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>From the time it became apparent that there would be a substantial excess of receipts over expenditure in the Commonwealth accounts for 1935-36, the Government has not been without requests and advice from various sections of the public on the subject of its future financial policy. These observations have ranged over the whole field of federal taxation, direct and indirect, and have also included proposals for additional and varied grants to the States. All these proposals have had the careful consideration of the Government. In placing before the Parliament the proposals in the budget for 1936-37, the Government has endeavoured to select those forms of taxation the reduction of which is likely to have the most beneficial economic effect. </para>
        <para>The Government was faced with selecting one or other of two simple alternatives - either to reduce both direct and indirect taxes to the full extent that was possible, consistent with our obligations, or to make some appreciably lesser tax reductions and to make increased money grants to the States. Of these two alternatives the Government is confident that, in presenting a budget providing for substantial remissions of taxes, it is acting in the best interests of Australia as a whole. </para>
        <para>Notwithstanding the increased sum of &#163;1,336,000 required from revenue for the development of defence, and the growing cost of old-age pensions, the budget provides for remission of taxes to the amount of &#163;5,275,000 in a full year, and for other expenditure proposals costing &#163;1,235,000 in a full year. In the present year these revenue remissions will cost &#163;3,868,000, whilst the expenditure proposals, including defence, will cost &#163;2,311,000. The total cost of the revenue remissions and expenditure proposals in the present budget is therefore &#163;6,179,000, and the total cost of all these adjustments in a full year will be &#163;7,846,000. The burden of these revenue and expenditure alterations on the budget next year will thus be &#163;1,667,000 more than this year. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>In 1933, the rate of sales tax was reduced from 6 per cent. to 5 per cent., whilst from year to year the list of exemptions has been extended. As compared with the peak period, the total value of the concessions made to date is &#163;3,740,000 on an annual basis. </para>
        <para>The Government proposes to recommend to the Parliament the provision of further relief from sales tax to the amount of &#163;3,000,000 for a full year. The rate of tax will be reduced from 5 per cent. to 4 per cent., involving a loss of &#163;2,000,000 per annum, whilst further exemptions to the annual value of &#163;1,000,000 will be provided for. The cost of these concessions for the balance of the present financial year will be approximately &#163;2,000,000. </para>
        <para>In the selection of classes of goods for complete or partial exemption the Government proposes to follow its established policy of seeking, in the first place, to provide for the exemption of goods which are the prime necessaries of life. This policy provides the greatest possible relief to those least able to bear the burden of the tax. Opportunity has also been taken to provide for exemptions which will remove certain anomalies and will simplify the administration of the law. Among the exemptions will be certain goods generally referred to as &#34; consumable aids to manufacture &#34;, these being goods which are used up or consumed in the process of manufacturing other goods. </para>
        <para>The reduced rate of tax will apply to all taxable transactions on and from to-morrow, the 11th September. This will mean that sales tax returns for transactions in the month of September will be based on the rate of 5 per cent. for the first ten days of September and 4 per cent. for the balance of the month. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 containing the uniform taxation provisions, agreed upon by the Commonwealth and the States following the inquiry by the Royal Commission on Taxation, was passed during the last sitting of Parliament. Uniform income tax legislation has also been passed by the Parliaments of New SouthWales and Tasmania, and bills to a like effect have been introduced into the Parliaments of Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. The Government of Western Australia has announced its intention to introduce a bill on the subject in the near future. </para>
        <para>In addition to dealing with uniformity in taxation, the 1936 Commonwealth act contains a number of concessions to taxpayers. The most important was the introduction into the act for the first time of a concessional deduction of &#163;50 for a wife, or in the case of a widower, for a female relative caring for his children, where the wife&#39;s or female relative&#39;s personal income does not exceed &#163;50. It is estimated that this concession will involve a remission of income tax to the extent of &#163;320,000 for a full year. </para>
        <para>Concessions have also been granted in the 1936 act to non-residents. The most important was the granting to all nonresident individual taxpayers of the same statutory exemption as is allowed to residents. This concession will, it is esti mated, involve a remission of approximately &#163;50,000 for a full year. </para>
        <para>The Government proposes to make reductions of income tax. One of the most severe forms of emergency tax imposed in 1930-31 was the special property tax. In 1933-34, the rate of this tax was reduced from 10 per cent. to 6 per cent. Last year the rate was reduced to 5 per cent. As stated in ray budget speech last year, the Government recognized this tax as a. severe form of emergency taxation from which relief should be given as soon as a reasonable opportunity presented itself. The Government considers that the opportunity has now arrived and proposes to abolish the tax, the remission resulting thereby being estimated at &#163;1,300,000 for a full year. </para>
        <para>In addition, the Government proposes to reduce the rates of normal income tax on individuals by 10 per cent., in respect of both income from personal exertion and income from property. This concession will involve a remission of approximately &#163;435,000 for a full year. </para>
        <para>Owing to the fact that all the assessments cannot be issued in sufficient time to collect the tax before the 30th June, and also on account of belated payments, the full amount of the foregoing remissions will not be reflected in the revenue of the year. </para>
        <para>Since 1931-32, the only variation in the rates of normal income tax was a reduction in 1933-34 of 15 per cent. of the rate of tax on income from personal exertion. </para>

          <graphic href="151331193609105_23_1.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para>In reducing taxes to this extent, the Government is adhering to the policy it has consistently adopted, namely, that taxes should be reduced to the fullest extent consistent with Commonwealth obligations. </para>
        <para>The fields of taxation in which reductions are now being made are those which, in the opinion of the Government, are entitled to preference as being not only most justified, but also most beneficial to the people as a whole. Endeavours have been made to hold the balance fairly, not only as between direct and indirect taxes, but also as between emergency taxes due to the depression and pre-depression taxes. </para>
        <para>In arriving at a decision as to the fairest and most beneficial forms of taxation relief, the Government has not only kept in mind the relation between revenue from direct and indirect taxes in the federal sphere, but has also taken into account the direct taxes imposed by the State governments. There is only one body of taxpayers in Australia, and they have to bear the burdens of both Commonwealth and State taxation in all its forms. </para>
        <para>The Government has given very careful consideration to the question of reducing taxes other than those included in these budget proposals. The cost of reducing customs and excise duties on petrol, beer and spirits to such an extent as to ensure the reductions being passed on to consumers, is so great that the Government has been reluctantly compelled to exclude them from the remissions. Land tax has been halved in the last four years, and now produces &#163;1,200,000, as compared with an average of &#163;2,846,000 for the five years ended June, 1931. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>In 1935-36 special grants, totalling &#163;2,750,000, were paid by the Commonwealth, on. the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, viz. : - South Australia, &#163;1,500,000 ; Western Australia, &#163;800,000; and Tasmania, &#163;450,000. This represented an increase of &#163;350,000 on the total of special grants paid during. 1934-35. </para>
        <para>The third annual report of the commission has now Been received, and contains recommendations that the payments for 1936-37 should be as follows : - South Australia, &#163;1,330,000; Western Australia, &#163;500,000; Tasmania, &#163;600,000- total, &#163;2,430,000. This is a decrease of &#163;320,000 below the total paid last year, although it is still in excess of the 1934-35 grant. </para>
        <para>The commission has reiterated statements made in its previous reports that the adoption of an automatic formula for the determination of these grants over a period of years is not practicable, and has based its recommendations on the amounts necessary to raise the finances of the claimant States to approximately the level of the other States. The effect of this method is to reduce the grants when the finances of the claimant States show a greater improvement than those of the non-claimant States, and vice versa. South Australia and Western Australia both improved their economic position more than the average in 1934-35, that is, the year on which the commission bases: its conclusions, and reduced grants are recommended accordingly for those States. On the other hand, the improvement in Tasmania was less than the average, hence the increase of the grant proposed for that State. </para>
        <para>The Government proposes to seek parliamentary approval for the grants recommended by the commission. The commission&#39;s report is being tabled to-day. </para>

It has been agreed between the Commonwealth and State governments that these agreements shall be extended for a period of six months. The estimated payments to the States on this basis, in the present financial year, total &#163;3,000,000. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided to submit to Parliament proposals for new agreements with the States, to cover a further period of ten years, commencing on the 1st July, 1937. It is proposed that these agreements shall provide for payment to the States of 3d. a gallon on petrol imported, and 2d. a gallon on excise petrol. It is proposed that this should be given effect to by a continuance of the Federal Aid Roads Agreements with the States, in their present form, for a further period of ten years on the existing terms and conditions - and that a further  &#189;d.  a gallon of the customs duty and a &#163;d. a gallon of the excise duty should be made available for the same period for the purposes of roads, works, or forestry.

          <inline font-style="italic">Invalid and Old-age Pensions.</inline>
        </para>
        <para>Honorable members will remember that the Government introduced, in 1933, a scheme whereby the maximum rate of invalid and old-age pensions was designed to increase with increases in the cost of living. The pension rate was accordingly increased in July, 1935, from 17s. 6d. to 18s. a week, following an increase of the price level. </para>
        <para>The total expenditure for the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1936, was approximately &#163;12,800,000, the highest amount expended in any one year in respect of this service since its introduction in 1909. The increase of approximately &#163;1,000,000 over the preceding year was due partly to the increase of the maximum rate of pension from 17s. Cd. to 18s. per week and partly to the increase of the number of successful applicants reaching pensionable age. On the 30th June, 1936, there were 287,235 invalid and old-age pensions in force, an increase of 13,257 during the twelve months. </para>
        <para>It is estimated that the net increase of the numbers of invalid and old-age pensioners in 1936-37 will be about 13,500, at an estimated increased cost, over and above 1935-36, of about &#163;600,000. </para>
        <para>The Government proposes to increase the maximum rate of invalid and old-age pensions from 18s. to 19s. a week. This will be given effect to as from the next pension pay-day following the passage of the necessary legislation. The estimated cost of this liberalization is &#163;760,000 per annum. </para>
        <para>The Government is happy to find itself in a position, by reason of the improved general financial position, to make this increase of ls. a week to invalid and old-age pensioners. This increase will give the pensioners a greater purchasing power than they have had in any previous year since the introduction of invalid and old-age pensions. </para>

        <para>The Government had proposed to exempt amounts paid as unemployment relief tax from computation as income for maternity allowance purposes. However, owing to complexity arising from varying provisions in this regard in the various States, the Government proposes instead to increase the amount of allowable income from &#163;208 to &#163;221 per annum in the case where there is no previous surviving issue, and to allow  a  corresponding increase throughout the existing income scale with  a  maximum income of &#163;312 per annum instead of &#163;299 as at present. This concession is of considerably greater value than exemption from unemployment relief tax. </para>

        <para>The trend of recent international events has emphasized the importance of national defence. At the time the first Lyons Government assumed office, bright hopes were held that the burden of armaments would be relieved by reduction on the part of the heavily armed powers and the elimination of competition through agreements limiting the fighting strength of the various nations. </para>
        <para>The results have proved disappointing. They are doubly so tothose democratic nations such as Great Britain and the dominions which have strenuously supported policies for the limitation and seduction of armaments, andthe maintenance of peace. </para>
        <para>While steadfastly pursuing a policy to this end,the Government, in view of its grave responsibility for national security, must, nevertheless, take the world as it finds it. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom recently said - </para>

        <para>The great strides made in recent years in the development of air communications is an important reminder to Australia that, in spite of our geographical remoteness, we cannot ignore happenings elsewhere. </para>
        <para>Without being alarmist, the Government wishes to put clearly before the people of the Commonwealth the provision that it is incumbent upon them to make for national defence. The defence vote this year will be the highest in the history of the Commonwealth, but it is essential constantly to bear in mind that the burden entailed by preparedness is small in comparison with the human and monetary cost of war. </para>
        <para>The Government, therefore, is making provision in this financial year, not only for the amount required for the final stage of the three-year programme, but also for &#163;1,480,000 for the commencement of a new programme. </para>

        <para>In 1934-35 an amount of &#163;4,160,000 was paid to the account out of the accumulated excess of revenue over expenditure for the three years ended the 30th June, 1934. Of thissum &#163;2,228,054 was expended in the last two financial years, leaving a balance at the 30th June, 1936, of &#163;1,931,946. </para>
        <para>During the present year theGovernment proposes to pay a sum of &#163;2,000,000 to this account out of the excess receipts of 1935-36. The total sum available in the account at the 1st July, 1936, will thus be &#163;3,931,946. Allowing for the estimated expenditure from the trust account for the present financial year of &#163;1,952,008, it is expected that there will be a balance at the 30th June, 1937, of &#163;1,979,938, which will be available towards assisting the defence programme after that date. </para>

The erection of this building, which, in addition to its function as a national memorial, is to house the war museum, was proposed shortly after the war. Although Parliament passed the necessary legislation in 1925 and certain funds were provided in 1928-29, the subsequent depression prevented the completion of the structure. The Government has now decided, subject to the requisite appropriations, to complete the memorial in this and the two following financial years. </para>

        <para>The Government is providing substantially increased sums this year to enable  the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to extend its activities with a view to securing greater national efficiency in primary and secondary industries. Last year the Government provided &#163;140,615 for investigations and research&#34;, and &#163;26,947 for capital expenditure. This year the Government proposes to provide &#163;187,043 for investigations and research, and &#163;57,381 for capital expenditure on laboratories, a fisheries vessel, an agricultural field station, &#38;c. </para>
        <para>Simultaneously, . sources outside the Treasury - private persons, institutions and industries - are increasing their contributions to the council. They are providing &#163;68,385 this year, as against  &#163;54,578 last year. </para>
        <para>The work of the council is being extended to cover research in connexion with secondary industries, and to provide for training of scientists in research work. </para>

        <para>In many directions the work of the council has already been of great benefit to Australia, and has effected savings far exceeding the expenditure.

        </para>
        <para>In considering theamount of Commonwealth expenditure to be provided from loan during 1936-37, the Government has kept in mind the position of the money market and the difficulty of raising all the loan moneys desired by the Australian Loan Council. At the meeting of the Loan Council in May last the estimated Commonwealth loan expenditure for 19.36-37 was, after discussion, set down at &#163;3,750,000. The Government feels, however, that if the carrying out of its public works programme is to be assured, the prudent course is to make provision for not more than &#163;3,107,000 from the LoanFund, and the balance from revenue. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>It isa great satisfaction to be in a position to present a budget which has somany happy features. I do not pretend that the Government can justly claim all the credit for all the improvement of which this budget is the convincing demonstration. Many factors affecting the prosperity of a community are quite beyond the control of governments. This is particularly so in the case of Australia by reason of the fact that we depend in a substantial measure upon an export trade in which profits are determined by world prices. But I do claim that the policy of the Commonwealth Government has had a very great influence in bringing about the desirable results reflected in thisbudget. Unwise financial, monetary or tariff policy would have gone far to prevent the effective operation of the factors making for improvement. Artificial speeding up of activity in Australia through credit expansion might have had temporarily beneficial effects but would have introduced the probability of dangerous repercussions. </para>
        <para>In addition to meeting our defence and other obligations the Government is most glad to have been able to improve the position of the invalid and old-age pensioners, and of incapacitated exsoldiers and their children, as well as to liberalize the law relating to maternity allowances. The Government is glad also to have been able by this budget to improve the position of every section of the Australian community. Those who are still, unfortunately, without permanent employment will have improved opportunities of being absorbed into industry consequent upon the spur to enterprise that the substantial tax remissions will bring. </para>
        <para>Economic prophecy is a precarious venture, but so far as it is possible to attempt to forecast the future upon the basis of theexperience of the past,I may at least express a reasonable hope that this budget will be the beginning of a period of greater prosperity and happiness for the people of our country. </para>

        <para class="block">As honorable members will remember, Supply Act No. 1 of this year, which was passed in May last made provision for the first three months of the present financial year. That period will expire at the end of the current month. As the appropriation under that act will then be exhausted, a further appropriation of revenue is necessary to meet ordinary requirements pending the passing of the Estimates for the current financial year. </para>
        <para>The new Supply Bill provides for an appropriation from revenue of &#163;4,404,750. which amount it is estimated will cover expenditures up to the end of November next. Provision is made for certain increased post office expenditure due to normal expansion, for certain urgent defence services, and for a few minor urgent new works for various departments, to be charged temporarily to Treasurer&#39;s Advance. Provision is also made for increased expenditure on salaries, based on the budget proposals for the restoration of salary reductions. These increases, however, will not be paid until the financial relief measure embodying them has been passed by the Parliament and has received the royal assent. Apart from these relatively minor matters, the bill is based on last year&#39;s expenditure and does not provide for anything which involves new policy. Although supply is sought for two months, honorable members will have an opportunity to debate the budget and with it, of course, the whole of the Government&#39;s proposals, at as early a date as possible. </para>

            <para>- It may be advisable in the interests of all parties to fix a time for the passage of the Estimates as a whole. I have no doubt that such action would be taken iu agreement with honorable gentlemen opposite, in order that every item of the Estimates might be equitably dealt with. At the moment, however, the Government has no proposals in that regard. It is confidently hoped that well before the end of November, when this supply will be exhausted, the Parliament will have had full opportunity to debate in detail the general estimates of expenditure for the year. I trust that, by reason of the information which has already been made available in the budget speech, a fuller explanation of this measure will not be necessary. I commend the motion to the committee. </para>

          <para>.- The Opposition will vote against the motion, because it feels that at this juncture there is no occasion for the introduction of a supply measure. Parliament has already passed a Supply Bill covering the first three months .of the present financial year. Honorable members will recall that during the consideration of that measure the committee was given to understand by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> that before supply for the first three months of the financial year had been exhausted, Parliament would have reassembled, and the budget would have been introduced. The honorable gentleman said that Parliament would be enabled to examine in detail the various items contained in the Estimates for the next financial year. I submit that that statement carried with it the clear implication not only &#39;that we would be able to examine the details of expenditure for the current financial year, but also that we would be able to control expenditure for the whole of the financial year with the exception of the three months for which supply was then &#34;sought and granted. The motion which the Treasurer has just moved will, if passed, take out of the control of the Parliament the management of the finances of the country for a further two months, making a total of five months of the financial .year. I cannot for the life of me see why it is necessary on the 10th September <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> grant supply for the months of October and November. Even conceding that, in order adequately to examine the statement delivered this afternoon, and control the estimates of expenditure set out in the relevant papers, the budget debate proceeded beyond the 30th September next, surely the honorable gentleman ought to be satisfied with supply for the month of October! Why does he want it for November ? </para>

            <para>- There is a good deal of legislation arising out of the statement delivered this afternoon. We might be in a better position to judge of the fairness of two months&#39; supply, based partly on last year&#39;s expenditure and partly on an anticipated approval of certain fundamental provisions of the budget statement, if the Government were to proceed to the second-reading stage of that consequential legislation. That would not only give to the committee the fullest knowledge in respect of the policy and the proposed legislation of the Government, but also provide the fundamental safeguard of enabling Parliament to exercise some check, if check be desirable, upon contemplated governmental expenditure. The Treasurer, as I stated earlier, gave us to understand that the supply for three months granted to him before the recess, was required in order that the services of the Commonwealth might be maintained and covered, and that, before any additional supply was sought the committee would be in a position to control the expenditure of the Government from the 30th September to the end of the financial year. Although those were not actually the terms which he used, I submit that we may reasonably claim that his statement carried that implication. I urge the honorable gentleman to reduce his proposed &#163;4,404,750 to &#163;2,250,000. I undertake that if, in the last week of October, it should be apparent to the Government that full and proper consideration of the budget and the Estimates make desirable the passing of another supply billno unreasonable obstacles will be placed in its way.  We  should then know that the choice confronting us was cither a curtailment of the budget debate or the granting of further supply. At this stage, the committee is exposed to the possibility that, having been granted supply and lacking agreement within its ranks upon major items of policy, the Government might adjourn Parliament for a fortnight, three weeks, or a month, in order to permit the heterogeneous collection of mixed elements which constitute it to resolve their difficulties. I do not propose to abuse the parliamentary control of public expenditure merely to permit Ministers to accommodate themselves to the political difficulties which their administration has incubated. It can justifiably be said that during the recess they have not given anything in the form of a demonstration which would warrant the Parliament giving to them this additional two month&#39;s supply before the budget has been considered. We shall not hold up this debate. I ask the Treasurer seriously to consider my suggestion to seek one month&#39;s supply. If at the expiration of that period it is clear that more time is needed properly to deal with the Estimates and the legislation resulting from the budget, we shall feel justified in granting another month&#39;s supply. Otherwise, the Government will be in command of the finances until the 30th November; a Government, mark you, which has muddled trade relations with certain of our customers, has exasperated the States of the Commonwealth, has bungled the matter of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, has arrived at a complete negation towards the issue of a 40-hour working week, which it undertook to affirm, at least in principle, and has produced utter confusion in respect of Commonwealth action in regard to the major problems of the country. </para>

            <para>- Not at all. That short summary appears to me to justify the Opposition in opposing this grant of supply for a period much longer than the necessities of Government administration demand, the effect of which, furthermore, would be to deprive the Parliament of authority over the finances of the country for at least one month longer than the circumstances of the Treasury warrant. If the honorable gentleman will not accept my suggestion to ask for one month&#39;s supply, we shall oppose the bill. </para>

            <para>. - In my budget speech I set out fully the Government&#39;s works proposals for the year . 1936-37, including those to be financed from revenue, and those from trust and loan funds. Details of these works will be found on pages 276 to 287 of the Estimates. Corresponding details are set out in the schedule to the Appropriation Works and Buildings Bill. I am about to deal only with the new works chargeable to the revenue account. A further bill will be submitted later to provide for certain works expenditure which the Government proposes shall be paid for out of loan moneys. </para>

          <para>The total of the proposed expenditure on public works, &#38;c., in 1936-37, as detailed in my budget speech and in the Estimates, is &#163;7,684,305, as compared with &#163;5,236,537 actually expended last financial year - an increase of &#163;2,447,768. </para>

          <para>The increase of the proposed appropriation for works from revenue in the current year over the expenditure in 1935-36 is &#163;953,297. </para>
          <para>The amount required for defence is &#163;1,117,772. This is in addition to the amount of &#163;1,952,000 to be expended from the defence trust account, which, as honorable members know, is financed from the excess revenue receipts of previous years. </para>
          <para>The appropriation recommended for postal works is &#163;1,750,000. A much greater amount could profitably be devoted to this service, which is definitely reproductive. The necessity, however, for a balanced programme, with due regard to all interests, forbids a greater allocation to these works. A further &#163;600,000 for postal works will be included in the Loan Appropriation Bill for the year. The total proposed expenditure for postal, telegraphic and telephonic works is thus &#163;2,350,000. </para>
          <para>The increase of &#163;278,709 in the provision for territory works is due mostly to the necessity for developmental policy, in regard to both the Federal Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. It is proposed to inaugurate a programme of works, extending over some years, with a view to the eventual transfer  of  all Commonwealth departments to Canberra, but the immediate need is to provide office and dwelling accommodation for the officers of the Defence Department and the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. Additional funds are also being provided for the development of the Northern Territory, particularly for mining development. </para>
          <para>Full information with regard to the specific works proposed to be undertaken during this year will be made available, if desired, by the Ministers in charge of the respective departments. </para>
          <para>For many years it has been the practice to deal with the new works proposals of the Government as soon as possible after the budget speech has been delivered, and without waiting for the general budget debate. This course is being followed by the Government this year, in view of the desirability of commencing the proposed new works at an early date. In view of the fact that the total proposed expenditure on public works considerably exceeds that of last year, it is particularly desirable that the new works should be considered promptly. </para>
          <para>As already stated, the total proposed expenditure on new works from revenue in 1936-37 is &#163;4,576,967. It is, however, unnecessary to appropriate the whole of this sum at the present time, because the following amounts are already available under special appropriations made in previous sittings of Parliament :  - </para>

          <para>The purpose of this bill is to appropriate from loan funds an amount of &#163;600,000 for works to be carried out by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. If honorable members will refer to the table towards the end of the budget speech headed &#34; public works, etc.&#34;, they will find set out there in tabulated form, the details of the amounts to be expended during the current financial year on public works. The grand total is &#163;7,684,305. This amount is to be drawn from loan funds, trust funds, and revenue. </para>
          <para>The total of the loan Estimates for 1936-37, as set out in the budget, is &#163;3,107,339. Full details of all proposed works chargeable to the loan fund will be found on pages 290-295 of the Estimates. </para>

          <para class="block">It is unnecessary to ask Parliament to appropriate the full sum of &#163;3,107,339. Many of the amounts included in the proposed expenditure have already been appropriated in earlier sittings of the Parliament under special acts, such as those relating to Farmers&#39; Debt Adjustment, the Port Augusta to Port Pirie railway, unemployment relief works in the States, and grants to the States for mining and forestry. The only amount included in the proposed loan expenditure which has not already been appropriated is a sum of &#163;600,000 for postal works. The present bill accordingly provides only for the appropriation of that amount. As explained in connexion with the proposals for new works expenditure from revenue, the total amount to be provided for post office, telegraphic and telephonic works in the present year is &#163;2,353,000. Of this sum, &#163;1,750,000 is provided for in the new works votes from revenue, and &#163;603,000 is on the loan Estimates. Of the &#163;603,000, &#163;3,000 was provided in an earlier appropriation. All the postal works are of a reproductive character and are urgently necessary to meet the increasing demands of the public for better postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities. </para>

          <para>.- I again bring under the notice of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> two urgent matters which I understand have already received his attention. I refer in the first place to the case of a woman who has been denied an invalid and old-age pension because the department contends that she is not totally and permanently incapacitated. A portion of the letter from the  Deputy  Commissioner reads - </para>

          <para class="block">The evidence shows, however, that whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs.- is</inline> not in good health, her condition is not such as to render her totally and permanently incapacitated for all work, and she is considered capable of rendering light household duties. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The department contends that because this woman is capable of washing up a few cups and saucers, and dusting furniture, she is not entitled to an invalid pension. The evidence submitted to the department proves conclusively that she can perform only light household duties, and consequently cannot obtain a position from which she could obtain sufficient remuneration to maintain herself. Many persons capable of performing light household work, as this woman is able to do, are deprived of a pension. The department is not giving effect to the spirit or to the letter of the act, and is administering it in an unsympathetic way. </para>
        <para>A case brought under my notice shows the extent to which the Repatriation Department will go. A man who applied for a service pension, was informed by the medical officers of the Repatriation Department that as he was not unemployable he was not entitled to a pension. He then applied for an invalid pension, which was granted on the grounds of permanent incapacity. Although this fact was brought under the notice of  the  Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> a communication has been received from his department stating that as the applicant is not unemployable, he is not entitled to a service pension. </para>

            <para>- Of course he  was.  The fact that this man has been granted an invalid pension shows that the Repatriation Department is treating this man in an unusually harsh manner. Invalid pensions are not granted unless applicants are entitled to them.I have brought this matter forward in the hope that something will be done immediately, particularly in view of the fact that  a  service pension has been refused by  the  Repatriation Department to  a man  although that man is actually receiving an invalid pension on the ground that  he  is totally and permanently incapacitated. I trust that the Treasurer will bring  the  matter under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation and that he will request the Repatriation Department  to  grant this man a service pension. </para>

          <para>.- I join with the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> in raising question against the manner in which the Repatriation Department is dealing with some claims for service pensions. As stated by the honorable member for Werriwa, persons who are eligible for and are in receipt of invalid pensions are refused service pensions. In delaying the payment of service pensions, the Government is paying persons only 18s. a week when they are entitled to 30s. weekly. I have felt for a long time that the medical officers of the Repatriation Department are unnecessarily harsh in interpreting the act, and in certain instances do not grant pensions to persons entitled to them. The Government should recognize that any returned soldier who receives an invalid pension is entitled to a service pension, more particularly if the invalid pension has been granted during the last five years. The Government should review the attitude adopted by the Repatriation Department, and give incapacitated returned soldiers the consideration they deserve. </para>

        <para>A special feature of the programmes of the wireless broadcasting station 5CL and 5CK in Adelaide, has been programmes by the 5CLBoys&#39; Club, which are appreciated by thousands of listeners, not only in South Australia, but also in other parts of the Commonwealth. It has come to my knowledge that the Broadcasting Commission has already curtailed the time available for these programmes, and it is reported that it intends shortly to discontinue this feature altogether. It has been stated that the commission proposes to utilize in some other way the services of certain of the lads who have shown outstanding merit. I draw the attention of honorable members, however, to the fact that this matter concerns others besides those whocoutribute to the programmes; it concerns also the many thousands ofboys and youths throughout South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania who are members of the club. I can assure the Minister that if the commission carries out its purpose to discontinue this feature it will evoke a spirited public protest from those who are interested in the welfare of our youth, and who appreciate the value of the work being done by the club.I hope that the Postmaster-General, who has some influence over the Broadcasting Commission, willtake this matter up in order to ensure that the club may be able to continue its operations. </para>

          <para>. - During the last session of Parliament, the Government generously arranged that there shouldbe one long weak-end in three to enable those members of Parliament representing distant constituencies to returnto their homes. I suggest that, in the interests of those members, the same arrangement be made again.I also suggest that arrangements be made with the New South Wales Railway Department to run a day train from Sydney to Canberra on the day of the week upon which Parliament resumes its sitting, as otherwise members representing Queensland constituencies will have to travel to Canberra on the night tram. </para>

        <para>Mr.MAR TENS (Herbert) &#91;9.5&#93;.- It is nearly two years since I was given an assurance by the Postmaster-General that the broadcasting station at Cleve land, in North Queensland, would be ready for operation. The station is not yet in commission, and the general feeling among residents of North Queensland is that it will probably be ready just about the time that it has become obsolete. On a previous occasion, when I made inquiries, I was told by the Minister that I could tell the people in the north that the station would be open in July last. I did so, and the people have been disappointed. NowI am assured that it may be opened during this month. I should like to receive a definite assurance from the Minister representing the Postmaster-General as to when it will be opened. Licence-fees are being collected from the owners of radio sets in the north, and summonses have been issued against those who have declined to pay the fee; yet for the last two years the people have been asking for a service to which they are entitled, but which has not been provided. Some work has been done on the station, but it is not yet in operation, and the people of the north and north-west of Queensland have practically no otherservice than that provided by two or three small B-class broadcasting stations. The excuse made a little while ago by the department that the delay was due to a lack of water does not seem to be very satisfactory. </para>

I realize that this arrangement was appreciated by honorable members last session, and steps will be taken to see whether the same arrangement cannot be entered into again. As for the train service from Sydney to Canberra, the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> has arranged that a daily service will be  inaugurated shortly,  I  think on the  2 7 th of  this month. </para>
        <para>The honorable  member  for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Martens)</inline> asked when the Cleveland broadcasting station would be in operation.

The station has  now  been completed, and is under test. As soon as the tests are completed,  which  will bo in the near future, the station will be opened for service. </para>
