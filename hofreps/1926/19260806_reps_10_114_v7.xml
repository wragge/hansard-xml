                    <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation. Speaking on the Treasurer's Estimates last night, I criticized the Expropriation Board and its actions in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. This morning's newspapers state that I criticized the Administrator and the Administration. I made no criticism of the Administration of New Guinea; on the contrary, I am ready to do anything to assist the Administrator and his advisers in the difficult task that confronts them. </para>

                        <para>. - This is a bill to authorize the execution by the Government of agreements between the Commonwealth and the States in relation to the construction and reconstruction of Federal aid roads, and to make provision for the carrying out thereof. It is becoming a platitude in this debate that we want good roads. As a matter of fact, we all want good things generally; but the first question that we must ask in regard to the bill is whether we can afford the good roads that we want, and the second is whether the money which we have to invest would be expended in the wisest possible way under the proposals before Parliament. I remind the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> that he is pledged to a policy of economy, or at least he was so pledged when he occupied another and less conspicuous position in this Chamber. Sometimes I think that since he became Treasurer he has forgotten that pledge, but it still remains. I am a great believer not only in the abstract policy of good roads but also in practical proposals for opening up this country, and in making sacrifices to do it, to enable those who are bearing the heat and burden of the day in connexion with primary production to bring their produce to market, and to make life more endurable and more enjoyable for them. I would remind the Treasurer that the scheme of main roads which this bill envisages is in the nature of a national luxury, and that this nation, since the war, is heavily in pawn. We have become accustomed to speaking carelessly in terms of millions, and the phrase "What is a million?" which once caused some astonishment among honorable members would have to be changed in more modern times to " What are ten millions?" to produce anything like the same effect. This nation, since the war and arising out of it, is in pawn to the god Moloch, whose interests we served for over four dreadful and tragic years. Although we are a protectionist country - at least it may be taken that we have accepted that as our policy, and I think that all sections of the House believe in it - we have to remember that the inflated revenues that we are receiving through the Customs under a protectionist tariff are unnatural. We must, if necessary, cease to expend with prodigal hand and unthinking mind the millions that we are receiving through the Customs and by means of loans, and cease to live as we are living to-day, in an age of luxury and extravagance, because the time may come - and I very much fear that it will - when the Customs revenue will fall, and once the <inline font-style="italic">debâcle</inline> begins it will be rapid and complete. </para>

                            <para>- It will mean that the protectionist policy is beginning to operate as such instead of as a revenue producing policy. At the moment, because of our conditions of living, certain persons are able to flood this country with imports despite even the highest protective duties that we have imposed. That condition is naturally and necessarily temporary and uncertain, and so soon as protection really begins to operate as such, these inflated and extravagant revenues of to-day must naturally and necessarily fall. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot prophesy that. But no statesman would say that our existing unnatural conditions will last indefinitely. So I say to the distinguished gentlemen on the other side who have so light-heartedly produced the conditions of debt and difficulty under which we are living to-day, and under which generations still unborn must labour for 100 or 200 years, even under the most favorable circumstances - because the produce of the labour of the workers of this country is being thrown into the open jaws of the god Moloch - that we cannot rightly, though we may in fact, have both prodigality and luxury in the one generation. This country must eat the husks before it will be entitled to participate in the fatted calf. It appears to think that it enjoys some special privilege by virtue of the fact that its loans and unnatural revenues are enormous, enabling it to live in a welter of expenditure as though its conditions were natural and permanent, whereas, in fact, they are clearly unnatural and bound to be temporary. It is, in these circumstances, when the public mind is inflamed against increasing taxation and its burden - and rightly so, in view of the swollen revenues of this country - that the Treasurer proposes to add a super-tax to that burden. The taxation outlined in the bill will fall largely upon industries and production, and has not the justification which a wise, protective duty could be argued to have. </para>

                    <para>I should like to ask whether the bill is constitutional? In these days, when judges differ with such cordiality and lawyers make large profits out of differences of opinion on legal points, it is not unbecoming that a member of what is sometimes called the inferior branch of this learned profession should venture an opinion which is bound to be respected, in that it is certain to be shared by some respected authority. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Since then he has found it necessary to square his present position and his present responsibility as a member of the Cabinet bringing in this bill, with his position when he expressed that view as an independent member and constitutional lawyer. All that I can say is that the refinements of his argument have been such as to inspire in me a greater admiration for his legal subtlety, if not for his political honesty. The Attorney-General raised certain objections to the legislation passed in 1923 and re-enacted in 1924-5, which he now says do not apply to the present proposal. First of all, he quoted the preamble to the bill, which reads - </para>

                    <para>In that act there are all the essentials of the present bill, though the present measure imposes restrictions on the States which were not in the former; there is the necessity for the approval of the Commonwealth Minister, and provision for the supervision and  choice of the class of roads for which this subvention is to be used, and for complete co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth. It is clear that the States cannot receive this money without parliamentary sanction, and it follows that, under the act asunder the bill, the States must come forward. I submit, therefore, that the argument of the honorable the Attorney-General, in which he would distinguish between these two measures on constitutional grounds, is much too attenuated to be convincing. I was struck by the interjection of the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> who, when the Attorney-General was speaking, asked, " If that preamble had been in the act, would it have been all right?" or words to that effect. The Attorney-General said, with commendable astuteness, that he would deal with that point later; and presumably he proposes to deal with it at the meeting of the League of Nations. The point I am endeavouring to make is that if one of these measures is constitutional, the other is also constitutional, and if one of them is outside the powers of the Constitution, the other is also outside those powers. My opinion is - and I state it with great humility, and with respect for the learned jurists who are bound to differ on this point-that both of them are outside the constitutional powers of this Parliament. I confess that I have not argued the point before, and I would probably not have argued it now if the Attorney-General, who is the responsible law officer of the Crown in this Parliament, had not challenged honorable members to say a word or two about it. Section  96  of the Constitution contemplates the existence of necessitous States, such as - can I name them without giving offence? - our friendly allies in the federation, Tasmania and Western Australia. Of both of them I wish to speak with a marked respect, in striking contrast to the language of one right honorable member, whom I shall not name for fear of bringing him into discredit in the island State, where he may sometimes go for a holiday. It contemplates that condition, though I would not say that necessity was a condition precedent, and the handing over of money by the Commonwealth to the States to give effect to their policy within  the  terms of the State constitutions. It does not contemplate giving effect to a policy formulated by the Commonwealth for the States, and to that extent imposed upon them. </para>

                            <para>- The States should initiate and formulate the policy in respect of which the money is paid. It is curious that honorable members on the Government side, who have been so lamentably slow to support the Labour party in seeking amendments of the constitutional powers, should be so ready themselves to embark on the troubled and dangerous waters of doubtful constitutional practice, and in that way to invite constitutional difficulties and litigation. They should have learnt by this time that this Constitution of ours, unhappily, is not a flexible instrument, but is a painfully rigid one. Its rigidity has cost luckless litigants in this country many thousands of pounds, and, more important still, has hampered the development of industry and the operation of the peacemaking tribunals created by this Parliament. The honorable the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> was eloquent in his criticism of a former Nationalist Government for departing from the best traditions of constitutional government; but he has been the readiest, the most cheerful offender in doing what he has so strongly condemned in others. I realize the serious limitations which our Constitution imposes on us, and therefore I have, on more than one occasion, advocated the amplification of our constitutional powers. But I also counsel respect for the Constitution while it remains, and which the distribution of powers between the States and the Federation is still part of our scheme of government. If the Labour policy were given effect, and we had in this country a unified system of government such as that policy foreshadows, with delegated powers in local governing bodies, it is more than likely that one of the functions that would be assigned to those bodies would be the making of roads. I do not despise the work of the present municipalities in road making. It is true that the limitation of their powers and their purse hampers their activities; but, as intelligent and economical road makers and road maintainors, the municipalities,  and in Victoria the Country Roads Board, too, which operates as an instrument of the State Government, have done extremely good work. It should be borne in mind that the function of road making and road maintaining is bound up with railways and railway administration. At present an unfortunate competition is developing between road and railway transit. Competition is good in its way, but national transport should be controlled by an authoritative body, .operating in the interests, not of private firms or companies, but of the people. </para>

                    <para>The right honorable the Prime Minister, in the course of an impassioned speech on Tuesday evening, set out to show, as he said, exactly where he stood in regard to this bill. He may have shown exactly where he stood on Tuesday evening, but, if he did, he showed that he stood in a different place from that which he previously occupied ; and I understand that if he sets out to-day to show his present position it will be another modification of his position as defined on Tuesday evening. In fact, the alacrity and flexibility with which this gentleman has taken up different positions in regard to this bill show him as a possibly' dangerous competitor with a certain terpsichorean artist who has recently been performing in Melbourne. Before the last election, the Government indicated its intention to embark upon a road policy on a large if not extravagant scale. The words in which the announcement was made, to the primary producers of this country were uttered at a time when they were calculated to fall with the gentle cadence of September showers upon a thirsty wheat field, and yield the best return in the form of votes at the coming election. After all, who would be so churlish as to inquire too closely into the nature of this Pandora's box out of which these blessings were to come? We are told that it is ill becoming to " look a gift horse in the mouth." When offered a million or two. particularly on the eve of an election, would it not be unmannerly to ask how the money was to be raised ? The Prime Minister says now that he made it clear that the money was to be raised from motor-users through the Customs. The words used by the Treasurer were " road users." We are supposed to have learned, therefore, from the joint and several utterances of these .distinguished spouses at the head of the Government, that, at the time, it was clearly intended that the tax should be levied on petrol-driven road vehicles. The right honorable gentleman has asked for clear thinking on this question. I have endeavoured to apply a little clear thought to it, and, as a result, I am of opinion that a duty of 2d. a gallon on imported benzine would affect many other people beside the users of petrol-driven road vehicles. Thinking over the matter has also, apparently, enabled the Prime Minister to clarify his own position, because when he spoke on Tuesday night, he assured the House and the country that his proposal would need to be modified in many important particulars. Certain classes of objections, he said, were justified and genuine. He instanced the objections raised by users of aviation machines, and stationary engines of various kinds, many of which are used by the primary producers; and he said that he would exempt those people from the operation of this tax. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but it was the result of a little clear thinking that had not developed in the early stages when the roads grants were promised to the producers.  The declaration made by the Prime Minister the other evening was a fairly substantial win for public criticism. By his impassioned resentment at the criticism which has been addressed to him, he actually justified a great deal of it. Retreating not too gracefully he got into difficulty with much stronger opponents than the owners of stationary machines, saw-mills, separators, and aviation machines. He came up against the Standard Oil and other trusts, and proceeded to couch a lance at them. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but let us not get too enthusiastic until we have things in proper perspective. The spectacle of this distinguished representative of the  anti-trust  propaganda delivering his first lecture on it to those dimpled innocents of the Country and National parties who listened to him " was a touching sight to see." No Labour politician upon a soap box ever assailed the trusts with more effective vituperation than distinguished the speech of the right honorable gentleman. Certainly no Labour audience ever looked half so pleased at the demolition of trusts as did his kindergarten at their first lesson from him in anti-trust propaganda. Honorable members opposite sat listening to him with satisfied smiles of appreciation and occasional " hear, hears." </para>

May I remind the right honorable gentleman - and this is where, for the information of the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> I would qualify the applause - that for many years the oil trust has been pouring oil into Australia, and, adopting the language of the right honorable gentleman himself, " levying a terrific toll on all countries of the world." May I also remind him that although this toll is being paid largely by his friends and supporters in the Country and National parties, and although the swallowing up of small companies, of which he made a feature, and the levying of a toll on the primary producers, have been going on for years, hitherto he and the members of his party have remained unmoved. This levy on the oil used to drive the machinery of the primary producer did not begin to be felt until the right honorable gentleman got piqued when he saw himself thwarted in carrying out his road policy. </para>

                            <para>- By supplying 6 per cent. of the total oil requirements of Australia? The right honorable gentleman had better not challenge me upon the operations of that enterprise, in which the Commonwealth Government has allied itself with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which also is a large importer of oil. Some day when I have done with wireless matters and the Marconi business I may have pleasure in moving a censure motion in connexion with the Commonwealth's association with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in order to see if it would not be wise to prick that bubble also. What has caused the change ? Because, undoubtedly, the position has changed. To the right honorable gentleman it is no longer a question of the terrific toll on the various countries of the world, or the extent to which stationary engines and aviation engines in Australia have been levied upon. What really actuated him in uttering his denunciation on Tuesday was the fact that a representative of this great importing trust had threatened to withdraw his election support from him. This was "the most unkindest cut of all!" The terrific toll levied on the people of this country might have been borne, the levy on the farmers' oil engines might have been suffered, but that any one should threaten the right honorable gentleman with the withdrawal of election support, which doubtless had been given with much generosity and liberality in the past, was indeed terrible. Probably he expected Labour applause, and he was surprised that it was qualified and moderate, even though some in the ranks of Tuscany did applaud a little. It was because we realized that there was in the talk of withdrawal of election support the real element of disaster, and it was then that the Leader of the Opposition quietly interjected, " That is an additional reason why we should pass the referendum." "For a moment the Prime Minister smiled broadly and appreciatively, and then I watched the smile fade away wan and feeble as the full import of my leader's interjection dawned on him. It dawned on him that whatever might be regarded by him to-day as an argument for the amendment of the Constitution in August, 1926, was equally applicable in 1911 and in 1913, and, in fact, on every occasion when these distinguished gentlemen opposite have had an opportunity to vote against an amendment of the Constitution, by means of which alone can we deal with that great octopus which he has said is throttling the nations of the world. When I listened to the right honorable gentleman, I thought of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company - our partner in the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited - of the wireless agreement, and of the right honorable gentleman's election expenses, and it occurred to me that his righteous indignation fell somewhat flat and had a hollow sound. However, it is never too late to mend. We welcome the right honorable gentleman when he moves in our direction. We shall join with him in dealing with this great trust as with others, so long as he can guarantee us the support of his following in the chamber and outside. But let him beware. If he enters into this discussion because of a threat by the oil trust to withdraw his election expenses, let him remember that as soon as he begins to fight it on the hustings with real weapons it will offer to restore its party contributions, and then will come the real temptation for him and his party. I know that the right honorable gentleman is sensitive on these things, and I would not say a word to touch his personal honour; but election expenses are essentially questions of money, and this is the acid test by which he and his party will be tried. The Prime Minister was asked on the floor of the House what he intended to do to counteract the operations of this great trust. He replied that he did not intend to do anything at present, though the Government was keeping an eye on it. But what about the terrific toll that this trust is levying on the people of this country? Does the Government propose to allow it to continue without hindrance provided it apologized for its remissness? Shall we hear nothing about it at the next election? I am reminded of the French duellist who said, " I will smack your cheek"If the right honorable gentleman meant one-half of what he said about the operations and inroads of this trust, it is his bounden duty to deal with it. He has declared that he has the power to do so - which I doubt - but, if so, let him use it. I conclude on this aspect of the matter by observing that, had he earlier given support to the policy of this party, he would have had ample power. For his former opposition to our policy he must now answer to his own conscience and to the people. </para>

                    <para class="block">In the course of his speech on Tuesday evening, the right honorable gentleman waved newspapers in his hand and called! attention to the advertisements that have appeared in every provincial journal in Australia in support of the agitation against the Government proposals. He argued that the funds for this campaign were supplied by this great trust, and ridiculed the possibility of the Town and Country Union having supplied them. " Ah," he said, " here is the hidden hand." If the form had been different, I could have imagined, in other days, similar words coming from the lips of the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> The "hidden hand," we are told, is the Standard Oil Trust, for the money could not have come from petrol users who own stationary engines, milking machines, and so on. Verily, here the Prime Minister felt a still kinder cut. He had just emerged successfully from an election won on these lines. Had he no copyright or" performing right " that he should be flattered with an unpleasant imitation of his own methods? </para>
                    <para>Main roads will not be an issue at the next election, but big principles and big business will remain an issue; and it will be found that the Labour party - it may be fewer in numbers or greater - will stand for big principles, while honorable members opposite will, as usual, stand for big business. For these reasons, we on this side of the chamber were not as deeply impressed as we might have been by the burning words of the right honorable gentleman against these oil importing companies. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister objected strongly to this company passing on the tax. But I ask him this pointed question: How does he propose to make this tax payable by the road users of petrol machines unless it is passed on? That question requires a little consideration. He should not penalize his quondam friends for doing what he and his honorable colleague, the Treasurer, undoubtedly foreshadowed and intended. There can be no doubt that the Government intended to pass this tax on to the road users of petrol machines. Let us be honest and consistent about the matter. </para>
                    <para>If this were a protectionist levy which would benefit the whole community honorable members on this side of the chamber would be supporting it far more heartily and unitedly than honorable members opposite ; but its protectionist incidence is utterly insignificant. As a matter of fact, it is a super tax. I should like to know what the Commonwealth Oil Refinery has to do with taxes on chassis and tires ; but that point seems to have been overlooked by the Government. I remember seeing in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> newspaper some little time since the picture of a motor car with arrows pointing to all the parts of it which were subject to heavy taxation. There can be no doubt whatever that this is a super tax and a revenue, but not protective, duty. I was reared upon the land, and for some years endeavoured to carve a living out of it, so naturally I have a deep and abiding sympathy with those who have to use bad roads. I believe that one of the most practical means of developing a .country is to provide it with means of transport and outlet. Those who have the courage and patriotism to go into our undeveloped areas with the object of making a living for themselves deserve superabundant consideration and support. But that is not the question here. We already have an overflowing treasury, and distribute millions of money with prodigal hands - a million for one bounty here, and a million for another there - without any consideration of the huge debts that are mounting up. We seem, by a reverse method of reasoning, to disregard our mounting debts in proportion to their rate of increase. In times of greater prosperity and solvency than these we should regard this proposal as utterly outrageous and unthinkable. </para>
                    <para>My view is that roads should be dealt with by the State authorities. For that reason no very great objection was offered to the original proposals of the Government to pay subventions to the States, within certain well defined limitations, for the purpose of road making. Under the old arrangement of the States and municipalities retained a greater measure of control of their roads. This Parliament has more than enough to do, without embarking upon an enterprise like this, the constitutional authority for which is extremely doubtful. It is true that we are looking for the amendment of our Constitution along lines which have proven urgently necessary to give effect to the concept of government of the original framers of the Constitution Act; but I value the work done by our municipalities and other local governing bodies generally, and, from that point of view, these proposals and the methods by which the Government proposes to raise the money to give effect to them, are utterly objectionable to me. The attitude of the Labour party in regard to trusts and combines cannot be misunderstood any more than can our roads developmental policy. We do not believe that we have any right under our Federal system to infringe the prerogative of the States, although we give place to none in our antipathy and hostility to trusts and combines. Nothing that the right honorable gentleman has said or can say will prevent us viewing these things in their correct perspective. Under our Federal system we should respect the rights of the States. If, bearing that in mind, we can, by equitable means, secure for the people good roads, we intend to do so; but we do not consider that possible by means of the proposals now before us. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> said the other day that the Commonwealth Parliament should deal with national matters, and that these were enumerated in the Constitution. My reply is that road making is not mentioned there. And if there is any matter that can be dealt with effectively by local authorities, it is road making. </para>

                        <para>.- I shall vote against this bill. I shall do so on many grounds, some of which have already been referred to by other speakers in this debate. The principal ground for my objection I say at once is that which was stressed with such force by the last  speaker,  the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan).</inline> Roads are essentially and exclusively, under the constitutional powers of the respective parliaments of this country, State concerns. This measure is an intrusion into the domain, of the States. It is unnecessary. I think it is wicked and misleading ; and that it will eventually prostitute, and be harmful to, the States. I do not desire under present conditions to see an essential function of the States, which most of them discharge as well as they can with the money they have, weakened in. any way. I believe this measure to be distinctly unconstitutional. I read the Constitution as a layman, and not as a lawyer. Those of us who are laymen in this Parliament, notwithstanding our administrative and legislative experience, which is fairly extensive when massed in this House, have to admit that lawyers may see points, in cases and principles which have been determined, that may escape us. But I have followed up this matter a little. I have read the Constitution and the commentaries upon it, and I make no doubt whatever that this measure is a defiance of the* intention of section 96. If any one wishes to be satisfied ou that point, he should read the debates of the Federal Convention. I do not mean to say that the High Court will do that. The High Court asks merely what is contained within the four corners of an act; but, all the same, we must recall, so far as we can, the views and intentions of the founders of the Constitution, because it was upon their expressed intentions that, on its submission to the people, these gave it their approval by their votes in all of the States. From the point of Anew  of the legislator who is not surrounded by the atmosphere of the law courts, but is responsible to the people, and should be responsive to their desires and wishes, we must take that consideration into account. It is perfectly clear that section 96 of the Constitution was framed to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to help a necessitous State, and not, by largesse, to debauch the States and persuade them from the discharge of their functions. The power conferred in section 96 is a very proper power. A practically similar power is contained in the Constitution of the United States of America, and in some others. It was felt that the central and national parliament should have the. power, if a particular State were in difficulties, either because of its association with the Federation or from any other cause, to vote money from the national revenue to help it. But it was never imagined by any one 25 years ago that this power would be used as an instrument of subversion of the Constitution, depending and relying upon the cupidity of the expected recipients to induce them to abandon their constitutional rights, powers, responsibilities, and duties. That is exactly what is being done when this extremely liberal, and, I think, unwise offer is made to the States. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has referred to the different interpretations of the constitutional position given to the House by the Attorney-General, ' first, as a private member, and later as Attorney-General. I dealt with that at some length in my remarks on the budget, and I see nothing in the subsequent address of the Attorney-General to cause me to change the views I then expressed. I cannot for the life of me see how a lawyer, giving an opinion as a lawyer, can take so widely different a vision of these two measures - that of 1923 and this of the present year. I am not prepared to accept the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of the Attorney-General. The honorable gentleman did not tell us whether he offered his latest opinion as a political Minister learned in the law, but I think we are entitled to know that. Only the other day,, in answer to a question concerning his intervention in a case before a court, the honorable and learned gentleman did distinguish between his dual responsibilities and duties. That distinction was not new to members who have studied the judicial functions of an Attorney-General. The honorable gentleman's statement was historically correct, with the exception of one phrase which he used in reply to the question submitted to him. He said that he was not responsible to Parliament in one aspect of his duality. "What a ridiculous statement. There are innumerable cases.. I could cite several, and I intend to cite one, in which in Great Britain, the home of constitutional principles, this duality of the position held by the Attorney-General was distinctly recognized by the authorities; but it has never been separated from politics. The latest case is that in which the Ramsay MacDonald Government withdrew a prosecution against a communist editor on the judicial advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Patrick</inline> Hastings, then Attorney-General. Who could keep that issue out of Parliament? It was distinctly political, and became a vital issue in the subsequent campaign. No man can stand here as a Minister of the Crown with duality of functions, and say that he is not responsible to Parliament for all that he does in either capacity. When it comes to a case of the discharge by the Attorney-General of his ordinary legal duties in this House, that is to say, his political legal duties in leading the House on questions of law, we speculate as to how much his opinion is coloured by his desire to help forward the policy of his colleagues, and whether his advice is pure law, so far as there is such a thing as pure law. </para>

                            <para>- It has been already tested by eminent King's Counsel, not before the High Court of Australia, but before the bar of public opinion. An eminent lawyer in this State has already informed the Victorian Government that this measure is not constitutional. Another has done the same in New South Wales, and I think another in South Australia, who controverts the Attorney-General's opinion from the State point of view. These men were consulted as lawyers, and not as judicial advisers of the Crown. There is no element of politics in their opinions, because none of them is in politics. I speak as one who has watched many Attorneys-General, and many of them eminent in State and Federal affairs, and I say the difficulty always is to know how much politics there is in the legal opinion offered to the House, to put through the Government's measures, or as propaganda for the Government's policy. </para>

He was challenged as to whether his former opinion or his present opinion was wrong. I made the challenge, and the honorable gentleman answered in a way which I think convinced nobody. He certainly did not convince me. Later on he offered his definite opinion that this bill is constitutional. A trained lawyer on the other side of the House distinctly disagrees with him. He says that if the other measure to which reference has been made was unconstitutional this is unconstitutional. We are entitled to exercise our own judgment. </para>

What I say is that when this law officer who is half politician and half lawyer gives an opinion in connexion with this measure which commits him to the stultification of an opinion he gave formerly upon an almost similar bill, I decline to take his <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit.</inline> That is all I say. I do not hesitate to express the belief that this bill can be challenged. I believe it will be challenged. Anything I can do to cause it to be challenged before a proper tribunal will be done if the measure passes. Let those finally responsible for the determination of the matter decide it by having it brought deliberately before them. We have this extraordinary paradox. We threaten to withdraw a substantial sum of money from the States, in connexion with another measure to which reference may be made, and almost simultaneously we bring along these gifts to debauch them. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; they could not be taxed from anybody else; although, if the gifts were made to the people who contribute the money, the bill would have one defect less than it has at present. It is surely an extraordinary paradox that we should propose to curtail the powers of the States by refusing them certain supplies, and should then endeavour to make them gifts and still further weaken them. Although the States may be in need of money to carry out this highway policy- </para>

                            <para>- Almost at the same time. The passage of one of the measures is delayed, and it probably will not be dealt with this session. The Government is, however, still pushing on with this bill. I do not think that we are entitled to make the States, which are constituent parts of this nation of ours, the poor relations of the Commonwealth. I agree with the Treasurer in one phase of his argument, that it is necessary that we should gradually divorce certain financial relations that subsist to-day between the Commonwealth and the States, but we should do that in a proper way. We should not endeavour to hold the States in pawn to control them. We should allow them to function so far as their means will allow within the ambit of their own constitutions. They should not be vassals of the Commonwealth. If we wish to alter the constitution - and I am prepared to go much further in this direction than some members of the Opposition, though I am not in accord with some of the views they have expressed on the subject - let us alter it in a proper way. It should be done by deliberate debate and decision of the two Houses of the national Parliament, whose decisions should be submitted for the sanction of the people. We should not do this work outside, but inside the constitutional limits set down. This bill is, I think, an attempt to get control of important State functions by the aid of patronage, gifts, bribery, and debauchery, which their very poverty has induced some of the states to accept. In introducing the bill, the Minister dealt at length with the example of America. It is astonishing how little literature is available in our libraries regarding the gradual advance of the financial relationships of the Republic with its constituent States. But I have dug into my memory for a number of facts promiscuously obtained and stored there, which, though they must be given vaguely, indicate that the parallel quoted by the Minister is false. The United States of America has passed the pioneering stage. Australia, on the other hand, is just emerging from the stage of the axe and the fire-stick, used in the clearing of land for the settler. It has about 6,000,000people; America claims to have a population of nearly 120,000,000. Australia's revenues are small; those of the United States of America are almost incalculable. Australia's debts per head of population are, as the honorable member for Batman rightly said, huge, and swollen by the war; those of the United States of America are probably the lightest in the world, relative to the power of its people to pay. Ever since, about 60 years ago, the crash following the American civil war broke the finances of the Republic, its exchequer has gradually risen to opulence. Indeed, there have been occasions when the Finance Committee of Congress did not know what to do with the swelling federal revenues; and it has been from year to year lad ling out to the States subventions, bounties, and dividends. These facts are easily traceable in the literature that should be, but is not, obtainable in our parliamentary libraries. But the Republic is now becoming cautious, and is harking away from this policy. It is urging the discontinuance of a number of these bad practices, with a view to leaving the States financially free. I am able to quote evidence of that new tendency.  President  Coolidge, when submitting his budget measure to Congress in August, 1924, referred to the Federal aid to the States and economy, and concluded </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>For Federal aid to States the estimates provide in excess of 109,000,000 dollars. These subsidies are prescribed by law. I am convinced that the broadening of this field of activity is detrimental both to Federal and State Governments. Efficiency of Federal operations is impaired as their scope is enlarged. Efficiency of State Governments is impaired as they relinquish and turn over to the Federal Government responsibilities which are rightfully theirs. I am opposed to any expansion of these subsidies. My conviction is they can be curtailed with benefit both to the Federal and State Governments. </para>

                    <para class="block">After giving a general warning,  President  Coolidge said, in effect, " I now become more specific; let us reduce these gifts; let us cut them down to half. We shall confine our aid to certain broad national highways." But later on the inevitable tendency of thought on the Finance Committee of Congress will prove itself; and these amounts will be further reduced, and, in that way, the divorce of federal and State finances - which the Treasurer is desiring of effecting in Australia - will be illustrated in the United States of America. If we are to follow the example of the United States of America, are we to be guided by its past practice, which it admits was prodigal and harmful, or its modem and more cautious tendency? I prefer the latter. America has had experience of the ill effects of the policy of making subventions to the States, to which the federal authority was driven only because, while the national exchequer was overflowing; some of the authorities which were charged with the development of the territories and the new lands of the west and middle west, were necessitous. But the situation is different now, and the federal authority is seeking to establish new and better conditions. So I pass by the Minister's illustration, which had been so elaborately prepared for him by his department. </para>

                            <para>- I have quoted the  President  of the Republic, and I do not know that he ever sat in a State Parliament. At any rate, on both occasions he spoke as the head of the nation, and he is not associated with State administrations. As to the special source from which the money to be handed to the States is expected to come, the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> rightly said that the original statement by the Government was that the users of the roads were to pay for their construction, if not for their maintenance. But in the passion that has been generated by political and economic opposition to certain phases of the new duty, the Prime Minister has since explicitly expressed the desire that the companies which import the petrol should bear the burden of the duty. That may be wise, if practicable, but it is not the ambition with which the bill was launched, and it is not in accordance with the statement made by the Minister when introducing it. Undoubtedly the wisest policy that can be adopted by any nation or State that has the duty of making and maintaining roads is to compel those who injure the roads to pay for their construction and upkeep. That was the policy originally promulgated by the Government ; but angered by the natural opposition of the very powerful interests which, I believe, have made enormous sums of money out of the increase of motor traffic in Australia, the Prime Minister allowed himself to he diverted from his first intention, and now seeks to impose on the petrol importing companies the tax of 2d. per gallon. Whether the idea be good or bad, he cannot do that. </para>

No man who knows anything of business can fail to realize that under present conditions the people who control the supplies of this eminently needful commodity can, if they so arrange amongst themselves, pass the whole of the duty on to the consumer; and the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, making so microscopic a proportion of the distilled spirit that motor users require, will be incapable of preventing it. The position would be different if the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited could supply 50 per cent. of the community's requirements, but its output is equal to only 5 to 7 per cent. of the total consumption. </para>

                            <para>- That is another paradox in this proposal. If the Commonwealth Oil Refineries could supply the whole of the needs of the community, and the importing companies were driven out of business, the Commonwealth would not get the £1,500,000 that it expects to pay into a trust fund for subsequent distribution to the States. The calculation of the Minister for Trade and Customs that the duty will yield only £1,500,000 may be perfectly right, allowing for the expansion of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries. But the rise in petrol consumption has been phenomenal and romantic. It may be safely said that in three years it has trebled. </para>

                            <para>- The proposed agreement with the States is for ten years, and if this rate of increase continues, a revenue now estimated at £1,500,000 may become £3,000,000 or £5,000,000 per annum. Is the Commonwealth to continue to pay into the trust fund the whole of the proceeds of the duty of 2d. per gallon on imported motor spirit? If so, this Federal largesse, which already seems to the States alarmingly high, may be two or three times as great before the agreement expires. </para>

                            <para>- Contradiction is not argument, and I have no desire to quarrel with the honorable member. I had the honour of establishing the Country Roads Board of Victoria; we appointed to it the best men we could get, and they did the best work that has been done oh any roads in Australia. After ten years of experience, they will declare that their problem at all times is not construction, but maintenance - and maintenance means finance. The Commonwealth Parliament would, I presume, be just as much entitled to grant money for the maintenance of roads as for their construction, and I fear that, upon the proposed trust fund and the Federal Treasury, substantial demands will be made in future for the maintenance of these special roads, for which the States will not accept responsibility. </para>

But when the agreement expires, what will happen ? The States cannot be obliged to maintain these roads in perpetuity. They will be our roads and our obligation, just as the east-west railway is, and as the north- south line will be. The Commonwealth, therefore, will have to maintain them, or let their surfaces revert to grass. It is as plain as the sun at noon-day that if developmental roads are built under this agreement, we shall be called upon to maintain them at some future time. </para>

The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> by interjection, said he thought that everybody knew that. He suggested that in his policy speech he made the matter clear to the people. I do not think that he is correct, because when reading his policy speech I, for one, assumed that there were many ways of raising money for this purpose. </para>

                            <para>- Respecting the attitude which the States are adopting towards the. Government's proposals, my opinion is that State action in matters of this kind should precede Federal action. That would have obviated the present extraordinary and humiliating spectacle of the Commonwealth Parliament being asked to do certain things on the assurance of the Ministry that five out of six States had agreed to the Commonwealth's proposals, and then finding that some of those States were not merely refusing to ratify, but were repudiating the agreement altogether. Our present position has come about either because of the haste with which this Government is rushing this legislation through, or because of delay on the part of the States. One State has agreed to accept the agreement, because of its natural desire for money. The South Australian Parliament has passed a resolution against the agreement, although it was the apparent desire of the Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gunn,</inline> and his Government to accept it. </para>

                            <para>- We should have followed the procedure that was adopted in connexion with the Murray Waters agreement. In that case, the States had to pass legislation before the Commonwealth Government ratified the agreement. I suggest that the present humiliating position of the Prime Minister and the Government could have been avoided if the State Parliaments had first been asked to ratify this agreement. I certainly object to the Government proceeding with the bill in the present anomalous and ridiculous circumstances. It cannot be wise to do so, whatever may he thought of the arguments for or against the measure. This Parliament should call a halt and say to the States : " Make up your minds, and then we shall deal with the problem. Our offerstands." That is the proper attitude for us to take, and I suggest to the Prime Minister that, lacking the time this session to give the measure leisurely and proper consideration, and in view of public requirements, he should place it again on the stocks until the States have arrived at unanimity respecting the Government's proposals. </para>

                            <para>- I leave my suggestion as it stands. I should not object if the tax were continued so long as the moneys collected were placed in a trust fund, which, I understand, is the intention of the Government. I certainly object to the tax, because of certain iniquities associated with it. If the States had first been asked to ratify the agreement, we should not now be in our present unenviable position. I object to the petrol tax mainly because I believe that we should do nothing to obstruct the growth of the use of motor vehicles, especially for commercial purposes. The present tax on all the motorist uses, and, in addition, the heavy State licence and registration fees, are more than sufficient for him to bear, compared with other users of the roads and taxpayers generally, despite the comparisons made by a Minister to a deputation. I object also to the agreement, because it leaves out roads in urban municipalities. I do this, not because I represent both inner and outer urban municipalities, but because probably 60 per cent. or 70 per cent. of the motor taxation and motor consumption taxation contemplated under these proposals will be raised within the urban centres, and further, because of the great damage done to urban roads by motor vehicles. There are roads in the metropolitan areas that, three or four years ago, were for mile after mile like Collins-street pavements, but are now riddled with holes because of the motor traffic that passes over them. Under the agreement motorists of the urban centres will pay heavily to provide roads in the country and in other districts which they will rarely or never use. Those whom I represent are to heavily contribute money that is to be spent in other districts. </para>

                            <para>- I wonder who will have the use of motor cars at the next election. Not the candidates of the party that imposes this taxation. They will go to the chartered libertines of the Labour party. Their supporters -- will be carried to the polls in motor cars, while the supporters of the Nationalist party, who at the last election had a car placed at the disposal of nearly every voter, will have considerable difficulty in obtaining any at all. This tax, moreover, is unfair not only to certain municipalities, but also to certain States. I do not wish to take a provincial attitude, because I am not a parochialist. I am an Australian above all things. When I was a youngster I took an interest in politics and advocated the adoption of the Federal Constitution, and since then I have done my best to assist the growth of the Federation. I have served in both Commonwealth and State spheres, but I am not going to argue now for State rights. </para>

Under the agreement, Victoria will raise £5,600,000, and will benefit by only £3,600,000 Under the two-fifths calculation of the Treasurer, that State will hand £2,000,000 to the other States, and the amount will grow, until ultimately it may become £5,000,000 or more. New South Wales has to raise £7,600,000, and will benefit by only £5,500,000. The distributions are to be made on the basis of area, and of population, and therefore Western Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland will greatly benefit. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member can prove that, he will be the senior wrangler of this Parliament, and capable of winning the mathematical tripos. The principle of special taxation for earmarked purposes, to be levied from certain States and given to others, has never been and cannot now be justified. New South Wales and Victoria, between them, contain probably 71 per cent. of the population of Australia, and they will receive infinitely less proportionately to population than the States with small populations. For these reasons I intend to vote against the bill. The scheme is ill-considered and unnecessary, and it makes the Kingdom of Heaven, as the States see it, very hard to enter. I hope that what the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> said, at the beginning and closing of his remarks, will not be lost sight of by the Treasurer, who, before the year 1923, was one of the most eloquent advocates of economy. I have just been perusing the speeches that he made, including the " loot " speech, and it. is difficult for any one to imagine the change that has since occurred in his character and conduct.I say that not to chide but to chaff him, and I venture to say that, before long, he will find it extremely hard to justify his position. He is not responsible for debts and commitments that were contracted prior to his becoming Treasurer, but, if he would put into operation only 50 per cent. of the theories that he so vigorously advocated when Leader of the Country Party, instead of making huge bounties and distributing largesse in every shape and form, as he has done since his elevation to Cabinet rank, he would be reducing the national expenditure. As the honorable member for Batman said, we are living in an extravagant age. At this time of undoubted prosperity, we should make provision for those alternating periods of prosperity and depression which must inevitably come to Australia. As sure as God made little apples, we shall have periods of drought. If we get bad weather when the ship of government is under full sail, as it is now, I foresee a lot of trouble for those responsible for the government of this country. So soon as the necessity for retrenchment arises, the electors will inflict condign punishment upon those who have been guilty of misgovernment. The Government should not disregard this warning nor our past experience. It is certainly time that we called a halt in expenditure, and refrained from voting extravagant sums to industries and to States in a way that the national treasury cannot possibly afford. </para>

He said that communications had been sent to each of the State Governments asking them whether they adhered to the agreement arrived at by a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in February of this year, which five of them had subsequently written to say they fully accepted. The Prime Minister also said that the bill would be delayed to permit of replies being received from the States. Since then five replies have come to hand.

                    <para>In those circumstances the Government regards its course as clear. It will carry out the agreement as a national policy in those States where the governments, in good faith, are introducing legislation to ratify the agreement. It will do the same as it did with the proposal to unify the railway gauges, which, when the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was Prime Minister, was agreed to by the Premiers in conference, and was subsequently repudiated by some of them. The Government believes that Australia cannot afford to have bad roads or an inefficient transport system. The increased cost of running motor traffic on bad roads is more than the cost of constructing and maintaining good roads. That has been proved by experience in other parts of the world. The Government considers that good roads, and an efficient transport system, are an essential part of our machinery of national development and production. </para>

                            <para>-That is true, and it has been continued and extended  by this Government. When I spoke from the corner I urged that additional loan money should be spent in that direction. I make no attempt to excuse that policy, for I am proud of it, and of the Government which has continued and extended it. The increase in invalid and old-age pensions has added about £4,000,000 to the total annual expenditure of this country. I am not ashamed of that expenditure. The act which increased those pensions was greatly overdue, and I am glad that it will help the old and infirm people to have something like reasonable comfort in their declining ye.ars. My only regret is that it is not possible, because of the conditions of this country, to make their old age still easier for them. Defence is the only other item involving increased expenditure. I have always maintained that, as a measure of national insurance, we must have as effective defence machinery as possible. </para>

                            <para>- That was immediately after the Washington Conference, when it was said that a reduction of defence expenditure could be made. As demonstrating the soundness of my amendment, I may mention that during the ensuing six or seven months the government of the day was able to reduce the defence expenditure, and that in the next budget it was reduced by more than the amount I had mentioned. Despite the Washington conference, it has now been found that we must make provision for naval defence ; and if the right honorable member for Balaclava will read the speech I made when moving the amendment to which he has referred, he will discover that I specifically excluded naval defence from my amendment. An examination of the figures will disclose that since this Government has been in power an iron hand has been kept on the expansion of departmental expenditure. Although during that time the population of this country has increased, departmental expenditure has remained almost stationary. That result has been achieved not by cheese-paring economy, but bv a bold policy of re-organization which has included the amalgamation of Federal and State Income Tax Departments. We believe that the people of this country appreciate that policy, and I, for one, am not ashamed of it. Australia pays for good roads, whether she has them or not, and the Government thinks that it should give to those States which are willing to honour the agreement an opportunity to improve their roads, and to make those parts of the Commonwealth as efficient as possible in the machinery of production. We believe that if we are to meet the rest of the world successfully in competition, we must pl.ace the transport system of this country in order. We have tried to arrange for the marketing of our produce in a national way, and we believe that transport is just as much a matter of national concern. The Government intends to proceed immediately with the bill to enable it to operate in those States that have adhered to the agreement. Provision will be made in it for the dissenting States to come in later, because the Government is quite satisfied that they are now labouring under a misapprehension. As the representative of a New South Wales constituency, I feel sure that New South "Wales will adhere to the agreement within a few months of the passage of this bill. An examination of the widely different masons put forward by the Governments that are at present repudiating the agreement show clearly that they will come into line later. </para>

                            <para>- I think I shall be able to produce evidence that will carry conviction to the* mind of every honorable member. Public opinion in New South Wales is strongly in favour of this bill, and no matter what the present Government may think, it will force that Government to accept the agreement. Just as these State Governments, under pressure of the agitation engineered by the oil companies, have seen fit to recant, so will they come into line again under the pressure of public opinion. The key resolution of the conference with the States' representatives was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cann,</inline> of New South Wales. It was - </para>

                    <para class="block">Commonwealth Government £560,000 under the agreement, That was actually admitted during the conference, and it was shown that at the present time New South Wales provides for main roads something like £819,000 for the county of Cumberland, and £1,151,000 for country main roads. As the New South Wales Minister for Works pointed out, the Government of New South Wales could use the amount required from that source to cover the money the Commonwealth Government was willing to place at the disposal of the State, without imposing additional taxation. He pointed out that by so doing that Government could continue and extend its programme. The shires and municipalities of New South Wales spent £3,320,000 in 1923-24, and £460,000 wa3 provided by the Government for roads. Much of the money provided by the Government came from motor fees, and the land-owners provided eight times as much as was provided by the motor users. When one knows that all over the world the volume of . traffic on the roads is 500 per cent, more than it waa a decade ago, one must admit that the road user should pay a proper contribution towards the cost of constructing and maintaining roads. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang's</inline> second objection is that towns with a population of over 5,000 are omitted from the scheme. In the discussion that took place, the only point of difference was as to whether towns of a population of 10,000 or 5,000 should be excluded. Ultimately the margin of 5,000 was fixed as a compromise acceptable by the States. Some of the States' representatives contended that the agreement should not include roads in any towns, and others that it should include roads through towns of only a certain size. This proposition which was largely arrived at as the result of a discussion among the State Ministers who are to handle, control, and construct the roads is not, as it has been absurdly stated, to create a Federal authority to override the States. Once a year the State Ministers will meet the Commonwealth Minister for Works and Railways, certificates will be given by the Commonwealth Works Engineer, and the Commonwealth Minister for Works and Railways has to give his approval of a main system of roads - roads of the type of the interstate roads </para>

                            <para>- But the new regulations will be an improvement. For instance, under the new proposals, the road from Melbourne to Albury will  eventually be as good as the road from Melbourne to Geelong to-day. The third objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales, is that the States cannot use this money for the maintenance of roads.. The purpose in raising this money is to construct new roads, and bring about a better system of main roads, which the Commonwealth insists should be properly maintained by the States. I should like to point out that this question was discussed very fully at the conference of Ministers, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calder,</inline> who is an authority on the subject, said - </para>

                        <para>I am only guessing when I say that I think (in Victoria) the local authorities spend about £1,000,000 a year on roads. For the past few years, they have been so burdened in financing the main roads By stem that they have had to reduce their expenditure upon other roads to a minimum. </para>

                    <para class="block">Under the old system, the burden of providing for the construction of main roads fell on the shires and municipalities, and they were not able to divert their funds to the maintenance of other roads. The conference of Ministers thoroughly appreciated that fact. It is also thoroughly appreciated in Western Australia, where,  a  couple of days ago, a conference representing  104  affiliated roads boards throughout the State carried unanimously  a  resolution "warmly supporting the Federal Main Roads Bill now before the Federal Parliament," and urged every Western Australian senator and representative "to strongly support the measure being passed this session." The representatives of these roads boards assume that the proposal to spend Commonwealth money on making main roads will undoubtedly help, to a remarkable degree, the construction and maintenance of other roads in country districts. I have already said that, in any opinion, this agreement will be finally endorsed in New South Wales. I shall bring evidence in support of that statement. My first evidence is that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stokes,</inline> Lord Mayor of Sydney, who, as everybody knows, is -the Labour member for Goulburn in the State House. Speaking at Braidwood last Friday, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stokes</inline> said- - </para>

                    <para class="block">Under the system of proportional representation, in operation in New South Wales, every country electorate has at least one, if not two, Labour representatives, and I am certain that the pressure of country Labour members will induce the Government of the State to give further consideration to this matter. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, if it is not evidence, it is a significant statement. If honorable members care to read the New South Wales newspapers, they will see that every day shire councils throughout the State are carrying resolutions urging the Government to come into the scheme. A fortnight ago I spoke to  150  motorists in Sydney. Not one of them was opposed to the Commonwealth's proposals; every one keenly supported them. Within the last few days I have been in touch with other representative Sydney men, and I can find little trace of dissension in the State against a national roads scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newlands, president</inline> of the Chamber of Manufactures in Sydney definitely said that he was strongly in favour of the scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ludowici,</inline> vice-president of the Automobile Club, commends the scheme, and his only regret is that the Commonwealth may not exercise sufficient control to ensure that good roads are made. I am sure that if a plebiscite were taken in New South Wales,  80  per cent, of the people would be in favour of the Commonwealth's proposals. </para>

                        <para>For those various reasons we are of opinion that, on the true reading of the Constitution, the Federal Aid Roads Bill is <inline font-style="italic">ultra</inline><inline font-style="italic">vires,</inline> and will, if passed, be invalid and inoperative. We are, of course, sensible of the fact that the. trend of High Court decision has been in the direction of sustaining the Commonwealth power in all cases of substantial doubt, either by construing ambiguous provisions of the Constitution somewhat liberally in favour of the Commonwealth, or by the other well-recognized principle of construing challenged legislation, so far as possible, in such a manner as to preserve its validity. The comparatively short period during which the High Court has been applying these principles renders it difficult for any constitutional lawyer to advise with certainty upon the extent to which the logical application of the later High Court doctrines will produce results which are possibly unexpected, and it may well be that the High Court, by giving to the important words of section 96 the very widest operation, might hold the proposal a valid one. </para>

The next State I propose to deal with is South Australia. I must confess that, although I have great hope of New South Wales and Victoria coming into line, because of developments that have taken place during the last few days, it is impossible to say what will happen in South Australia.

                            <para>- The Premier of South Australia was exceedingly anxious that the new duties should be imposed  only  on chassis and tires. He is now more concerned about the constitutionality of the petrol tax than of our road proposals. It is impossible to know what the State Governments will do in the future, for they have already changed their ground so often. In these circumstances, the Government has decided to proceed with its' policy, and will impose only sufficient taxation to meet the obligation it has incurred It is evident that as only three States have intimated that they intend to ratify the agreement, our expenditure in the coming year will not be so great as was anticipated. The three States concerned will, as a matter of fact, need something like £860,000. The Government has decided, therefore, to impose the tax of 2d. a gallon on imported petrol, but for the time being to waive the proposed additional duties on tires and chassis. The tax on petrol will supply requirements for the time being. If later, other States ratify the agreement, and it is found that the Commonwealth has insufficient revenue to meet its commitments, the Government will reconsider the position as it then appears. If it should be found that too much money is being raised by the petrol tax, that matter can be reviewed. </para>

                            <para>-- The constitutionality of the Main Roads Development Acts passed in the period 1923 to 1925 has been assailed. If these measures should be declared unconstitutional, it appears to me that the only result will be that the States will have to repay to the Commonwealth the road moneys they have received. </para>

                    <para>I wish now to offer a few observations in reply to the speeches delivered by the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> and other honorable members. First of all, let me insist that this matter must be dealt with from the national standpoint. If we are not prepared so to deal with it, we should leave it alone. It is surely our duty to do our best to enable our producers to compete in the world's markets with the producers of other countries, and also to compete with them in their own market. We should make our national machinery of production thoroughly efficient. If one country in the world needs good roads more than another it is Australia, for 96 per cent. of our production that is exported and sold on the world's markets is primary production. During his second reading speech, in introducing this bill, the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> was subjected to continual gibing for talking so much about the United States of America. I have no desire to talk a great deal about America, but we must give some attention to the fact that at present our imports from that country are valued at four and a half times as much as our exports to it. It is generally recognized that American methods are efficient, and, in my opinion, we should, in view of our unfavorable trade balance, do our best to apply them here. So far as Great Britain is concerned, the trade  balance is fairly even. We sent about £69,000,000 worth of our products to Great Britain last year, and we imported British goods of about the same value; but in the case of the United States o!f America, we received £39,000,000 worth of goods, and sent in return for them only about £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 worth of  our  produce. In the circumstances, it i= surely desirable that we should do whatever we can to improve our  position.  Ten years ago, the United States of America introduced, on a very small scale, a federal aid roads grant system. In the first year of its operation, the Federal Government spent only about $20,000,000 on it ; but last year its expenditure under the same heading ran into many hundred million dollars, for it has found that the policy pays handsomely. </para>

                            <para>- Then it is time that we started to build some, and the Government, in introducing these comprehensive proposals, is actuated with a desire to do so. Good roads are found in the United States of America, not in isolated patches, but in stretches of hundreds of miles throughout the whole country-side. Vast sums have been allocated there for road-making under the federal aid system. Difficulties were encountered in developing this system there, just as they are being encountered here; but having 48 States in their Union, the Americans seem to find it easier to take a national view of the situation than we do with only six States. Federal aid road money is distributed in the United States of America as follows - one-third on the population basis, one-third on the area basis, and one-third on the basis of the mileage of road in a State to the total mileage of roads in the Union. </para>

                            <para>- They do, as I shall indicate in a moment. It is interesting to see how this policy works. In America, as in Australia, some of the States are developed far more than others. New York State, for instance, contains only 10 per cent, of the total population of the United States, but pays 26 per cent, of the direct federal taxation that is collected, and is granted only 5 per cent, of the money distributed for federal aid roads. In other words, it pays proportionately five times as much taxation as it receives in road grants. </para>

                            <para>- I propose to do so in regard to a number of the States. Massachusetts paid in direct taxation to the Federal exchequer in 1922-23, $139,094,000, or 5.3 per cent, of the total taxation collected in the Union; but she received in federal aid road grants only $6,832,000, or 1.51 per cent, of the total amount distributed. In other words, she paid four times as much, proportionately, in taxation as she received in road grants. New York State paid $664,797,000 in direct taxation that year, or 25.36 per cent, of the total ; but received in federal aid road grants only $23,045,000, or 5.1 per cent, of the total. In other words, that State received only one-thirtieth as much in road grants as it paid in direct taxation. New Jersey contributed $110,909,000 in national taxation, or 4.23 per cent, of the total ; but received in road grants only $5,652,000 or 1.25 per cent, of the total. Pennsylvania contributed $247,121,000 in taxation, or 9.43 per cent, of the total, and received in road grants $21,237,000, or 4.70 per cent, of the total grant. Here let me join issue with the right honorable member for Balaclava in regard to the development of the United States of America. Quite a number of settlements there are as backward as some of our States. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Elwood</inline> Meade, who has been here recently, has been responsible, in the last three or four years, for establishing a number of new settlements in the "United States of America which are just as primitive as any in Australia. When we come to the Dakota states we find that the proportion of road grant to national taxation has changed. For instance, North Dakota in 1922-23 contributed only $1,507,000 in national taxation, or .06 per cent, of the total, b-;.t received in road grants §7,185,000, or 1.59 per cent, of the total amount distributed. In other words, she has received about five times as much in road grants as she paid in direct federal taxation. South Dakota paid $2,065,000 in national taxation, or .08 per cent, of the total amount received, but was granted $7,510,000 for roads, or 1.66 per cent, of the total distribution. Texas contributed $34,634,000 in direct taxation, or 1.32 per cent, of the total, but received £27,313,000 in road grant, or 6.04 per cent, of the total distribution. Montana's contribution in national taxation was $3,280,000, or .13 per cent, of the total, but she received $9,422,000 in road grants, or three times her total contribution to the national exchequer. </para>

                            <para>- They are paid from federal sources. The distributions are made on a national basis, and undoubtedly we must regard this as a national question. It has never been suggested that these grants in America were bringing about unification. The right honorable member for Balaclava argued that it was not fair to compare the United States of America with Australia. Then let us take Canada, just across the border, with her population of 9,000,000, and her huge area of undeveloped country, for she may well be compared with Australia. Canada has found it necessary to make federal subventions to the provinces to enable them to develop roads, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calder</inline> pointed out in. his report. The right honorable gentleman admitted that our States were endeavouring to do the best they could with the limited funds at their disposal. </para>

It is contended that we should not spend money in this national way, but should allocate the expenditure to the States in which the money is collected. That is not the way in which we allocate other expenditures by this Parliament, with the exception of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment, and I think I have demonstrated that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments have never been satisfactory, and have had to be supplemented from other sources. </para>

                            <para>- We are now raising taxation other than through the Customs for the purpose of making the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. Let us consider the bounties which have been paid in the past to stimulate industries. Much of the money paid in this way has been spent exclusively in one State. In the case of the iron and steel bounty, the total amount paid was £667,000, and of this amount £664,000 was spent in New South Wales, and the balance in Victoria. In the case of the meat export bounty, the total expenditure has been £263,000, and of this amount £227,000 went to Queensland. In the case of the canned fruit bounty, £70,000 out of a total expenditure of £120,000 went to Victoria. In the case of the cotton bounty, practically the whole of the money will go to Queensland. In the case of the wine export bounty, of a total amount paid of £245,000, £150,000 went to South Australia. In connexion with these payments, no one has ever suggested that the money should be allocated on a population basis to the State in which it is collected. It is spent as it ought to be, as the need arises, and in the States in which the assisted industries are carried on. There is another example in the expenditure on the River Murray Waters scheme. The money is provided by the whole of the people of all the States of Australia, and yet the whole of it is spent in three States. None of the other States have ever grumbled on that account, because it is a national work. No one will contend that every shilling collected in a particular State should be spent in that State. Let us examine the position as regards Federal establishments, and we shall find that, although people in Victoria at this time grumble about the proposed expenditure from Federal sources in the other States the Federal expenditure on this account has been greater in Victoria than in any of the other States of the Commonwealth. In the case of munition factories, £700,000 of capital is invested in New South Wales, £1,371,000 in Victoria, £126,000 in Queensland, £4,000 in South Australia, and nothing in the other States. These are national services, and if interstate and main roads are not also national services, I do not knew what a national service is. The right honorable member for Balaclava admitted that there should be something spent on interstate roads, and it is refreshing to find from the last report on the federal aid roads system in the United States of America, that, instead of the States becoming almsmen of the Federal Government as the result of the Federal and road grants, they have, under the system, been placed in a position in which some do not need Federal assistance at all. </para>

Two years ago I visited a place called Yuma, in the southern part of Arizona, where <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Elwood</inline> Meade carried out irrigation works. Four or five years ago the place was a desert, worse than any dry part of Australia, but to-day there are 54 miles of concrete roads in that area, and these roads provide the producers with direct communication with the railways, and with transport almost as speedy as if they had spur lines of railway construction. This is what is said in the report of Thomas H. McDonald, Chief of the Bureau of Public Roads - </para>

While these States could forego this privilege, the Federal Government could not, for, if it expects at any time in the reasonably near future, to have a complete system of national highways, it must offer to all the States sufficient inducement in the form of financial aid to get them to improve interstate highways in preference to unimportant local highways. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it extends into three different countries. In America the necessity for the creation of arteries for traffic is appreciated. The argument as to the value of good roads needs no further elaboration. In Canada it is admitted that the difference between an ordinary earth road and a macadamized road, as regards haulage, amounts to 6d. per ton mile. In four years, from 1920, they spent £5,000,000 on road construction, and it is estimated that the expenditure is worth £1,000,000 a year in the extra loads which can be hauled and the shorter time occupied in transporting products to the railway station. As to the views of the Government regarding the people who should contribute to the cost of construction and maintenance of main roads, there are three classes of persons who should contribute. For a start, there is the land-owner. </para>

                            <para>- He should contribute, but I remind the honorable member that he has been carrying the whole burden of the expenditure up to the present time. In New South Wales, in 1923-24, the land-owners found £3,320,000. It is only within the last three or four years that the State Government has devoted for the purpose of road construction some of the revenue collected in motor fees, and it spent in 1923-24 £400,000 or £500,000 from this source for this purpose. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware that the honorable member and the Leader of the Opposition believe that an increased land tax should be imposed. I disagree with them. I consider that there is already a very substantial land tax imposed. The Government of New South Wales gave up its land tax to local authorities at the inception of local government, because they knew that good roads and easy means of transport were necessary to assist the pioneers and settlers of the country, and could not be paid for twice by the land-owner. The second class of persons who should contribute towards road construction and maintenance are the road users. They should pay their proper share. Since motor traffic came into being within the last ten years in every country, the volume of road traffic has increased 500 per cent. That is not a result of the activity of the land-owners. It is due to the fact that with motor transport it is possible to run 200 or 300 miles a day, when with horse drawn vehicles it is not possible to run more than 50 or 60 miles a day. The third class of persons who should contribute is the general public, who, as a result of improved roads, will enjoy the advantage of a lower cost of living, by reason of the fact that production and distribution costs can be reduced. The Commonwealth scheme provides that all these classes shall contribute what the Government considers a fair share of the cost of the scheme. Throughout Australia between £12,000,000 and £14,000,000 is being spent in road construction and maintenance in the different States each year. The amount proposed to be provided by the Commonwealth is £2,000,000. Ail that the motor user is being asked to pay of this new taxation is £1,500,000, which with his State taxes make only about 20 per cent. of the total expenditure upon road construction in Australia. I have said that the advent of the motor car has increased the volume of traffic on roads 500 per cent., and there can be no question that the road users will benefit most from the construction of good roads. They will save money, first of all on the wear and tear of their cars. They will save in repairs to metal parts of cars rendered necessary by continual shocks. Less petrol will be necessary on smooth roads, because a rough road means a continual loss of driving power. With good roads there will be tremendous decrease in the loss on tires. In America there is a guarantee of 12,000 miles for the life of a tire, but in Australia it is very difficult to get a similar guarantee. </para>

                            <para>- There is all the more reason here why, by the construction of good roads, we should reduce the cost for petrol and tires in the running of cars. The savings in this way in Australia should be proportionately greater than in America, because of the greater cost of these things in this country. </para>

                    <para>I should like now to examine the attitude of the Opposition to this proposal. Three years ago honorable members opposite favoured the roads policy of the Government. The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> complained bitterly that the amount the Government proposed to expend in this way was not larger. He said he could use the whole of the proposed grant in his own electorate. Every one of them urged the Government to bring down the grant to lessen unemployment. I cannot account for their change of view. When they went to the country it was in support of " a progressive and continuous road policy." This is what the Leader of the Opposition stood for in his policy speech : - </para>

                        <para>The necessity for improving the roads in Australia is apparent to everybody. The Labour party is fully seized with the importance of this matter in the development of the country. Primary producers living some distance from the railway lines should be provided with proper roads as feeders to the railways. The Labour party will, if elected, take the necessary action to carry out a liberal and continuous scheme for the construction of roads, in co-operation with the State Governments. </para>

                    <para class="block">A liberal and continuous scheme is what they suggested. Yet the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> got up here and said they do not want a liberal and continuous scheme, and that they believe in building roads only out of Federal surpluses. What is the position with regard to Federal surpluses during the last sixteen years? There have been eight deficits during those years. The honorable member does not suggest a roads policy to secure continuous employment. He says, " Let us carry out a spasmodic policy, and construct roads only when we have a Federal surplus.". </para>

                    <para class="block">I said, but the Leader of the Opposition certainly said that the money should be found out of the surplus, which means that the general public would pay the whole of the Federal Government's contribution for roads. That means that the general public pays all. We say that the motorist should pay his fair share of the cost of constructing roads, as he does in other countries. Ever since 1909, a roads fund has been in existence in Great Britain, the Government of which last year collected from motorists about £18,056,000. In fact, I think the Chancellor of the Exchequer was charged with having raided the funds to the amount of £7,000,000 in order to balance his last budget. The Government has put before the States, the House, and the country a definite and continuous policy. It is objected that the improved roads will permit of competition with the railways. It is high time that the railways, which are a State monopoly, experienced some competition. Competition is good for everybody, and only when the railways are subjected to it shall we get improved services and cheaper rates. But competition must be fair ; the railways must not be expected to bear the burden of heavy capital cost and maintenance, while their competitors, the motorists, use the roads without payment. The honorable member for Yarra said that the Federal land tax should be retained, in order to enable the road grants to be paid. I have already pointed out that the greater part of the present cost of road construction is paid by the land-owner. The time has come for the road user to pay his share, and to that proposal there is no real opposition from the genuine motorist. It is said that a certain amount of money is being found by the States for road construction out of loan. At the conference with the. State representatives, Commonwealth Ministers tried to reduce the loan expenditure to a minimum, and undertook that there would be incorporated in its scheme a 3 per cent. sinking fund, which would ensure that by the time the road was worn out, its capital cost would be repaid. That is the next best alternative to the building of the roads from revenue only. </para>
                    <para>The oil companies have raised some objection to this scheme. At first, they said their opposition was prompted entirely by their sympathy for the motorist. Subsequently, following a speech I made, they said that, although they were opposed to the Commonwealth duty of 2d. per gallon on petrol, they were heartily in favour of the State tax of 3d. per gallon. They threw aside the hypercritical mask of sympathy with the motorist, and said that they were opposed to the Commonwealth proposal because it did not provide for an excise duty. </para>

                        <para>.- Much of what I had proposed to say has already been said much better than I could say it by the honorable member for Balaclava. But I wish to deal with it few points of this very controversial subject. The Treasurer said that this proposal is similar to the roads policy proposed by the Government in 1923, but I submit that that is not so, and, if the Attorney-General is correct, this proposal is decidedly different from the earlier one. The Treasurer contends that those who supported the original policy cannot consistently oppose this bill. The Attorney-General, on the other hand, says that one could oppose the other policy and consistently support this one. Whichever statement is right, there is evidence of glaring inconsistency on the part of somebody. No section of the community objects to the allocation of £5,000,000 of the proposed total of £20,000,000. Most cf the objection has been to the manner in which the remaining £15,000,000 is to be collected. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer referred to the River Murray Waters Scheme, Commonwealth railways, and other works upon which money collected from the whole of the people has been expended without regard to State boundaries. The analogies they employed were false. To spend upon the whole of the people, irrespective of State bounties, money collected from the whole of the people, is one thing; to expend upon the whole of the people money raised by a specific tax upon one section of the community, is quite a different thing. The tax on motors is definitely a class tax. The motorist has been taxed ever since he first appeared on the road. In the old days the motor car was regarded as a luxury; the man who drove a motor car was considered to be exhibiting the hall-mark of plutocracy, and he was fair game for the  tax gatherer.  That stage has passed; to-day the motor car is an absolute necessity. </para>

                            <para>- The policy enunciated by the Minister when introducing this bill is very different from that declared by the Prime Minister a few days ago and the Treasurer this afternoon. In the first place the Government proposed to impose duties of 2d. per gallon on all petrol, irrespective of the manner in which it is used; 2£ per cent on chassis, and 6d. per lb. on imported tires. Ministers vigorously denounced all those who criticized the new taxation, and boldly declared that they would stand to their guns. To-day they propose to remove the duties on imported tires and chassis, and to exempt petrol not used on the roads: all that is left of their original scheme is the tax oh imported petrol used by road vehicles. God knows what their proposals will be to-morrow, but the rate at which they are retreating gives me hope that presently they will abandon this taxation entirely. In the course of an impassioned speech, to which I listened with interest, the Prime Minister declared that evidence had been brought forward that petrol was used for other purposes than travelling on the roads. Having made that startling discovery, the Government readily agreed not to tax petrol so used. It knew very well before the bill was introduced that millions of gallons of petrol consumed annually are not used on any roads. The Treasurer has affirmed on the platform and in the House the principle that those who use the roads should pay for them. This loudly proclaimed formula sounds well, and one can imagine the loud cheers with which it was received. But, having laid down that principle of taxation, the Government has made modifications of its scheme which will permit those who own chassis imported before these duties were imposed, those who use locally-made tires, and those who buy Commonwealth Oil Refineries spirit, to use the roads without paying any tax. Never did a government make a more ridiculous showing than has this Ministry in connexion with this unfortunate roads proposal. But one must pay a tribute to the pliability of Ministers. They abused their unfortunate critics, and said they would stand to their proposals with a firmness that would make the rock of Gibraltar seem a mere jelly, but saying they'd ne'er consent, consented. </para>

                            <para>- I was a member of the Government that introduced a roads policy which, according to the Attorney-General, was totally different in principle from the present proposal. I shall now deal with the speech of. the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> which has been well described as an extraordinary outburst. It was loudly cheered, but, to me, it was one of the best red herrings drawn across the trail that I have seen in the Parliament. He waxed eloquent about the evils and rapacity of the nil importing companies. One could have imagined when listening to him that the Leader of the Opposition was speaking. I have never before heard such an impassioned and eloquent denunciation of the octopus qf vested interests sucking the life-blood of the people of Australia. One wondered what evidence the Prime Minister possessed which led him to denounce the oil interests in such unmeasured terms, and whether the best way to deal with them was under a bill giving effect to a roads policy. He made strong comments on, and definite charges against, the oil importing companies. I hold no brief for those companies in any way. The manager of one of them replied through the press to the charges made by the Prime Minister. I do not know the man, but I read his letter and also a statement in the press that the Prime Minister's attention had been drawn to it, but that he had no comment to make. One of the charges made so dramatically by the Prime Minister was that the oil importing companies employed Chinese or coolie labour, the inference being, of course, that such labour was not employed by the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, otherwise there would be no point in the charge. The letter that I have referred to appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of yesterday's date, and reads - </para>

                        <para>Many of the statements made by the Prime Minister on Tuesday night, in the House of Representatives, are demonstrably incorrect, one allegation particularly so, namely, that the British Imperial Oil Company employs Chinese or coolie labour. There is absolutely ' no foundation for an attack of this kind on a company which has always prided itself 'on its standard of employment. Every employee of the company is a white man, and, to the best of my belief, an Australian, or some other British subject. </para>

                            <para>- The motive behind the Prime Minister's charge was to obtain support for the Government's unfortunate roads policy. The inference was that one company employed coolie labour and the other white labour. The Prime Minister's second charge against the British Imperial Oil Company .was that it was a foreign company, although trading under a British name. In reply to that, the letter states: - </para>

It seems necessary also that I should once again remind <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> of the following statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> when Prime Minister, in the House of Representatives, on the 18th July, 1917, following a specific inquiry regarding the constitution of the British Imperial Oil Company Limited :  - " Certain information has been received from the British Government in reply to our inquiries relating to this company, to the effect that the British Imperial Oil Company was a British company, and there were no reasons why it should not be treated as such." If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> is still doubtful on this point, I would invite him now to make a similar inquiry of  His  Majesty's Government. </para>

                            <para>- I am not speaking for the British Imperial Oil Company, because I know nothing about it, but I heard the speech by the Prime Minister, and I read the letter in the press which he refused to comment upon. He should reiterate his charge, and prove it, or else withdraw it. The Prime Minister has made dire and mysterious threats against the oil companies if they pass the tax on to the public. Here again we have evidence of the extraordinary confusion in which the Government finds itself. The Treasurer has said that those who use the roads should pay for them, and the Prime Minister has said that the importing oil companies, and not the road users, should pay for them. It has been said that the States agreed to the Government's proposal. The inference is certainly that the States were willing partners to it. But I do not think that they were, because they were not acquainted with all the facts. When a representative of a State has agreed to a proposal he should certainly attempt to carry out his contract. If we are to have repudiation between government and government in this country, where shall we end ? I am glad t hat the Government has seen fit to review its policy. Honorable members know the value of good roads. America has been quoted as an example, and the interjection by the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> was pertinent. He said that the heavy taxation of American motorists was more easily borne by them as motor cars, motor tires, and petrol were much cheaper there than in Australia. The reply of the honorable the Treasurer had but little point in it. I venture to predict that if the Government would reduce all tires, chassis, and other parts of . motor cars to the American price level, no motorist in Australia would object to the petrol tax. I have some other comments to make regarding the method of taxation, but, as another bill will be brought down to deal with that, I shall reserve those remarks for the present. </para>

                        <para>. -There has been much talk to no purpose in this debate. Almost all, if not all, honorable members believe that good roads are a national necessity. At any rate, honorable members on this side of the House, during the Federal election, lauded the Government for proposing this scheme, which it was thought would provide for continuity, and would set up machinery for making roads efficiently. There is no dispute as to the need for good roads; we all want them. But the question is, how to provide for them. It was felt that if it could be done out of the ever-increasing revenue of the Commonwealth Government, that would be the next best thing  to lowering the tariff. Those who are taxed by the tariff felt that this .would be a means of getting some return for their money. The right honorable the Prime Minister said that the money would be collected from the users of the .roads; but he' also said something else. He said that the new duties were in no way related to the protection policy, but were purely revenue duties, imposed for a specific purpose. It is clear, therefore, that the people were told that the users of the roads would have to find the money required for the scheme. I should say that the Government's proposals, to that extent, are fairly equitable, and, at any rate, the Government is justified in endeavouring to carry out a policy put forward by the Prime Minister at the last election. It was clearly shown by the last  speaker  - and I think I have shown it also - that discrimination in taxation for the purpose is now proposed, and it is that discrimination which is resented as an injustice. I am surprised that the Prime Minister should lend himself to it. At present only a small percentage of the C.O.R. spirit is used in this country, although the. percentage may increase later. About 94 per cent, of the petrol used in this country and only 35 per cent, of the tires are imported; but the local article is not to pay anything for the roads. There has been much argument to try to demonstrate that some honorable members do not believe in good roads. The truth is that we are all anxious for good roads. The contention that good roads are necessary to save wear on cars and tires is unarguable; it is beside the question. I should like to see the Government act in strict accordance with the promise made to the electors. I am glad that it has somewhat modified the scheme. If the money is raised by taxing the users of the roads, the imposition should be made as light as possible, and distributed over all road users. </para>

The business still to be taken is the Federal Aid Roads Bill, the Customs duties - which have already been introduced - the Cotton Bounty Bill, the Estimates, and the Income Tax Rates Bill, which is passed every year to fix income tax rates. There will be no alteration in the rates. The Imperial Conference agenda-paper is still on the business sheet. The Government may have to bring down a bill of considerable importance, the nature of which I cannot indicate at the moment, and possibly, also, a small amending bill will be introduced. Those are the only matters it is proposed to proceed with. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer has announced that the duties on tires and chassis will be withdrawn. That is really an announcement of a tariff amendment. Will it be followed immediately by amending the tariff schedule that has been tabled? I realize that withdrawing duties is different from imposing new or increasing existing duties, but it is important, when changes in the tariff are announced, that the schedule should be altered immediately, for otherwise the conduct of business is hampered. It is well known that the delay in considering the last tariff schedule, caused by the intervention of the election, ' had a serious effect on many businesses in this country. Chassis may be in bond to-day, and, ordinarily, would be released on Monday. I ask for an assurance that the amended schedule will be brought down at once. </para>

                    <para>. -  I appreciate the point raised by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> but no practical difficulty is likely to arise. It is a different matter when increases are being made. The announcement of increases must be made after the Customs Houses have closed, and the amended schedule must be placed on the table of this House before they open next day. The object of that procedure is to prevent withdrawals from bond. In the case of a decrease of duty, goods may be taken out of bond as soon as the announcement of the decrease is made, with confidence that refunds will be made of any duty that may have been paid. I shall look into the practical side of the matter, and, if there is likely to be any interference with business, I shall probably take action as soon as the House meets on Monday; but, if there is no practical difficulty, it will probably be preferable for the matter to be dealt with in the ordinary way. </para>
