It affords ready means of identification for Australians visiting other parts of the world and having banking and other business to transact. Another most important feature of the system is that it enables the Government to keep a check upon, and close control over, the number of alien migrants who might seek to gain admission to the Commonwealth. </para>

It is the practice in the High Commissioner's office to ship goods for Australia in the Commonwealth Line steamers wherever possible. Explosives, which form a large portion of the tonnage shipped from England to the Defence Department, cannot, on account of the special conditions governing such shipment, be always taken by vessels of the Commonwealth Line. Further, stores are sometimes purchased for direct delivery at ports in the United Kingdom other than those from which Commonwealth Line steamers usually depart for which freight has to be arranged by other vessels. </para>

                        <para>. - In reply to several questions asked yesterday regarding the position  that  had arisen at Geneva,  I  indicated that if possible I would make a statement on the subject to-day. I ask leave to make that statement now. <inline font-style="italic">(Leave granted.)</inline> I regret that the information contained in the columns of the Australian press yesterday, that Brazil, one of the non-permanent members of the Council of the League of Nations, had definitely refused to allow unanimity to be reached regarding the admission of Germany as a permanent member of the Council, has now been officially confirmed. As a result of that action it has been impossible to admit Germany as a permanent member of the Council, and the whole matter of Germany's admission to the League has been postponed until the September meeting of the Assembly. I very much regret that this position has arisen, and in the circumstances I think it desirable to inform the House of the whole of the facts regarding the genesis of the recent proceedings at Geneva, and the course which the Government pursued during the recent sitting of the Assembly there. That meeting arose out of negotiations which took place at Locarno, which culminated in the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee to which Great Britain, Germany, France, Belgium, and Italy are parties. One of the conditions of that treaty was that it should not come into operation until Germany had been admitted to the League. Germany undertook to apply for membership, and this she did. She had to apply for admission in the same way as any other power which might desire to become a member would have to apply. A special meeting of the Assembly was called to consider Germany's application. If such a special meeting had not been held, the matter could not have been dealt with until the ordinary meeting of the Assembly in September next. To delay the matter until then would have delayed the operation of the Treaty of Locarno. Accordingly a special meeting of the Assembly was summoned, and invitations to attend it were sent to the 55 nations which are members of the League. A second question to be considered was the appointment of Germany as a permanent member of the Council of the League. Three of the parties to the Locarno Treaty are permanent members of the Council of the League, and those powers, and the other signatories of the treaty, had agreed that Germany should become a permanent  member. Consequently there .had to be a meeting of the Council at the same time as the meeting of the Assembly. Every one will agree that the provision that Germany should be given a permanent seat upon the Council of the League was wise and proper and in accordance with the spirit of co-operation in which the League is trying to promote world peace. It was the spirit that permeated the Locarno negotiations and "led to the signing of the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee. The permanent members of the Council of the League are Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan. At the time of. the framing of the Covenant of the League it was contemplated that the great powers should become permanent members of the Council, and that there should also be four - increased later to six - elected non-permanent members, to be chosen from time to time from the other nations who were members of the League. Provision was made under the Covenant for increasing either the permanent or the non-permanent members of the Council; but any recommendation made by the Council for such an increase must be unanimous. This unanimous recommendation of the Council goes before the Assembly, because any new member of the Council must be approved by the Assembly. The Assembly can act on a majority vote. At Geneva it was found that the necessity for securing a unanimous recommendation from the Council would be a serious obstacle to the admission of Germany to the League, and the failure to obtain unanimity has led to the present unfortunate situation. It has come about through the ambition of certain nations to obtain permanent seats upon the Council of the League. It is possibly not unnatural that countries should aspire to permanent seats on the Council, and two countries in particular - Brazil and Spain - have long held this ambition, and have been working very hard for its realization. The application of Germany also led to a new claim by Poland, based upon the many complicated and difficult questions that are outstanding between that country and Germany. Poland bases its application for a permanent seat on the Council upon the argument that it is not fair or just that, in these circumstances, it should not be in an equal position with Germany. This caused a troublesome situation; but Poland's case could have been met by her appointment as a nonpermanent member of the Council, and I think that the good sense of the Assembly could have been relied upon to keep Poland on the Council so long as there were difficult and complicated questions outstanding between that country and Germany... There were thus at Geneva grave elements of disunion on matters on which it was absolutely vital that there should be a spirit of good, sense and cooperation. This is to be regretted. We should, however, recognize the efforts that were made to overcome the difficulties which arose. While we are forced to the conclusion that one nation showed <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> spirit that was hardly in accord with the ideals of the League, there were other nations which showed that they were prepared to act in a spirit which would assist to establish the position of the League and to assure its influence in the world. Unfortunately, the difficulties could not be overcome. Sweden and Czecho-Slovakia, both of which are. non-permanent members of the Council, tried to ease the situation, and- to bring about the admission of Germany into the Council of the League by voluntarily offering to resign to make way for Poland. Notwithstanding that offer, Brazil was adamant, and refused to give way. She took up the attitude that unless a permanent seat was given to her upon the Council, she . was not prepared to allow unanimity to be reached by the Council, which, of course, prevented Germany from being given a permanent seat upon the Council. I do not want to comment on or to criticize the action of any other country ; but I certainly think that it is deplorable that one nation should have been able to do so much to destroy the spirit which enabled the Locarno treaty to be entered into, a treaty which every one will admit is the most important step taken towards securing the peace of Europe since the signing of the Armistice. It is regrettable that a country which is so far away from the storm centre of Europe should be able to take action the consequences of which, if they cannot be avoided, may again throw the world into a devastating war. </para>

                    <para>I shall now put before the House the attitude of- the Government regarding the. questions that arose at Geneva. I would remind honorable members that it was a special meeting of the Assembly, and the outstanding question to be determined was the admission of Germany to the League, with a permanent seat on the Council. The Government's view was that nothing should be done to imperil Germany's admission to the. League, and the honouring of the undertaking that she would be given a permanent seat on the Council. A second question of equal, if not greater, importance arose, namely, the further enlargement of the Council beyond the admission of Germany to a permanent seat, and in regard to this the Government considered it imperative that it should express its opinions promptly and definitely. It accordingly represented to the British Government, and instructed its delegate at Geneva, that it considered it most undesirable that there should be any increase of the permanent members of the Council beyond the admission of Germany. The framers of the Covenant of the League of Nations contemplated that permanent seats on the Council would be given only to great powers having worldwide interests, whose influence and sense of responsibility arising out of such interests would enable them to play au important part in the affairs of the world. At that time it was anticipated that America would enter the League and have one of the permanent seats on the Council. But in order that the Council should not be composed of great powers only, the Covenant provided for the election by the Assembly of six non-permanent members. If the League is to succeed it must be guided by considerations of practicability. However much we may desire that the nations of the world shall be on a footing of absolute equality and have permanent seats on the Council, we cannot ignore the fact that the League will be destroyed if the Council be so constituted that the smaller, but more numerous, powers can dictate to the great powers. If that state of affairs is allowed to develop inevitably the League will collapse. To-day it has the goodwill, co-operation, and assistance of all the great powers, and its strength is steadily growing, but if by an increase of the permanent members the great powers are placed under the control of a council dominated by the small powers, who have no world-wide interests - powers, for instance, that have no interests outside South America - a fatal blow will be struck at the League. Where, then, ara we to draw the line? A line of demarcation is fixed at the present time in such a way that no unrest or discord is created in the League. It distinguishes between the acknowledged great powers which have permanent seats on the Council, and the lesser powers which are entitled to a definite number of non-permanent seats.

                            <para>- No. As to the future, it is impossible to say what is likely to occur between now and the next meeting of the Assembly in September, or at the Assembly itself. It is inconceivable that the work so happily terminated at Locarno should be stultified by the action of any one member of the Council of the League. It is unthinkable that any one country, particularly one which is far removed from the region which is directly and immediately the object of the Locarno Treaty, should persist in its attitude of thwarting the consummation of the Locarno settlement, and the active cooperation of Germany with the League. The recent proceedings demonstrate how necessary it is that all the nations which are members of the League, and which, above all, have received the great honour and responsibility of sitting on the' Council, should use their position and influence, not to satisfy purely selfish ambitions, but to collaborate with the rest of the world in a spirit of goodwill. That is the only possible basis of international co-operation. Without such an attitude no association of states or League of Nations can hold together. I would greatly deprecate any exaggeration of what has happened at Geneva. I do not think that the League has suffered any real injury or that, its foundations have been in any way damaged. If a spirit of selfishness has been displayed in one quarter, good sense, compromise, toleration, and even self-sacrifice have been displayed in other quarters. The Government, however much it may regret and deplore that the present situation has arisen, does not regard it with alarm. It believes that a satisfactory solution will be found at the next meeting of the Assembly in September, 'when a real spirit of conciliation will animate all the members and Germany will at length enter the League and take her seat on the Council in circumstances befitting the dignity of a great power. I might have made this statement om the motion that a paper be printed, and thus have afforded honorable members an opportunity to debate it. But I suggest that the present time is not opportune for such a debate. Before Australia's delegates leave for the next meeting- of the Assembly of the League, an opportunity will be afforded the House to express its view upon the important and vital matters which will arise at Geneva, and which unquestionably will require to be considered at the Imperial Conference to be held subsequently. </para>

                                - Having regard to the concluding remarks of the Prime Minister, I do not propose to say much regarding the situation that has developed  at Geneva. The right honorable gentleman said that the provision of the constitution of the League, requiring that any decision of the Council shall be unanimous, interferes considerably with the operation of the League. That is the kernel of the trouble, and I suggest that the time is opportune for the Prime Minister to take action for the purpose of bringing about an alteration of the procedure. It was apparent to me when I was at Geneva, as it appears to have been to the Prime Minister, that some such change is essential if the League is to function satisfactorily.

                            <para>- The time has arrived for an alteration of the constitution of the League. Honorable members must realize that if one vote is sufficient to prevent action from being taken, whether it be in relation to the admittance of a new member or on any other matter, intrigue and compromise are bound to ensue. The League cannot be expected to prove a success if there is room for dissatisfaction regarding its procedure. I believe that the League will not continue to exist for very many years unless an alteration is made to its constitution. I, therefore, stress the necessity of this Government making representations to the Imperial Government to take steps to that end. Where it is necessary to secure absolute unanimity it is an easy matter for a comparatively strong nation to influence a smaller nation in the direction of taking action which will effectually prevent the League from functioning satisfactorily. </para>

Absolute unanimity is quite a different matter. I would not object to a proposal that two-thirds, or even three-fourths, of the members of the League must consent to any proposed action. Had I, as the representative of Australia at the Fifth Assembly of the League, had the right to vote upon the matter, the Institute of Intellectual Co-operation would not be in Paris to-day. </para>

I dealt with an unfortunate result of the requirement of unanimity, but I did not desire honorable members to think that it was my view that unanimity was not necessary. That is a matter which would necessitate very full discussion, and it could appropriately be debated in this House. I have no intention of arguing against the principle of unanimity that at present operates in regard to many of the decisions to which the League may come. </para>

                    <para>.- This is the principal clause of the bill. It proposes to validate the refund of certain moneys which were collected in respect of bonus shares that had been distributed from accumulated profits. During the second -reading debate, three or four speeches relating to this  particular  matter were delivered. Whilst I admitted that the re-collection of this money would cause great difficulty, and might impose certain hardships, I said then, and I now repeat, that it is the duty of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> to tell honorable members precisely what those difficulties are, so that they may judge as to whether the action which the Government took should be validated. He has not done that. I complain of the honorable gentleman that he has  -not treated honorable members fairly. If they are able to satisfy themselves that the bill is necessary, well and good; I cannot. A large sum of money which had been legally collected was illegally refunded because of the misinterpretation of a' judgment of the High Court. "Sufficient care was not exercised in the making of that interpretation. Admittedly, illegal action has been taken, and a large sum has been refunded to persons from whom it was legally and justly collected. After the lapse of three years, we are now asked to validate, those refunds. If the Government can prove to us that the blunder which it committed, serious though it was, cannot be rectified, that it is impossible for it to retrace its steps, we shall have to accept the position. </para>

                        <para>- It was neither long nor clear. If honorable members will read the Treasurer's second-reading speech, they will find that he made a few general statements dealing (with the difficulties that might be apprehended, but did not furnish the House with any information. He is the only person who possesses inside information. What is the use of his saying that the existence of trust funds and the probable death of certain shareholders who had refunds made to' them render it impossible for the money to be re-collected? He has not stated the exact position. There cannot be a large number of shareholders affected. We should be given a general statement, setting out the number of assessments affected, the amount of money involved, the particular instances of hardship that could arise, and their number. The whole of that information is in the possession of the honorable gentleman. </para>

                        <para>- Then it is about time a change was made in the bookkeeping methods of the department. We have two parliamentary committees - the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee - that inquire into certain aspects of the expenditure of public money. There is greater necessity in this than in any other phase of administration for an investigation by a committee of honorable members. Very few honorable members are informed regarding the administration and the activities of the Taxation Department, which I regard as the most important of our departments. We have to wade through large numbers of documents to obtain even a surface knowledge. </para>

                        <para>-That is so. It was a very useful survey, and a most valuable report was presented. But that is now out of date. Judgments of the court which have been delivered from time to time have altered the whole aspect of our legislation; and very few members are in a position to discuss them with authority. Even in the last five years great changes have occurred. Yet we continue to amend legislation without having definite information as to the full effect of our actions. Only yesterday it was reported in the daily press that a claim for £40,000 had been withdrawn. I was not able to gather from the abbreviated report of the proceedings why the case was withdrawn. If it was wrongly withdrawn the Government has lost £40,000 which it should have ; if it was correctly withdrawn £40,000 was wrongly claimed. </para>

                        <para>- No; it was for wartime profits tax. A special appropriation was made by Parliament to enable refunds of taxation thought to have been wrongly paid, to be made to applicants who applied within six months of the date of the announcement in Parliament. It has since been found that that taxation was legally imposed, but the refunds were made. Now the Government desires to validate them; but apparently we have no record of the amounts or receipts in respect to them. If the money was not refunded in the loose way which I suggest, and a proper record was kept, it will be easy for the Treasurer to supply the information that we require. I shall not hammer this matter any more. The simple fact is that extraordinary action was taken by the Government without a due regard for the facts. Parliament was led to believe that the High Court held certain things which, in fact, it did not hold; and that certain moneys were collected illegally. It was subsequently proved that the money was collected quite legally. In the circumstances the Treasurer should supply us with the number of persons to whom refunds were made, the amount of the refund in each case, and a return showing whether the persons concerned are now dead or alive. Having that information before us, we should be in a position to judge whether or not we should validate the repayments that were improperly made. In view of the paucity of information supplied to us, honorable members on this side of the chamber will not take the responsibility of voting for the bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know whether the Treasurer proposes to afford the committee any statement of the difficulties of the Taxation Department in supplying the information which the honorable member for Yarra has requested. It is perfectly clear, as the honorable member has said, that if more books were kept in the Taxation Department, statistical information such as he desires could be easily supplied to us; but, to my knowledge, as one of the administrators who presided at the Treasury for a time, the Taxation Department kept as few books as it thought necessary, and I believe still does so. The provision of statistical information by a department which collects revenue from, perhaps, 500,000 taxpayers, is most expensive; and if we desire it, we shall require <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> add largely to the vote for its administration. Refunds of taxation are made under headings whose number is legion. I do not think the bill is as important as either the Treasurer or the honorable member for Yarra thinks it to be, nor that it will matter a great deal whether we pass it or not; in fact, in my opinion, it might just as well be thrown under the table as be passed. </para>

If the Treasurer had given us last year the information that he has given us this year, I believe that honorable members would have passed the bill without delay; but it does not matter now whether we pass it or not. The bill affects to deal, in its three major clauses, with profits that have already been taxed. That fact was overlooked in some of the arguments of the honorable member for Yarra. </para>

                        <para>- May I say that I consider that the. honorable member's speech on the second reading of the bill was one of the most industrious, clear, far-sighted and excellent efforts that I have ever heard on a subject of this kind since I have been a member of this Parliament. The honorable member had evidently studied the matter with very great care, and under some difficulty, for he did not pretend to be personally associated with any enterprise that distributes bonus shares. He had had to read up the subject, and for that reason -his educative * speech on the principles of taxation affecting this measure was the more praiseworthy. I disagree with him on one vital point. I think that we should argue, not as to the merits of taxation refunds, the difficulty of making them, the necessity for indemnifying the Government, and the wisdom of passing retrospective legislation, but as to whether we should ever have attempted to tax bonus shares in the way that we did. The honorable member for Yarra knows that, in all eases, this taxation has been paid on money represented by bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits, on which a double tax has been paid. If a company made  a profit of £50,000, distributed only half of it, and reserved £25,000, which in subsequent years was issued in the form of bonus shares, a double tax wa3 paid on the amount so reserved. The flat rate was levied year after year on accretions of capital before they expressed themselves in the shape of bonus shares, and when later the Taxation Department determined to follow to their destination bonus shares, and to tax the recipient shareholders on them, a double rate was paid. The money which all these shares represent has therefore been taxed at more than double the average rate. </para>

                        <para>- The department erred in its own favour, and the rate of tax that, was levied on these shares was a higher average rate than the recipients should have paid. My experience in regard to the levying of taxation is that you cannot get absolute justice; you can only get as near to the fair thing as practicable. Our effort was to fix a rate which would approximate to the average. Unfortunately, the general opinion of honorable members who would tax bonus shares seems to be that 99 per cent, of shares of this class are received by the wealthy taxpayer, or the "fat man/' as he is commonly designated. I venture to say that if we had time in our busy lives to examine carefully the share registers of the joint stock companies, from the banks, the wool firms, and the shipping firms, right down to the smallest corporations of the kind that are operating in Australia, we should be astounded at the width of distribution of their shares. I recently  examined  the share register of one of the largest companies in the country, which has a capital of £2,500,000. It is a successful concern, and was originally promoted by courageous, wealthy people. It would not be fair for me to mention the name of the company. I only wish to say that I was astounded, as I wandered through the register, to find that of the many thousands of shareholders, there were very few who held 1,000 shares. The corporation was composed, very largely, of shareholders who held from 100 to 500 shares, and they belonged to all classes of the community. I should be glad if, at some convenient time, a few of the more thoughtful members of the Opposition, who speak upon these subjects, and are interested in them, would join me in making an examination of the share registers of some other big companies. In the last ten or fifteen years, joint stock enterprises have covered well nigh the whole of our productive and industrial field, and while, originally, the shares in them are taken up by a few wealthy persons, they soon become parcelled out, and pass into the possession of the general community. Trustees, widows, and minors, in very many instances, hold shares in these companies. I should like the honorable member for Yarra to bear this fact in mind in his consideration of the bill. Many of the people who pay the flat rate on shares of this kind have incomes lower than the amount of the exemption. </para>

                        <para>- No refund of taxation would be possible in those cases. I think it would be almost impossible to recollect the amounts that have been refunded; and instead of spending time on arguing as to the practicability of doing so, we should be well advised to devote our consideration to the merits of subjecting to further taxation money, represented in bonus shares, which has already been taxed. In my opinion, such taxation is inequitable and unjust. The bill does the best it can in a tardy way to rectify matters, and for what it is worth, deserves support. But prompter action should be taken should it be necessary in the future to give effect to the decisions of the courts altering the interpretation of the law accepted by the commercial community or the department. The taxpayers have been misled, the big trading corporations have been misled, and the Government- has been misled, and I think the judges have faltered and varied in their views of the intentions of Parliament as expressed in the laws relating to taxation. I am sure that the honorable member for Yarra would find worth while an examination of the width and extent of the distribution of the joint - stock shareholding in Australia. The examination of the register of only a few companies would, I am certain, surprise him and other honorable members. Take a corporation like the Bank of New South Wales, the shares of which are sold singly in the share markets of Australia. They were originally held in large parcels. The fact that they have been split up so much indicates to me that the people believe this to be the era of joint operation. Enterprises have been started in Australia, since the war, by joint-stock methods, which could never have been established had the ordinary private firms of a few years ago been left to inaugurate them. The corporations that have been responsible for their establishment have had to invite the people generally to invest their savings in them, and the joint-stock corporations that have been established are beneficial to the community, and tend to stabilize the national credit. Such huge accretions of capital cannot help doing so. There is one other theory in relation to bonus shares that I desire to mention. When we gave the Commissioner of Taxation power to say that companies should distribute a certain amount of their income, it was with the object of preventing them from evading taxation by being subject to a flat rate lower than the average rate. That, in my opinion, was not altogether a good thing. I believe that companies such as I have in mind should be encouraged to reserve a good deal of their profits for the expansion of the industry in which they are engaged. I noted, for example, in this morning's newspapers that, perhaps, the richest proposition that Australia has ever known in the State represented by the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watson),</inline> the Golden Horseshoe mine, is now asking for Government assistance. If I remember aright, no less than £13,000,000 was taken out of one or two shafts in the Golden Mile at Kalgoorlie and distributed amongst the shareholders after working expenses and plant had been paid for. But a period of relative poverty arrived; poorer ore had to be treated, and the company cannot now carry on without assistance. Something of the same kind occurred in connexion with one of the richest mines ever known in Victoria - the Long Tunnel mine, in Gippsland. That mine was torn open and dividends paid to its shareholders as fast as they could be dug out until a smaller lode was reached, and the mine was shut up. What takes place in connexion with mining may take place in connexion also with big productive enterprises of other kinds. We should encourage people engaged in these enterprises to pay reasonable dividends only, and put surplus profits back into their business for expansion and the equalization of dividends. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; and Western Australia would not be getting a grant of £450,000. I hope that honorable members generally will recognize that it  is impossible to argue the question concerning joint stock companies and corporations from one side only. The better we understand these organizations, the more we realize the benefits they are distributing throughout the community, the manner in which they are extending the power of this nation to carry its war debt, and providing for the payment of satisfactory wages and the giving of continuous employment. In other words, this is an era when, without the operations of joint stock companies, we could not have tackled many of the biggest things we have successfully achieved in this country. </para>

                        <para>- That is not done, and there might be a germ of justice and benefit to industry in such a proposal. We adopt a reverse course. We say that secrecy is the badge of crime. It is assumed that a company that does not distribute all its income must be trying to defeat the tax collector, and that the saving and storing of profits is a bad thing. In recent years the last Government and the present Government have seen the necessity and wisdom of refraining from unduly penalizing companies which, although doing things for their own benefit, are at the same time expanding the industries in which they are engaged. I hope that the Treasurer will take a lesson from what has occurred, and if he has retrospective legislation to propose, will not delay it until it becomes blue-mouldy. This legislation is late in making its appearance, so late that it scarcely matters now whether it is passed or not. But on the ground that it intends to relieve bonus shares of double taxation, I support the clause and also the clause that follows. </para>

                        <para>- I point out that whatever may be the merits or demerits of the taxation of bonus shares, the attitude adopted by honorable members opposite is that they are quite prepared to let this bill pass if given a definite assurance that in future bonus shares will be taxed. That would not be fair, because it is not right that Paul should have to pay because Peter has managed to avoid paying. The question of taxing bonus shares is one which should be settled on its merits, and not because of its connexion with the subject-matter of this bill. This, in my opinion, is a proposal to deal out evenhanded justice in a simple and straightforward manner. I should like to point out that if the judgment of the High Court in the James case had been given in 1924, there would have been no occasion for the introduction of a measure such as this, because the whole matter would have been covered by the bill introduced in 1925, which enacted that after the passage of three years it would be impossible for the Commissioner of Taxation to re-open assessments. As soon as it was possible for the judgment of the High Court to be thoroughly studied by the Crown Solicitor, which was at the beginning of 1925, and as soon as the Government made up its mind as to its policy, it made an announcement of its intention to introduce this bill. The fact that the policy of the Government was as stated, was an indication to the Commissioner of Taxation not to proceed with the re-collection of moneys which had been refunded, as he might otherwise have felt himself compelled to do. </para>

                        <para>- During the greater part of the period during which this series of acts have operated, from 1915 to 1921, between 700,000 and 800,000 taxpayers were sending in returns to the Taxation Department. If honorable members carefully consult the annual budget statements, they will find that sums varying from £500,000 to £1,200,000, to meet refunds of revenue, have been voted every year. Considerable alterations take place in the revenue anticipated from assessments because of new information supplied by taxpayers. Taxpayers are required to pay the amounts at which they are assessed within a certain time, and adjustments are only made subsequently. These adjustments were made in the ordinary way. There was no special appropriation for the purpose. On the statement made in this House regarding the policy to be pursued, taxpayers concerned had to make their applications for refund within six months. Those applications were dealt with in the same way as all other applications for refunds. It would involve a tremendous amount of clerical work, and the examination of hundreds of thousands of assessments, to discover the total amount involved. It is clearly impossible to supply the information in this connexion which some honorable members desire. We have arrived at a stage when practically the whole of the assessments cannot be re-opened. There are only certain assessments, and these are very few, remaining to be dealt with. The proper course to pursue is to pass this measure so that the exact position of the Government and the taxpayers shall be understood. </para>

                        <para>- I want to say in reply to the contention of the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> that one might go through lists of the shareholders of various companies, and I guarantee that amongst them will be found quite a number of people who hold shares in several gilt-edged propositions like the Broken Hill Company, big joint stock companies, pastoral companies, and banks. Their aggregate income from their shares in various companies amounts to a very considerable sum. They cannot be regarded as poor people at all. A comparatively poor man may be advised by a stock broker that, instead of putting £200 or £300 into the Savings Bank for a return of 4 per cent., he should invest it in a joint stock concern. Such persons may be the small shareholders to whom the right honorable member for Balaclava refers, but if shareholders' lists for a number of big companies are examined, I guarantee that the same names will be found in many of them. </para>

                        <para>- I think we are fairly safe in arriving at the conclusion that in the Webb case only one aspect of the matter was dealt with. In that case it was decided that the bonus shares were to be regarded as capital of a reconstructed company. In the James case the representative of the Crown, as well as of the appellant, asked the court for a general decision. . That decision was given, and it was  that  bonus shares are taxable. </para>

                        <para>- The court did not desire that capital should be taxed,' and quite right too. Upon the reconstruction of a company bonus shares were regarded as capital, and it was decided in the Webb case that they were not taxable. But I repeat that in the James case the High Court gave a general decision that bonus shares are taxable. </para>

I agree with the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> that the companies take risks in their investments and do a certain amount of good in the community, but I contend that the country has been very good to them. Taxation should rest equitably upon every section of the community. I am against class legislation, and shall therefore oppose the bill. </para>

                        <para>- To a large extent, particularly in respect of taxation. The responsibility would then be shared by all parties. At present the Treasurer exercises a tremendous power in administering the taxation laws, and in . the public interest that responsibility should be partially shouldered by a parliamentary standing committee. It is regrettable that our method of taxation should be so involved and complex. We have two parallel systems of taxation, one the graduated system of taxation for income and- land assessment, and the other a flat rate for companies. </para>

                <para>Mr.RODGERS (Wannon) [4.6].  -I  propose to assist the Government to make good its promise, because any other action would have a negative effect. The deed is done, and the bill is to rectify it. The principle involved in this matter is strictly not in test. If it were, I should have a good deal to say, and my vote would be cast against the principle unless it applied equitably to all taxpayers. For instance, what rights have companies over private individuals that they should be earmarked for remission of taxation on portion of their earnings, either placed in reserve or issued in the form of bonus shares? Take the primary producer. He knows that in a country like Australia lean years occur periodically. He builds up reserves of fodder to carry him through droughts. He does not take those reserves into account in his earnings, but he has to pay income tax on them. If the principle of taxation were now at stake, I should vote for its all-round application, and for the insertion in our taxation legislation of a proviso that every taxpayer shall have the privilege of setting aside a certain portion of income and calling it reserve or capital. This would place all taxpayers on the same footing. Discrimination in favour of those who form themselves into companies to avoid taxation should not be encouraged. The privilege should apply all round. </para>

                        <para>- They have spread their investments. The right honorable member for Balaclava supports this measure on its merits respecting exemption of bonus shares from taxation. The Treasurer chided him for raising that matter, and said that it had nothing to do with the bill. The honorable member for Balaclava truly reminded him that I had dealt with that subject at some length. I remind the committee that it has a lot to do with this bill, because we have to consider, not only its legality, but its equity. Is not equity the main thing? I should not hesitate one moment to support the validation of an illegality if I were satisfied that it was equitable; but, in this case, it is not. The exemption of bonus shares is most inequitable. Their taxation is embodied in the legislation of this country, and this bill constitutes one of the worst forms of discrimination that has ever been exercised in regard to taxation. The exemption from taxation of bonus shares is not only inequitable, but also  illegal. Surely we have strong grounds for opposing the bill. </para>

                        <para>- I have received no information that would bear out the honorable member's contention. We have asked for information from the Government. We allowed the bill to pass its second-reading stage to give the Government an opportunity to obtain further information, but it has answered all our queries by simply saying that it cannot be obtained. This is not the first time that such a thing has happened. Storrie years ago I asked for information respecting amounts of money due on the leaseholds of this country. The Treasurer informed me that the information could not be obtained. I set about to obtain that information myself, and my efforts at that time led to the appointment of a royal commission. Notwithstanding the boast of the Treasurer about the finding of the commission, the facts that were placed before it bore out every statement that I made in this chamber. All the information that was refused me in this chamber was subsequently produced and printed in documents. I have a complete set of those documents, which may be perused by honorable members. When I am now told the same old stereotyped story, I refuse to accept it. As a member of. the Opposition, I cannot share the responsibility of passing this validating measure. It does not validate the decision of the court, as was suggested. It simply proposes to validate the action of the Government, which the last decision of the court declared was illegal. It is true that that action was taken because of the interpretation of the previous decision of the court, but it was a gross misinterpretation of that decision. A layman, after examining the High Court judgment, would not conclude that the decision in the Webb case was that bonus shares were not taxable. The honorable member for Balaclava says that the Government's action in introducing the bill is merely a rough way of doing, justice, and is therefore equitable. He said that these shares had already been taxed, and that refunds had been made to remove the inequitable double taxation.  That  statement does not convey to -this committee the exact position. Under the original law there was a flat rate of 2s. 8d., and subsequently 2s. 5d. in the £1 on all companies' accumulated profits. When those profits were distributed there was a rebate of the amount of the tax. Let me give a simple illustration. Consider the case of a man who paid taxation at the rate of 4s. in the £1 on an income derived from salary and dividends. The £400 received as dividends was added to his other income, and he had to pay in respect of it the difference between the 2s. 8d. which the company had already paid and the individual rate of 4s. That was the only taxation imposed on bonus shares, and it was not in any sense double taxation. The present company rate is ls. in the £1, and when dividends or profits are again taxed in the hands of the shareholders, less a rebate of the amount paid by the company, the shareholders are not doubly taxed. When the flat rate was 2s. 8d., the only people who had to pay taxation in respect of bonus shares were those whose individual rate of tax exceeded the company rate. Therefore the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> was quite right in saying that the refunds were confined to. people who enjoyed large incomes. The talk about the small shareholders in a company is irrelevant, because the moneys, refunded, by the Government wore received only by persons whose average incomes exceed £4,000 per annum. They are the only persons affected by this bill. That fact does not make this legislation right or wrong, but it emphasizes my contention that the people who will be benefited by it are few in number; they are what the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> termed " the fat men." That .fact adds strength to my contention that this proposal is not equitable. There are thousands of small shareholders in companies whose income, if received from some other source, would not be taxable, and they are inequitably taxed under the present flat rate. When the rate was 2s. 8d. in the £1, those recipients of dividends on bonus shares whose individual rate of tax exceeded 2s. 8d. in the £1 were allowed a rebate; those whose individual rate was less than 2s. 8d. received no allowance. To-day companies pay a flat rate of ls. in the £1 on all profits, and a widow whose only income is £50 from a small parcel of shares left to her by her husband, has to pay income tax amounting to £2 10s. . That is most inequitable. The royal commission on taxation, composed mainly of men prominent in the financial and commercial world, did splendid work, and made a simple and just recommendation, namely, that a flat rate should be levied on undistributed profits; the distributed profits should be taxed in the hands of the shareholders; the tax on reserves should be struck at what would have been the average rate of tax if the profits, had been distributed, say 2s. 5d. or 2s. 6d. ; when the reserves were distributed, they should be added to the income of the recipient shareholder, and taxed at the individual rate, the company rate previously paid being rebated to the company. The existing law was passed in the small hours of the morning, and this committee has been afforded no information regarding the effect of the tax. The Commonwealth is being cheated by clever people, who are able to dodge taxation by the formation of companies. The right honorable member for Balaclava said that companies should be encouraged to put more of their profits into reserve. I agree with, the right honorable member. Instead of businesses being improverished  to pay dividends, more of the profits should be set aside to provide a fund which would be an insurance against hard times. I have mentioned many instances - and the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> could add many more - of mining companies concentrating on the rich lodes in order to pay high dividends, and not setting aside any reserve for the development of the lower grade ore. A similar policy is followed in other industries. I agree that companies should be encouraged to make reserves ; but should not the same encouragement be given to the private trader ? The honorable member for "Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> rightly asked why our legislation should distinguish between a private concern and one controlled by a company. In one town there may be two large drapery establishments, one owned by John Brown, and the other by Thomas Smith and Company. Each makes a profit of £100,000. Both should be treated alike in regard to taxation. But the law allows John Brown to carry only 15 per cent, of his profits to reserves, whilst Thomas Smith and Company may put 33 per cent, into reserve, and pay only company rate of tax thereon. Is that equitable ? The truth is that many small proprietary businesses are 'being floated into companies for the purpose of avoiding taxation. The- royal commission suggested that reserves should be taxed at a flat rate, and the company should get a refund when the profits were distributed and taxed at their destination. Another suggestion is that the company should be treated in exactly the same way as the individual, and that may be an easier way out of the difficulty. But there is no suggestion of double taxation. The commissioner merely follows the dividends or bonus shares into the hands of the shareholders, adds them to his income, assesses him at the individual rate, less the flat rate already paid by the company. Every dividend issued by any company is taxed as part of the shareholder's income when he receives it ; yet it has come from profits which have already paid the company rate. Nevertheless, there is no double taxation. The only inequitable feature of the present companies tax is that the rebate is enjoyed only by those whose individual rate of tax exceeds the company rate. It should be rebated to all shareholders, and that can be done only by the rebate going to the company. I dp not believe in taxing the profits of a company. I believe in taxing the income of the individuals who receive the dividends. Taxing at the source is neither sound nor equitable. An income tax should be a tax on income alt its destination. A shareholder enjoying an income of £500 should be taxed on £500, neither more nor less. The exemption of bonus shares will allow an inequitable state of affairs to continue. It will encourage the evasion of taxation amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds per annum. Day after day companies are formed for no other purpose than to evade taxation. They call themselves investment companies or holding companies. The honorable member for Balaclava criticized that section of the act which requires a company to distribute two-thirds of its profits, or in default provides for an assessment based on the assumption that two-thirds has been distributed. That provision was designed to discourage the evasion of taxation, but it actually discourages the carrying of profits to reserves. If the taxation were made equitable, companies would be encouraged to build up their reserve funds. The right honorable member for Balaclava interprets this bill as a declaration, by inference, that bonus shares should not be taxed. If that is so, every honorable member who is opposed to granting such exemption should vote against the bill. </para>

I do not think that it is. Honorable members can vote for the bill if they are satisfied that there is no remedy other than that which the Government proposes; but they must bear in mind that, in so doing, they will be lending their support to an illegality. I should support the Government if I were satisfied that no other course was open to it. There is special provision in our legislation to meet cases of hardship, so that we need not concern ourselves with that aspect of the matter. I refuse to believe that it is impossible to re-collect this money, and I decline to share in the responsibility of validating the action which was taken by the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- The speech which the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has just delivered laid bare the fallacy and the misapprehension that underlie the whole of the opposition to the bill. It has been repeatedly said that the measure applied only to those whose incomes exceeded £4,000 a year; but, as that contention was not seriously argued, I assumed that honorable members believed that it had not a substantial basis. The honorable member for Yarra has just argued that only those who were assessed at a rate above the company rate received a refund in accordance with the promise that was made by the Hughes Government in 1922. That is quite erroneous. Every taxpayer who participated in the distribution of bonus shares received a refund, whether the tax was small or large. I ask the committee to visualize a supposititious case. Let us assume that when the statutory exemption was £200, a taxpayer with an income of £198 in one year received from some source bonus shares whose face value was £500. That taxpayer would be taxed on the basis of an income of £698. </para>

                        <para>- I have not worked out the exact details; but when the shares and other income together exceeded the general exemption, the other income was always taxable at the rate applicable to the combined income. The shares are added to the income at their face value to ascertain the graduated scale. Refunds were necessary when the shareholder's individual rate on his combined income from the shares and other sources exceeded the company rate, and also to the extent that the shareholder had paid tax or additional tax on his other income by reason of the aggregation of that income with the shares. I do not  believe that any honorable member desires that all assessments covering a period of six years should be examined. That is the reason for the Government's holding that it is impracticable to deal with the matter in the manner suggested. The real basis of its objection, however, is that three years ago the Commonwealth Parliament acquiesced in the action which the Government, on the definite statement of the Treasurer, proposed to take. The policy was changed in the present taxation legislation, so that what was done in the past should he done in the future. As taxpayers have for three years been under that very definite impression, we should validate the action which was then taken. It would be unjust to compel these persons to make an accounting of that money and return it to the Treasury. This is not the proper time to argue the merits or the demerits of the taxation of bonus shares. I think that I have shown conclusively that, unless the whole of the assessments were examined, it would not be possible to compile an accurate return. I therefore ask the committee to agree to the clause. </para>

                    <para>. -  I wish to explain the circumstances that have led to the inclusion of this clause in the bill. The Government and the Commissioner were so sure of their position when the claim was drawn up in the James case that they decided to re-assess James's taxation and include in the amount the tax on bonus shares from both accumulated and current profits, so that an authoritative test of the question might be made. James was told that, in view of the Government having stated, in Parliament, that a tax would not be imposed upon bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits, the tax would not be collected on his shares which issued out of accumulated profits, irrespective of what the decision of the court might be. We did not desire the case to be upset on a mere technicality, and, on the other hand, we wished to have a definite declaration from the court that all bonus shares were taxable. </para>

                    <para>.- When the motion for the second reading of the bill was before us, I said that the Government could have had a test case stated in 1922 to determine the legal position; but the Treasurer interjected that that would have been improper. I replied that it was always possible to make an arrangement with a taxpayer to have a question tested in the court; and the Treasurer said that that would be immoral. But that is precisely what was done in the James case. The Government asked James to agree to have added to his original assessment the amount of tax on the bonus shares which he had received from accumulated profits, but on which he had not been assessed, and James agreed with the proposal, on being given a promise that whether the Government won or lost the case, no tax would be collected from him on his bonus shares from accumulated profits. </para>

                        <para>- If my statement is wrong, the Treasurer is to blame, for he has refused to give us information which we should have had. But my remarks are based upon a letter by James's taxation expert, published in the daily press,  which stated that James was assessed for taxation on bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits, and appealed against the assessment on the logical ground that as bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits were not taxable, those distributed from current profits should not be. Before the case came on for hearing, the letter went on, James was asked to agree to have added to his assessment the amount of tax on his shares from current profits, and he agreed to the request on the Government giving him- a promise that, even if it won the day, his shares would not be taxed. Counsel for the Commissioner for Taxation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen</inline> Dixon, advised that a complete assessment of taxation on all James's bonus shares should be submitted in the claims to the Court. If the Government could make an arrangement with James, in 1925, to have a test case stated on this point, it could have done so in 1922; and had it done so, then we should not be required now to validate an illegality three years old. Before the present Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> was a member of the Government he argued, when a measure was before this chamber with the object of validating the appointment of taxation appeal boards, the appointment of which the High Court said was invalid, that it was entirely wrong for the Government to ask Parliament to go behind a judgment of the court; but that is precisely what the Government of which he is a member is now asking us' to do. </para>

In the first place, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell was counsel for the Commissioner of Taxation in the James case, and not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen</inline> Dixon. In the second place, the reason for including James's full assessment in the claim was to avoid the possibility of the proceedings being upset on a mere technicality. James was told that no matter what the decision of the court might be in regard to taxing bonus shares distributed out of accumulated profits on which company tax had been paid prior to 1922, he would not be asked to pay tax on those shares. No arrangement was made with him on the matter; he was merely told what the Government intended to do. </para>

                        <para>- There was a specific statement, but no arrangement made. The honorable member said in the third place that, because the Government had the question of taxing bonus shares distributed from accumulated profits tested in the court in the James case, it could have had it determined in 1922, by arrangement with a taxpayer. The honorable member seems to forget that no question as to the right of the Commissioner to tax these shares was raised prior to the James case. </para>

                    <para>. - I find that I was in error in saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen</inline> Dixon was counsel for the Commissioner in the James case, but I was speaking from memory. My error in that connexion does not prove that the remainder of my remarks was inaccurate. An arrangement was made with James that, even if the court decided that he must pay tax on shares distributed from accumulated profits - and the Government believed that he should do so, or it would not have included them in the claim - he would not be requested to pay it. I do not know how the Treasurer can possibly reconcile the facts in any satisfactory way. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to thank the Minister and the Government for their assurances to me and to the growers, and their offer to consider the appointment of one of the growers as a member of the proposed board. That is something which I urged very strongly when this bill was previously under consideration. The board will have to deal with the question of repayments under this measure. I stated before, and now repeat, that the Government should not insist on the repayment of these advances. In support of that statement I propose to quote from the original act, under which the advances were made, and I ask honorable members to note the points I make. Section 10 of the act of 1924 provides that - </para>

The section continues - after the costs of production and marketing (not exceeding such amount as the Minister determines) of those dried fruits have been provided for. </para>

                <para>First of all the advance was upon the 1925 crop, and no other. It was to be repaid only after the costs of production and marketing, as determined by the Minister, had been received by the grower. The growers did not receive sufficient to provide for the costs of production and marketing. The Government admits that; but instead of wiping off the advances on the ground that the growers did not receive the costs of production and marketing, it now insists that the advances shall be repaid out of the 1926 and 1927 crops. That is fundamentally wrong. It is a violation of the provisions of the original act. </para>

It was a condition of repayment that growers were to receive the costs of production and marketing, and the repayment should be from the 1925 crop. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I have already quoted the section of the original act dealing with the repayment of advances. Almost every grower made application for an advance on the understanding that he would be guaranteed his costs of production and marketing. As they did not receive those costs, the growers naturally conclude that they are not expected to repay the advances. </para>

                        <para>- In the circumstances, I can do no more than accept the assurances of the Government. Everything will depend on the manner in which the proposed board will deal with the growers. If it deals with them in a callous or arbitrary way, this bill will be worthless. There are- many returned soldiers engaged in the dried-fruits industry, and if they have to meet repatriation advances by the State Government with interest thereon, and also the advances made under the Dried Fruits Advances Act of 1924, they will be placed in a very difficult position. I have no alternative but to accept the assurance of the Minister that the board will deal liberally with the men engaged in the dried fruits industry. No industry in this country has had worse treatment. If any honorable member doubts that, let him talk with those engaged in the industry, and he will soon be convinced that what I am saying is correct. </para>

                    <para>has said that because these moneys were not collected from the growers out of the proceeds of the 1925 crop, as provided for under the original act, the Government should not collect them at all. That is a novel argument to me. It was only after the Government had ascertained that the collection of moneys on the 1925 crop would place the growers in financial difficulties, that it agreed to defer payments until the disposal of the 1926 and 1927 crops. The board will deal sympathetically with all cases. Growers who prove to the board's satisfaction that they cannot meet their obligations will receive total release. Others will receive partial release. The Government is acting liberally, and I am surprised that the honorable member for Wimmera has put forward such an extraordinary claim on behalf of the growers.

                            <para>.- When speaking on this matter on Friday last, I dealt with several points to which I shall now briefly refer to connect up my remarks. I spoke of the much vaunted settled policy of Australia and asked for a definition of it. I asked if the adoption of the policy of protection would mean excessive protection or prohibition. I referred to my election pledges, which were against excessive duties. I showed that, despite the prediction of the previous Minister for Trade and Customs, when introducing the 1920 Tariff, that it would result in a reduction of imports, there had actually been a steady and continuous increase of imports, with a corresponding decrease in the export of both primary products and manufactures. It was hinted by interjection that I was choosing my figures to suit my case, but I would remind honorable members that I was then dealing with the effect of the tariff, not on local production or consumption, but on the export trade. I said emphatically that the slight increase in primary production was due largely to the enormous sums of money that had been spent under the repatriation scheme in the various States  during the last four or five years. When progress was reported I was dealing with agricultural implements, and I propose now to touch further upon that subject. Last Friday week, when the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> moved the adjournment of the House to discuss agricultural implements, the Minister in his reply lauded the report of the Tariff Board. He said that it was an excellent report, and th?.t we should give the board credit for its industry and its aptitude in marshalling its facts. I say emphatically that the report of the Tariff Board on agricultural implements is biased, and is the most one-eyed report that has ever been presented by any board to this Parliament. These are strong statements, which I shall support by quoting the report itself. One point strongly stressed by the board was the debt that the primary producers owed to the Australian manufacturers and engineers. The report reads - </para>

                            <para>The agricultural implement manufacturers have directly benefited the primary producer to a quite remarkable extent, through the invention and development of the types of implements needed for the conditions peculiar to Australia, and which have enabled the farmers here to produce wheat at a cost which is probably less than that in any other country in the world. The Australian implement makers have brought into use machines of inestimable value to the farmer, and of particular value in subduing the Mallee country and bringing it under cultivation. It is sufficient, therefore, to say here that the primary producer is the direct gainer through the existence of the industry, and it would not be unfair if the primary producer had to contribute something through the medium of the Customs tariff in order to maintain that industry. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">I contend that instead of the Australian manufacturers and engineers conferring benefits upon the producers as indicated in the report, nearly all the inventions and improvements in Australian agricultural implements have been due to the genius, not of Australian engineers but of the Australian farmers themselves. I go further and say that many of the improvements in Australian agricultural machinery - I refer particularly to stump jump machinery - have been adopted by the Australian manufacturers and  engineers  only after the most persistent agitation by the farmers. Changing the types of implements always involves expense, and many of the Australian manufacturers are conservative and will not adopt a change until they are convinced that it is beneficial and likely to be a success. To illustrate that contention, I instance the Robinson Big E harvester, a three-wheel' machine. In the opinion of some farmers at Woomelang, the machine had a tendency in the stripping of sandy country to side-drag. This made it heavy to pull, threw a great deal of chaff and wheat on to the riddles, and spoiled the sample. Some of the farmers thought that the machine would do its work better if the front wheel were extended. In the midst of harvesting wet weather set in, and, suspending operations, they decided to experiment with one of the machines. Taking it into a blacksmith's shop they extended the front wheel 18 inches. The result was a remarkable improvement in the stripping of sandy paddocks. The experiment was reported to Robinson's agent, and the manufacturer was urged to make the alteration part of the standard equipment. Some years elapsed before the company adopted the proposal, and then it imposed an additional tax on the farmer by regarding this alteration as special equipment, for which the purchaser had to pay a higher price. However, so many applications came from farmers in the Mallee for the improved machine that the firm had to standardize it, although the wheels were' not extended so far as some farmers considered necessary. </para>

                                <para>- As a practical agriculturist, the honorable member should know the position. Earlier in my speech I quoted a statement from the Tariff Board report that the Australian agricultural implement-makers have brought into use machines of inestimable value to the farmer, particularly in subduing the mallee country, and that implements suitable for Australian conditions have been invented and developed by Australian manufacturers. The whole tenor of the report is to give to engineers and manufacturers all the credit, whereas some of it rightly belongs to the farmers. </para>

                                <para>- We are told that it is of advantage to the primary producers to have in Australia an industry for the manufacture of agricultural implements. The advantage is not all on one side.  One  of the biggest advantages enjoyed by Australian manufacturers over their competitors, in Canada, for instance, is that, being on the spot, they are able_more quickly to make changes to meet Australian conditions. I am not opposed to the Australian manufacturers, nor would I, by any action in this Parliament, deliberately seek to make their position more difficult, or destroy their industry. Every implement on my Mallee farm is of Australian origin, and was bought for that reason. The question in regard to which we join issue with the high protectionists is not as to the advantage of the local manufacture of agricultural implements, but the conditions under which the factories have been established, and shall continue to operate. Consider the profits that are made by some of the manufacturers. The report of the Tariff Board includes one clear illustration of profiteering. In summarizing the history of T. Robinson and Company Proprietary Limited, the report says - </para>

                                <para>Robinson and Company was originally founded in 1854, and became a limited company in 1889. As a limited company, up till 1905 it only paid two small dividends. In 1906, 1907, and 1910 it also paid small dividends. It began to turn the corner in 1910, when slightly better profits were made, but for the years .1913, 1914, and 1915 no dividends were paid. During these three years the business was seriously affected by the drought conditions which prevailed in large areas of the agricultural districts. In 1916 the company paid a dividend of 24 per cent., and in 1917 one of 5 per cent. This was followed by five years of steady progress, in which each year a dividend of 10 per cent, was .paid. In 1923 the dividend paid was 15 per cent., and in 1924 20 per cent. </para>

Such firms perform the services of banking institutions by extending long credits on hire and purchase agreements, which are of stupendous importance to the primary producers, and, furthermore, are involved in heavy annual expenditure in the maintenance of expert staffs, who educate the primary producer in the use and care of modern agricultural implements. </para>

                                <para>- The powers of the board are so wide, and its operations affect so vitally the whole of the industrial and economic life of this country, that its composition should receive the careful consideration of honorable members. Independence of outlook, and freedom from bias, are as necessary in its members as they are in the judiciary, but apparently they have been chosen, not because of their freedom from bias, but in order that they may represent certain sections of the community. That is indicated by the appointment of a fourth member as a direct representative of the primary producers. </para>

                                <para>- The  chairman  of the board is a departmental officer. My brief experience of departmental officers has convinced me that they are intensely loyal to the government of the day, no matter what the opinions or the policy of that government may be. When a change of government occurs it is, with them, a case of " The king is dead. Long live the king!" It hag been truly said that in all of us there is a good deal of human nature. That applies with considerable force to those very excellent servants of the departments to whose loyalty I have paid such a tribute. When a board is presided over by a departmental officer there is the tendency to make recommendations that will please the Minister. The Tariff Board appears to consider that it is its duty to interpret and enforce the settled policy of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- It is quite true that Parliament has given the Minister the power to take such action. I shall cite a specific instance. Parliament laid it down that wire netting should be imported free of duty; but when certain English manufacturers were selling lines of wire netting at a price that the Tariff Board and the Minister considered was lower than the price of a similar article of Australian manufacture, a duty was imposed under the provisions of the Customs Tariff Industries Preservation Act. </para>

                                <para>- It is not often that I agree with the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> but I do so in this case. It would not be fair to Australian manufacturers if their competitors oversea were allowed to dump their manufactures here under any conditions with the deliberate object of destroying a necessary Australian industry. Provision should be made to prevent practices of that kind in the wire-netting industry by an increase in the bounty. My point is that duty should be imposed only with the authority of Parliament. The Tariff Board should not be a departmental board. It should be entirely independent. </para>

                                <para>- The board would be far more effective if its powers -were limited to making inquiries into the necessity for duties and the incidence of the existing tariff, and if it reported to Parliament instead of to the Minister. It would be advisable, in my opinion, to appoint a tariff committee composed of honorable members of this House, and charge it with the duty of considering the reports of the Tariff Board and recommending  the amount of duty to be imposed. The present procedure is wrong. Apart from my disagreement with the extremely protectionist policy of the Tariff Board, I have a great admiration for . its enthusiasm. I consider that it has done a tremendous amount of good hard work,  and  I make no reflection whatever upon it. </para>

                                <para>- So far as possible, such a committee should fairly reflect the fiscal, opinions of the House. Generally speaking, I think that when honorable members criticize an existing arrangement they should propose another as a substitute for it. I am trying} to do that. If my suggestion for the appointment of a tariff committee is not considered to be workable, all I can say is that it is the best that I can make. </para>

                                <para>- Under the present system the Tariff Board has an almost impossible task, and it is inevitable that its conclusions must displease more people than they please. Even if the members of the board were supermen, they would still incur adverse criticism. In my opinion, it would immeasurably help the board and add to the value of its findings if it were relieved of the responsibility of recommending definite tariff duties. If its reports were submitted to a tariff committee, such as I have suggested, the committee could make recommendations to Parliament. </para>

                            <para>Flexibility would be an undesirable feature of the tariff in any event. It is true that when any tariff goes into operation, experience shows that some of the duties in it have been wrongly calculated for carrying out the policy intended. It is also true that, as time passes, conditions in industry and commerce undergo changes which throw other duties out of adjustment with the intent of the law. The necessity of correcting such maladjustments explains in part the frequent recurrence of tariff revisions in recent American history. But it sometimes happens that the change of conditions is not so widespread as to justify a general revision, and yet that it seriously affects some particular branches of industry. In that event it might well be desirable to modify the duties on the products of the' industries affected. </para>
                            <para>Such instances, however, are not so frequent that Congress cannot deal with them as they arise. When the tariff is framed, substantial allowance should be, and in fact is, made for the ordinary, the seasonal, and other recurrent vicissitudes of industry and commerce. It is necessary to do this for the reason that stability of rates is far more essential to the public welfare than is the maintenance of an exact adjustment of duties to tariff policy. When the operation of the law clearly discloses that, owing to exceptional and unexpected developments, ' some of the rates are gravely injurious, there is no valid reason why  Congress should not give them individual consideration. Such a procedure, however, is quite different from what is implied by the term " flexible tariff." </para>
                            <para>Undoubtedly there is something alluring in the motion of a benignly flexible tariff. It is as plausible as the maxim : Be good and you will be happy. Unfortunately, it rests on a mistaken supposition, namely, that it is possible to alter duties punctually and smoothly in such a manner as to offset with substantial preciseness changes in economic conditions, and thus to maintain equilibrium between importation and domestic production. But even if this supposition were correct, which it is not, a flexible tariff would still be an expedient of harmful possibilities. For it should toe remembered that the tariff, whatever the purposes of it may be, is in fact a tax assessed on the import branch of international trade. And it is an essential quality of a just and  un-oppressive  tax that it should be certain in order that suitable provision may he made for its payment without destructive consequences. There can he no safety in business plans when the payments which the Government will exact from business arc unknown. This is especially true of an indirect tax, such as the tariff is, where ultimate payment is expected to be postponed, and all the intricacies and uncertainties of shifting are encountered. Under a system of flexible .rates the paralyzing sense of insecurity that attends a general revision would be made continuous. It is hard to conceive of any more damaging effect of a tariff on conservative business than would result from a substantial and irregular fluctuation of duties. It would instil into the import trade a powerful spirit of speculation, and this in turn would undermine the security ot all domestic producers with whose produces imported goods compete. Flexible duties, therefore, instead of promoting stability, would add another to the many uncertainties to which commerce and industry are exposed. </para>

                            <para>Modification of the tariff &gt;by proclamation of the  President  has been negligible. In June, 1924, the Tariff Commission sent to the Senate a report on the progress of its work. The time lacked by three months of completing the two-year period for which the committee on finance had first proposed that- the " flexible " provision of the tariff should remain in force.' At that date, the  President  had ordered no change of duty, except on wheat and wheat products, barium dioxide, and sodium nitrite. The commission, meanwhile, had received requests for investigation from 172 industries. Thirty-seven investigations had been instituted; but of these eight had been suspended, only three had 'been completed and their results laid before the  President,  and the rest were in various stages of progress. To regard the present tariff, therefore, as " flexible," one must view it from a geological stand-point. </para>

According to the honorable member for Perth, every man must be a whole-hogger ; he must be either an out-and-out freetrader or a prohibitionist. I do not accept that view. I am not a freetrader. If a proposal were submitted to this House to wipe out all Customs duties I should fight and vote against it. I believe in moderation in all things. I believe that the imposition of Customs duties is permissible and desirable as a source of revenue. Duties are desirable and necessary also for the fostering of new industries, but I qualify this statement by saying that I do not include tinpot industries for the manufacture of dolls' eyes, mouse traps, artificial flowers, or many other finnicking little businesses that could be mentioned. </para>

                                <para>- The dried fruits industry has for a quarter of a century had the benefit of the protection afforded by those duties.1 My objection is to the continual increase of duties on specific items. Before I agree to further increases I want to know where they are going to stop. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> V. McKay having had for 25 years the protection of a duty of, -say, £10 on reapers and binders, and having had the opportunity to adjust his business accordingly, did not come to this House asking for more and more protection, I should be prepared to continue to give him the advantage of the protection he had previously enjoyed. The difficulty is that industries that have been protected are continually clamouring for higher protection. I believe that excessive protection is harmful. When we take such a huge sum as £37,000,000 per annum out of the pockets of 6,000,000 of people, that must have a material influence on the cost of living, and of production. </para>

                                <para>- I note the honorable member's interjection, and let me say that when proposing, in 1920, the imposition of what were described as very excessive duties the then Minister for Trade and Customs expressed the opinion that the effect of their imposition would be to reduce the revenue derived from Customs taxation. The effect has been to increase it. Wow, the successor of the then Minister for Trade and Customs comes along with the old story, the old dope from the same old bottle, and asks us to believe him when he says that increases in duties will result in the reduction of Customs revenue, although all the predictions of his predecessor in that regard have been falsified by experience. I do not admit that in all cases the home market is the best market, but assuming that it is, it has to be remembered that, the taxation of the implements and tools of trade used by the primary producer in production for export is unjust and inequitable. Whatever may be the  opinion  of members of the Labour party with regard to the building up of industries in this country, I ask them whether they consider it equitable to compel the primary producers of Australia to pay Customs taxation on their implements and tools of trade used, not for production for home consumption, but for production which must be sold in the markets of the world. That is what the Australian primary producers object to. There might be some justification in asking them to pay the Australian price for their implements and tools of trade used in production for local consumption; but to compel them to pay through the Customs duties levied on implements and tools of trade used to grow produce which must be sold in the markets of the world, is wrong, unjust, and indefensible. ' The real remedy does not lie in acceding to continual applications to this House for higher and still higher duties. The Minister referred to Australian secondary industries as suffering from growing pains. That was a very frank' and significant admission, for which I thank the honorable gentleman. He made it clear that the idea that it is necessary to impose a duty to enable local industries to be established, and when they have commenced mass production, as the American makers of agricultural machinery have done, the duties may be, removed, must be abandoned because he quite frankly admitted that after an industry is established it is necessary to continue to feed it with fiscal dope in order to keep it going, and to relieve it of growing pains. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad that interjection was made, because it enables me to say that some representatives of the primary producers in this corner, whilst protesting against the tariff burdens that are piled upon the primary producers, feel that, as they are being crucified by this policy, they are compelled in self-defence to hop in with the rest and get a cut out of the tariff. I do not agree with those who think in that way. If we get the Australian price for butter, wheat, and the other primary products of Australia based, not on export, but on import parity, and continue increasing the protective duties year after year, as is done for the benefit of the secondary industries, the result must be that the cost of living in Australia will be considerably increased. Wages will necessarily have to be increased to meet it. Costs of production will be increased, and the last position of the country will be worse than the first. The attitude adopted by some honorable members opposite surprises me. Do they not realize that the object of nearly every increase in the tariff - I admit there are some exceptions - is to enable local manufacturers to increase their prices. </para>

If that is not the object, why impose the duty? I may be told that the manufacturer may temporarily raise his price, but that it will ultimately come down. That is mere prophecy, and I have said that the object of the imposition of a duty is to increase the price of the article upon which it is imposed. </para>

                                <para>- I have no wish to be one-eyed in this matter. I have said there are exceptions to what I regard as the rule. Higher duties result in higher wages, which increase the cost of production. Manufacturers and organized workers are fighting one another, and the poor devil who handles the pick and shovel is always a lap behind in the race. When prices go up the worker has to apply to the Arbitration Court to increase his wages, and may have to wait a very long time before his application can be heard. The workers are always a lap behind in the race. The real remedy is not the continual increasing of tariff duties or the granting of bounties, but a campaign throughout the country to secure national efficiency in workmen, primary producers, and manufacturers. It is to that our energies should be directed. The continual increasing of tariff duties is no remedy for our difficulties, and when the Minister replies to this debate it will be for him to tell us where all this is going to end. </para>

                            <para>.- I should not have arisen tu address myself again to the tariff during the general debate had it not been for the astounding statement made by the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> that an agreement had been entered into between the Nationalist party and the Country party in Western Australia in order that they might present a united front in that State at the recent elections. He pointed out that 'but for that agreement, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> a member of the Cabinet, would not have been returned to Parliament. Many peculiar things take place in connexion with election campaigns, but I venture to say that, if one took the trouble to look up political history, it would be difficult to find a parallel case to this, in which a Minister of the Crown, who had agreed in Cabinet to certain tariff proposals, introduced in the form of a schedule two or three months prior to the elections, had entered into a compact to do his utmost, if returned  to Parliament, to reduce the duties imposed by that schedule. The action of the Minister for Home and Territories clearly proves that responsible government, as it existed in the past, does not exist to-day. This anomalous position has been brought about because of the endeavour to govern this country by two parties which do not see eye to eye on many questions, particularly the tariff. What was this agreement? It is only right that the position should be clearly put before honorable members. The honorable member for Wimmera, in this chamber last Friday, said - </para>

One member of the Cabinet, the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> accepted those conditions, nominated under them, and won his seat under them.

                        <para class="block">Many things in connexion with political campaigns may be overlooked, but it is difficult to overlook an action of this kind on the part of a Minister of the Crown. It indicates that politics in this country are deteriorating. While this agreement was being entered into in Western Australia, the Prime Minister made the following statement: - </para>

                            <para>The Government recently found it necessary to submit proposals for an amendment of the tariff in respect of certain of our industries. These alterations were only submitted after the most exhaustive examination by the Tariff Board and the Government, and are based upon the principle of sane and reasonable protection to efficient Australian industries. </para>

                        <para class="block">In other words, the Prime Minister told the public of Australia that the tariff which we are now discussing was in the interests of efficient Australian industries ; that the Government had considered it, and had come to that decision. Every Minister is loyally bound to stand by a decision of the Cabinet, otherwise responsible government would not be possible. Yet, despite the Prime Minister's statement, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> deliberately entered into an agreement with a section of the Country party in Western Australia. Evidently he had some qualms of conscience respecting his action, because, when opening his campaign at Perth he was reported as follows: - </para>

The Federal Parliament was very strongly protectionist, and from every appearance would continue to be so. His influence had been used to moderate tariff proposals, and his position in this regard was the same as that of Ministers representing the Country party who were members of the Composite Ministry. When the tariff, after being considered by the Cabinet, was finally approved, he must accept that decision or resign. </para>

                                <para>- It is marvellous how honorable members quibble when circumstances are against them. I remember that a somewhat similar position arose when the Country party, before the elections, made representations to their Leader respecting new States, and also the tariff as it affected agricultural implements. At that time honorable members quibble, and they are still quibbling. </para>

The Composite Government went to the country on a policy of protection, and as a result obtained the votes of the manufacturers and many of the men employed in factories. I am now endeavouring to show that an agreement was entered' into in Western Australia whereby one Minister of the Crown promised to do his best to reduce the duties imposed by the tariff. There is no escape from that position. </para>

                                <para>- If I were a member of a government that had decided on a certain policy, I should stand true to its decisions. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had not done that, he would not have been re-elected. After agreeing to a tariff schedule approved by the Cabinet of which he was a member, he pledged himself to do all that he could to reduce it. That was. a very serious thing for the Leader of the Government in another place to do. A majority of members in this House believes in protection. The Government also professes to believe in it. Yet one of its Ministers - and the one who will be in charge of the tariff when it reaches another place - has stated publicly that he will do his best to wipe out, or reduce, the tariff which the Government has introduced. Recently, a bill providing for a grant of £450,000 to Western Australia was agreed to because of the disabilities which the tariff imposes on that State. That grant will be made from money collected as  Customs revenue. Western Australia cannot have it both ways. She cannot obtain a grant of £450,000 from the Commonwealth Treasury, and at the same time cut off the source from which that money is obtained. A double-barrelled gun is being levelled at the Government. Not only do Western Australian members desire the tariff to be reduced, or wiped out, but they also want to get from. the Treasury a grant out of money received by virtue of the tariff to assist them to meet disabilities caused by the tariff. </para>

                                <para>- I. wish that there was no revenue from that source. I should like the tariff to be sufficiently high to enable Australia to be self-contained. If revenue is not obtained from Customs, it must be obtained from some other source. The next source is the income tax. But, for two or three years, the Treasurer has been endeavouring to get the Commonwealth to vacate the field of income taxation. In Sydney, yesterday, a big meeting of interested persons made representations to the Government to abolish the Federal income tax. Should revenue from Customs and from income taxation be no longer available, how would the Government obtain revenue ? We must not lose sight of the fact that Australia incurred a debt of . £400,000,000 in connexion with the recent war. That money has to be repaid; from that there can be no escape. While that war debt remains it is useless for honorable members to complain that our income taxation is too high. If each person paid only that taxation which he thought necessary, how should we pay our debts? </para>

                                <para>- If Australia were in a position to manufacture all her requirements, her population would be sufficient to enable a substantial reduction in taxation to be made. The establishment of factories gives employment to greater numbers of people. They constitute the home market for our primary products, and enable taxation to be reduced. The Government went to the country declaring that it was in favour of the tariff schedule - a protectionist tariff. Because of that policy it gained the support of numbers of people who previously were wavering. Before the recent election, numbers of men otherwise opposed to the Labour party told me that they were not satisfied with the attitude of the Composite Government on fiscal matters. But when the tariff schedule was introduced, they were satisfied. </para>

I say nothing as to the attitude of the honorable members for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> and Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann)</inline> ; they have been consistent. But no Minister is justified in entering into an agreement for political purposes when that agreement is opposed to the policy of the Cabinet of which he is a member. I cannot imagine that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> accepted this agreement without first consulting Cabinet. What is to be said of a Cabinet which, after having submitted a tariff schedule, based on the recommendations of the Tariff Board, permits one of its members to enter into an agreement to do all that he can to reduce that tariff ? </para>

Because it was thought wise to get rid of him, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> was got out of the way before the agreement was entered into. As things were, Government supporters in Western Australiasaw little chance of reelection. This arrangement was therefore entered into. It is no wonder that people speak contemptuously of parliamentary institutions. Men like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes and W. B. Dalley would not have stood for this kind of thing. If, during their regime, a member of the Cabinet agreed to something which was not in keeping with the settled policy of the government, he would have been called upon forthwith for an explanation. The position now is that the Country party claims <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> as a supporter of its fiscal policy. Hitherto it has been contended that, in the Composite Government, the Nationalist party held a majority of portfolios. </para>

What, will happen if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in another place, uses his influence to interfere . with the tariff ? No Government can control the affairs of the Commonwealth in such circumstances. Until the Minister denies it - if he does deny it - I shall assume not only that before entering into the agreement he consulted Cabinet, but that Cabinet consented to the action which he subsequently took. What will the manufacturers of Australia say when they know that they have been tricked? The Prime. Minister went to the country declaring that his Government stood for protection, that it would do its best to pass this tariff schedule. But at the same time he permitted one of his colleagues - the Leader of the Government in the Senate - to go to Western Australia and to agree to do what he could to reduce the tariff. What is responsible government coming to when such things are possible? </para>

                                <para>- That really does not matter, because the same influences would have been present in the Cabinet. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> stated distinctly that he was working in conjunction with the Country party members of the Cabinet in this matter.  His  action demands the attention of the Government and of Parliament. Whatever our political views, we all admire a party which, when in office, shoulders its responsibilities and is true to the best traditions of Parliament. The action of the Minister would not be tolerated in the House of Commons, or, indeed, in many of our State Parliaments. Yet, in the Australian National Parliament we are asked to stand for this kind of thing in order that the Composite Government may remain in office. Rather than that the Composite Government should continue, it would be better for the Nationalists themselves to form a government. There would then be no division, and we should have responsible government. We should not then have one section of the Cabinet standing for something, and another section, while not approving of it, agreeing to it. When one party controls the administration we shall get back to responsible government. The sooner that can be achieved the better it will be for the country. The state of affairs that has existed for months past is most unsatisfactory. In making this complaint I am seeking no party advantage; I am actuated only by the desire to uphold the traditions of British parliamentary institutions. The signing of an agreement by a member in opposition to the policy of his Cabinet is wrong, and I would be recreant to my duty as a member of this House if I did not draw public attention to it. It is clear that honorable members opposite have placed party advantage before political rectitude. The Government is not right in leading people to believe that it stands for the fostering of local industries by means of tariff protection, when, apparently, half the members of the Cabinet are endeavouring to destroy that policy. The disclosure of this agreement will at least have the effect of opening the eyes of those people who voted for Ministerial candidates in the belief that the tariff schedule now before the committee indicated the accepted policy of the Government. I believe that three-fourths of the people of Australia are in favour of the protection of local industries. The Government played on the fiscal sentiments of the people in order to get returned to office, notwithstanding that half the members were doing their utmost to destroy the tariff. I do not criticize those honorable members who are conscientious believers in free trade, and appear in their true colours; it is to their credit that they fight for their political  faith. But it is not in the interests of clean government that a Ministry which claims to have a protectionist policy should allow one of its members to enter into an agreement for the removal of tariff duties. I invite the Government to declare whether or not it had knowledge of this agreement.' If it had such knowledge, the Prime Minister had no right to make a policy speech in which he pledged his Cabinet and his party to a policy of fostering secondary industries by means of tariff duties. If the Government had no knowledge of the agreement, the Prime Minister should say so. If it acquiesced in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> action, it should be frank with the people, so that they may know that their votes were obtained by false pretences. At election time many things are done which would not be done at other times, but when the probity of the Cabinet- is undermined and certain members enter into an agreement for the purpose of nullifying the publicly declared policy of the Government, a serious wrong is done to- the country. We cannot have stable government while this condition of affairs obtains. A  return  to one-party government will be in the interests of the Commonwealth, for we shall get away from the present system of intrigue and compromise, and the advocacy of sectional interests without regard to the welfare of the great majority .of the people. All sections of the House are prepared to help the primary producer to any reasonable extent, but the members of the Country party are always trying to wring some advantage out of other sections of the community. That state of affairs cannot endure. It is the duty of all honorable members to place the welfare of the country as a whole before the interests of a class or section. By the establishment of secondary industries a market will be provided for the primary industries, more employment will be created, and the country will be made capable of absorbing more population, thus reducing the taxation per head and helping to develop Australia into one of the finest countries on God's earth. </para>

                            <para>. - Repeating the tactics to which his party has frequently resorted during the last three years, the Leader of the Opposition has sought to create division in the ranks of Government supporters by raising false issues.  His  great anxiety to secure, at one time for .-the Nationalists and at another time for the Country party, better consideration and representation, is almost pathetic. The honorable gentleman has declared that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> a member of the Ministry, went about the country saying that he was opposed to the fiscal policy of thu Government. That is an absolute misstatement. The agreement between the Nationalist and Country parties in Western Australia was not a secret. </para>

                                <para>- They should be read by any honorable member who presumes to make charges such as the Leader of the Opposition has made to-night. The two organizations in Western Australia accepted the nomination of three candidates for the Senate, knowing full well their views and responsibilities. When they accepted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> they knew that as a Minister he was bound by the declared policy of the Government. That policy was no secret. Last year the Government tabled in this House a tariff schedule almost identical with that now before us, and would have given legislative effect to it had not the Leader of the Opposition challenged us to go to the country on the communistic issue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did not mislead the people as to his position; he knew, and they knew, that if he were returned to Parliament it would be his duty as the Leader of the Government in another place to pilot the tariff through that chamber and fight loyally for the policy it represented. </para>

                            <para>.  -  The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> is deserving of the thanks of all fair-minded honorable members for having drawn attention to the moist immoral contract made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> the Leader of the Senate, in order to ensure his re-election. During the election campaign the Government, by facing both ways on the fiscal issue, hoodwinked the people in Western Australia . and the electors in the eastern States. Ministers apparently considered that the end justified the means. The Treasurer said that there was nothing wrong in the compact to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> subscribed. Yet when the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> heard the terms of the agreement read by the honorable member for. Wimmera, he interjected that it was a' most immoral arrangement. He was expressing an impartial opinion. The Treasurer knows that the arrangement was immoral, corrupt, and politically dishonest, and that a party guilty of such conduct deserves to be swept out of public life. The Treasurer says that all this has been known for the last eight months, that it has appeared in the Western Australian newspapers, and that honorable members should have known of the agreement. But the Western Australian newspapers have a limited circulation in the eastern States, and I doubt whether the Treasurer himself ever reads a Western Australian newspaper. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> earlier in the debate, also brought this matter before the committee. He said that so far as Western Australia was concerned the Country party and the Nationalist party, prior to the elections, came to the following agreement : - </para>

                                <para>- I intend to do so, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman.</inline> The Treasurer endeavoured to show that the suggested new States could be brought about if the Federal Labour party had not, as he termed it, " fallen down on the job." He deliberately set out to deceive the people in Capricornia, New England, and other places. He also said it was regrettable that the honorable member for Capricornia, meaning myself, did not attend the meetings of the Parliamentary New States Committee. Are honorable members aware that the Treasurer himself is not a member of that committee, and that the committee meets about once in every six weeks or so ? I remind them also that only yesterday the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> took action to ensure Government business taking precedence over private members' business, which includes a notice of motion relating to the formation of new States. That action prevented this chamber from discussing the question. Is it .any wonder that the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> in his book <inline font-style="italic">The Case for Labour,</inline> published many years ago, declared that coalition governments were immoral combinations unlikely to be of any benefit to the country ? It is evident, from the disclosures made by the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart),</inline> and eloquently emphasized this evening by my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> that the Government has descended to unheard of depths of political immorality and dishonesty. The Leader of the Government in another place associated as he was with Country party members of the Cabinet, and Country party candidates went before the electors of Western Australia pledged to bring about a substantial reduction in the tariff. This, mark you, is the gentleman whom the Government has to rely upon to pilot the tariff through another place. I should like to know what the 450,000 workers employed in our secondary industries think of this. I should like to know, also, what the manufacturers of Australia and those primary producers who have to depend upon the home market for the disposal of their surplus products think of it? I intend to confine my remarks to certain phases of the' tariff proposals and emphasize where I stand in relation to the schedule. I believe in the granting of bonuses to assist primary and secondary industries in their initial stages; I believe in adequate tariff protection  for both primary and secondary industries; 1 believe, also, that we should, at the earliest possible date, give effect to the Labour party's new protection policy. This will guarantee to the manufacturers adequate protection, and they in their turn .will be obliged to observe Australian standards in their factories and sell their ' goods at reasonable prices. This policy will result in a substantial increase in our population, and provide a splendid home market for our primary producers. All honorable members have received numerous communications from interested parties in regard to various items in the schedule, particularly those items dealing  with cotton tweeds, cotton piece goods, and woollen piece goods. I do not propose to deal with those subjects in the general debate on the schedule. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> stated, in the course of his remarks, that the recent Farmers' Conference at Ballarat carried resolutions protesting against the present high tariff policy of the Government. That conference also passed, a resolution endorsing the policy of the Composite Ministry. If the farmers at the Ballarat conference had been sincere and consistent they would have supported the stand taken by the honorable member for Wimmera, and passed a motion of censure on those Country party members who sold their political principles for office. Evidently they were more anxious for the continuance of conservative government in Australia than that their principles should be given legislative effect, so they deserted the honorable member for Wimmera. It is apparent, from speeches made by Country party members during this debate, that they are ardent freetraders, and are out of step with Australia's national policy of protection. If they had their way, they would flood this country with imported goods from, cheap labour countries. </para>

The honorable member for Gippsland is what is called a "shandygaff" protectionist; that is to say, he wants protection for everything that the farmer produces and freetrade in farming implements. He has also been referred to as a " leaky-roof" protectionist. So far as our secondary industries are concerned I fail to see any difference between the honorable member for Gippsland and the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann),</inline> who, at all events, was bold enough to say that if he had his way he would wipe out all tariff protection. The policy of Country party members, if adopted, would result in the destruction of all our big manufacturing industries and the unemployment of 500,000 people. </para>

                                <para>- That astute move was taken on the eve of the Country party conference at Ballarat. The honorable member moved the adjournment of the House to protest against duties being imposed on agricultural implements so that farmers could buy in the cheapest market, but he failed utterly to prove that the foreign market was the cheapest. It is evident that, on the fiscal issue, the honorable member for Gippsland is not as sincere as is the honorable member for Perth. One wishes to wipe out the duty altogether, and the other declares himself to be in favour of a moderate tariff, which will slowly strangle our secondary industries. Members of the Country party, if they had their way, would gradually strangle some of the primary industries in certain parts of Australia, especially the Queensland sugar industry, so that sugar could be imported from Java and other cheap labour countries. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member believes in what he calls a. reasonable amount of protection, but he thinks that the duties in this schedule are too high. He tries to face two ways politically. I prefer a man like the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann),</inline> who is politically honest enough to say definitely where he stands. The Treasurer, I believe, is of the same opinion as the right honorable member for Balaclava concerning the Western Australian agreement, but he is. not courageous enough to say so. The honorable member for Gippsland is not prepared to give adequate protection to our secondary industries, but on the other hand he is anxious that protection should be granted in respect of maize, millet, potatoes, hops, jams, dried fruits, and onions. As a matter of fact he was a member of a deputation that waited upon the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> recently. He then said, " I want the duty on potatoes increased from £1 to £4 a ton." Those present at the deputation were Messrs. Rodgers, Bell, Hurry, Cook, M. Cameron and Paterson, members of the House of Representatives. They desired to have the duty on potatoes increased by 300 per cent. ; but they objected to . 45 per cent. protection on farming implements. They, therefore, speak with their tongue in their cheek when they say that the raising of the duties on items produced in the secondary , industries has the effect of increasing the cost of living to the workers. Will not the raising of the duty on potatoes increase the cost of living to men and women, not only in the cities, but also in the country districts ? </para>

They cannot take the broad Australian view. They stand on their back verandahs at their farms, look down their fields, and decide that protection on millet and meat, and a decent road, are all that they require. Yet the party to which they belong has a half-share in the Composite Cabinet ! Some Nationalist honorable members from Western Australia advocate reasonable protection until they visit their State; when they assure, those who desire freetrade, "We will co-operate with Country party members to reduce the tariff." In the eastern States they preach the doctrine of protection for our secondary industries. Honorable members opposite say that that is political honesty ! I should like to hear their definition of political dishonesty. I had to fight a good deal of misrepresentation in Queensland  during the recent election campaign. All the newspapers were opposed to the Labour candidates. The Country party candidate for Capricornia said that Federal Labour members would ruin the Queensland sugar industry if they had an opportunity to form a Government. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- He favoured the protection of prunes, potatoes, and millet and maize, because they were grown in his electorate; but he was not prepared to adopt the Australian view, and admit that if the sugar industry were wiped out, the greatest bulwark of our White Australia policy would be destroyed. Without that industry, the north could not be developed. Despite the views that they have previously expressed,- certain honorable members opposite now claim' to stand for a reasonable measure of protection for the secondary industries of Australia. ' That word " reasonable " is most ambiguous. If it means the lifting of the embargo which protects the sugar industry, and the introduction of black-grown sugar, how can they say they truly represent the interests of the primary producers? They may represent those who are engaged in primary production in a few square miles of Victoria, but they lack the vision which should be possessed by honorable members of a chamber of this character. It is difficult for me to understand why these alleged Country party members should hold such views, in view of the wonderful progress that has been made in Australia under protection during the last 20 years. A more rapid advance has been made during that period than in any other similar period in the previous history of Australia. Australian industries, primary and  secondary, increased in value from £117,000,000 in 1903 to £392,000,000 in 1923-4; whilst our manufacturing industries .increased from £28,000,000 to £132,000,000. A perusal of the statistics discloses a substantial increase every year. For example: - </para>

                                <para>- That is so. The Labour  party's  policy of protection is not one-sided, nor is it confined to the back portion of some farm. It is a well-balanced Australian scheme. We, as a party, support effective protection for agricultural machinery and implements; but we also say that those implements and machinery should be sold at a reasonable price, and that in their manufacture the Australian standard of living should be observed in the factories. Our policy also embraces adequate protection for the primary industries. </para>

                                <para>- We wish to prevent the consumers from being robbed by the exploiters, the speculative agents, and the market-riggers, who fleece the producers and consumers, and support the Nationalist party. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> was very unfair in his criticism this afternoon of the agricultural implement industry. To answer his statement that the Canadian binder is cheaper than that manufactured in Australia, one has to consider the price which the Australian farmer had to pay for that binder prior to the 1921 tariff. It was then sold in Australia for £120. When the tariff was imposed the Australian manufacturer secured the trade. In order to recover the market the Canadian manufacturer reduced the price of his binder to £93. If, in spite of a substantially increased duty, he could make his business pay at that price, what sort of a profit was he making before the 1921 tariff when he was charging £120 for' the same article. The honorable member for Gippsland, on the 26th February last, moved the adjournment of this House to discuss the duty on farming implements. I have never heard a weaker case than that which he put forward. It was just a political " stunt " to deceive the farmers who were about to attend a conference at Ballarat. The Minister for Trade and Customs effectively answered his arguments by stating that the agricultural " implement industry in Australia gave employment directly to 5,000 men, and indirectly to between 3,000 and 4,000; that it turned out annually implements valued at £1,500,000; and that the cost of a 6-f t. binder in freetrade  New Zealand was £72, compared with £75 for the binder manufactured in Australia. Who would not be prepared to pay an additional £3 in order to support an Australian industry, especially as the farming implements manufactured in Australia  are equal to any in the world? I have heard practical farmers say that they are superior to the imported article. All this talk about the high duties that are paid by the farmers on farming implements is so much moonshine in the light of the facts. Last year £135,000 was collected by way of duty on agricultural implements. That works out at only one-third of Id. on every bushel of wheat produced, leaving out of consideration all other agricultural products. That is on one crop. Take barley and potatoes and the cost is still more infinitesimal. The fallacy of the arguments used by honorable members opposite is thus exposed. They surely do not seriously claim that there is any truth in their statements. They make them merely in order to please a few misguided individuals, whom they should educate on these fiscal questions. They have secured their seats in this chamber by misleading the people with false statements. What - are- we experiencing in Queensland to-day? Owing to the inadequacy of the local market there is an over-production of sugar to the extent of 180,000 tons per annum, which has to be sent abroad to compete with sugar grown in Java and Fiji where labour costs ls. per day. This surplus sugar has to be sold .at £9 10s. per ton as against the Australian price, based on the cost of production, of £27 per ton, so that our sugar-growers lose heavily on it. The Queensland sugar-growers are strongly opposed to the freetrade policy of honorable members of the Country party. They do not desire to break down our tariff wall so that the products of cheap black-labour countries may compete unfairly with the products of Australia. The conditions here are incomparably better than those of most countries abroad. </para>

                                <para>- For years the sugar-growers in Queensland and northern New South Wales were unable to produce sufficient sugar to supply our local requirements, but the sympathetic treatment meted out to them by various Governments has enabled them, to overtake and exceed the local demand. The tariff protection has made sugar growing a payable proposition. It is only in the last two years that we have had a surplus production here. If another 500,000 people were employed in the secondary industries of Australia there would be sufficient people here to consume all the sugar that we could produce. The tropical north is not suited for general agricultural operations, and adequate protection must lie given even the sugar-growers to make it possible for them to carry on their work. Our great national fiscal policy has been good for primary producers, not only in Queensland, but throughout Australia. </para>

As a matter of fact, many persons acquired land and began to clear, and till it before there was a surplus production. It must be remembered that it is impossible to clear scrub country and get a crop off it in twelve months. Many of the people now engaged in the sugar industry entered into contracts for the purchase of their land two years before they got a crop off it. The sugar industry has developed in Queensland for the same reason that the number of factories has increased in Victoria, namely, that adequate protection has been provided to make development, possible. Men of initiative and enterprise will always be found ready to engage in primary and secondary industries when they are assured that adequate protection, will be afforded them against the competition of low-wage black-labour countries abroad. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> quoted figures this afternoon with the object of showing that primary production had not expanded under our Protectionist policy; but he gave values instead of quantities. When he was asked by the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> to give quantities, as they would be more convincing, he side-stepped the question. I intend to quote figures, aud I shall give quantities and not values, to show how primary industry has developed in Australia under our Protectionist policy. In 1900-1, before we had a Commonwealth tariff, the total area under crop in Australia was 8,812,463 acres. In 1923-4, the area had increased to 16,531,186 acres. The production of wheat increased from 45,974,992 bushels in 1919- 20, to 164,544,701 bushels in 1924-5. </para>

The production of hay totalled 2,986,411 tons in 1919-20, and 4,051,934 tons in 1923-24. The  quantity  of sugar cane produced in 1919-20 was 172,973 tons, while in 1923-24 it was 286,004 tons. Wonderful progress has been made also in our vineyards. The area under vine cultivation in 1919-20 was 73,326 acres, and in 1923-24 it had increased to 112,965 acres.' The production of wine increased from 7,649,404 gallons to 14,663,881 gallons in the same period. The production of raisins and currants has also increased remarkably. In 1920-21, 136,551 cwt. of currants were produced, and in 1923-24 the figures had grown to 304,294 cwt. We produced 168,177 cwt. of raisins in 1920-21. and 590,406 cwt. in 1923-24. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> should have quoted all these figures, but he failed to do so. The dairying industry has also developed substantially. The quantity of butter produced in Australia in 1919 was 165,648,791 lb., and in 1923 it was 226,665,853 lb. </para>

                                <para>- I have quoted various years, and they all show an increase. The cheese production in 1920 was 24,160,524 lb., and in 1923 it was 25,380,525 lb. In the face of these figures it is ridiculous for honorable members of the Country party to say that our great national policy of protection is suicidal. Our primary industries are developing on every hand. It must be apparent to even the dullest intellect, that the welfare of the farmers of Australia is closely bound up with the development of our secondary industries. The best market that the farmers can have is the local market. Every expansion of our secondary industries means employment at good wages for more people and a development of the local market for the farmers' produce. The Queensland producers, at any rate, realize that the larger the market at their door, the better for them. One customer in Australia is worth three or four on the other side of the world, because of the heavy transport charges involved in marketing our products abroad, and the competition there of low-wage countries. I cannot understand why honorable members opposite, particularly members of the Country party, should be continually railing against tariff protection and the secondary industries.

At the inception of the period for which the price has been guaranteed the basis laid down was  5½d  per lb. foi1 all cotton ; but, owing to the setting up of grade standards, after the first two years this basis was destroyed, thus causing intense disappointment to the growers, which is evidenced in the decreased area being put under crop this year. Since the departure from the spirit of the guarantee is responsible for the decrease in the acreage being planted this year, I am of the opinion "that the Federal Government should have reviewed the present guaranteed price with a view to resuscitating the industry. The losses on the guarantee are comparatively small when the services that the industry has rendered to the community are taken into account. The  depreciated overseas market should not affect the guaranteed prices during the defined period, because the growers have accepted the conditions outlined at the outset, and have laid themselves out to produce cotton on a large scale. In many instances they have increased their liabilities by purchasing additional implements, and more especially have they responded to the appeal to grow cotton of a high quality. The prices now guaranteed by the Federal Government are inadequate, and it is felt that they are having a depreciating influence on the anticipated bounty, thus prejudicing the expansion of the industry in Australia. It will be remembered that the guaranteed prices fixed for the ' 1925-6 season were from 2$d. to 5d. per lb. I am glad to notice that the growers in Central Queensland are most active in their endeavour to secure an increase in the prices for the coming season.

The Queensland Government has agreed to grant id. per lb. towards this increase if the Federal Government will grant the other £d.' Surely, with the resources of the Commonwealth behind it, this Government will readily consent to the proposal, if it has the interests of the growers at heart. There has been a request put forward for a bounty of 2d. per lb. over a period of ten years to establish the cotton-growing industry- in Queensland on a sound basis. This request was made to the Federal Government before the last elections, and it said that it would refer it to the Tariff Board. I hope that the report of the board, when it is submitted, will recommend a favorable reply to the request. Unfortunately the cotton-growing industry in Queensland has not been as successful as was predicted.' This bias been due largely to dry seasons. The last three seasons were unfavorable. The drought of 1922 was followed by a season in which pests did a great deal of damage to the crop. I am advancing these circumstances as reasons in support of the request for a bounty of 2d. per lb. on raw cotton. Cotton, is as sensitive to seasonal vicissitudes as are many other agricultural products. In the United States of America the cotton crop fluctuates between a feast and a famine. In one year there is a great surplus, and in the next, perhaps, a great scarcity. That is why transactions in cotton rank with the biggest gambles on the stock exchanges in America. In 1914, the crop in America was 15,000,000 bales. In 1921, it was 7,953,641 bales. For the three years * ending 1923, the average American crop was less than 10,000,000 bales. In 1924, it expanded to 13,627,936 bales, and in 1925 it was 13,588,000 bales. I mention these facts to show what a great opportunity there is for Australia in the cotton industry, if a bounty of 2d. per lb. is paid by the Commonwealth. In a reasonably good season next year, the Queensland crop might easily reach 35,000,000 lb. of seed cotton. That would be merely a drop in the ocean of the world's market. Thirty-five million pound of cotton represents only 70,000 bales of 500 lb. each, and in one American State, Texas, last season there was a yield of over 4,000,000 bales. It will be a" long time before we can reach that, but we should first be able to supply our own spinning and weaving mills in Australia. The results from cotton-growing in Texas should be an example and an inspiration to the Australian cotton-grower. Cotton is grown and picked there chiefly by white labour, and under climatic conditions very similar to those of Queensland. There is in our favour the cheapness and virginal richness of our lands, and the absence of the dreaded boll weevil, which has been a frightful pest in America, and has caused a falling off of millions of bales in the American production of cotton. Let us hope that we shall have no experience of that pest in Australia. Europe draws three-fifths of all its requirements in cotton from the United States of America, where high wages are paid. Australia has nothing to fear on the ground that the Australian standard of wages . cannot be paid in the industry here. The Americans have no fear of over production of cotton, and we need not fear over production here, because Great Britain is to-day very much concerned about the sources from which she will obtain her cotton in the future. America . to-day is not producing as much cotton as she did eleven years ago. Therein lies. Australia's chance. Last year England took 2,545,123 bales of American lint. Germany took 1,852,723 bales, and Japan took 701,575 bales. The cotton imported by Japan was worth £35,000,000, and was imported from the Gulf of Mexico. The importations of Japan are very significant for Australia, because they show the market which would be open to us for our surplus production of cot- ton. Japan requires raw cotton to the value of £35,000,000 a year, and Australia might very well aspire to capture that trade. That is one reason why I am pleading for the encouragement of the cotton-growing industry by the payment of a bounty of 2d. per lb. on raw cotton grown in Australia for a period of ten years. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- Yes, England spends every year £200,000,000 in the purchase of raw cotton, and of that amount she spends about £30,000,000 a year in Egypt. If in Australia we could get even £10,000,000 a year for our production of raw cotton, what a wonderful thing it would be for this country. The sugar industry is worth £10,000,000 a year, but the cotton industry in Queensland in ten years' time might be worth £15,000,000 a. year. That should be our aim. Although the prices of cotton lint have slumped, the passing1 of the severe depression in Europe will, I believe, tend to an increase in the prices offered for cotton. The. normal world demand for the raw product is not being met by present-world  production. America, which previously supplied Europe with raw cotton, has now established her spinning industry to meet the wants of her ever-expanding population. Great Britain will have to look to the dominions to supply her with raw cotton in the future. In the United States of America cotton is spun within sight of the fields on which it is grown. That is what I hope to see in central Queensland, which is the greatest cotton-growing district in Australia. There are some thousands of cotton-growers there, and I hope that, in time, in central Queensland, we shall have Australian cotton spun within sight of the fields on which it is grown. If honorable members opposite take the desired interest in this matter they will support the request for a Commonwealth bounty of 2d. per lb. over a period of ten years. Last year American mills absorbed 6,191,349 bales of raw cotton, which was less than 2,000,000 bales short of her production in 1921. These figures show that America cannot be depended upon to continue to supply the requirements of Great Britain, or of Japan, especially in view of the destruction caused by the boll weevil in American crops. The big factor to make cotton a great success, as wool has been, in the development of Australia's resources, will be quality as the first principle of production. In Queensland we have gone a long way on the road towards improvement of the quality of the cotton produced. The very best kind of' cotton, the Durango cotton, is now being grown extensively. The Government planted experimental plots for the growth of cotton seed, and subsequently distributed the seed to Queensland growers, with the result that to-day practically 75 per cent, of the cotton grown in Queensland is of the Durango type. One finds on going into the figures that in America, for one purpose or another, the people use 26 lb. of cotton per head of population per annum. Taking the Australian average at 20 lb. per head per annum of our  population.  our annual consumption of raw cotton would be 120,000,000 lb., which is seven times the quantity of raw cotton which Australia produces to-day. It is estimated that if we grew all our raw cotton and manufactured all our requirements of cotton goods we could absorb 280,000 additional people in Australia. That would create a greater market for our sugar, butter, wheat, maize and potatoes, and it would not be necessary for members of the Country party to look for an increase of 300 per cent, in the duty on potatoes. . "We have to take into consideration the byproducts of the cotton industry which are all obtained from the seed. In America the seed is now being fully utilized. Forty years ago it was considered to be absolutely worthless. In 1914, a record year for the production of cotton in America, 6,000^000 tons of cotton seed were treated, which produced 230,000,000 gallons of oil, 2,750,000 lb. nf meal and 200,000 tons of linters. These manufactured,  products  were valued at £100,000,000. These figures show what a wonderful industry the cotton industry is. In the cotton industry in Queensland we have had some of the best cotton experts that could ' be obtained from America. Unfortunately, several of them were not conversant with Queensland conditions, and their advice was not so valuable as that of some of the experienced farmers. The cotton industry no longer belongs to any one State, and cotton-growers put that to the Federal Government as one of the reasons why cotton-growing should be treated as a great national industry, and why the claim for payment of a bounty of 2d. per lb. upon the cotton produced in Australia is justified. . Cotton-growers are quite within their rights in asking for this bounty for a period of ten years, or for five years at least. I know that the Minister for Trade and Customs will consider the request sympathetically. The granting of the bounty would guarantee the growers against loss. They have already spent a great deal on machinery and equipment. They have now gone into the industry, and cannot retrace their steps. With proper encouragement, they should be in a position in a few years to supply the whole of Australia's requirements of raw cotton. An embargo should be imposed on the importation of raw cotton as soon as the cotton-growers of Australia can supply the requirements of cotton-spinning mills and weaving mills that will be established here in the next five years if effective tariff protection is given to both primary and secondary branches of the cotton industry. The Queensland primary producers' organization scheme at present provides an arrangement with individual farmers in each industry to keep records showing the cost of production. Up to the present we have no very reliable  figures  to show what it costs to produce cotton. Under the scheme for the keeping of records, it will not be long before reliable  figures  can be obtained. The cost of production should be on a fair and generous scale, the basis of which should be decided upon by the Queensland Council of Agriculture, and approved by the Director of Agriculture. The growers of cotton should have some say as to the basis on which it is decided. In my opinion, there is a great future for the cotton industry of Queensland if the  growers  co-operatively control the cotton from the farm through the ginneries, and also look after the marketing of the product. With a view to the adoption of this course, the Queensland Government recently established the Queensland Cotton Pool Board, which has all the necessary powers to handle the cotton, purchase and sell it, and finance the crop. Now the cotton-growers are very wisely endeavouring to purchase plant and equipment from the British-Australian Cotton Growing Association at a fair valuation. They will pay for it over a term of years out of the returns from their crops, so that- they may control the whole industry. It is a very wise move on the part of the growers to control their industry from the farm to the market. If the Government will afford the desired impetus to the cotton industry in Queensland, and if it will give a bounty on the manufacture of cotton yarn in . Australia, and thus encourage the secondary industry to work in conjunction with the primary industry, I believe that cotton-growing will become one of the greatest industries in Australia, and will do much to absorb the additional 2,000,000 people who are necessary in order that we may consume all our surplus primary produce, such as sugar, 40 per cent, of which is sold abroad at a loss to the growers of Queensland. </para>

                            <para>.- I do not know whether the passage of the Power Alcohol Bounty Bill had any effect on the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> but I am afraid that if our economics were based on his utterances, the condition of Australia would be bad indeed. If we placed an import embargo on all the things that Australia could produce, it would not be long before embargoes would be imposed on Australian produce in other countries. However, I did not rise to discuss the question raised by the honorable member for Capricornia, but to reply to the charge made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> against a colleague of mine from Western Australia: The Leader of the Opposition showed great heat, and professed to be astounded at what he denounced as the politically immoral practices of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I wondered what was behind his tirade, and after some consideration, I began to appreciate the reasons that actuated him. I am satisfied that he did not think there was anything improper in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did; but he realized that, having regard to the action taken in Western Australia, to the result of the elections there, to the fact that the people all over Australia are beginning to realize that high tariffs are not good for this country, and to the good work done by the Town and County Union in pointing out the dire effects of the high protection policy, he must find some way of making an attack. In Western Australia, we have a National party, a Country party, and a Labour party. </para>

                                <para>- I believe there is. The parties were anxious to overcome the difficulty that existed in the previous Senate election, when a large number of. candidates went to the poll. The National party in Western Australia has no association with the National party here. The Country party in Western Australia is a low-tariff party, and it has a different policy from that of the Country party in Victoria. I believe that the Country party in Victoria is beginning to realize the need for more moderate duties. The people of Western Australia feel that high tariffs make production in that State almost impossible. The long distances that separate them from manufacturing centres may have something to do with that opinion. Representatives of the Country party and the National party met together. They were alike desirous of going before the country united. That was not because they feared the advent of a Government such as that extolled by the honorable member, not because they wished to see controlling this Commonwealth a Government like the Lang Government of New South Wales ; but because they wanted a Government that would act sternly and strongly against certain disturbers of the peace. They also sought a common policy, in regard to the tariff, and they decided upon a policy of moderate protection. The candidates accepted by the Nationalists were <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> and the Country party was given the possibility of one member. Honorable members opposite have said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> signed an agreement. No request was made to him or to me, or to any other candidate, to sign- an agreement. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member knows how true that statement is in regard to the tariff. When on the election platform, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> stated his policy in regard to the tariff clearly and distinctly, and also enunciated the general policy of the Government. Honorable members opposite may be pledged body and soul to the platform prepared for them, but I am not pledged to any platform, and I presume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is not; but we are expected to give general support .to the party's policy. He asked the electors to accept him on his public statements, and his speeches were fully reported in the public press. He said he was "not a high tariffist."  No one knows better than the . Leader of the Opposition whether that statement by him is true. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> was Minister for Trade and Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> at that time a Freetrader, was a member of the Cabinet. But was he not loyal in every way to the Government of which he was a member? He has been an advocate of low  tariffs all his life. When the 1920 tariff passed through this House, and was sent up to another place, did not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> do his duty there? Did he riot tell the people of Perth that he was not an advocate of high tariffs, but that he recognized that we could not have freetrade. in this country? He said the Federal Parliament was very strongly Protectionist, and, from all appearances, would remain so; and that his influence had been used to moderate tariff proposals. Was there anything wrong  in 'a Minister saying that his influence had been used to moderate tariff proposals? ' Are there any facts to justify the grave insinuations made by the Leader of the Opposition and the' honorable member for Capricornia  that  'there was something immoral or improper in what he did? When a Minister goes before the electors he is bound only by his public . speeches. </para>

                                <para>- There was no agreement so far as individual members were concerned. It merely concerned the policy of the two organizations. I venture to say that there is not one honorable member of this chamber who is prepared to accept every word in the platform of either the Country party or the National party. My opinions, on the tariff are strong, and the leader of my party knows perfectly well that I demand absolute freedom on tariff matters. Members of the Labour party are bound body and soul, but that would not suit me even if it suits the honorable member for Dalley. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> speaking to the people of Western Australia, said that when the tariff after being considered by the Cabinet was finally approved, he must accept that decision or resign. He accepted that decision, and nobody knows that better than the Leader of the Opposition. There was nothing wrong with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> attitude in any shape or form. The people of Australia are realizing that a high tariff policy is not sound or economic, and is bound to cause injury to this country. It is time that we began to consider the future of Australia. We have borrowed no less than £150,000,000 during the last five years, and this has created a fictitious prosperity here. Our secondary industries have been spoon-fed : they have been encouraged by hot-house methods. Not one of them is ever likely to' compete in the markets of the world. Are we going to follow a policy such as that enunciated by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> who favours an embargo against all foreign goods. Under such conditions what would be our relations with other countries? The future prosperity of this country depends upon our export trade. We must export, but we want millions more people here to open up the land and to develop our primary resources. I do not object to the imposition of moderate duties. The present high tariff is enabling the manufacturers to accumulate huge fortunes. I cannot understand how honorable members of the Opposition are prepared to support the imposition of high duties that enormously increase the cost of living. For instance, textiles are most grievously taxed under this schedule. The workers receive no benefit from the tariff, because only 8^ per cent, of the workers are engaged in the highly-protected industries of Australia. Boot manufacturing has been protected for the last 40 years, and yet the worker in that industry gets a lower wage than a bricklayer's labourer. The workers are really  being penalized by the present tariff. We must change our tariff policy, and live more within ourselves. We must borrow less money. We are continually making huge conversions of loan money at from 5 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> to 6 per cent., which was originally borrowed at 3^ and 4 per cent. Taxation has increased enormously. </para>

We should come down to bedrock. The manufacturers and their employees should come to a better understanding: I do 'not mean through the Arbitration Court, but by agreement.

                                <para>- If we adopted the methods in vogue in the United States of America, the honorable member would not be required in this Parliament. In that country, men employed in manufacturing are receiving from §45 to $60 a week. The skilled artisan there owns his own motor car and has a high position in society. He is paid for what he turns out. In nearly all the industries there the working hours are 44 and 48 a week. It would be far better to get the workers to agree to something in the nature of piecework, or to become shareholders in the businesses in which they are engaged, and receive a share of the profits.  I have a great objection to duties which are not needed. I rose to refer to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> regarding the Western Australian agreement. I thank him for giving me a copy of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> speech, his action in doing so is further evidence of his unfailing courtesy. But the honorable member was in error regarding the action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who during the election campaign made his position abundantly clear to the people of Western Australia. I do not pretend to be an apologist for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I have no time for the tariff proposals which the Government of which he is a member has introduced - if I could rely on the Opposition I would go further, because I realize what the tariff has done for Australia - but the person who tries to reflect on the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in connexion with the recent election makes a charge which is unfounded and unjust. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member has evidently forgotten his history lessons. England built up her manufactories by the closest protectionist policy which the world has ever seen. Of the 200 death penalties in England in the year 1S00, 75 were for breaches of the excise and customs duties. In those days children of six' and . seven years of age were whipped in the mills, and made to work. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd-George,</inline> before he was Prime Minister, unveiled a statue in Wales to the memory of three men who received sentences of seven, five, and three years respectively for advocating that the workers' hours should be reduced to 70 per week, and their wages, increased from lis. to 13s. per week. In that way were the factories of England built up. Afterwards, there was an agitation in favour of freetrade. But England has never been a freetrade country; and she never will be. The position is much the same as it was when as schoolboys we played see-saw. At one end of the see-saw is the real freetrader, who does not want one penny from Customs duties. At the other end is the real protectionist, who is prepared to go to the extent of prohibition. He will not accept revenue from the Customs House, but he will allow everything that cannot be made in his own country to enter free of duty. From a revenue point of view there is no difference between the true freetrader and the true protectionist; they both believe in obtaining the necessary revenue from direct taxation - principally land taxation. The revenue tariffist of England takes the place of the boy who in our boyhood days stood in the middle of a see-saw. Ry taking off some duties he causes the protectionist to go down and the freetrader to go up; by adding duties, in other instances he reverses the position of the see-saw. Since the days when England's, fiscal policy was a policy of protection she has had a revenue tariff. The Channel Islands were supposed to have approached to -almost ideal freetrade conditions; but even there there was a revenue tariff. When I took the figures from <inline font-style="italic">Mulhall's Statistics,</inline> and compared the United Kingdom with other nations, I found that Great Britain drew more per head of population from her Customs House than any European nation, with the exception ' of Scandinavia. What but the Protectionist policy of Bismarck built up Germany's might, which almost overwhelmed the world? What but its protectionist policy has made America the greatest manufacturing country the world has ever known? Australia's policy of protection goes only about three-quarters of the way; but if the people were ' consulted by referendum, they would demand a truly protective tariff. In the <inline font-style="italic">Shipping World YearBook</inline> are published the tariffs of all countries. It shows that in the Argentine no duty is imposed upon agricultural machinery; yet no representative of the farmers has controverted the statement that such machinery is more costly in that country than in Australia. Only one country has a higher tariff than America, and that is the island Empire of Japan, which in half a century made a phenomenal rise from almost mediaeval conditions to a place amongst the most advanced nations. I hope that I may live to see Australia impose a tariff equally as high. Time was when two large stock companies in Australia joined forces to fight the American tobacco combine; they  made the defeat of the combine their slogan; but the shareholders awoke one morning to find that the American combine had acquired a controlling interest in their business. The combine proceeded to fight the English tobacco companies, which, ' after losing £3,000,000 or £4,000,000, capitulated. The only country that has beaten the American combine is Japan. Knowing that a tobacco monopoly was a valuable asset upon which to raise loans, the Japanese Government made a generous offer to the American combine for its trading, interest in Japan. The combine, arrogant in its financial might, rejected the offer. A second appeal by the Japanese Government was likewise turned down, and the Government then said to the combine, " We shall have to fight against you." The combine said, "'Good! Competitions is the life of trade." At the time of my first visit to Japan the competition had just started. A duty of 20 per cent, upon tobacco had been imposed. Within a year that had been increased to 50 per cent. ; in less than another year to 100 per cent., and later to 250 per cent. The combine found that it could not compete against such a handicap. For instance, cigars costing £10 f.o.b Hamburg, would cost the combine £25 in duty, whereas the only cost to the Japanese Government was £10, plus freight and landing charges. Finding that it was being driven from the market the combine offered to negotiate with the Japanese Government with a view of abandoning the market, but the Government wisely said, " We made you two fair offers, which you would not accept. We prefer you to remain in the market, for competition is the life of trade." Thus the combine's own answer was turned against it. To-day the maximum duty on tobacco imported into Japan is 355 per cent. Australia gives only a comparatively small protection to the workers in the tobacco industry. For instance, the duty on tobacco for manufacturing purposes is only 2s. 6d. per lb, and the maximum duty is 5s. 4d. The duties on cigarettes are l1s. 6d. and 12s. per lb., and on cigars l1s. to 13s. per lb. In the United States of America the duty on cigars and cigarettes is $4.50, equal to about 19s. per lb., plus 90 per cent, of the value, which makes the total duty more than £1. The Japanese duty of 355 per cent. on cigars worth £5 would amount to £17 15s., as compared with about 15s. in Australia, for our tariff does not differentiate between the cheapest and most expensive brands of cigars. I have yet to learn of any honorable member who claims to be a true freetrader. Revenue tariffists there are, and we see many grades between the moderate protectionist and the prohibitionist. But can a man be a moderate thief or a woman moderately virtuous? Away with this moderation! </para>

                                <para>- That is so, but let us be whole-hearted in the protection of our industries. I recognize that the primary producer does not receive a fair deal. I am informed that fruit sent by the producer to the Western Market is there manipulated and re-packed, the wholesaler taking so many pounds out of each case, so that when the fruit is sold again in the Victoria Market the purchaser gets 6 or 7 lb. less in weight. In that way the wholesaler adds to his profits, and so valuable have the auctioneers' stalls become that a bribe of £1,000 was offered to a member of the Melbourne City Council - which, to his honour, he refused - to use his influence in favour of the granting of an application for one. There should be a means of bringing the prices received by the orchardists into more equitable proportion to those paid by the purchaser. The Labour party alone has attempted to deal with that problem. Consider the position of the grower of wheat. To-day wheat is worth about 5s. 8d. f.o.b. Approximately about 50 bushels, equal to about 3,000 lb., of wheat is required to make 1 ton of white flour. The cost amounts to £14 3s.4d. From 3,000 lb. of wheat, 2,000 lb. of flour can be made. That flour will absorb sufficient water to enable it to produce 2,600 lb. of bread. There are 1,000 lb. of offal- bran and pollard. Many scientists and dietists are coming to the conclusion that whole wheat-meal bread is much healthier than that which is made from white flour, which is too highly refined. I was astonished to find that some establishments charge <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> more for a loaf of whole wheat-meal bread. I have been informed scientifically that 3,000 lb. of wheat will  produce 3,000 lb. of whole wheat-meal flour. That flour will take up a greater quantity of water than white flour, and it will produce 3,900 lb. of bread. At 3d. a lb. the receipts from the 2,600 lb. of bread made from white flour will bring in £32 10s. The 1,000 lb. of bran and pollard at £9 a ton - which is a fair price - will produce £4 10s.,or a total of £37. Adopting the same prices in respect to the 3,900 lb. of bread made from whole wheatmeal flour, you find that the result is £48 15s. The cost of gristing would not exceed 30s. or £2. Will any honorable member who represents a country district say that the producer is getting a fair deal? I ask leave to continue my remarks to-morrow. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire once more to direct the attention of the Minister for Defence to the urgent necessity for extending the air service from Derby to "Wyndham. Wyndham. is the most remotely-placed settlement in Australia. It is 1,600 miles north of the capital city of Perth. The air service at present goes as far as Derby. Wyndham is so isolated that at present it has only one mail every two months. The position was accentuated by the fact that for 23 days in the month of January last the telegraphic service entirelyfailed.' I have received from the  chairman  of the Wyndham Road Board a letter which I shall read, to acquaint honorable members with the difficult position of. the people, and the adverse conditions under which they labour. It is as follows : - </para>

                        <para>The residents of East Kimberley wish to bring under the notice of the Senators and Government the following urgent reasons for the extension of the air service to Wyndham before the wet season: - 1st. We have only one mail every two months, and, owing to the breaks on the telegraph line extending for 1,000 miles, the Town of Wyndham was without telegraphic communication for 23 days in January, and was continuously down from the 18th of January to the 4th of February, and at time of writing is down again. During the period of line breaks, all telegrams have to be sent to Darwin by wire- - less ;thence through Adelaide to Perth, and vice versa. Days at a time, the wireless could not work owing to atmospheric disturbances, and messages were as much as a week late, and often not received in the order as when sent, causing confusion. After breaks had been repaired as far as Derby, wires were sent there; thence by aeroplane to beyond the break on the line; then transmitted to Perth. </para>

                    <para class="block">The writer of this letter then proceeds to tell a most pathetic story -  2nd. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alec.</inline> C. Campbell and Lady Campbell, with three children, eldest aged six, reside at Waterloo Station, . 164 miles from Wyndham. Lady Campbell was preparing to leave for Wyndham to be confined, when she was suddenly taken ill. A messenger was sent to Wyndham for the doctor, who set out at once on horseback, but arrived too late. The unfortunate lady died the following day. From the time the messenger left, and until the doctor arrived at the bedside, eleven days had elapsed. Had we the aeroplane service, two lives would have been saved. We hope the lesson of thislady's death will not go unheeded by the powers that be, as the service would have saved many, lives in the past. </para>
                    <para class="block">I do not lay at the door of the department over which the Minister for Defence presides the blame for the death of this poor lady, but I stress the necessity for the extension of this air service, because such an extension would be the means, not only of providing a regular mail service, but also of saving human life. Government officers have been inspecting the ground between Wyndham and Derby. I trust that the Minister will- take into consideration the plight of this most remote centre in Australia, and in view of the great hardships that the people are suffering, arrange at once for the present air service to Derby to be extended to Wyndham. </para>
                    <para>Dr.MALONEY (Melbourne) [10.51]. - I am perturbed by the recent happenings at the meeting at the Council of the League of Nations at Geneva. It seems to me that an effort is being made to make patricians of the big nations, and plebeians of the small nations. Personally, I do not think that there will be peace on earth until there is a world congress at which every . nation will be represented and where the only question that will be asked is, " Do you wish to join this congress for the purpose of making peace and abolishing war for ever? Much as I should like to see Germany a member of the League, I cannot blame Brazil for opposing the proposal that Germany should be given membership in the Council of the League in' preference to Poland and Brazil. I do not know whether the great money kings of the world are pulling the strings, but certainly they rule the world in this age. Surely no group of nations has the right to say, " We intend to form a small circle and you must stand outside." Brazil represents 30,000,000 people, and is the only nation in South America that has membership in the League. If war should occur again, Poland will bethe first nation that will be in danger. Why should not both Brazil and Poland have membership on the Council ? Why should not every nation be admitted to it that desires admittance? I believe wholeheartedly that if a vote were taken in Australia to-morrow our people would say with an unmistakable voice that every nation that has a desire to abolish for ever the horrors of war should be permitted to join in one great conference with the object of achieving the glorious object of peace. </para>
