Since then, however, I have had a conference with the  chairman  of the War Service Homes Commission and the  chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank, and I hope that as a result all the difficulties will be removed, and the matter will be satisfactorily settled. </para>

                            <para>- The report of Sir George Buchanan on the ports of north and north-west Australia was received a few days ago, and I hope to make it available to honorable members tomorrow. As for his general report, I cannot yet say exactly when it will be received; but he hopes to be able to forward it almost immediately. The delay in its preparation has been due to a serious illness from which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Buchanan suffered after leaving Australia. </para>

                    <para>- I received a very large deputation yesterday on the subject of the proposed duties affecting motorists. I have fixed six as the maximum number of persons I will receive as a deputation, but yesterday I think that ten persons were present, all of whom spoke, and each of whom also submitted a prepared statement. One of the speakers was a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison.</inline> He, in opening his remarks, dealt with the tariff and its imposts on motorists, and I had to interrupt him, and point out that the tariff had been passed by Parliament, and had no relation to the particular subject under consideration. He made other remarks, and when he had concluded his speech, handed in a statement. I had agreed that any statement put in would be embodied in the notes of the deputation. I did not read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison's</inline> statement until last night; but in perusing it then I found one paragraph which could be interpreted only as an attack upon my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, an attack couched in the most insulting language. No such statement as that submitted in writing by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> was made at the deputation, and I did not know when the deputation was before me what was in the statements which its members handed in. Had any member of the deputation ventured to make such remarks in my hearing as are contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison's</inline> statement, I should have insisted upon their withdrawal or the withdrawal of the individual who made them. </para>

                            <para>- It is obviously undesirable that the Prime Minister of Australia should proceed to Great Britain unless an Imperial Conference that will be representative of the whole Empire is to be held there, and as Canada has a larger population than any of the other self-governing dominions, a conference in the absence of representatives of Canada would be one from which no great results would accrue. There is no certainty at the moment as to the exact position, and I am anxious to learn at the earliest possible date whether Canada will be represented at the conference, because it is impossible for us to proceed with our general arrangements until we are in possession of that information. </para>

The present demand for aviation spirit is not sufficient to justify their allotting special storage facilities for such a highly volatile spirit. Some tests with the ordinary Commonwealth Oil Refineries No. 1 grade motor spirit have been made by the Civil Aviation Branch, and, though the machines were successfully flown, the trials to date have not been comprehensive enough to enable a reliable report to be made in regard to its suitability for aviation purposes. </para>

                            <para>. - On Friday last I was pointing out that during the four years in which the sinking fund has been in operation, the amounts paid into it have counterbalanced new borrowings, so that the National Debt has been kept practically stationary. The net debt on the 30th June, 1922, was £339,200,105, and on the 30th June, 1926, it was £338,841,476, showing an actual reduction of almost £160,000, notwithstanding that during the four years the population had increased by 481,000. In other words, the national debt was reduced by £4 19s. 6d. per head. That is very pleasing reading to honorable members, and more so to the general public. Charges of extravagance and excessive taxation are made against the Commonwealth Ministry, but the taxpayers must be gratified to know that there is one parliament in Australia that is reducing the load of public debt. Another gratifying feature of the Budget papers is the evidence of reduction in the working costs of government departments. In 1921-22 the cost of administration was £2,952,000, and for the year ended 30th June, 1926, working expenses had actually been reduced to £2,874,000, and it is anticipated that during the current year the amount will be still further decreased. Those figures are an eyeopener to me as they must be to the outside public, especially having regard to  the increase in population and the progressive awards of the Arbitration Courts. Actually the cost of maintaining the civil service has been reduced from 10s. 9d. to 9s. 2d. per head of population. In spite of the charges of 'extravagance this reduction of administration costs is a feather in the Government's cap, and will be warmly approved by the taxpayers. The activities of the Commonwealth Bank also call for favorable comment. In 1924, we were threatened with a financial crisis. Men in commerce hardly knew what the morrow would bring forth. The position of the primary producers was very precarious. Within a few months Australia had to export £140,000,000 worth of wheat, wool, and other primary produce. For each £100 worth, of goods we exported we received only £90. It was a severe trial for the banking institutions of this country, and the Commonwealth, through the instrumentality of the Commonwealth Bank, came to the rescue of the private banks by offering to advance £15,000,000 worth of notes. That action enabled our exports to be sent oversea, and gave us a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo,</inline> the amount of exchange being reduced to only a few shillings per cent. Although £15,000,000 was made available, the gross amount taken by the banks on any one date, and refunded by them within a short period was only £2,800,000. The Commonwealth Bank then carried Australia through one of the worst financial crises it has experienced, and for that action, if for nothing else, it deserves the thanks of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>The Government has been criticized for its housing scheme, which, it is alleged, will trespass on State preserves. That may or may not be so, but if we cast our minds back to the last election we find that the housing plank in the platform of the Nationalist party was received by the electors with hearty approval. In his policy speech the Prime Minister said that the Government was prepared to finance a housing scheme to the extent of £20,000,000. That is a wise policy. Housing should not be exclusively a Commonwealth, a State, or a municipal matter; for any authority that assists the people to obtain homes of their own confers a lasting benefit on the community. If all the people of this country lived in decent homes, this would become a con tented democracy. A few months ago there was evidence of a disturbing bolshevik element in this country, and even to-day some of the proposals of the Labour party are too bolshevistic for honorable members on this side to accept; but such views would largely disappear if the workers were provided with better houses. When I was in Adelaide a few weeks ago some of the 1,000 homes that are being erected by the Government on the outskirts of the city were pointed out to me, and I was told that many of the occupants of them, although they were Labour supporters before they acquired their own homes, had ceased to vote Labour. In that locality the Nationalist candidate polled as many votes at the recent election as did the Labour candidate. The Commonwealth Government would be well advised to proceed with its housing scheme as soon as possible. I assure the Prime Minister that there is a burning anxiety in many parts of the Commonwealth to know when the scheme will be launched. The workers realize that it offers them the only chance they are likely to have of obtaining homes of their own. The State Governments are doing all they can, and are eagerly awaiting the promised assistance of the Federal Government. I cannot see that the launching of such a scheme would encroach on the rights of the States, or would be objectionable as a measure of socialism. </para>
                        <para>On Friday last I mentioned the expenditure of the Defence Department, and I said that because it was small it would probably be pleasing to honorable members of the Opposition, who do not favour a large expenditure on defence. The Inspector-General of our * military forces <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Harry Chauvel)</inline> has just drawn attention to the inadequate provision made for defence, and has urged that more money should be spent in that direction. I do not pose as a military expert, but I venture the opinion that much more money than appears on the Defence Estimates is spent on defence. The cost of making and maintaining roads, for instance, could just as properly be included in defence expenditure as the money spent on ports and harbours. Good roads are essential for defence. </para>
                        <para>I realize that this debate is leading up to a burning subject. In the minds of the public there are three outstanding things that are now receiving the attention of this Government. The first is the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> proposal, the second is the referendum, and the third is the petrol tax. I have heard the question discussed,  ' Is Pratten's petrol proposal protective <inline font-style="italic">V</inline> That question must be answered by this House. I understand that the Prime Minister does not regard the tax as protective; but it appears to me that it .is both protective and revenue producing. Some of the Customs duties agreed to by this Parliament recently were rather high; but even if we regard the petrol tax as purely a protective duty, it is not a high one. If any industry should be' protected, it is that which supplies liquid fuel. While there is peace between the nations, Australia can obtain her requirements of liquid fuel from overseas; but there may come a time when those happy conditions will cease. The tax provides a measure of protection to the shale oil industry. What would be the condition of Australia if supplies of liquid fuel from overseas were withheld ? Australia can supply only about one-tenth of the petrol needed for industrial purposes in this country. In view "of the many attacks made on the Government in connexion with this matter, I was gratified to read in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Baily Telegraph,</inline> last week, an article supporting this tax. It will be useful to open up shale' deposits, even if they are not immediately developed. It has already been ascertained that certain scientific work has to be undertaken before oil shale deposits can be expected to produce on a commercial basis. In view of the need for meeting to some extent our requirements of liquid fuel, the proposed action of the Government appears necessary. When it was stated during the election campaign that the Government, if returned, would spend £10,000,000 to £15,000,000 during the next ten years on road construction, the announcement was rapturously received by country audiences. I do not know whether candidates suggested that the money it was proposed to spend would be obtained from revenue, or whether additional taxation would be imposed in order to meet the cost of the Government's road policy, but any candidate who did not mention the probability of extra taxation did not act honestly. </para>

                                <para>- Any one who did not suggest that additional taxation for the specific purpose of main road construction and maintenance would be imposed misled the electors, as it must have been apparent that insufficient money would be available, unless additional revenue were raised. An extra duty upon petrol to provide money for road construction is the most equitable form of taxation. When taxation matters were under consideration in the New South Wales Parliament two years ago, I was, with others, responsible for holding up, for at least three months, a measure authorizing the collection of taxes based on the weight of motor cars. The Treasurer at that time believed in a tax on petrol being imposed, but said that the imposition of such a tax was a Federal and not a State matter. It will be seen that if a State tax were imposed on, say, petrol or tires in New South Wales, the purchasers of those commodities would obtain their supplies in another State in order to escape the tax. Taxation based upon the weight of a car would be inequitable, as a person who used his car for, perhaps, a short run on a Sunday afternoon would have to pay the same tax as the owner of a car plying for hire, which might perhaps clover hundreds of miles a week. If a petrol tax is imposed, the users of cars will be taxed, in proportion to the extent to which they use the roads. </para>

There are certain persons whom it is hard to convince that the action proposed to be taken is not in their interests. Although more money is now being spent on road construction and maintenance, it is generally admitted that many of our roads are in a worse condition now than they were in 20 years ago, owing largely to the heavy increase in traffic. In the early days, perhaps, only one sulky would pass a given point on a country road every hour, but, to-day, a motor car passes the same place, perhaps, every few minutes. A sulky, travelling about 7 or' S miles an hour, would have little or no effect upon the road, but motors travelling at 20 or 30 miles an hour do considerable damage. The important work of main road construction and maintenance has grown to such dimensions that the State authorities are unable to cope with it, and, consequently, the Federal Government is proposing the imposition of higher petrol duties in order to raise sufficient money to meet the cost. The proposal of the Government, in this connexion, has met with a good deal of opposition, and is unpopular with the press. No Government can afford to be unpopular with the press. </para>

                                <para>- The press is 'largely instrumental in influencing and moulding public opinion. Although the present Government was returned with a larger majority than any other Federal Government, its action, in certain directions immediately caused friction, and, consequently, heat ; but a government would be unworthy of further support if it surrendered to opposition. The referendum proposals, which I intend to support, are being vigorously opposed by the press, which, because of its wide circulation, has a greater influence upon the public mind than the opinions expressed in this Chamber. The Government is only referring the referendum proposals to the people, and is not deliberately attempting to interfere with State rights. Almost every newspaper in Australia is opposing the proposed additional petrol tax, but, in imposing the tax, the Government is giving effect to the policy on which it was elected. I should be willing to consider any other proposal whereby the important work of road construction could be carried out without raising the necessary money in the manner proposed. I cannot, however, understand the attitude of honorable members from Western Australia. Three-fifths of the £15,000,000 to be made available to the States will be distributed on a population basis, and the balance on a territorial basis. If the whole of the amount were divided on a population basis, Western Australia would receive less than £1,000,000, but on the proposed basis of distribution it will get about £2,500,000. The sum of £1,500,000, raised in the eastern States, will be provided for the development of Western Australian roads, and yet opposition to the proposal comes from the western State. </para>

                        <para class="block">Wales adopted towards one another prior to federation was commendable. During the Federal Convention and at the subsequent referendum we in New South Wales were asked to believe that we were about to federate with certain thieves across the border. No doubt, a similar feeling existed in Victoria regarding New South Wales. Consequently the Constitution was framed in an atmosphere of suspicion. Although it may have been suitable for that period, it does not necessarily meet all the requirements of the present time. During the last quarter of a century there has been a great war, and the financial position of Australia has undergone a tremendous change. Twenty five years ago motor cars were practically unknown. Factories have since increased to an enormous extent, and the population, which was then less than 3,000,000, has more than doubled. I do not go so far as to  sav  that I am a unificationist; but whether or not unification is our goal, we are all marching in that direction, and must inevitably continue to do so. The Commonwealth Government is now accused of encroaching upon State rights. Although the cry that State rights should be preserved commanded a good deal of attention in New South Wales ten or twelve years ago, I am inclined to think that a person who took up that theme today would have a small following. I disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Peacock, because I consider that the federal spirit has increased. The boundaries between the various States are now generally regarded as being merely artificial. The interests of the eastern half of Australia are recognized as being similar to those of the western- portion, and any Government that did not legislate along the lines adopted by the present Ministry would receive -short shrift. I intend to vote for the petrol tax, because I supported it on the hustings, and regard it as essential. Nobody likes direct taxation; but I feel sure that after this tax has been in operation for a while its benefit will be realized by all sections. In the United States of America, which is noted for its good roads, motor tires are guaranteed to give four times the mileage obtained in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- It is due to the good highways of that country ; and if the roads of Australia could be improved to such an extent that the mileage of tires was doubled, motorists would have no need to complain of the petrol tax. The mileage varies in different parts of the State in accordance with the quality of the roads. I deplore the necessity for a tax on tires, and I hope that the tire manufacturers in Australia will not look upon it as a protective duty; they are already sufficiently protected under the tariff. The Government might well provide in its proposal that the manufacturers shall not use this tax as a means of obtaining additional protection. </para>

                                <para>- I am prepared to do that, so far as tires are concerned. The petrol tax, however, should be protective to a slight extent to assist local industry. There is no reason why the price of petrol should be raised to any considerable degree; but if the distributors of imported petrol had to pay the extra 2d. a gallon, it would be unfair to them. </para>

                        <para>The present Government has done much in the interests of the primary producers. Some persons even say that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)'</inline> is "running" the Ministry, and that its legislation is all in favour of the primary producer. They now object to the petrol tax as injuriously affecting the primary producer ; but they cannot have it both ways. Practically every primary industry has been assisted under the present administration. Much has been done in the interests of the cotton industry, which is in its infancy. Its prospects in North Queensland are indeed bright. In most of the cotton-growing belts a lack of rain is almost unknown ; but, unfortunately, the growers during the last twelve or eighteen months have experienced a severe drought. That is a bad start for a new industry. The Government is, however, sympathetic towards it; and, no doubt, it will in time be placed on a proper footing. The wool industry was in practically the same situation. Had the wool-growers not received assistance, they would have been in a serious position. In wheat-growing alone we appear to be making progress. Today, wheat is reaped in places where, twenty years ago, it was not thought possible that it would grow. There was a time when it was considered that, with the exception of the area in the vicinity of Perth and Fremantle, Western Australia was practically a desert; but, last month, more wheat was exported from Western Australia than from any other State. Our fruit and wine industries also show promise of development. Those engaged in the dairying industry are to be congratulated on having as Minister for Markets and Migration one so interested in their welfare. The appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Paterson</inline> as Minister for Markets and Migration is very popular in my electorate, where there are numbers of dairy farms. In the dairying industry there is not a 44 hours week, and practically no minimum wage. In order to make a living, not only the dairymen themselves, but their wives and children also have to work long hours. The Dairy Produce Export Control Board, last year, saved the dairy farmers of the Commonwealth at least £20,000 in connexion with marine insurance. Further advantages will no doubt accrue to them from the operations of that board. </para>

                        <para>While I agree that the national debt should be kept as small as possible, I admit that if this country is to be developed, expenditure must be incurred. In connexion with the Northern Territory alone, the Commonwealth has undertaken a big liability. The east- west railway also meant a considerable outlay; and the annual losses on that line are still considerable. These undertakings and other developmental schemes add to the financial burden of the Commonwealth, and necessitate the borrowing of money. In this connexion, the Government is to be commended for having provided for a sinking fund. A considerable increase in the national debt is undesirable. Those who framed the Constitution could not have foreseen the great war, which added £400,000,000 to Australia's national debt. </para>
                        <para>It is unfortunate that the Commonwealth should have departed from the policy of a uniform railway gauge for Australia. Had I been a member of this House at the time, I should have opposed the construction of a 3-ft. 6-in. railway in the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth Government, and the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland are at present engaged in the construction of a railway of 4-ft. 81/2-in. gauge between Kyogle and South Brisbane, which, when completed, will give a railway of standard gauge from Albury to South Brisbane. I should like to see the country between Gippsland and Eden-Monaro served by a railway. At present, the Victorian railway terminates at Orbost, and the New South Wales line at Bombala. Between those places is some fertile country which, for want of railway communication, is still practically "no man's land." A glance at the railway systems of Victoria and New South Wales will show how neglected this portion of the continent is, so far as railway communication is concerned. With proper facilities for transport, the country would be capable of carrying a large population. It would probably have . been better if that area had been included in Victoria, as, apparently, the authorities in New South Wales do not concern themselves about it. There is no need to go to the Northern Territory to find undeveloped land in Australia; this huge tract of country awaits development between Melbourne and Sydney. I suggest that the Government should communicate with the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria with a view to the construction of developmental railways in that portion of the continent. At Twofold Bay, an excellent port exists. About 100 years ago Captain Boyd landed there, and later he expressed the opinion that that port was equal to any on the Australian coast, with the possible exception of Sydney. Believing that a big city would develop there, he invested large sums of money in Eden, but, unfortunately, the government of that time and subsequent governments also concentrated their energies on developing Melbourne and Sydney, with the result that the port of Eden is in practically the same undeveloped state to-day that it was in 100 years ago. Eden possesses not only a good harbour, but also a rich hinterland. A proposal to develop that port was at one time referred to the New South Wales Public Works Committee, but that committee, which recommends only those schemes which show a prospect of immediate success, rejected it. Had the committee been in existence at the time, it is probable that the SydneyBathurst railway would not have been taken across the mountains to open up that fertile country. </para>

He says that we cannot afford to offend the press. The Labour party has always had to fight that section of the press which represents the interests of its wealthy advertisers and supporters, and in spite of this opposition it has been in power in every State and in the Commonwealth, and before long will again be in control of the Commonwealth. Possibly the honorable member remembers the smoke screen of misrepresentation which was thrown out by the press during the last election. History has shown that in nine times out of ten the press represents the views, not of the great masses of the people, but of the wealthier sections of the community. The honorable member said also that he supported financing of the Government's road policy by a petrol tax. We heard nothing about that policy at the election. </para>

                                handling of some important features of Treasury business on this occasion is not to be commended. . . . And the accounts have been presented in so confused a manner that it is only by complicated calculations that the real position can be ascertained. . . . The effect of the manipulation must be to make those who take some pains to study the condition's for themselves more and more suspicious of the bona fides of the Commonwealth's scheme for readjusting Commonwealth and State financial relationships.

                        <para>It is no use continually reminding us that we have a big war debt, the interest of which has to be paid wholly out of taxes. For if the taxpayer had only that burden to carry he would not need to grumble. But, seeing that, since five years ago, the reduction in department running expenses amounts to only £158,000 a year, it is easy to see how the money goes. In 1921 the departments were still inflated by the result of war stalling, which required vast numbers of officials to be engaged at any price for emergency work. Deflation is a very slow process when the departments are costing only such a trifle less than in the peak years. </para>

                                however, hides a surplus of over £2,500,000 with the same care - and success - that an ostrich displays in its traditional ruse to escape from the hunter. He is a little shy about surpluses. If one has too big a surplus the pestilent fellows who pay the taxes ask, "Why not reduce taxation?" and, as all who have studied politics know, to reduce taxation is ultimate torture to all good Treasurers. Reducing Treasurers became extinct with George Turner.

                        <para class="block">It is now about three years since the Commonwealth Government made arrangements with the British Government for the funding of the Australian floating war debt of about £90,000,000, representing payments made by Great Britain on account of the Commonwealth. Shortly afterwards Britain concluded  negotiations  with the United States of America for the funding of her war debt at 3£ per cent., and since America furnished Great Britain with a considerable portion of the money with which she financed Australia's war expenditure, it is obvious that as we have to pay Britain 5 per cent, on our debt of £90,000,000, the British Government is making a profit of lj per cent, on the transaction.

                                <para>- More information should have been furnished in the budget. It is nearly twelve months since the last Federal elections, and Parliament will go into recess again in a week or two. The budget and the Estimates for the next twelve months will be passed, and we shall then go into recess until the Parliament is removed to Canberra. There is some talk of a meeting in January for a month or. two, probably to enable the Government to obtain temporary Supply to carry it over the winter, so that it will be unnecessary to sit at Canberra during the cold months. The Government has proposed an expenditure of £20,000,000 on the building of houses. What is it going to do about that? Where is its scheme for the building of houses? It is twelve months since all these promises were put before the electors, but we have no practical schemes submitted to give effect to them. I can sympathize with the references of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro to the necessity for good roads, because his electorate is' probably worse served in this regard than any other electorate in Australia. I am able to say so, because I travelled over the electorate during the last by-election campaign there. There is a road in the district called the Prince's Highway. but if the Prince is not better as a king than the Prince's Highway is as a road, there will be trouble for the Empire in the future. A tax is to be imposed on petrol to get in some money for the purpose of road construction. In the Eden-Monaro district there are mountains of granite alongside roads over which at present it is dangerous to travel, and there is no reason why the Government should not find employment for many of the thousands who are now unemployed in Australia in the building of good roads in that district. Its scheme for road construction would appear to depend on the use of imported petrol and the amount of revenue which can be derived from the tax proposed upon it. If motorists prefer to use Commonwealth Oil Refineries petrol, there will be no revenue derived from the tax, and no roads will be made by the Commonwealth Government. Three years ago the Prime Minister told the people of England that everything was all right in Australia, and they would do well to come out here. He told them that a commission was appointed to submit a scheme for unemployment insurance. Where is that scheme? The commission is still sitting, and tens of thousands of pounds of the taxpayers' money have been wasted without result. We shall probably receive no report from the commission until the dying hours of this Parliament, and then the Government and its supporters will go to the electors promising that an unemployment insurance scheme will be brought forward. A health commission has been appointed, and what is it doing? </para>

The Treasurer led a political party here a few years ago, and I should like to know what has become of the Country party's policy. Apparently it has been scrapped, also. Honorable members will recall the mighty boast about decentralization, and the intention to establish the factory alongside the primary product. What has the Treasurer done about that? He has put a stranglehold upon State finances, and so has prevented the State. Governments from, carrying out work to bring about decentralization, which, but for his action, they might nave undertaken. The honorable gentleman went about the country with his thirteen points, one of which was decentralization. He delivered a lecture in ray electorate on the question, and some of my people were concerned about it. They thought there was some prospect that something would be done to bring about decentralization. It was thought that rural credits would bo established through the Commonwealth Bank, and money would be made to available to bring the secondary industry and the factory into the district in which the primary product was produced. It was believed that in that way rural centres would be developed ; but we have found the financial arrangements of the Commonwealth conducted in the interests of the Country party's policy of freetrade. </para>

                        <para class="block">I should like to know what the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> has to say to that. He repeatedly told this House that borrowing abroad must stop, because it is detrimental to the development of Australia. The honorable gentleman asserted that Australia must finance herself, but he is now a member of a government that proposes to satisfy its requirements by overseas borrowing. No one can challenge the statement that we can borrow overseas only by importing goods from the countries in which our loans are floated. If we float a loan for £1,000,000 . or £10,000,000, whether in Britain or in America, we can do so only by importing the products of the secondary industries of the country, from which the money is borrowed. Every penny borrowed abroad is so much taken from Australian industries, and, as a result of our borrowing abroad, Australian industries are languishing. That is the policy of the Government, and is in accord with the freetrade policy of the Country party. The Treasurer has said that he is acting upon the advice of private financial experts. I do not know who they are, but I know that private financial experts advised <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> when he was Prime Minister during the war period, that it was impossible to raise a loan of £4,000,000 in Australia. They advised that the financial fabric of the Commonwealth would be destroyed if the attempt were made to float a loan of £4,000,000 or £6,000,000 in Australia, for destructive purposes in 'time of war. It was admitted that we might raise money within Australia in times of peace, for its permanent development and welfare, but the present Government apparently believes that it is necessary to go abroad for money, even for this purpose. Borrowing abroad stifles the policy . of protection. Let no man claim to be a good protectionist if he stands behind a policy of borrowing abroad. The two policies are contradictory </para>

                                <para>- Here is the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> telling us what the Queensland Government is doing; some other honorable member will remind us of what the South Australian Government is doing, and still another will talk of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> and the Workmen's Compensation Act passed by the New South Wales Government. Why do not honorable members opposite give us something off their own bats? The Commonwealth Government, by the action- it has taken in connexion with the Commonwealth Bank, has left the State Governments no other resource but to borrow abroad. They are not in a position to expand credit in Australia; it is only the Commonwealth Government that can do that. It has absolute power over the banks of the country, .and can dictate to' them and to the various financial institutions. It is in a position, through the Commonwealth Bank, to bring other banks and private financial institutions to heel. No State Government possesses any such power. When in 1920 publicity was given through the press to the intention of the then Premier of New South Wales <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Story)</inline> to introduce a Rural Bank Bill, the Commonwealth Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> introduced an amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act, proposing the transfer of the note issue to the bank, and containing a clause the object of which was to give the associated banks and financial institutions of the country the legal right to refuse circulation of credit instruments of the State rural banks. When that legislation was passed, the  chairman  of directors of the Bank of New South Wales said that the rural banks would only be feeders to the private banks, because the Commonwealth Government had made them so. I have said that borrowing abroad stultifies the policy of protection, because it can only be done by permitting the admission of the products of the secondary industries of the countries from which the money is borrowed. The Government that pursues such a policy is a revenue tariff government, and not one prepared to give adequate protection to the industries of this country. </para>

                        <para>By its proposal for the abolition of the <inline font-style="italic">-per capita</inline> payments to the States, the Government proposes to give up all fields of direct taxation. Our Commonwealth direct taxation had to be imposed to meet war expenditure. The Government proposes to give up all direct taxation and intends to run the Commonwealth on the revenue derived from Customs and excise. This proves that it is" its intention to remain a freetrade government, and depend for the financial resources of the Commonwealth on a revenue tariff on imported goods instead of giving effect to the demand of the people for a protectionist policy. A revenue tariff is the most iniquitous means of taxation that could possibly be adopted. The Government proposes to depend upon indirect taxation, which the taxpayer pays without realizing that he is paying it, and to leave all direct and unpopular taxation to the States. </para>
                        <para class="block">It is another instance of the Country party giving effect to its policy, not only of freetrade, but also of surrendering all fields of direct taxation to the States. I am not speaking from the State rights point of view; but I think the future outlook of the Commonwealth will be serious indeed if it evacuates entirely the field of direct taxation and depends for the whole of its revenue on excise and Customs duties. </para>
                        <para>Speaking of the Commonwealth Bank, the Treasurer showed that although for a certain period the bank's profits had declined, they were picking up again. He implied that this was a normal state of affairs ; but, to my mind, the profits of the bank should never have declined. If the institution had not been hamstrung, its profits would have increased. If it had been allowed to compete openly with the associated banks, and to deal direct with the farmers, by the establishment of branches in rural areas, giving overdrafts at lower rates of interest than those charged by the associated banks, not only would our rural industries have been better developed, but the bank itself would have made a much larger profit, to the detriment of the private banks. I want to show what profits were made by these private banks during the period following the war, when, according to the Treasurer, the Commonwealth Bank's profits' necessarily showed a shrinkage. The Commonwealth. Bank having all the resources of Australia behind it, is in a position <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> take risks which other banks dare not take in the peaceful development of the nation. During the war, no doubt, it did its work well; but it was not established by the Labour party to serve the purposes of war. Its founders had in mind the peaceful development of Australia in the interests of the general masses of the people, and not in the interests of a few individuals. It has not been doing the work for which it was founded. Its operations have been so limited by the present administration that it showed a loss during a period when private banks made an enormous profit. In 1919 the associated banks had a paid-up capital of £35,696,940, their reserves amounted to £23,543,496, and their annual dividends totalled £2,492,637. Five -years later, in 1924, their paid-up   capital amounted to £55,496,264, their reserves had increased to £40,384,224, and their annual dividends totalled £5,046,559. Thus, in a period of five years, the associated banks watered their capital to the extent of £20,000,000, and increased their reserves by £17,000,000, while their dividends in one year had increased by £2,500,000. In this period of five years, taking their reserves, watered stock and increased dividends, they actually made £6,000,000 more than the whole of their total capital in 1919, much of which was also watered. These figures make interesting reading. These profits were made at a period when we were called upon to stretch the financial resources of the country to the uttermost in order to keep development going and to keep people employed. Yet the Commonwealth Bank retired from open competition with the private banks, leaving those engaged in secondary and primary industries to contribute heavily to the profits of those institutions. I venture to say that two-thirds of those profits have been drawn from the primary producers, and that to-day there are tens of thousands of those producers in the hands of the banks. At least seven-tenths of the men on the land who are hit by a drought are obliged to approach the private banks for assistance. Let me take the story of a man with a farm worth £5,000, of which he has the fee-simple. </para>

                                <para>- The man who holds the fee-simple of a farm which is worth £5,00.0 goes into the sanctum of the manager of the local branch of a private bank in fear and trembling, and asks for an overdraft of £1,000. If he obtains the accommodation he requires, he delivers to the bank £5,000 worth of securities, but in return the bank gives him nothing but some figures in a book. The farmer does not take from the bank the currency he might get by borrowing from a private individual. He gets a fictitious currency created by means of a cheque book, and for that he has to pay interest at the rate of 8 per cent. The conclusion of the story of this farmer's difficulty is seen in the figures I have given showing the enormous profits made by the associated banks. These institutions are the biggest parasites in the community. When they give overdrafts they give nothing but figures in books. </para>

Honorable members will recollect that when war broke out  the financial advisors of the Fisher Government advised that not more than £4,000,000 could be borrowed in Australia without endangering the whole commercial fabric of the community, and that when the Labour Government issued the " Fisher flimsiest," as they were called, its action was described as frenzied finance. Yet Australia subsequently raised over £200,000,000 by internal loans, and, if necessary, double that amount could have been raised. </para>

                        <para>Now I come to the £15,000,000 in notes issued to the associated banks against securities in London. In his budget speech, dealing with this subject, the Treasurer said - </para>

                            <para>The action of the bank in the crisis of 1924 has sometimes been criticized by those who have not realized the gravity or the complexity nf the situation. They appear to think that the Commonwealth Bank itself could have dealt directly with the producers, instead of promising assistance to the other banks. Such a course was impracticable. To give one reason only, it may be pointed out that, to prevent inflation which might have been permanent, with the consequent lessening of the purchasing power of money, it was necessary that the advances be repaid within a definite short period. This repayment could not have been depended upon in the case of individual advances to producers, but the banks could be so depended upon. </para>

                        <para class="block">The Treasurer's statement is humbug, and would not convince a school boy. If the Commonwealth Bank issued credit to the associated banks on which they operated to finance the producers, it is obvious that the banks could not meet their obligations as borrowers until the producers had met their obligations to them. The Commonwealth Bank could have financed the producers directly, had it not been prevented from doing so by the strangulation policy pursued by the present Government, as a result of which the bank has not as many branches throughout Australia as it should have. In a further statement the Treasurer spilled the whole can of beans, and for his naive admissions he should be sacked from the Treasury. He said - </para>

                            <para>The banks did not avail themselves of their full rights under the arrangement. Actually they borrowed sums which at no time exceeded £2,800,000. They paid interest to the Commonwealth Bank at the Bank of England rate of the day, and they repaid all the advances within a few months. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">Although the associated banks never drew more than £2,800,000 from the Commonwealth Bank they extended their credits on that basis to £15,000,000. In effect, the Commonwealth Bank was functioning in the interests of the associated banks, and against the interests of the nation, particularly the primary producers. They paid interest only from day to day, but from the unfortunate individuals to whom they gave credit they exacted interest for three, six, or twelve months, or for any other arbitrary' terms they chose to fix. Instead of the Commonwealth Bank being utilized by a Country party Treasurer to finance the producers, it gave to private banks the right to draw £15,000,000 against water-logged securities in London, and to pay interest from day to day on a maximum of £2,800,000. The Treasurer knew that that would be the result of the arrangement he made. In moving the second reading of the Commonwealth Bank Bill in 1924, he said, referring to the Commonwealth Notes Board - </para>

                        <para class="block">Even at that early period, when he was forcing the Commonwealth Bank to do something which the Notes Board was disinclined to do, he knew that the private banks would expand their credit upon a very small basis of actual borrowing. A little later in the same speech, dealing with the issue of £10,000,000 in notes to the associated banks against securities in London, he said - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>The result would be, not merely that £10,000,000 had been added to the local currency, but cheque money manufactured by the banks would further add to the means of payment in Australia. . . . We shall be taking only a moderate view of the possibilities if we suppose that the means of payment in Australia were added to by £20,000,000 <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> £25,000,000. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">In those words the Treasurer admitted that cheque pounds are currency. Ten million pounds would grow to £30,000,000 or £40,000,000, but interest would be paid on only such portion of the £10^000,000 as might be required to meet any emergency rush on currency. Primarily the object of this financial arrangement was to finance the primary producers, and facilitate- the marketing of their products overseas, but the primary producers paid heavily for the service they received. If the Commonwealth Bank had been functioning in the interests of the nation, to tide it over a difficult period, and had charged, as it should have done, only bare costs for its services, at least £10,000,000 would have been saved to the primary producers. I come now to the most serious aspect of thi3 business. Here is the evidence of the underground engineering by the associated banks and private financiers. In each of his four budgets, the Treasurer has referred to deflation and the need for reverting to the gold standard. Deflation is as old as banking and the British national debt itself, for it started in 1694, when the Bank of England was founded concurrently with the establishment of the British national  debt. These things always go together - foreign wars, a national debt, and private banks, and they have enslaved most of the nations of the world. The proposal to revert to a gold standard is used as the spieler uses a thimble to cover the pea ; it is, at best, mere cant and humbug. The gold standard is based on the free circulation of gold, and the old law that payment of amounts exceeding £2 may be demanded in gold, amounts under £2 in silver, and amounts under1s. in copper. Notes are issued against a reserve of gold, and the holder of the notes is supposed to be able to demand gold for them. Upon that basis, the Banking Act was erected, and every  banking  crisis has been due to the failure of the gold standard. It  is  impossible to have a gold standard together with a paper currency which is legal tender; the two things are incompatible. If paper currency is legal tender, the holder of the notes cannot demand gold for them. A lot of publicity was given recently to the proposal to reestablish the gold standard by importing gold from America. The absurdity of that talk is proved by the following extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 8th July last : - </para>

            <para>SYDNEY, Wednesday. - The steamer <inline font-style="italic">Sierra</inline> left for San Francisco to-day with £1,000,000 in gold, being the third shipment of Australian gold to be sent to America recently. The steamer <inline font-style="italic">Makura</inline> lifted £1,000,000 worth on 22nd May, and a similar amount was shipped by the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Ventura</inline> on 16th June. </para>
            <para>The shipments have been made through the Commonwealth Bank. Gold has been accumulating in the Commonwealth Bank for some time, and last year the private banks imported gold to the amount of £10,000,000. They have since found that a large portion of the metal was not actually needed for reserve purposes, and have deposited it with the Commonwealth Bank. That institution, acting on. the principle that large holdings of gold were uneconomic, has exported £3,000,000, and has also transferred over £4,000,000 from the banking department to the note issue department. </para>
            <para class="block">We were told that, in order to restore the gold standard, gold must be imported from America, but as soon as we had obtained£10,000,000 worth from that source, there  was  a glut of it, and we are now shipping it back to America. If we return to a gold standard, the position, according to the figures published in the <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> for 1925, would be - Savings Bank deposits, £176,871,477; Commonwealth notes, . £56,890,225 ; bank deposits at call, £106,378,836; fixed deposits at six or twelve months, £133,273,020; making a total of £463,413,558. Against that total there is in Australia £43,914,733 in gold, or barely ten sovereigns for every £100 claim against gold. This expedient of returning to the gold standard was used after the Napoleonic wars, after the civil war in America, and after every war in every country, to double the national debt and increase the power of the private banks and financiers. </para>

                    <para>- That is the point; By deflation and the reversion to the gold standard, the value of bonds is increased. If a bond of a face value of £100 would keep a man for six months in 1918, and the same bond would keep him for twelve months in 1924, its value had doubled. That is the process that occurred after the Napoleonic wars and after the civil war of America, when the United States of America repudiated its greenbacks. At one time £100 on paper was worth only £60 in gold. This policy of deflation and reverting to the gold standard is a danger to the country. We hear much talk of restoring the free export of gold, but the mere lifting of the ban on exports does not mean the restoration of the currency to a gold basis. Gold is not exported as currency, but as bullion; it is exported like any other metal or commodity. I challenge the Treasurer, or any person who regards himself as a financial expert, to say where, in national finance, safety ends and inflation begins. With finance and currency controlled as they are at present, no one can say how much currency is needed per head of the population. To state it in another way, no one can say when a country has ceased to be financially safe and when it is suffering from inflation of currency. It may be said that the fluctuation of prices is an indication. Admittedly it is ; but it is impossible to draw a clear line of demarcation between safe finance and inflation. 'Since the establishment of private banks, and the evolution of the cheque system, no government has controlled currency. Ninety-five  per .cent, of the currency is represented by cheque pounds, .which, when judged by all known currency laws, are spurious and base. But there has been no inflation in the issue of Commonwealth notes. Let me now come back to more orthodox tests, for, up to the present, I have been enunciating doctrines that some honorable members may regard as unorthodox. We have been told that huge inflation has taken place. We may judge whether that is so by the only law by which it can be judged, namely, the substance at the back of the note issue in comparison with the prices of commodities. If we take 100 as the index figure of the cost of living in 1914, we find that the figure for 1920, which was the peak year after the war, was 295. In 1914, the Commonwealth notes were backed by 42.90 per cent., and in 1920 by 41.54 per cent., of gold, a difference of only 1.36 per cent. Can the Treasurer contend that a difference of 1.36 per cent, in the gold backing of Australian notes, between the years 1914 and 1920, accounted for the increase in prices indicated by the figures 100 and 295? But, when we consider the inflation of manufactured cheque pounds, we see where the cause lies. In 1914, the associated banks held legal currency to the amount of £21,341,026, and they manufactured cheque pounds to the face value of £115,507,210. In 1920, they held £20,704,097 of legal currency, and they manufactured cheque pounds to the face value of £160,693,541. Obviously, the Commonwealth note was not responsible for the inflation in the year when inflation and high prices were most marked; but the associated banks, with £750,000 less of legal currency increased credit expansion by £45,186,331. Inflation to-day, as in the past, is brought about by the manipulation of manufactured cheque pounds by the associated banks, which receive all . the profits. The clearing house returns also provide an indication of how the associated banks have inflated the currency. In .1914, the clearing house returns, for the capital cities, were £807,695,000, when the legal currency  was £21,000,000;  but, in 1920, the clearing house returns were £1,896,860,000, an increase of £1,089,165.000 over the year 1914. Those are the figures that indicate the enormous increase in the paper instruments of credit created by the associated banks - credits which are exchanged for the commodities of life, and enter into the transactions of trade and commerce. There was an enormous increase of £45,000.000 in the cheque pounds, and an increase of £1,089,000,000 in the clearinghouse exchanges of the nation; but, behind the banks, there was only £20,000,000 of legal currency. In the days of despots, the issuing "of legal currency was the prerogative of the Crown, but as the despot has been dethroned, and democracy has taken his place, that prerogative has passed to the government; We know what happened when  monarchs  held the prerogative. We know what' happened under the Bourbons of France, and Henry VIII. and James II. of England. There were business failures, unemployment, starvation, and suicide; and all those things are threatened by the wholesale usurpation by private banking institutions of the instruments of credit. The figures I have quoted show a species of jugglery that should make the world's greatest fakir turn green with envy. </para>

                <para>I do not wish to approach the subject of the rural bank in a party spirit; but I regret, with other honorable members on this side, that the Government has not done more to make that bank something of which this Parliament can feel proud. Australia cannot indefinitely develop its primary industries and neglect its secondary industries;, both must be developed concurrently. The bank should have been used, as the Treasurer said it would be used, to assist both secondary and primary industries. All countries that have elected to rely mainly on rural and pastoral development have remained as serf nations to the more highly developed industrial nations. It is possible to go too far in promoting rural development. We can produce too many primary products for our markets 12,000 miles away. Side by side with the development of primary production we should distribute the population more widely over the country by establishing secondary industries in country centres. We should also develop our mineral deposits, particularly coal and iron. Very few country towns in Australia can boast of a factory. To bring 10,000 more migrants to develop the rural industries of this country will overload those industries. A country must develop in two ways - it must rest on a basis of scientific primary production, and it must possess large secondary industries engaged in mass production. The Rural Bank of New South Wales, hamstrung as it is by the amending Commonwealth Bank Act, introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook in 1920, is doing more than the so-called Rural Bank of the Commonwealth for the primary producers. The Treasurer has told us that rural credits would bring about decentralization ; the factory would be taken to the primary producer, and rural centres would become hives of industry by the waving of his fairy wand. But, alas ! All we see is this puny rural bank, which is left to starve, because the food on which it should thrive is eaten by the private banks. Although it was said that, in establishing the Commonwealth Bank, the Labour party was embarking upon a policy of frenzied finance, and that the issue of Fisher's " flimsiestt " would bring about financial chaos and ruin, the bank to-day is an institution of which the Labour party is proud. It will, however, never be the success its founders intended whilst it is used only as a hireling of the associated banks, in whose interests it is now functioning instead of operating on behalf of the nation. We shall always be confronted with pressing problems and financial stringency while we have to submit to budgets such as this and we have a government which depends upon Customs and excise revenue to enable it to carry out its policy. There is nothing in the budget worthy of commendation, and the successful development of our primary and secondary industries and the financial stability of the Commonwealth cannot be assured until the Labour party is in control of the Treasury. </para>

                <para>I should like to deal at length with the proposed abolition of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments to the States, the referendum proposals and the imposition of additional Customs duties in order to provide sufficient funds for the construction and maintenance of main roads; but as we shall have an opportunity to consider those subjects later, I shall occupy the limited time at my disposal in referring to the Government's proposals in connexion with the payment of a bounty on seed cotton. It will be seen, from the Treasurer's budget speech, that the Government propose to pay a bounty of11/2d. per lb. on raw seed cotton, although, after an exhaustive examination, the Tariff Board recommended a bounty of 2d. per lb. For the information of honorable members, I propose to submit some particulars concerning the development and possibilities of the cotton industry, which has recently been developed in Queensland, and to a limited extent in New South Wales. Following upon the shortage of cotton during the war, and realizing the urgent need for the Empire to be self-supporting in this and other essential commodities, a search was made by the cotton spinning interests of Great Britain to ascertain the most suitable country within the. Empire in which superior, long-stapled cotton could be produced. After an exhaustive investigation, the sub-tropical areas and forest lands of Queensland were considered to be the most suitable for the establishment of the long-stapled cotton industry, and in that State the industry has been developed. The BritishAustralian Cotton Association which was then formed has spent a considerable sum of money in erecting ginneries and in developing the industry in Queensland and in the northern part of New South Wales. For some years the Commonwealth and the governments of the cotton producing States entered into an arrangement under which the price of seed cotton was guaranteed, based on a system of grading, under which the industry has been established, particularly in Queensland, where about 95 per cent. of Australian-grown cotton is produced. In order to give honorable members some idea of the extent to which the seed cotton production in Australia has increased I quote the following figures :  - </para>
                <para class="block">
                    <graphic href="114331192607203_18_0.jpg" />
                </para>
                <para class="block">It is estimated that this season there will be between 7,000 and 8,000 growers engaged in supplying ginneries with cotton, whilst the area cultivated will be approximately 40,000 acres. Seed cotton production is of particular importance to Australia, because it provides for further development in sub-tropical areas which are as yet very sparsely populated. The cotton plant has great drought-resisting capacity once the seed has germinated and the young plants have become established. Many mixed' farmers whose maize and other crops have been ruined by drought have been saved from financial disaster by the small returns derived from their cotton area, which has withstood the drought. Poultry and pig farmers also supplement their incomes by growing small areas of cotton. There will be no danger for many years of overproduction of seed cotton of the superior staple and grade now grown in Australia, which is in marked contrast to the position in relation to crops of certain hard and soft fruits. Cotton probably enters more largely into articles required for human needs than any other commodity. Over £13,000,000 worth of cotton goods are imported annually, and if the seed cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton textile manufacture industries could be effectively established in Australia, a very large proportion of the £13,000,000 worth of goods imported could be made in Australia, thus giving employment to approximately 20,000 workmen, representing sustenance for, say, 80,000 persons. The significance of this industry may be gauged from the following facts. In the matter of defence, cotton is necessary for the manufacture of cordite, without which no rifle can bc fired or big gun discharged. It enters into the manufacture of motor tyres to a greater extent even than rubber, and for either peace or war motor transport it is indispensable. Cotton covers the widest field in the textile industry, as it is used in the manufacture of the coarsest cotton canvas and of the finest muslin. It forms the basis of the artificial-silk industry. It is the raw material of the knitted 'underwear and hosiery industry. It is used in the woollen manufactories. Its byproducts are used by the margarine and soap makers. It provides the dairyman and poulterer with a valuable stock food. To the  paper maker  it will supply a high-class pulp. Bedding manufacturers, the upholsterers, and motor-car body builders use the waddings made from cotton waste and the lower grades. There is scarcely an industry, and certainly not a home" into which cotton in some form or other is not used. From- <inline font-style="italic">Chemistry and Industry,</inline> of the United States of America, I quote the following statement to illustrate the importance of this new industry :-  . </para>
                <para>If I were asked "What won the war"? I would unhesitatingly answer, " The cotton plant." Let us consider for a moment some of the things the cotton plant contributed. The four outstanding things required by a soldier in any war are food, clothing, housing and ammunition. Second only in importance to the nitrogenous foods for soldiers are the fats that they must have. Most of the lard consumed by our armies, was compound lord, made from cotton-seed oil.' Much of the butter they ate was oleomargarine, of which cotton-seed oil was the principal component. The dairy products and meat which they consumed came from cattle largely fed with cotton-seed meal and hulls. Much of the clothing of our soldiers was made of cotton. Their hats were made of felt, a product of cotton linters. The buttons <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> their uniforms, when not metal, were celluloid, also a product of cotton liners. The artificial leather used in their equipment was made from cotton liners, and the real leather came from cattle which were fed on cottonseed meal and hulls. The tents which covered our soldiers were made of cotton, the mattresses upon which they slept were stuffed with cotton, and their bedclothes were either made from cotton or from wool of sheep which were fed to a large extent on cotton-seed meal. The basis of ammunition, or explosives, was cellulose and  glycerides,  one coming from cotton linters and the other from cotton oil. This was such an important factor during the World War that the War Department took over all the cotton-seed oil mills and operated them under licence. Can you find one single source that contributed so much to the welfare of our soldiers as the cotton plant ? It may not have won the war, but we certainly could not have won without it. The cotton seed produces four main products : the linters, meal, hulls, and oil. A <inline font-style="italic">résumé</inline> of the history of the cottonseed products industry will show that within a space of half a century the chemist has developed from this little insignificant seed sixteen principal commercial products and hundreds of minor ones. </para>
                <para>To-day there' are hundreds of millions of dollars invested in plants using the cotton seed as a raw material, and this is the second largest manufacturing industry in the southernStates. It is not, however, confined to the southern States, for most of the large refineries producing the finished products are located in the big cities of the east and middle west. Hundreds of chemists have made this little cotton seed their life study, and it is entirely through the science of chemistry that the industry has been developed. . </para>
                <para class="block">With your permission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I propose to hand in for inclusion in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a list of the principal products made from cotton seed. </para>

Having carefully perused the Tariff's Board report, I have no hesitation in saying that at least during the limited time that I have been a member of this Parliament, no more comprehensive report on any industry has been presented by it. But the Minister refused to accept its recommendation. I do not find fault with him on that account, since he has a right to his own opinion on the matter ; but I strongly object to the grounds on which he based his contention that a bounty of l1/2d. a lb. was adequate.  His  contention that a bounty of 11/2d. a lb. on cotton yarn, where 50 per cent. of the yarn used in the manufacture of fabrics was made from cotton grown in Australia or Papua, would increase the demand for, and therefore the price of, seed cotton, thus making the bounty of11/2d. equivalent to that of 2d. a lb. recommended by the Tariff Board, and sufficient to ensure the early permanent development of this new primary industry cannot be sustained. </para>

                        <para>- The inference was that the Government substantially approved of the recommendation of the board, as the same result would be achieved, because of the increased demand for the primary product, and also because of the development in the secondary industry. I have had an opportunity of discussing this aspect of the subject with expert accountants, and they assure me that there is no prospect of the pious hope of the Minister being realized, at any rate, within the first three years of the operation of the bounty. At a later stage I propose to ask the Minister to provide a bounty of 2d. a lb. on seed cotton for the first three years. With the experience gained at the end of that period, it could then be determined whether the industry would be in a sufficiently strong position to carry on with a reduced bounty. The Government has given considerable help to the woollen industry, and as the result of generous tariff assistance, many new mills have been established, affording increased employment. I am at a loss to know _ why a similar measure of assistance is not being given to the cotton industry. If an adequate bounty is provided for the first three years this industry will prosper; but if it is forced to attempt to subsist on the present bounty there is no prospect of its success. It seems to me that, if the bounty is to be less than 2d. a lb. during the first few years, the inevitable result will be that less cotton will be produced and the industry will gradually pass out of existence. This will mean that the expenditure of, possibly, over £500,000 by way of bounty will be wasted, and those engaged in the industry ruined. The net return to the grower on the present world's parity for cotton lint would be about 2d., exclusive of the bounty. Supposing the lint market recovers so as to return seed cotton-growers 2$d., the bounty of l$d. would increase the grower's return to 4d. a lb., which is £d. less than the guaranteed price he received, during last season. The Tariff Board based its recommendation on the fact that the Liverpool parity at that time was slightly over lOd. a lb. To-day the price has fallen to between 8d. and  8¼d.  a lb., which proves that the claim for a bounty of 2d. a lb., which was recommended by the board, is now more than ever justified. The strongest possible argument can be advanced for fixing, the bounty at at least 2d. a lb in the early and difficult years of the industry. Obviously the Ministry is satisfied that the industry is important enough to deserve encouragement; but it is necessary; if it is to be successful, to promote increased production in both the primary and secondary cotton industries. The Government is wise in combining two aspects of cotton production by giving a bounty on seed cotton and cotton yarn; but a further step is necessary, namely, a scientific scale of duties will even be required on all imported cotton apparel and fabrics, if the industry is to be permanently established, and Australia's interests properly conserved. To-day the ginneries are working only at 25 per cent, of their full capacity. If the production were substantially increased, the overhead charges would be proportionately reduced. If it granted an adequate bounty in the initial stages, the Government could possibly reduce it after three or four years without crippling the industry. </para>

                        <para>- Both in primary and secondary industries, increased efficiency comes with experience. It should be remembered that the last five years of the cotton industry have been almost entirely experimental and devoted to testing Australian conditions and the best types of cotton. It may be said that the industry is only now in a position to really proceed on well-defined lines. Last season was the first in which a full supply of Durango seed - the best type for Australian conditions thus far discovered - could be made available to growers. It may well be asked what other industry has achieved, or could be reasonably expected to achieve, success and efficiency in so short a time as the cotton industry has had, especially in such unfavorable conditions, viz., the falling in world's prices which have obtained. It has also to be remembered that an entirely new primary industry has to adjust itself to strange conditions of climate and soil, and that a much longer period is necessary to achieve sound results in such a primary industry than would be necessary in any secondary industry. There can be no doubt as the quality of the cotton produced in Australia. According to a press cable from London last week,  Colonel Evans,  late Director of Cotton Culture in Queensland, has borne testimony to that fact, which is also supported by the uniformly high premiums brought by Australian lint in Liverpool, as compared with American lint. Regarding the bounty on cotton yarn, it is proposed that 50 per cent. of the lint used shall be of Australian or Papuan origin. I believe that when the local industry is firmly established, it may be able to supply 75 per cent. of the requirements for yarn by means of a lint of the right staple grade and textile strength. I urge, therefore, that the provisions of the measure be made sufficiently elastic to allow of that alteration. I notice that the Minister stated, in effect, that the desired bounty of 2d. a lb. on seed cotton was equal to 50 per cent. of the cost of production in Australia. He suggested that that was, therefore, excessive. But what do we find is the position in regard to other primary industries ? The Australian production cost of jam is 61/2d. per lb., and the tariff 3d. per lb., equal to 46 per cent. Canned fruits cost 9s. a dozen tins. The tariff is 8s. 6d. a dozen tins, or 94 per cent. Raisins cost 31/2d. a lb. to produce. The tariff of 3d. per lb. is equivalent to 85 per cent. of the cost. In the case of dried fruits, which cost 4d. per lb. to produce, the tariff, being 4d. per lb. also, represents 100 per cent. The duty on hops is £112 a ton, which is approximately 100 per cent. of the Australian cost of production. The duty considered necessary to protect many of our secondary industries is frequently more than 50 per cent. Why should the same percentage of protection be excessive in the case of cotton? </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Every Queensland member has been nearly snowed under with communications from anxious growers on this question. There is no prospect of the industry succeeding unless a bounty of at least 2d. per lb. is granted. I am firmly of the opinion that if this industry is encouraged in its early stages, it will, in time, do for Australia what wool has done in the past. But if the Government is not prepared to grant greater assistance now, it will not develop. In September last, Parliament agreed to the duty on sewing cottons and threads being 25 per cent. British, and 35 per cent. general. As a result, the British </para>

                <para class="block">Thread Mills Limited, of Leicester, England, has floated a company in Australia, and is now asking for an additional capital of £150,000 to enable it to manufacture in the Commonwealth the whole of Australia's cotton and cotton thread requirements, valued at £750,000 per annum. If similar duties were imposed on other classes of cotton goods, additional factories would be established in Australia, with the result that the Australian seed cotton industry would be so assisted as to make it possible for the bounty of 2d. per lb. to be reduced, or even discontinued. Seeing that the Tariff Board based its recommendation on a world's parity of10d. per lb., and that the price of seed cotton to-day is only 8d. per lb., I cannot understand the Minister's unwillingness to grant a bounty of 2d. per lb. If, for a period of three years a bounty of 2d. per lb. on seed cotton were granted, this new industry would be permanently established in Australia. The position could then be reviewed. On the other hand, to strangle the industry almost at its birth, would mean not only the loss of the money paid by way of bounty, but also the ruin of the industry and those engaged in it. I urge the Government to agree to a bounty of 2d. per lb. for three years, after which, possibly, it could be gradually reduced to l1/2d. per lb., or less. That would establish the industry in Australia, and at the same time assist in the development of this great country. </para>

                    <para>.- No financial statement ever presented to this House has been subjected to such adverse criticism and scathing condemnation as has that presented by the ' Treasurer recently. Instead of support, there is an almost universal feeling of contempt both for the Treasurer and his budget. No political party is prepared to champion the Treasurer's proposals. Reliable financial authorities have stated that, in their opinion, the budget has been ' ' doctored ' ' to present the case for the Commonwealth in the best light, and that for the States in the worst light possible. The Treasurer's attitude towards the States is surprising. He does not treat them fairly. The Government's policy, if carried out, will mean serious loss to the States. The statement that it is intended to surrender certain forms of taxation to the States is illusory. At the Premiers' Conference it was stated that the Commonwealth intended to vacate certain fields of taxation. In this connexion the taxation of the incomes of individuals was specifically mentioned. The Treasurer's proposals, which included the discontinuance of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, were based on the assessments for 1924-25;. The State Treasurers challenged his figures; they also contended that the basis of the proposals was unsound. </para>

                        <para>- The figures relating to taxation in respect of companies were also misleading. They were based on the receipts for 1924-25, and, therefore, were not a fair basis, because in that year no allowance was made for depreciation, or for stock and plant. Surely it is obvious that revenue from this source is steadily diminishing. </para>

                        <para>- I doubt if the Treasurer did himself justice at the conference.  His  figures were misleading. The State Premiers were quite justified in objecting to the proposals of the Commonwealth Government. A few days after the conference alternative proposals were submitted by the Government,  not to the Premiers of the several States, but to this House. Ordinary courtesy demanded the submission of those proposals to the Premiers for review before they were presented to this House as a definite portion of the Government's policy. </para>

                        <para>- Of course he does. This policy is only an indirect method of relieving certain interests of their obligations in regard to taxation. The Government is endeavouring to make the people believe that if the Commonwealth vacates this field of taxation the States will be able to make good the loss of revenue by the introduction of legislation ; but as I have shown, they will be unable to induce the Legislative Councils to pass it. </para>

                        <para>- As the Upper Houses are constituted in South Australia, Western Australia, and Victoria, it will be impossible to pass land tax legislation that will return to the States sufficient revenue to make good the loss of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. The right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> the other night furnished convincing proof of that. He told us that when he was Premier of Victoria he endeavoured to get the Legislative Council of that State to accept a proposal on similar lines. The Government's proposal is not on an equitable basis, and will not bear inspection. There is no reason why the Government should act hastily. We have been told that there will be a special session at Canberra next year to consider certain amendments of the Constitution. As the financial relationship of the Commonwealth and the States is of vital importance to the States, and as it raises constitutional issues, the whole subject could very well be postponed for consideration at the proposed special session. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. It would be of advantage if a committee representing all parties in. this House conferred with the Premiers of the various States upon those issues that are so vital to the States. If we extended this courtesy to the .States, and if they were given a reasonable opportunity to consider taxation proposals to compensate them for revenue which they will lose owing to the withdrawal of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, in all probability good ' would result. No hint of the Government's pro&gt;posal . was given to the people at the recent elections, ' and it was unworthy of Ministers to suddenly submit a scheme for the adjustment of the' financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States which is calculated to -create chaos and confusion in the realm's of - State finance. One of the most far-reaching and vita] proposals that could' be submitted' for- the adjustment of Commonwealth and State financial relations has been introduced in the first ses.sion of a new Parliament, and the State Governments and Parliaments which are «o deeply concerned have been given no reasonable opportunity to review it. In view-.'of 'the unreliable . figures submitted  to them by  the' Treasurer, the State Premiers have every justification for their t50m plaint that they have not "been fairly treated ;by' the Commonwealth Government. I . hope that wiser counsels will prevail-. ' The Government should realize  that  'it' is its duty to deal fairly by the State 'Governments. The Commonwealth and State Governments represent the same citizens, and as the future prosperity and progress of the States is closely linked with those of the Commonwealth, the Government would do well to review or postpone the operation of its proposal for the abolition of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments to the States. The Government can find no excuse for the proposed exercise of a supreme power  in  this matter other than the contention that it is unreasonable that any authority should enjoy the expenditure of funds which it does not itself raise. That is the one ground upon which the Treasurer might attempt to justify his action. But if the honorable gentleman puts that forward as his chief reason for a re-adjustment of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, his insincerity . requires no further proof than the statement of the fact that at the present moment the Government proposes by the imposition of special taxation to raise moneys which it intends to hand over to the State Governments for road construction, which is essentially a duty, 'not of the Commonwealth, but of the State Governments. A more substantial reason than any which have so far been advanced is necessary to justify a proposal which has caused serious concern to the State Governments as to the sources from which revenue to carry out their undertakings is to be derived. The State authorities should be left to work out the destinies of their respective States in their own way. They should not be expected to come as mendicants to the Federal authority for financial assistance. The Government's proposal must have the effect of- lowering the financial standing of the States abroad, and in this respect it must be regarded as invidious and unfair. </para>

The policy of the South Australian Government has been seriously interfered with because a Commonwealth agency has declined to pay to the South Australian treasury revenue collected by it, but rightly due to the State. The Commonwealth has no more right than has a private individual to collect taxation under the law of a State and not pay it over to the State Treasury. The State Government could obtain redress against a private individual in a court of law. but the Commonwealth Government is apparently immune in that regard. It has no right to take advantage of its position to deprive a State of revenue which is justly due to it. </para>
                <para>It must be somewhat disturbing to honorable members to note that for the current year the Treasurer estimates that the Customs revenue will amount to £40,500,000, an increase of £1,301,117. Less than twelve months ago we revised the tariff in the belief that it would give added protection to our industries,' and not with the idea of producing extra revenue. </para>

                <para>Another matter which is causing some anxiety is the' intention of the Commonwealth Government to get out of certain fields of direct taxation which were entered with the idea of helping to pay for our war obligations. Until we have fully met our obligations in regard to the war I do not think we are justified in doing so. The State Legislative Councils are' not likely to impose those forms of direct taxation which were designed by the Commonwealth to fall mainly on the wealthy classes of the community. The effect will be that instead of the wealthy paying their just due to help to meet our war obligations, the greater portion of the burden will" fall on the shoulders of the poor. We laid it down definitely during the war that the Commonwealth's direct taxation should take a certain form, and I certainly resent a proposal which can only have the effect of relieving the wealthy of their rightful obligation to take a fair share of the burden of the cost of the war, and transfer it by means of Customs taxation to the shoulders of those who can least afford to pay it. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins)</inline> has reiterated the statement - which I am afraid from the number of times it has been said here is likely to become the accepted truth - that honorable members of the Labour party had little or no hand in the introduction of invalid and old-age pensions.

The speech in which he supported his motion was temperate and telling, albeit he said some severe things about the attitude of the States towards the subject. When he was called upon by interjections to say how the money was to be provided, he wisely replied that if he formulated a scheme he would be accused of dictating to the Government.  His  contention was that such a measure had been demanded by the people on grounds of common humanity, had been promised by the Ministry, and should not be neglected another day. The Prime Minister was suave and approving. </para>

                <para>I turn now to a matter that caused some heat in this committee last week, and was responsible for a display of bitterness on the part of the Treasurer and the Attorney-General. The ebullition of temper, when endeavouring to protect the Government against the very effective" attack made by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> in regard to the non -collection of land tax on Crown leaseholds, reflected little credit upon them. The Treasurer said that he thought the matter was dead and buried; no. doubt the wish was father to the thought. He said an old ghost had been resurrected ; but I warn him that, so long as he remains in public life, his maladministration of the Land Tax Act will continue to be a skeleton in his political cupboard. He will not be allowed to forget his action in allowing certain wealthy pastoralists to escape their obligations to the Commonwealth. The allegations made by the honorable member for Yarra have not been answered by Ministers; indeed, the Government cannot answer them. It referred the matter to a royal commission, and the Prime Minister declared that the terms of reference were as wide as possible. I shall prove to the committee that that statement was not correct, and that the terms of reference upon which Judge Edwards conducted his inquiry did not fairly represent the charges made by the  honorable member for Yarra.  His  speech was wilfully distorted, certain portions of it were torn from their context, and it was impossible for the royal commissioner to give judgment upon the charges actually made by the honorable member against the Government.

                        <para>- The honorable member for Yarra made definite charges against the Treasurer. Inevitably, the name of the commissioner of taxation was introduced; but the charge was against the ministerial head of the department, who must always be held responsible for the doings of his subordinates. Judge Edwards ruled that, under the terms of the agreement, he could not inquire into the reasons why land taxes owing on Crown leases had not been collected, although they represented 75 per cent. of the total land taxes shown in the budget as outstanding. The amount of land tax outstanding was £2,114,914, of which 75 per cent. was due in respect of Crown leases. The honorable member for Yarra charged the Government with having failed to collect those arrears, and he demanded to know the reason for the omission; but the commissioner declared himself so limited by the terms of reference that he could not investigate that most important phase of the subject. Had he been given a free hand the Government would not have come out of the inquiry with a clean re cord. It would have been been convicted of an improper patronage of certain wealthy interests. He also held that he could not inquire into the statements in the speech other than those contained in the passages selected for him by the Government. The judge was asked to give a decision on a number of extracts from the speech, and that is all he did. Extract No. 4 submitted to the judge reads - </para>

                        <para>- It is quite evident that I am touching a vital spot, but the facts are against the Treasurer, who, if he refreshes his memory, will find that he cannot substantiate his statement. The table which I intend to quote will prove that the statements of the honorable member for Yarra were correct, but that owing to the clever and deceptive manner in which the Government restricted the terms of reference they could not be fully inquired into. The commissioner was asked to report whether " it was owing exclusively," but as the word " exclusively " was not used by the honorable member for Yarra, the commissioner was able to submit a report which was favorable to the Government, but which, unfortunately, does not deal with the accusations against the Treasurer. </para>

It is needless, therefore, to ask if any discrimination was shown on this phase of the question, which was also wilfully distorted by the Government in its terms of reference. The evidence of departmental officers, and extracts from files read to the commission by these witnesses proved conclusively that discrimination had been shown in the treatment of different taxpayers For example, contrast the rigorous manner in which the law was enforced against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Browne, of Werribee, with the leniency shown to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman. For six years Browne failed to lodge his land-tax returns, and was fined each year.  His  fines aggregated £134, in addition to penalties imposed for the payment.  His  tax did not average more than £12 per annum. Kidman failed to lodge land-tax returns for seven years, and was not prosecuted until the scandal was exposed in August, 1924, when he was then prosecuted for one year, and fined £10. Browne was fined in the same year by the same magistrate £40, but in his case the department pressed for a heavy penalty. When Browne's returns were not in by the due date each year, he was sent a reminder, then a final notice, which was followed shortly after by a summons. How differently Kidman was treated was revealed by tie correspondence and departmental minutes on the land-tax file. Repeated requests were made for the lodgment of returns. There were " final demands," appeals, threats, more " final demands," more threats and appeals, and so on, for seven years. For the information of the committee I may state that from the year 1922, when this Government came into office, until the 6th September, 1923, the records taken from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman's file disclose the following: - 31st March, 1922. - Departmental Minute - "No returns have been lodged since that for 1916-17." 31st March, 1922. - "Taxpayer's agent, John Jolly, has on several occasions promised to furnish returns, but has not done so." 1917-18, 1918-19, 1919-20, 1920-21, and ' 1921-22 returns. 13th May, 1922. - Departmental Minute - " 1921-22 returns not yet furnished. Reminder sent. Seven days allowed." 13th Juno, 1922. - Departmental Minute - " What action should be taken to obta"in return, please?" 19th June, 1922. - "Have final demands sent." 0th July, 1922. - Final demand sent to Jolly as agent for Kidman. 1st August, 1922. - " Is there any reason why taxpayer should not be prosecuted for consistent failure to furnish returns 1917-18 <inline font-style="italic">et seq."</inline> 4th August, 1922. -  Deputy  Commissioner reports to Commissioner and advises proceedings to be taken. 7th August, 1922. - Commissioner wrote to Kidman. 10th February, 1923. -  Deputy  Commissioner asks Commissioner for a reply to letter of 4th August, 1922. 10th February, 1923. - Departmental Minute - "The Commissioner is writing to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman direct, threatening proceedings." 2nd March, 1923. - Commissioner writes to Kidman and says that as returns not lodged no alternative but to prosecute. 19th March, 1923. - Commissioner instructs  Deputy  Commissioner to take action. </para><para class="block">Returns wanted for 1917-18 to 1922-23. 16th April, 1923. -  Deputy  Commissioner instructs  Deputy  Commissioner, Adelaide, to prosecute for 1922-23, and says can only prosecute for this year as twelve months having elapsed in respect of other years prosecution is barred. 28th August, 1923. - Departmental Minute - Assistant Commissioner has made certain arrangements with Kidman. Wire Adelaide to please hold up all action." 4th September, 1923. -  Deputy  Commissioner, Adelaide - " I requested <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ford,</inline> who is a responsible employee in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman's  Adelaide office, to interview me. ... He emphasized that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jolly</inline> had a difficult task, in that until last three years <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman kept no systematic records. A list of his land and other securities did not exist, and it would be a tremendous task to locate all his various interests." 6th September, 1923. -  Deputy  Commissioner reports to Commissioner, and quotes the above reasons for delay. The memorandum goes on - " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jolly</inline> advances these arguments as reasons for delay. . . . The onus, is on taxpayer to incur the necessary expense for professional assistance to enable him to comply with the law as is insisted on with other taxpayers. Reviewing the whole, situation, it is patent that the requisitions of the department have been ignored. ... In my opinion, the adoption of a <inline font-style="italic">laissez faire</inline> policy resulting in continued failure of taxpayer to supply necessary information and returns required amounts to defiance of the department." </para><para class="block">Defiance by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman! Notwithstanding that, the Commissioner of Taxation stated in a report that he had interviewed <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman, and had the distinct impression that that gentleman had no desire to defy the department. Time will not permit me to place all the facts on record, but on the 22nd August, 1924, three days after the charges had been made by the honorable member for Yarra, final action was taken against <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman, who was then prosecuted. It is clear that the charges made by the honorable member have been proved up to the hilt. It is also clear that by manipulating the terms  of reference to the judge, whose only desire was to do what was right, the Government prevented him from reviewing the whole of the charges. The Government is now using the Commissioner's report in an endeavour to clear its record, which is as black as the ace of spades. In an impartial court the action of the Government would not bear investigation. The Ministry stands condemned on the charges levelled against it by the honorable member for Yarra, when they are considered in conjunction with the matters contained in the supporting documents that were made available to him, but were not included in the terms of reference. I leave the public to judge between the honorable member and the Treasurer. Every fair-minded citizen will recognize that the honorable member has rendered a great public service in revealing the misdeeds of the Government in trying to protect wealthy land-owners from taxation and ruthlessly prosecuting small taxpayers. </para></speech>

                    <para>. - I feel some diffidence in speaking on such an important subject as the budget; but since we have had many illuminating criticisms upon it by honorable members opposite, I venture to offer a few comments. It is apparent that should the political millennium arrive, and honorable members opposite come into power, there will be no lack of aspirants for the office of Treasurer, since quite a number of them claim to be capable df dealing with public finance. I regret that the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> spoilt his speech by hinting that the learned judge who presided over the inquiry into the charges made by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> was to a certain extent biased in his decisions because of the terms of reference to the royal commissioner. We had some heavy salvoes from the honorable member for Werriwa (Mir. Lazzarini), and between the volleys I was able to gather from him the interesting information that a bank overdraft is simply a number of figures in a book, and the overdraft does not materialize! I regret to say that that has not been my experience. If one borrows money from a bank by way of an overdraft granted on approved securities, and after, for instance, buying a number of sheep, makes payment by cheque, one finds that the person to whom the cheque is paid is able to cash it, and so turn the overdraft into concrete figures. In common with the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins),</inline> I pay tribute to the honorable member for Yarra for his excellent speech. I shall not go so far as that honorable member did, and say to him, " Come over here;" but if in the whirligig of politics the honorable member should come into office, he will certainly discharge his duties as a Minister with ability, dignity, and moderation. There has been a great deal of " blowing off of steam " in this so-called budget debate. Although nearly three days have been devoted to it, not one-third of that time has been spent in actual criticism of the budget itself. Honorable members have wandered far and wide, and the Opposition apparently, not finding much in the budget to criticize, have resurrected the ghost of the so-called land tax scandal. When the last election campaign was in progress, I was considerably concerned to find that Gunnedah, a town in my electorate, had been placarded with notices stating that the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Scullin)</inline> would address the electors on the land tax " scandal," and concluding with the invitation, "Come and hear Australia's finest  speaker  show up the corrupt mismanagement of the Bruce-Page Government." </para>

The honorable member for Yarra and the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> both got away very rapidly from the subject of the budget and dealt with a matter that gave greater scope for their histrionic talent - the land tax - but the replies by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> effectively and finally disposed of their arguments. </para>

                <para>Honorable members opposite levelled a good deal of criticism at the budget proposals; but I sometimes think that much of it is prompted by newspaper criticism, which, we have to remember, is generally destructive. I cannot quite join with the honorable member for Eden-Monaro in his respect for the press, and perhaps I may be applauded by honorable members opposite for making that statement. It seems to me that we are liable to over-estimate the importance of press criticism. Timid persons, and those who do not think for themselves, are often influenced by opinions expressed by newspapers; but, after all, a newspaper is merely a number of sheets of paper on which is printed news, advertisements, and opinions. Most of the opinions are paid for, and they often reflect the opinion of only one person. I am reminded of a remark by Napoleon, who, when annoyed by the criticism of the Paris <inline font-style="italic">Monitor,</inline> exclaimed, " An editor! What is he? A dirty man with a pen in a back office." I admit that we have advanced much since Napoleon's time; but having read the Melbourne press for the last few weeks, during which the Government has made considerable progress with its programme of legislation, I realize how well Victoria and the Commonwealth generally would . be managed by a triumvirate of the editors of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus ,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> The conservative leanings of the metropolitan dailies of this State is well evidenced by their failure to take off the extra halfpenny charged for newspapers shortly after the outbreak of war, although the proprietors of the Sydney dailies removed it years ago. If one looks at the leading article page of yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> - to which I suppose every politician turns with interest - one will find three leaders. In the first it is said that the Prime Minister is hot much good ; . in the second that the Federal and State Governments also are not much good; and in the third that the city and municipal councils are of no account. I cannot help thinking that when the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> got up that morning and set out for its office it could not say, with Browning - </para>

                <para>It seems to me that the principal criticism of the budget offered so far is that the Treasurer has dared to have a surplus. I admit that, taking the present regime of State Labour Governments, surpluses are old-fashioned; but, in my  opinion, they are not to be despised. In my private business I ardently look forward to having one every year, and I commend the Treasurer who is able to place his Government in that happy position. There is a good deal in the budget that calls for commendation. . Despite the charges of extravagance, the expenditure over a period of years shows that there has been very little increase in the actual cost of departments. Considering the fact that population has increased by nearly 500,000, the figures in that respect are creditable. The surplus is principally confined to the Customs revenue. It is impossible, of course, to forecast this revenue twelve months ahead, because one does not .know what may happen in that time. </para>

It is hard to say, therefore, what the imports will be.

                <para>Country people realize that the present Government may be trusted to protect their interests, and they are heartily behind it in its proposals. It is said that, owing to the surplus, taxation should be reduced; but one asks where the reduction is to be begun. The Customs revenue is absorbed in reducing the war debt, in old-age pensions, defence, repatriation, and in other directions. I cannot place my finger on the spot where reduction should be commenced. Another criticism is that the Government is paying off the war debt too quickly. This is a new point of view, particularly regarding war liabilities. When one examines the figures, and notes what is to be done with the surplus, one realizes that the budget calls for commendation. There is £1,000,000 for naval construction, £250,000 for the air service, a similar sum for the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, and £1,000,000 for war debt reduction. There are further payments of £100,000 for assistance to prospectors, and £186,944 for invalid and old-age pensions and national insurance. While I oppose a high tariff, I am quite prepared to waive my fiscal views so far as expenditure on defence and development is concerned. There is a cry for reduced taxation; but were certain fields of taxation to be vacated by the Commonwealth, they would immediately be entered by the State Governments, lt is much better that this money should be applied by the Commonwealth Government to some good purpose than that it should be frittered away by State Governments in extravagant socialistic enterprises. The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> referred to the speech which I made some time ago, and by the exercise of that wonderful ingenuity which he possesses, so twisted my remarks as to make it appear that I had attacked the present Government. While I admit that a high tariff is harmful to the primary producers, the main responsibility 'in connexion with land settlement devolves upon the States. That the kind of government in power in the States affects the primary producers is shown by the fact that, so far as Victoria, New . South Wales and Queensland are concerned, the only State to go ahead with closer settlement is Victoria, which has an anti-Labour government. The solution of this problem is in the hands of the party to which the honorable member for Hume belongs. It will be solved by the workers doing a fair day's work, thus decreasing production costs, and making high tariffs unnecessary. </para>

                        <para>- The workers should not be misled by specious promises which, if given effect <inline font-style="italic">to,</inline> bring sorrow and disillusionment, and cause great expense. When we see class legislation introduced such as the Workmen's Compensation Act recently passed by the New South Wales Government, ostensibly in the interests of the worker, but which has resulted in hundreds of workers being thrown out of employment, we naturally ask where that class of legislation is to end. That primary production in. Australia has not developed to a greater extent is not the fault of the Common wealth Government. It is due to unsympathetic administration by the State Governments, whose duty it is to pass sound and helpful legislation, and thus to develop the country and increase the prosperity of its people. I know of no instance in which a Labour government has treated land-owners sympathetically, or has referred to them as other than parasites and land-grabbers, a section of the people from' whom taxation may be squeezed. </para>

                <para>I am pleased at the sudden concern for the primary producers which the oil companies of Melbourne and Sydney have recently evinced in connexion with the increased duties on petrol and motor tires. I hope that their interest is the dawn of a better day for the primary producers. Let us consider the effect of the increased duty on petrol in the case of a man owning a motor car which will travel twenty miles to a gallon of petrol. The extra cost for petrol, because of the increased duties, would be £4 for 10,000 miles. Would it not be worth while to pay that additional amount in order to ensure good roads? The increased duty on motor tires does not affect me because, I do not use other than locally-made tires. Reference has been made to the petrol used in connection with tractors, but I point out that kerosene is the fuel usually used in those machines. The case of the primary producer using stationary engines has also been referred to. I have a stationary petrol engine which, in the shearing season, consumes two gallons of petrol a day. For a period of twenty days, that represents 40 gallons of petrol, the extra cost of which, in consequence of the increased duty, would be 6s.8d. That was the fee which we . paid to lawyers in the good old days, before they raised it to 10s. 6d. . The additional cost of petrol under these new duties cannot be compared with the advantage which good roads would confer upon motor users. Good roads mean a lessening of freight charges, and a reduction of wear and tear; the blessings would outweigh the extra cost. The various shires of New South Wales find it exceedingly difficult to maintain their roads in anything like a decent state of repair. It takes all their funds to keep the main roads fit for traffic. In the district represented by the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson),</inline> there is a stretch of road between Uralla and Armidale. At one time it was practically a speedway. The Gostwyck shire to-day spends about five times as much on that road as previously; but, nevertheless, it is only a succession of ruts. During the last election campaign the honorable member for New England, when travelling along it to address the electors, was thrown against the hood of the motor car in which he was travelling, and received a mark which he carries to this day. Landowners in New South Wales pay 21/2d. in the £1 on the unimproved value of their land. Should they want anything done to their roads they are called upon to make further contributions, because the shires have no money for the purpose. </para>

                        <para>- The Government's proposals will mean, not only better main roads, but also better subsidiary roads. I take strong exception to an advertisement that appeared in some of our newspapers recently under the auspices of the Town and Country Union. In it electors were advised to telegraph to their Federal members, and to watch how they voted in connexion with these duties. That is political blackmail. If honorable members cannot be trusted to vote as they think right, but have to be watched, as that advertisement suggests, the sooner we do away with Parliaments the better. Once members yield to coercion their usefulness has gone. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. The Government has been castigated on the score that it has been going too fast. Generally the cry is that governments do not proceed quickly enough. No Government which unswervingly carries out its policy will ever be universally popular, because, by so doing, some section of the community will be affected. I say, however, to the present Government, "Go on as you are going. The people of Australia are behind you and the weaklings and sluggards who now attack you, will yet join in the general chorus of acclamation." </para>

                    <para>.- My remarks will he confined chiefly to the financial proposals of the Government as outlined- in the States Grants Bill. I agree with previous speakers that, because of the Government's proposal to alter substantially the financial relations between the Commonwealth and' the States, this budget is one of the most important that has been brought down since the inauguration of federation. I regret that the proposed financial grants to Tasmania and Western Australia are included in the proposal of the Treasurer to discontinue the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, and are related to the Government's intention to relinquish certain fields of direct taxation. I would have preferred to see those proposals dealt with separately, so that no honorable member would run the risk of being misunderstood if he opposed the States Grants Bill. I am perfectly sure, nevertheless, that the Treasurer has combined them in order to clarify the position, and make clear the real effect upon the States of the withdrawal of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments.. The Treasurer has definitely stated that the proposals to assist Tasmania and Western Australia by. special grants have really nothing to do with the withdrawal of <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, so that, even if the States Grants Bill is defeated, there is no reason to suppose that the scheme to assist the two States mentioned, by special grants, will not be proceeded with. At the outset, I should like to commend the Treasurer and the Government. The Minister's sympathetic treatment of Tasmania is in marked contrast with the treatment extended to it by former Treasurers. The proposal to assist Tasmania by a special grant of £375,000 meets with the approval of the people of that State. Possibly it is not as much as we thought we were entitled to, and not as much as the State Premier expected, but I know that he has expressed his satisfaction with the proposal. </para>

                <para>While on this subject, I should like to allude to a remark made the other night by the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt).</inline> It will be remembered - by honorable members who were present that the right honorable gentleman said that, if the States had the power, they would not impose land taxation that would be comparable with the Federal land tax which the Commonwealth is proposing to surrender. To that remark I interjected, " They certainly would not." I notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report that the word "not" is. omitted, and I am not sure if the right honorable gentleman understood what I said. In any case, I submit that there was no justification whatever for his retort, " The voice of the sluggard State speaks truly for that State." I said, "Why sluggard?" and the right honorable gentleman, continuing, said, " If ever a statue is built to Tasmania, it will have its hand extended for a tip.'' The right honorable gentleman must have known that the remark would be offensive to every representative of Tasmania. I am sure, also, that such a gratuitous insult to one of the States of the Commonwealth is resented by every other honorable member. </para>

                        <para>- I think not, and it ill becomes the representative of one of the two States that have benefited most from federation to speak slightingly of a small State like Tasmania, which, for a longtime, has been bearing a heavier burden of taxation per head than any other State of the Commonwealth. Development in Tasmania is more difficult than in the other States. Nearly the whole of the agricultural areas of Tasmania at one time carried dense forests which had to be cut down and cleared before the land could be brought under cultivation. This work was done, not by sluggards, but by stout-hearted pioneers. The same hardships had to be surmounted in the development of the mining industry on the west coast. Contrast the difficulties encountered by our pioneers with the work of developing the agricultural areas in the mainland States. With the exception probably of Gippsland, in Victoria, the work on the mainland has been comparatively easy. It has been possible to utilize up-to-date machinery and bring the land into production much more easily than in Tasmania. The development of our agricultural and mining industries has not been the work of sluggards, as the right honorable member for Balaclava suggested. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think I am, because we all know that his speeches are well considered and widely read. Probably no other public man in Australia enjoys a better reputation as an orator than the right honorable member for Balaclava. We have done a great work in the development of our mining and agricultural resources in Tasmania. And we have done a great work also in the establishment of the electrolytic zinc industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Nicholas</inline> Lockyer, who was appointed by the Commonwealth Government to inquire into the disabilities suffered by Tasmania as the result of federation, made special reference to the establishment of the electrolytic zinc works. He added that, because of the national character of the industry, the State was justified in contracting to sell to the company electric power at less than the cost of production. It may also be of interest to honorable members to know that we have spent nearly £6,000,000 on roads in Tasmania. With our heavy rainfall is is essential that we should have macadamized or metalled roads. Necessarily this expenditure has proved a great burden upon our taxpayers, but it had to be faced, to ensure the development of our natural resources. No less than £3,300,000 has been expended on the great hydro-electric scheme of Tasmania, which could never have been carried out if the people of the State were sluggards. Referring again to the right honorable gentleman's remark that, if a statue were erected to represent Tasmania, the figure would need to be holding out a hand for a tip, I suggest that, if in the matter of tips, other Treasurers of the Commonwealth were to follow the example set by the right honorable member for Balaclava, when he was Treasurer, Tasmania would not be encouraged to keep the palm of her hand uppermost for very long. It ill becomes a representative of one of the metropolitan electorates of Victoria to speak disparagingly of the little State of Tasmania. Victoria has derived more benefit from federation than has any other State of the Commonwealth. The bulk of the trade of the north of Tasmania is enjoyed by Melbourne. I should have thought that that would lead the people of Melbourne to sympathize with the people of Tasmania. I am certain that such a sympathy exists, and that the views expressed by the right honorable member are not approved by the overwhelming majority of the people of this very fine city. The reason that Tasmania has for a considerable time found it necessary to claim special assistance from the Commonwealth is that she has not benefited to any degree from the expenditure of Commonwealth money. I have always based her claim to special consideration on that ground. I invite honorable members to consider the expenditure of Commonwealth money on the River Murray water scheme, the unification of railway gauges, the east and west railway and Canberra, and the expenditure of Commonwealth funds in Melbourne as the Seat of Government; and it will be admitted that all the States, with the exception of Tasmania, have largely benefited from Commonwealth expenditure. Victoria and New South Wales have been specially fortunate in this regard. </para>

                <para>In confirmation of my statement that very little Commonwealth money has been spent in Tasmania, I have only to direct attention to the fact that the Public Works Committee, whose duty it is to inquire into every proposal involving the expenditure of Commonwealth money in excess of £25,000, visited Tasmania for the first time about two months ago, and then only to inquire into the proposed erection of an automatic telephone exchange at Hobart. It should be borne in mind in this connexion, also, that the taxpayers of Tasmania have to find their share of all moneys paid into the Commonwealth Treasury. They have been overburdened with taxation in recent years. I again commend the Treasurer for his sympathetic consideration of the peculiar position of Tasmania, and I should like to say a word of commendation, also, of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Nicholas</inline> Lockyer, who, as a royal commissioner, recently inquired into Tasmania's special disabilities. It is evident, from his report, not only that he carefully considered the question submitted to him and the evidence placed before him, but that he is a man of farseeing vision. The recommendations in his report compel one to realize that he understands the peculiar position of Tasmania very much better than it has been understood by any other person who has reported upon it. I do not blame the Government for failing to adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Nicholas</inline> Lockyer's report. The Premier and Treasurer of Tasmania has said that he does not consider the report satisfactory, because of certain conditions to the financial assistance recommended, which he considers could not be accepted by the State. Nevertheless, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Nicholas</inline> Lockyer's report might well have formed the basis of negotiations with the Commonwealth Treasurer. Many of his recommendations might have been embraced in proposals to assist Tasmania, and they would be distinctly beneficial to the people of that State. </para>
                <para>With regard to the proposal to withdraw the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments from the States, I claim that to give effect to it would, to a certain extent, nullify the benefit conferred upon Tasmania by the special grant which is to be made. That is contended by the Treasurer of Tasmania, and to a great extent I concur in the views that gentleman has expressed. Under this proposal it will not be possible for the Tasmanian Government to reduce State taxation to the extent to which it might have been reduced if the special grant were made and the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment was continued. I know there is a difference of opinion as to the advisability of the proposed withdrawal of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. I am not going to say that the proposal has no merits, but one of my difficulties, as a representative of Tasmania, is that I am unable to estimate what really will be the effect of the proposal upon the finances of Tasmania, because there is a great discrepancy between the figures given by the Commonwealth Treasurer and those submitted by the Treasurer of the State, and there appears to be no means of ascertaining which set of figures is correct. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer says no figures were given, but I refer him to the speech he made in introducing the States Grants Bill. In that speech he supplied some columns of figures, explaining the fields of taxation to be relinquished by the Commonwealth, giving the amounts to be collected by the States from those fields of taxation, and the amount of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment which will be withdrawn from each State. The figures given for Tasmania as the amounts which the State authorities will, under the Treasurer's proposal, be able to collect, are: Land tax, £46,279; estate duties tax, £26,022; entertainments tax, £6,000; 40 per cent. of income tax on individuals, £80,629; 40 per cent. of income tax on companies, £28,078 ; total taxation surrendered, £187,008. It will be seen that the Treasurer proposes that the Commonwealth shall still exploit the field of income tax to the extent of 60 per cent. I do not quite know what the Treasurer meant when he said that no figures have been given. </para>

                        <para>- That, I understand, was after the Treasurer had given his figures to the House. It may be that what the honorable gentleman says is correct in that the States have not supplied him with their figures; but they certainly have been given to members representative of the respective States. But whilst the honorable gentleman estimates at £80,629 the amount to be collected by Tasmania in the exploitation of 40 per cent. of the field of income tax on individuals, to be left to the State, the Treasurer of the State says that the amount which will be collected from that source will not be more that half that sum. My difficulty is to know whose figures are correct. I cannot absolutely trust either set of figures. I am not going to say that the figures suggested by the State Treasurer of Tasmania are correct, but I am perfectly certain that those supplied by the Commonwealth Treasurer are incorrect. If we take into consideration the collection of income tax by the central office on the system of the aggregation of incomes, it is evident that the Commonwealth Treasurer's figures cannot be right, because they are based upon a population basis. No one will contend that it is possible to divide the figure representing the amount estimated to be collected by the number of taxpayers in the States, and so arrive at an exact estimate of the revenue to be obtained from the portion of this field of taxation from which it is proposed the Commonwealth shall withdraw. But it is clear that the discrepancy between the figures of the Commonwealth and State Treasurers should not amount to nearly 50 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer of Tasmania estimates the revenue from this field of taxation at from £38,000 to £40,000, and the Commonwealth Treasurer estimates it at £80,000. There are also discrepancies in the estimates of revenue from the other fields  of taxation referred to in the Treasurer's proposal. It is evident to me that there must be a discrepancy arising from the system of collection at the central office on the aggregation of incomes for the purpose of the tax. I have read very carefully the debates of the conference between the Commonwealth and State Premiers, and I find that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> said that the States could collect income taxation on the same basis as that upon which the Commonwealth has collected the tax in the past. With all due deference to the right honorable gentleman, and whilst I do not pose as a constitutional lawyer, or claim to question the constitutionality of what is proposed, I do not think it is possible for a State Treasurer to collect income tax upon an income earned in another State. </para>

                        <para>- As to probate, it is easy  to obtain information regarding the value of estates of deceased persons, but not so easy in the case of the living. I know that it has not been done in Tasmania in regard to income tax information. The Commonwealth has made no attempt to collect income tax from individuals who reside in other portions of the Empire, but I should say that if it were practicable for the States to aggregate the income of individuals derived from various States, it would be just as easy for the Commonwealth to aggregate the income of individuals earned in different portions of the Empire. The State Premiers must be considered to be quite honest in their statements that they have no power to aggregate incomes earned in various States, and that they doubt the accuracy of the figures supplied by the Commonwealth Treasurer. I do not claim that the figures supplied by the Tasmanian Treasurer are correct, because I have no means of checking them, but  it is obvious to me that, the Commonwealth Treasurer's figures are incorrect, and I think I am justified in saying that I distrust any of the - figures supplied. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that the State Premiers are free from blame in this regard. The Treasurer tells us that they will not send their officials to enable him to obtain the necessary information, and that they have taken up the determined stand that they have a moral right to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment, and are not prepared to discuss the matter with the Commonwealth. In that respect I think they are wrong, but at the same time I think that the Commonwealth Treasurer is also wrong in insisting on his proposals, although they are so strenuously opposed by the whole of the States. I believe that some re-adjustment of the finances of the States and the Commonwealth is necessary, and that there should be some means of severing the two, so that one definite field may be left to the States and another to the Commonwealth At the same time I contend that no proposal can be acceptable to the people of the Commonwealth unless there is to some considerable extent an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States. It has been repeated by practically every one who has discussed this matter at the Premiers' Conferences, that we are one people, and that the States and the Commonwealth represent one people. That is perfectly true, but a proposal which seriously affects the finances of a State will not be satisfactory to the people of that State unless there is complete agreement between the States and the Commonwealth. I think the State Premiers are entitled to insist that they should have a voice in this matter. The fact that the Commonwealth has, so far, failed in its efforts to get the States to arrive at some agreement is no reason why a further effort should not be made. There is no immediate hurry to carry out a proposal that will certainly disrupt the finances of the States for some time to come. The proposal to defer the operation of the new arrangement for twelve months is clearly a relief to the States, but I cannot admit the claim of the Treasurer that a postponement for a year will prove the correctness of the figures he gave when introducing his proposals. It will do nothing of the sort, because until the States bring down their own taxation measures, and levy taxation on individuals or companies in the States there will be no means of ascertaining the value of the fields relinquished by the Commonwealth. The fact that the Commonwealth will continue to collect these taxes for another year will make no difference whatever, because it will continue to collect on precisely the same basis as before. Therefore, no further information can be gained in the twelve months. In other words, if we cannot get the information now we shall not be in any better position to do so a year hence. </para>

                <para>The Treasurer has said on more than one occasion that it is right that those who spend money should have the responsibility of collecting it. That statement sounds very well, and probably the average individual who does not think very deeply about such matters will applaud it, but there is no such virtue in the Government's proposals. We are hot separating the two fields of taxation. The Commonwealth will still retain the right to tax incomes to the extent of 60 per cent. of the present basis. It will retain its right to levy direct taxation. We have also a proposal by the Government to collect money through our Customs in order to make roads. That proposal hardly bears out the assertion of the Treasurer that those who have the right to spend money should have the responsibility of collecting it, because he is now levying a special Customs tax to raise money for the States to spend on roads. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth is not applying the principle that those who spend should collect. In various ways it is still remaining in spheres that rightly belong to the States, and the States only. There is not the least doubt that the financial trouble between the Commonwealth and the States is entirely due to  the fact that the Commonwealth has entered a field which it was never entitled by right to enter. For instance, it has taken over the function of building railways, unifying railway gauges, making roads, and giving bounties for this, that, and the other thing. Admittedly these invasions were in response to a demand from certain quarters, but the Commonwealth should have resisted it. The Federal intrusion in. spheres which rightly belong to the States, and in which State administration would have been more economical, has been responsible for all the present conflict between Commonwealth and State in regard to financial matters. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the River Murray waters scheme could not have been handled as well by the three States concerned as it has been handled by the Commonwealth. But that one instance in which the Commonwealth interfered successfully is not a sufficient excuse for its entering upon a policy of road construction and unification of railway gauges, as well as a housing scheme. These departures from the legitimate course of Commonwealth activities have been responsible for a great increase in taxation. The Customs and excise revenue soars higher every year. In 1914 who could have anticipated that the collections through the Customs Department in the year 1926-27 would reach £40,000,000? The people have been looking forward to the time when the Commonwealth would abandon the field of direct taxation, and had not the Commonwealth exceeded its constitutional rights, and created big spending departments, often duplicating the work of the States, there would have been no necessity for Federal direct taxation .today. Had proper economy been exercised the Commonwealth, with a revenue of £40,000,000 from indirect taxation, would have been able to evacuate the field of direct taxation, and until the Commonwealth does permanently quit that field I am not prepared to support the Government proposal to withdraw the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. The Government; should have made further efforts to reach agreement with the States before resorting to the extreme step of withdrawing from them an income which they regard as one of the conditions of the Federal compact. The Constitution originally contemplated that the field of direct taxation should be left to the States. I do not agree that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments to the States should continue for all time, but I am convinced that unless some understanding can be reached between the Commonwealth and the State Treasurers the policy of this Government will not receive the support of the. public. Moreover, there is no guarantee that if the Commonwealth evacuates the field of direct taxation to-day it will not re-enter it in the near future. The Prime Minister suggested to the conference of Premiers that a general election might place in power in the Federal Parliament a party whose socialistic schemes would necessitate the expenditure of large sums of money, and if that happened Parliament could withdraw the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments to the States, and continue to impose direct taxation also. The right honorable gentleman's argument was not very convincing, because, even if the proposals which his Government has put forward are  accepted there  will be nothing to prevent this Parliament from again levying direct taxation on income and land. It will be very much easier for a parliament to reimpose direct taxation than to suddenly discontinue the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments to the States. The honorable member for Yarra said, and other honorable members of his party endorsed the statement, that if the Labour party were returned to office in this Parliament it would immediately reimpose the land tax. I draw the attention of the Prime Minister to that statement, which indicates that the evacuation of that field of taxation as part of the compensation to the </para>

                <para class="block">States for the loss of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments may prove to he no compensation at all. There is no guarantee that the field of direct taxation will not be reentered at any time when the Commonwealth Government requires more money. I am satisfied that the withdrawal of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments will have the effect of increasing taxation in the State of which I share the representation, and the increased taxation will fall on many of those who are least able to bear it. </para>
                <para>Although I had occasion to take the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> to task, I agree with some of the views he expressed and  bo  intimated by interjection when he said that the . States could not impose taxation to the same extent as the Commonwealth. Although I have not heard the views of the Premier of Tasmania on this subject, I know that he has no chance of passing through both Houses of the Tasmanian Parliament a bill to impose land taxation of the same weight as that imposed by the Commonwealth. It is, therefore, obvious that, to obtain the same amount of revenue, the State Parliament will have to impose taxation that will bear disproportionately on the poorer sections of the community. The Treasurer may say that that is the business of the States, and has nothing to do with him ; but surely the State Treasurers are entitled to take these questions into consideration. They know the effect it will have upon their revenue, but, unfortunately, the Commonwealth Treasurer has not that knowledge. When the States Grants Bill is before the House I shall probably have more to say on this subject, and if there is any chance of its being withdrawn or defeated, I shall advance every argument possible to that end. Although I take second place to no man in upholding the Commonwealth as distinct from the State point of view, as a representative of a small State like Tasmania, I am justified in emphasizing the effect of the proposal on that State. </para>
                <para>It has been claimed that the Commonwealth is doing everything necessary to provide for defence; at any rate, the Treasurer said that we are doing all we can afford to do. Possibly that is right, but the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> and others on this side of the House, claim that when we are considering defence expenditure we should include amounts spent on roads and railways. I am surprised at that contention. Iron, steel, cotton, and many other things - in fact, almost everything produced in this country - would be essential to our existence if the Commonwealth was engaged in war and isolated from the rest of the world. The expenditure on roads has nothing to do with the amount of money that the Commonwealth is spending on defence or with what the Inspector-General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Chauvel, has said regarding the need for more money. He is dealing with defence as administered by him and members of his staff, and when he says that the amount provided is inadequate to give Australia a chance of training and equipping her forces, it cannot be supposed that he has taken into consideration such questions as the North-South railway and good roads. I suggest to some of the strategists of this House that there may be a difference of opinion as to whether good roads and unified railway gauges would be beneficial to us if we were defending this country against an invader. Strategists preparing plans for the invasion of Australia would be seriously concerned at the breaks of railway gauge, and, in so far as those breaks of gauge would be adverse to an invading army, they would be beneficial to those on the defensive. I doubt whether good roads are of benefit to a people defending themselves. The invader is always ready - he strikes his blow when he is prepared - but those on the defensive have no warning. Certainly Australia would need time to complete the organization, mobilization, and equipment of her forces. If the Commonwealth was invaded from the north, and the North-South railway had ' been completed, the first thing we would do would be to destroy that line. Honor-, able members, when searching for arguments to support schemes for building railways, unifying railway gauges, or constructing roads, are always ready to say, " This is absolutely necessary from a defence point of view." They think that such argument has special weight with honorable members, and so it would have if honorable members generally agreed with their point of view that railways and good roads would assist Australia in time of invasion. I entirely disagree, and I suggest that there is room for difference of opinion among military strategists that the unification of the railway gauges would assist Australia to 'defend herself. It is the duty of every Government to make adequate preparation for the protection of the territory under' its control, and, although I do not suggest that sufficient care has not been exercised by this Government, I emphasize the point that it cannot altogether disregard the opinions expressed by its expert advisers. The budget, which has been favorably commented upon by honorable members on this side of the Chamber, is, I think, on the whole, one of the best submitted to Parliament. It is gratifying to know that during recent years our national debt has been reduced, which is the first purpose to which surplus revenue should be put. I cannot, however, ' see any particular virtue in placing a portion of our surplus revenue to a redemption fund, if, at the same time, we are placing new loans on the market. </para>
