                        <para>- The matter about which the honorable member asks is one of extraordinary complexity and difficulty, and the Government has given much consideration to it. The copyright laws of the Commonwealth are in conformity with the international convention for the protection of copyright, and therefore the difficulty to which the honorable member has referred cannot be met by a mere alteration of the Copyright Act. There is, however, a general desire to find some solution of the problem. It affects not only the rights of people who, by the exercise of their brains, have produced something for which they are entitled to remuneration and protection against piracy, but also the conduct of broadcasting. After full consideration the Government has concluded that the best thing will be to get the parties concerned together, to see if. a mutually satisfactory arrangement cannot be arrived at. Therefore, at the instance of the Government, a meeting will he held  in  Sydney next Tuesday, at which there will be representation of the Performing Rights Association, broadcasting companies, and those who were present at a conference which was held in Sydney three or four weeks ago. At that meeting, at least a preliminary survey of the situation will be taken to see what can be done. </para>

                        <para>- Two aspects of the Locarno Pact concern this House. One is the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee itself,  the general question of its usefulness as a means for promoting and ensuring world&#39;s peace, and its relation to the League of Nations and the ideals underlying the establishment of the League. Then there is the position of Australia to be considered as one of the self-governing dominions, in view of the fact that the British Government is a party to the Treaty. The first subject can be dealt with when the discussion takes place upon the agenda for the forthcoming meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations, and an opportunity for that discussion will be afforded in the near future. An opportunity to discuss the other matter will be afforded on the consideration of the agenda for the forthcoming Imperial Conference. In reply to a question submitted yesterday, 1 stated that I propose either at the end of the present week, or at the beginning of next week, to present that agenda paper, and move that it be printed. 1 shall then make a statement on the subject. </para>

                        <para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-21, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report, namely: - The erection of cottages at Canberra. </para>

                <para class="block">In connexion with the preparations for the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra it is necessary to provide housing accommodation for civil servants. There is no prospect of private enterprise undertaking this work within the time available, or even at all, and there is no alternative to provision of the necessary housing by the Government. The Federal Capital Commission was asked to develop a scheme for the building of houses, and it prepared plans of various standard types for which tenders were called and accepted. The commission was under the impression that the erection of cottages did not come within the scope of the Public Works Committee Act; but this matter has been recently referred to the Crown Law authorities, who have advised that these cottages could not be regarded as a number of separate works, but must be considered as one work, and therefore come within the provisions of that statute. It is. therefore, desired to place this matter in order by referring it to the Public Works Committee, which will be invited, if this House approves, to deal with it as a special subject, provided leave is given for the committee to meet while the House is sitting. If this leave is not granted, the committer will be unable to bring in its report before Parliament rises. The delay that would be thus involved is undesirable, in view of the necessity of having the necessary housing completed and ready for occupation by the civil servants when they are transferred next year.. The commission has prepared standard types of plans and specifications with a view to keeping down the cost of the houses as much as possible; but the designs may be modified to suit the requirements of civil servants who are now stating their wishes after inspection of them. It is not known what total number of each type will be required, pending the completion of returns by all civil servants affected. The estimated costs of the various types range from &#163;950 to &#163;2,030, and the average cost per house may, therefore, be taken to be under &#163;1,500; but this will depend upon the proportion of lower-priced houses that may be required. I produce plans and specifications of the types of houses, and further particulars will be given in evidence before the committee. I understand that the committee is prepared to deal with this matter expeditiously, and will visit Adelaide at the week-end. It may not be possible for it to return to Melbourne before Wednesday, and the second portion of my motion, if agreed to, will cover the absence of honorable members from the House on Tuesday next. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government&#39;s reference amounts to closing the stable door after the horse has escaped, since the proposal should have been submitted to the Public Works Committee before the work was begun. Contracts have already been let, and, if the committee reported adversely where would the Government then stand? </para>

He poses as a builder, but I doubt if he could build a fowl house. Some of those men are as capable as any in Australia, and their work will bear comparison with that done in Melbourne or Sydney. The honorable member, who has no qualifications as a builder, should not have had the audacity to slander his own countrymen. The commission had a hard task in securing the necessary men for the work at Canberra in the early stages, because plenty of employment was available in the building trade in the capital cities: Therefore, the Commonwealth is under an obligation to the men who were prepared to sacrifice the comfort of their homes, and undergo the rigorous winter conditions prevailing at Canberra. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that I shall disclose a secret when I say that the Crown Law authorities pointed out that if the contracts were terminated the Commonwealth would sustain considerable loss. This showed conclusively that the contracts had been let, although the commission made it appear that it was letting contracts for one house at a time. The fact is that the contracts have been let, and they cannot now be repudiated. The Public Works Committee may point out that a wrong course of action has been pursued, but the work must continue. The honorable member for South Sydney need not fear that the move to Canberra will be delayed. The building will go on all too rapidly. I hope this experience will be a lesson to the three kings of Canberra that they cannot override the provisions of an act of this Parliament. </para>

I wish&#39; to make a brief reference to the remarks of the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> in regard to his visit to Canberra. He, like myself, paid only a flying visit to the city, and was well paid for doing so. We did not see the men at work for five minutes. The only man that the honorable member crossed swords with was a Scotch bricklayer, and very few words passed between them before the honorable member ran for his motor car as quickly as he could. He started to argue with this bricklayer about laying 1,000 bricks a day. </para>

He said that a good deal of the blundering was due to our unseemly haste to get to Canberra. I should be well pleased if it took us 50 years to get there. I am glad that the Government took this step. It had only two courses in the matter, one of which was to bring down a bill to validate the illegal act that was done, and the other to refer the matter to the Public Works Committee. I think the right course has been taken. I should be glad to know whether the scope of reference to the committee will be sufficiently wide to enable it to inquire into the cost of the houses. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government was well advised to seek the authority of &#34; Parliament, through the Public Works Committee, for the expenditure involved in these Canberra contracts, but I did not gather from the Minister&#39;s remarks whether the scope of the inquiry would be wide enough to enable the committee to investigate the suitability of the types of houses that are being erected. Perhaps the Minister will make that point clear when he replies. With regard to the workmanship in the houses at Canberra, so far as I can see, no fault can be found with it. Nor do I think there is any room for complaint about the quality of the materials that are being used. Perhaps, as regards the use of shingles with which some of the cottages are being roofed, there is room for difference  of opinion as to the wisdom of using such roofing material. Perhaps the committee could also inquire into that matter. I am quite sure that the Canberra Commission is doing its best, within the limited time at its disposal, to provide the necessary accommodation to enable the transfer to be made in May of next year. I do not think any blame is attachable to it for the oversight that has apparently occurred in connexion with the letting of a contract exceeding &#163;25,000 without reference to the Public Works Committee. I understand that the Public Works Commission is to be given permission to make its inquiries while Parliament is sitting, so that the inquiry may be expedited and any avoidable delay obviated. I hope that its report will be submitted . to the House before it rises for the vacation. Any &#34;fear that the work at Canberra will be delayed or interfered with on account of what has happened may, I think, be dismissed. Such interference would involve the country in serious financial loss, for the contractors would have to be compensated in case of any breach of their contract by the commission or the Government. The Public Works Committee, in view of all the circumstances, will undoubtedly pursue its inquiry as rapidly as possible and submit its report without delay, and very little expense is likely to result in consequence of the unfortunate oversight in not referring the matter to it in the first instance. </para>

                    <para>.- I should not have risen to participate in this debate but for the apology that has just been made in behalf of the Ministry. I have no desire to throw the blame for this mistake on the shoulders of the commission. The Government should have seen that the matter was referred to the Public Works Committee, and it must accept responsibility for not having done so. So far as I can recollect, this is the first time that a mistake of this kind has been made, and the only thing we can do now is to rectify it and get on with the work. I trust that the reference to the committee will be broad enough to enable it to inquire into the value of the cottages that are to be erected, and intimate whether such heavy rents as public servants have been notified will be charged are really justifiable. I do not think it is fair that Commonwealth officers with limited incomes should have to pay high rents, which are really beyond their means, for the cottages. </para>

I hope that no time will be lost in inquiring into the erection of the cottages. I direct the attention of the Minister and the Government to the fact that thousands of .people are anxious to go to Canberra to witness the ceremony in connexion with the opening of Parliament there. I suggest that the Government should proceed as quickly as possible with the erection not only of the cottages referred to, but also of as many others as possible. The taxpayers are finding the money for this venture, and those desirous of attending the opening ceremony, which will be one of the most important in our history, should, if possible, be provided with accommodation. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not wish to cross swords with any honorable member on this side of the House on the question of apportioning the blame for the bungling that has taken place. I am prepared, if necessary, to halve the blame. There is no doubt that both the Federal Capital Commission and the Government are to blame. Parliament made the initial mistake of appointing a commission, and if the advice of honorable members on this side &#39;had been taken, the bungling would not have occurred. We suggested that those who had previously been responsible for constructional work at Canberra should remain in charge. Although the appointment of the commission may relieve the Government of some responsibility, there is al-  ready ample evidence that it needs watch- ing carefully. I understand that about 2,000 cottages are needed, and, if they cost about &#163;2,000 each, substantial profits will be made out of the Government. I hope that the committee will investigate the tenders submitted by contractors, and will inquire as to the cost of materials. A proper investigation will probably disclose that the contractors are calculating on a handsome profit. Australian workmen are the best in the world, notwithstanding the remarks of the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook),</inline> &#34;and, under proper supervision, Canberra could be built better and more cheaply by day labour than by contract. The members of the commission are believers in the contract system, and they will, therefore, play up to contractors. I am not imputing anything dishonest; but, because the commissioners believe that the contract system is the best, and will consequently favour contractors, they should be watched. Until the commission was appointed, works at Canberra proceeded satisfactorily under the control of departmental officers, who knew their jobs thoroughly. &#34;We are  now paying thousands of pounds a year to a commission to protect the funds of the Commonwealth, and it has already disregarded the provisions of an act of Parliament, and the expressed views of honorable members. As bricks and tiles are made at Canberra, and all conveniences exist there for the landing of materials on the job at the cheapest possible rate, it is strange that cottages should cost such an enormous </para>

                    <para>&#91;3.281.  - The fault has undoubtedly been with the commission and not with Parliament. The commission has exceeded its duties; but, at this stage, it is farcical for the Government, at great expense, to send the Public Works Committee to Canberra to investigate something in regard to which it must report favorably. I do not mean that the committee must report that the houses are being built at a reasonable cost, but it must report in favour, of voting money to _ continue the scheme. The members of the committee will appear to the public as automatons, who have to do as they are told. They will find fault with the buildings, and may allege that too much money is being spent; but in the end they will condone what is being done. An inquiry should be made as to the cost of these buildings, which, in my opinion, and in the opinion of other honorable members, is excessive. The commissioners have exceeded their duty by spending more money than they are entitled to spend, and now this Parliament should shoulder the responsibility and legalize what the commission has done, instead of placing the onus on the Public Works Committee. The report of the committee should have nothing to do with the voting of the money. </para>

                    <para>.-- The discussion this afternoon has justified the criticism in this Chamber the other day, when the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> moved to have this matter referred to the Public Works Committee. I would remind the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins)</inline> that the members of the Public Works Committee inquire into every matter submitted to the Committee. They report on the facts as they find them, and are not influenced in any way by party considerations. I have risen now chiefly because the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> has charged me with having made an attack upon the workers at Canberra. I contradict that statement and, in support of my contradiction, I propose to quote what I said on the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I said that the houses at Canberra were jerry-built and went on to refer to the builders and not to the men who actually carried out the work. When a foreman is placed in charge of a job, the workers on the job have to carry out his orders. What I condemned was the system under which the houses were built at Canberra. It will be remembered that I complained that some of the houses were roofed with cheap shingles instead of with a better form of roofing. No one would charge the men who did that work with responsibility for the selection of the inferior roofing. I attributed the shoddy, work done at Canberra to speeding up under the contract system. The honorable member for Franklin did refer personally to the workers. He said - </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Franklin charged me this afternoon with having attacked the workmen at Canberra. I did not do so. It would not have been right for me to do so. What I attacked was the system under which the houses were built. The honorable member for Franklin said that many of the houses were built by day labour by men receiving 25s. and 30s. a day, who were not tradesmen. To-day he says that he did not make an attack upon the workmen. What he said is on record, and can be compared with the statement he made this afternoon. He has referred to time lost in a conversation with a workman. I was present when the conversation referred to took place. It did not occupy more than three or four minutes, and, as a matter of fact, the workman referred to did not cease his work for an instant during the conversation; he complained that the workers were condemned for not doing a great deal of work when, as a matter of fact, they were working as hard as they could.  His  grievance was that a number of persons were going about Canberra in motor cars, looking at the works m progress, while only a few were doing the hard graft, and he was one of them. I am very pleased that these works are to be referred to the Public Works Committee. The decision to make the reference is a victory for those who advocated the adoption of that course weeks ago. </para>

                    <para>The committee is unanimously and strongly of opinion that the carrying out of a work such as that indicated, involving a large expenditure of public money, is a distinct evasion of the act, and some members were desirous of ventilating the matter on the floor of the House.

                    <para>The failure to do so is due entirely to inadvertence, it having been assumed, after full inquiry had been made, that this work, which embraces the construction of 500 cottages, was one in relation to the individual cottages, and not to the contract for the 500 as a whole. </para>
                    <para>I am sure I need not stress to you or to your committee the fact that neither the commission nor my predecessor, in failing to refer the work to you, was either desirous of avoiding the provision of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act, or of showing any discourtesy to the committee. </para>
                    <para>It lias also to be borne in mind that the date for the transference of the Capital to Canberra would have to be postponed if the question of these cottages were now to be investigated by the Public Works Committee, as the commission, working at full pressure, would only he able to make the necessary arrangements for the transference on the 9th May, even if the work is not interrupted in any way. </para>
                    <para>In view of these circumstances, the two courses which it appears possible to pursue are: (1) That there shall be a formal reference of the works to your committee, and that your committee should formally approve them, and in its report to the House set out the circumstances under which that formal approval is given; or (2) That a bill should be introduced into Parliament authorizing .the works. </para>

                    <para>. - The question resolves itself into whether the Federal Capital Commission or the Government called for tenders for these works, and committed a breach of the Public Works Committee Act. When the Seat of Government Administration Bill was recently under consideration, it will be remembered that my reply to the second-reading debate on the measure was interrupted by the adjournment of the debate. I had at the time before me the whole of the facts of the case, and the correspondence between the Public Works Committee and the Government, and it was my intention then to make a statement on the subject to the House. It has been stated that the commision; or the Government, or both, has tried to go behind the Public Works Committee Act. I have said previously, and I say again, that nothing was further from the minds of both the commission and the Government. When the matter was brought to the notice of the Government, it was immediately referred to the Crown Law authorities. The commission has certain powers for the carrying out of works when money is voted by Parliament for them. It must be remembered that the commission is carrying out works every day. It is making roads, extending the sewer services, the electric light and power services, and the water mains, and all those works are costing more than &#163;25,000. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members have to-day said that the Government and the commission had gone behind the back of Parliament to carry out certain works. Had the Government had any desire to deceive honorable members respecting the erection of cottages at Canberra, instead of moving to refer the matter to the Public Works Committee, it could have passed a validating measure through this House. Neither the Government nor the commission had any desire to go behind the back of Parliament to build works at Canberra. The commission has been straightforward throughout, and rightly referred the matter to the Government for decision. The honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lacey)</inline> was absent when I replied to some of the statements that he made&#34; the other day respecting the use of shingle roofs at Canberra. I would inform him that only six houses there have shingle roofs, and that the residents of Sydney are to-day paying more for shingle roofs than for tiled roofs. That completely discredits the statement of honorable members that shingle roofs are shoddy and absolutely useless. </para>

The Government has taken the first opportunity to bring the matter before Parliament, and I ask honorable members to agree to refer the matter to the Public Works Committee for consideration and report. </para>

                <para class="block">The report of the Public Works Committee was tabled in the House and ordered to be printed on the 7th of July last. It was not circulated amongst honorable members until to-day because of the pressure of work in the printing office. In the approved plan of Canberra, a special zone has been created for parliamentary and official activities, and a proper layout has been made for all structures in this area, so that the&#39; permanent&#39; offices to accommodate the various administrative departments of the Commonwealth may be arranged in accordance with an orderly and dignified scheme, with due provision&#39; to meet expansion for many generations. It will be remembered that the original proposal was that provisional buildings be erected, in the first instance, to accommodate the departments, but this House, on the recommendation of the Public Works Committee, passed a resolution on the 24th August, 1923, that such provisional buildings be not authorized, but that an architectural competition be held instead for the design of the first unit of the permanent administrative offices. This competition was held, and the design for which the first premium was awarded was duly referred to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report. Its report has recently been presented to Parliament. The building, as proposed, will contain five floors, including lower ground and mezzanine floors, and will be constructed of concrete, faced with stone. Australian materials will be utilized wherever possible in its completion. Its equipment will include hot water heating, vacuum cleaning, hot water service, a refectory, strong rooms, and modern appliances generally.&#39; The planning aims at the convenient location of the departments, and a standard unit of floor space has been adopted to afford economic subdivision or utilization in large office spaces as may be found necessary. Access and internal communication by stairways and lifts have also received special study. The general finish will be as simple as possible, consistent with the requirements of an important permanent national building at the Seat of Government. The estimated  coat of the building is &#163;631,819, but to this should be added - </para>

                <para class="block">Either of two corresponding sites - one on each side of the main city axis - in the government area is available for these offices, and it is proposed to erect the building on whichever site affords the cheaper foundation. In due course, when required, and subject to the prescribed inquiries, the other site will be occupied by a building of similar design to form a balanced scheme. The conditions of competition provided that the winning design may be used in the future for the second building without employment of the successful architect, or payment of any fee. It is estimated that the building will require about four years for its completion, and when that is accomplished the balance of Central Administrative staffs will be transferred. The cost of the building will be borne by the Federal Capital Commission. The Public Works Committee has made a very exhaustive inquiry into this proposal, and its report contains valuable suggestions for improvement and reductions in the cost of building. These will receive careful attention in working out the further details of the project. This will be the first permanent governmental office to be erected at Canberra. Even Parliament House, which is now nearing completion, is a temporary building, estimated to serve from 60 to 100 years. The Government intended in the first place to erect temporary offices, but the Public Works Committee reported unfavorably on that proposal, and the House, on the 24th August, 1923, passed a resolution providing for the erection of permanent administrative offices. Plans and specifications were prepared and submitted to the Public Works Committee for inquiry and report. Its report was tabled in this House on the 7th of this month. The committee has recommended that the building of the administrative offices be proceeded with as speedily as possible, so that accommodation may be provided for the public servants and the staff to be transferred to Canberra within the next three or four years. </para>

                        <para>- I should think so. The Government at present intends to call for tenders for the work. The architect whose design was accepted will supervise the erection of the building. I cannot say definitely whether the work will be carried out by day labour or by contract, because that has not yet been decided by Cabinet. The policy of the Government is to carry out permanent works by contract, and I understand that it will be adopted in this case. </para>

It is necessary, therefore, that I should publish a synopsis of previous chapters, as it may well be that the pressure of other important matters and the flight of time have caused honorable members to lose the continuity of the narrative. Moreover, since I last spoke, new members have come into this Chamber. Regretfully I have to admit that they have come from the wrong direction, carried in on a high tide of hysteria and terror artfully created by the Government which I have the honour to oppose. When the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> was speaking in regard to land tax, upon which he is an acknowledged expert, he described the history of the taxation of Crown leaseholds as a drama, of which the phase with which he was then dealing was the fourth and final act. Following the example of the honorable member, but adopting a different analogy, I shall call my dissertation on wireless a saga, and I introduce it with these words of Longfellow - </para>

                        <para>A saga of the days of old - a&#34;&#39; saga which, however, will be supported by history and will be regarded, if I may paraphrase the words employed by the new judge of the Arbitration Court, as an historical verity. I am glad to be able to give an historical review of the subject, because history ison the side of the Labour party. It is bearing out our prophecies and turning to dust and ashes the promises and prophecies of the Government. Therefore, in the public interest, history must be faithfully told. Besides, the poet has said, rightly, that &#34; hope springs eternal in the human breast,&#34; and we hope, in face of the inexorable logic of facts and history, that the Government may yet see its way to mend its course in regard to this most questionable and questioned agreement with Amalgamated Wireless Limited. The first epoch of this history may be said to have been ushered in by the draft agreement presented to this Chamber by the then Prime Minister, the right honorable W. M. Hughes, in the latter days of December, 1921. I do not pretend to know what were the influences that persuaded the right honorable gentleman to <inline font-style="italic">accept</inline> the draft agreement with the company, but I do know that he is still a director of it. The directorate consists of three representatives of the company and three representatives of the Commonwealth, the six electing a seventh director, and the whole seven, in due course, electing a  chairman.  The right honorable member for North Sydney is the seventh director, and I understand that, giving a wise and&#39; broad interpretation of his position and powers, he has decided that he cannot be removed unless by the unanimous decision of the other directors. That, I think, is characteristic of the right honorable gentleman. There is, however, some time limit to his services, but no doubt he will meet any change in the situation when the need arises. It was in December, 1921, or a little earlier, that that versatile gentleman, the present managing director of Amalgamated Wireless Limited, first made his presence felt in the lobbies of this Parliament, where he wore out a good deal of shoe leather while addressing himself, quite unsuccessfully, I am happy to know, to the then Postmaster-General (Mir. Wise), who, wisely but somewhat curtly, if not absolutely brutally, turned him down. Notwithstanding the strong stand taken by that Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk</inline> was active in other directions. This busy bee, after attempting to draw honey from the precincts of Federal Parliament House, proceeded to London, where he alighted on the then Prime Minister, who was attending an Imperial Conference. Apparently he was more successful with him than he had been with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise,</inline> for as soon as the right honorable gentleman returned to Australia he submitted the proposed agreement to this House for ratification. By common consent the agreement was one which this Parliament could not accept. We of the Labour party succeeded in rallying to our support sufficient members on the Ministerial side to have the question referred to a select committee. The Opposition did everything possible to ensure that after the committee had dealt with the agreement it should come again before this House for further consideration, but we were overborne, and the House decided that if the agreement were approved by the committee it might properly be signed by the Prime Minister. The agreement referred to the committee was of such a nature that it is hardly credible that any responsible man could have advocated its acceptance by Parliament. Pre-eminent amongst many radical defects was the provision that a majority of the directorate should represent Amalgamated Wireless Limited. Let me say at this stage that for all the practical good that resulted from their efforts the committee and the Opposition might well have saved themselves their trouble, because whatever was gained by the committee&#39;s inquiry and the suggestions which it subsequently made, and whatever improvements were made to the agreement as a result of its deliberations, have been successively given away by the present Government. Upon examination of experts, the committee found that there was no scientific certainty that a commercial wireless service of the kind required between Australia and the United Kingdom could in any circumstances be supplied in our present state of scientific knowledge. In that regard I shall quote from the notes of  evidence which accompanied the published report of the committee, and which have been previously referred to in this Chamber. I think that we owe it principally to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that these notes were prepared and embodied in the report, and the Prime Minister would, no doubt, be one of the first to acknowledge their accuracy, and the services rendered to the committee and the public by that honorable senator. On page 16 the report states - </para>
                        <para>On the one hand, the committee had the very valuable report of the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy .Commission of 1920, which dearly defined a commercial wireless service as one that guaranteed rapid, reliable, and continuous operating for 24 hours every day, and which also very positively stated that such a service was not practical beyond a distance of 2,000 to 3,000 miles. On the other hand, they had before them the draft agreements of the Amalgamated Wireless Company and the Radio Communication Company, which inferentially set out that a one-step service between Australia and the United Kingdom was commercially possible. </para>

                            stated that the Marconi Company has developed devices which would effectively prevent atmospherics interfering with received signals, and that the efficiency of any system depended on the provision of such contrivance. He was unable, however, to adequately reply to the opinions expressed by certain noted physicists and wireless technicians that some really effective anti-atmospheric eliminating invention was still urgently required to remove this most serious limitation to long distance radio-telegraphy.

It will be found, on turning to page 17 of the report, that at that stage there was no historic record of anything approaching a satisfactory commercial service of the nature for which we were bargaining. I recall these facts now because, while the Managing Director of Amalgamated Wireless Limited declared at that time that this system was so firmly established that it only awaited the necessary capital to enable it to be put into operation, the fact remains that even at the present time there is no scientific data upon which any sensible person would conclude that a commercial service of the kind promised could be furnished. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I need hardly say that Mr. Fisk, , in making his declarations of the competency of Amalgamated Wireless Limited to &#34; deliver the goods,&#34; was obviously influenced by an intense desire to have &#163;500,000 of Commonwealth money put into an undertaking which at that time had a capital, at the most, of &#163;200,000. I propose to endeavour to show that that capital was largely of a fictitious character, and probably did not amount to as much as even &#163;100,000. In addition to the Commonwealth, under the agreement, putting half a million into the company, the latter was to take over the Government plant at a valuation. If we turn to clause 6 of the agreement, which was executed on the 28th March, 1922 - an agreement approved of by the majority of the committee, although I, as a member of it, did not approve of it - we find that the company was to take over the following: </para>

                    <para class="block">Those were the main undertakings of the company; but, of course, it had become obvious to the committee and to the Prime Minister that it was idle to enter into an agreement with an optimistic gentleman such as the managing director of Amalgamated Wireless Limited without substantial guarantees, particularly in view of the facts elicited by the committee, not with the aid of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk,</inline> but in spite of him, as to the technical and scientific difficulties in the way. The Prime Minister, who was  chairman  of the committee, and became Treasurer at about that time, was probably the most insistent member in exacting guarantees from the company. I mention that, because history discloses that, although he was the strongest, as  chairman  of the committee, in standing for guarantees, as Prime Minister he has been the weakest in giving them away. At the top of page 10 of the agreement we read &#34; That the company shall not enter into or be a party to any commercial trust or combine, but shall always be and remain an independent British business.&#34; 1 pass on with the single remark that that undertaking also has been broken. That was the subject of some comment, and many questions were repeatedly asked by myself and other honorable members as to when the company would proceed to  &#39; deliver the goods. &#34; The Prime Minister, in reviewing the matter afterwards, when many extensions of time for which there did not appear to be any justification had been granted, said that the tender of the Marconi Company was accepted in September, 1923, and that it contemplated the erection in Australia of a station with 20 masts, each 800 feet high, at an approximate cost of &#163;480,000. It was at that stage that the Marconi Trust first came before the footlights. Members of the Labour party had suspected, and alleged, that Amalgamated &#34;Wireless Limited was an agent of the Marconi Trust, although it did not appear in that light in the agreement with the Commonwealth. On the contrary, wo were to have an allAustralian and British company, which was not to be associated with any trust. If Amalgamated Wireless Limited was not to operate the stations, why did it enter into the agreement with the Commonwealth for their erection and for the &#34;delivery of the goods?&#34; Most naturally, and as we had suspected it would, it immediately entered into an agreement with the Marconi trust. Tenders were called for, and were returnable at such short notice that it was perfectly obvious that only the Marconi trust, which had the fullest information on the matter, could possibly tender. We appealed to the Government to grant an extension of time at least for the acceptance of tenders, but it said, &#34; No; the matter is too urgent to grant an extension of time for even a few weeks.&#34; But it was not too urgent to extend the time for months and years to satisfy this company. Of course, Amalgamated Wireless Limited may as well have entered into an agreement with itself, or at least with &#34; father.&#34; We recognize that, apart from the financial gift of this generous Government, Amalgamated Wireless Limited is insignificant in comparison with the Marconi trust. The two companies are substantially one, or so closely akin as to make the difference between them negligible. At all events, an agreement was made under which the Marconi trust undertook to build stations and to give us the specified commercial service. Subsequently, according to practice, it applied for an extension of time. When I submitted to the Prime Minister a question as to whether, in view of the repeated failure of the Marconi trust to carry out its contract, he would cancel the agreement, as he had every right to do, he said that he had no intention of doing so-. Then came the anti-climax, the introduction of the Wireless Agreement Bill, in 1924, which subsequently became an act of this Parliament, the effect of which, to sum it all up, was to confirm the company in all its rights, and to relieve it of ail its material obligations. That is clearly shown by the following clause, which appears in the new agreement, which is the schedule to the act : - </para>

                    <para class="block">That gives away without consideration everything that the right honorable gentleman had taken such pains to secure, and upon which he had prided himself so much and so justifiably, in connexion with the work of the committee. It is true that that measure is an act of Parliament, and it is not for me to quarrel with the wisdom of Parliament in passing it; but it is for me, in giving the history of this matter, to state that what was done then was done through this Government misrepresenting the position. The Prime Minister, in introducing that bill, which was to relieve the company of its obligations, said that the new beam system that had been invented had completely revolutionized wireless, and changed the whole aspect of this matter. In passing, I make the following comment on that statement. First of all, so far from the beam system being new in 1924, Marconi had applied for a patent for it in 1917, and his application was rejected on the ground of want of novelty. As for the system revolutionizing wireless, the fact is that neither by the beam nor the high-power system has it yet been demonstrated that a commercial service is possible. One admitted fact about the beam system is that, if it meant anything at all, it meant cheaper and lower-powered stations and less expense. But the company, instead of requiring less and giving more, is giving less and requiring more. In fact, it is requiring the whole of the &#163;500,000 which this Commonwealth so unwisely contracted to give. On the 28th August, 1924, the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> asked the Prime Minister the following pertinent questions in regard to the matter.: - </para>

                    <para class="block">That was a very subtle jest from such an unlikely quarter. The Prime Minister said, in effect, &#34; If the cost is less, it will cost us less &#34; ; but he was not quite sure about it. The evidence before us at that time was that a beam station was being erected in England for about &#163;36,000. Yet under the new agreement with the Amalgamated Wireless Limited, beam stations to be erected in Australia were estimated to cost the extravagant maximum of &#163;120,000. The reason that the managing director of Amalgamated Wireless Limited wanted the &#163;500,001 was that he intended to spend &#163;480,000 on a high-powered station. In the light of the facts before us, &#163;120,000 was undoubtedly an extravagant maximum for a beam station; but it certainly gave opportunity for much saving as against &#163;480,000 for a high-power station. A little later I shall suggest some reasons for requiring the larger sum, but I wish to return for a few moments to the new wireless agreement of 1924, in which the managing director set out the excuses, rather than the reasons, which the company gave for asking, and asking not in vain, to be relieved of its obligations. These are set out in the preamble of the act as follows: - </para>

                    <para class="block">It was said, in effect, that the company was led to believe that the British Government would issue licences  for the erection of these stations in England, and that, by not doing so, it had deceived the company. I wish to say that successive British governments have made it perfectly clear that they would not give a licence to the Marconi trust to control wireless traffic with Australia. It is equally certain, on the other, hand, that the British Government would at any time issue a licence to this Government to erect and operate stations in England for the purpose of communication with Australia. Although I am not aware that I am famous for having placed any stones in the temple of Empire, I must say that it is a very poor compliment to British governments, whether Labour, Liberal, or Conservative, to allege that they have, in a churlish way, stood in the light of Australia providing . inter-Empire wireless communication. There is not a single historical fact upon which such a. charge could be justly made, though there aro abundant facts to show that various British Governments have regarded the operations of this partly German, partly American, and partly Italian and French trust as being inimical to Britain. I think they rightly refused, in our interests as well as their own, to allow it to be the sole controlling agency of wireless communication with- Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The British _ Government&#39;s contention is that the business must be controlled by the British Government itself. Does the right honorable gentleman expect to be allowed to establish in the heart of Britain power stations that are not subject to the control and supervision of the British Government? Would we allow Great Britain, or any other country, to construct in Australia, for the purpose of communication with the world, stations over which we had no control? And would be allow a foreign trust to do so? Assuredly we would not. </para>

He cannot substantiate that statement. The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr),</inline> when he was seeking to discredit me and others who had spoken on this subject, raised the point just mentioned by the Prime Minister. He introduced his speech with the observation that &#34; Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,&#34; and he very soon proved that he was no angel. The Marconi trust has been allowed to erect a station in England, as has been frequently mentioned; but the conditions are that the station is not to cost more than &#163;50,000, that it is to be subject to British control, and that it is to be built on the principle of &#34;no goods no payment.&#34; I find nothing in the conditions applicable to that station about relieving the Marconi trust of its obligations.

                    <para class="block">The difference between the two undertakings of 1921 and 1924 was the difference between twenty words a minute for twelve hours a day and 300 days a year, and 21,600 words a day for 300 days a year. Something, of course, has been done. Stations are partly erected at Rockbank and Ballan; but no service is available. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> asked what were the causes beyond the control of Amalgamated Wireless Limited. No one knows. It is probably true that there are causes beyond the control, and beyond the knowledge, of that firm. Beam wireless had not been sufficiently developed scientifically to enable the company to pledge itself, and to pledge the Commonwealth in the way it was allowed to do in 1921; and the position was practically unaltered in 1924. Still this company hood winks the Government with promises that it knows it cannot fulfil, or at the best hopes that it may be able to fulfil. The Government, when it entered into the last agreement, had before it conclusive evidence of serious technical difficulties. It knew that the managing director, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk,</inline> had understated the difficulties, and had attempted to mislead the committee regarding them. It knew, or ought to have known, when it entered into the second agreement, that the position was practically unchanged. It knew, or ought to have known, that the reasons alleged for broken faith were fictitious and disparaging to successive British Governments. And it  knew  perfectly well that the Marconi trust was a foreign corporation of world-wide influence, regarded as inimical to British interests by successive British Governments; and that Amalgamated Wireless Limited was, as it still is, a creature of this foreign trust. In these circumstances the obvious course for the Government was not to despise <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> advances of science any more than I despise them, but, taking advantage of scientific discovery so far as it had gone, to conduct its own experiments on the cheapest possible lines in step with the march of scientific progress. If it had done so, at a cost of probably one-fifth of the amount for which it has pledged the Commonwealth in connexion with this matter, it might have been to-day as far advanced, so far as communication between England and Australia is concerned, as it is under this agreement, and probably much further, because it would not then have introduced this foreign element which the present and previous British governments have been constantly resisting. In any case, we would not then have pawned our national assets and services. </para>
                    <para>That brings me to another phase of the matter. Our money is invested under a management that is not responsible to this Parliament.

                            <para>- That is so. I have obtained a copy of the balance-sheet for the year ended the 30th. June, 1925. It does not come under the purview of the Auditor-General, as the honorable member for Maribyrnong elicited. My information is the result of a private search. I find amongst the assets of the company * Patent rights, ?93,000.&#34; I challenge that item. I say that when the committee considered this question in 1921 it had expert evidence before it to show that many of the patents claimed by the Marconi trust were either expired and valueless, or were at least contested. We had evidence of which the committee took serious notice that claims made as to the value of Marconi&#39;s patents were grossly exaggerated. I ask the Prime Minister whether any one has examined the value of these patents alleged to be worth ?93,000. The Commonwealth is the principal shareholder in Amalgamated Wireless Limited. On paper it has 50 per cent., and one more of the shares. I venture to say that the Commonwealth owns four-fifths of the capital actually invested. Surely we should know something about the value of these patents, especially in the light of the history of that matter, and also because when it was before Parliament on a previous occasion a very interesting address was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> to whom I have just referred. Referring to the history of actions brought by the Marconi trust against the Commonwealth, he pointed out that we had brought <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> an expert from England, to examine the authenticity of the patents claimed by the Marconi&#39; trust, and that gentleman had reported favorably to the Commonwealth in the action then brought against it by that very trust. In spite of that fact the Government of the time unloaded a good deal of Commonwealth money under pressure. of an action by the trust on whom it is now dependent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> interjecting in the course of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> speech, and referring to the Marconi trust, said - </para>

                    <para class="block">That was advice from a friend. It is amazing, therefore, that Oris company, which not only was regarded as unfriendly by the &#34;British Government, but had instituted actions against the Commonwealth, and wrung damages from us in the courts on doubtful claims, should have been allowed to continue to control through Amalgamated Wireless Limited the whole wireless operations of Australia.. I have to- add in this regard that even the steel that is used in the erection of the towers at Ballan and Rockbank - if I can trust the information supplied to me by a workman on the job - has been brought across the seas from England, notwithstanding the covenant in the agreement that where practicable local manufactures will be used for the requirements of the company. </para>

During the year they investigated the latest- high power commercial wireless telegraph service, the latest developments in wireless telephony and broadcasting, and also the latest manufacturing methods in Britain, on the Continent, and in America. &#39; They made arrangements valuable to the company&#39;s business, and they brought back much information the value of which is very high. </para>

                    <para class="block">But, apparently, not capable of being assessed at &#163;128,291. I give the figures as they appear before me in a copy of the balance-sheet, but they may be subject to correction. In any case, they seem almost incredible. Even if they should turn out to be incorrect, the fact remains that the whole of the management and its staff are under no responsibility to this Parliament. The managing director is probably receiving a salary - I hazard the guess - of between &#163;3,000 and &#163;4,000 a year. When a judge is appointed to the High Court of the Commonwealth at a salary of &#163;3,000 a year, one of the highest appointments in the gift of this Parliament, he is subject to the ultimate control of the Parliament. Every member of the Public Service passes, as to his salary, under review before this Parliament every year before a penny can be paid to him ; but the managing director of Amalgamated Wireless Limited has no responsibility whatever to this Parliament. We have no control over <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk.</inline> He gambols like an irresponsible bellwether in the rich pastures which the Commonwealth provides for him, but, by a most unnatural inversion of the usual order, instead of yielding himself to the shears of the Commonwealth taxpayer,  the taxpayer has to yield himself to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk,</inline> to be shorn in due course. In Queen-street, Melbourne, and in York street, Sydney,, are immense buildings1 erected by Amalgamated Wireless Limited, and in them a staff of workers is engaged carrying on business and selling the manufactures of that company. We know nothing about them, who they are, what they do, or how they are paid. We know nothing about any system of bonuses, gifts, or graft which exists be-&#39;&#39; tween the managing director and any other person. We only know that we have invested &#163;500,001 in this company, and that those who contracted to deliver the goods have flagrantly dishonoured their undertakings. Is it not time that the Commonwealth Government was censured for this? In 1924 we made out a case respecting the then broken agreements, and the Prime Minister then succeeded in obtaining the vote of the majority of honorable members on this side of the House by virtue of the new guarantees which he was able to secure for their acceptance. Now after two years of futility on the part of the company, the Government should be prepared to admit that we have made out a case. Surely it will either retrace its steps, and relinquish the business altogether, or at least put the cards on the table, and let us investigate the facts. I do not believe, on the facts before us, that Amalgamated Wireless Limited has &#163;50,000 of assets, apart from our money. The money in the company, for all practical purposes, is ours. The honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin),</inline> to whose diligence I am indebted for some of my information, asked several questions in the House the other day. He asked, &#34; What amount has been paid to Amalgamated Wireless Limited for working expenses to 30th June, 1926 ?&#34; The answer was, &#34; &#163;251,958 lis. 9d.&#34; He asked,. &#34; What is the total amount that has &#39; been paid to the capital of Amalgamated Wireless Limited to 30th June, 1926?&#34; The answer was &#34;&#163;250,000 10s.&#34; He asked, &#34;What is the total amount that the Government has received from Amalgamated Wireless Limited to 30th June, 1926?&#34; The answer was &#163;106,228 lis. lOd. That leaves a debit balance of &#163;145,729 19s. Hd. The honorable member for Hindmarsh asked, &#34;Do the Commonwealth Government and </para>
                    <para class="block">Amalgamated Wireless Limited share equally in any profits received from the transactions of the partnership % &#34; The answer was, &#34; The Commonwealth Government, as holder of 500,001 shares in the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, will receive just over half of the profits of the Company, if any.&#34; The honorable member for Hindmarsh asked, &#34;Does the Commonwealth Government accept full liability for the losses in the business transactions of the partnership in wireless matters between the Amalgamated Wireless Limited/ and the Commonwealth Government ? &#34; The answer was, &#34; No, the only losses the Commonwealth Government would bear would be those as a shareholder in the Company.&#39;&#93; That is not very consoling to us. To bring the matter absolutely up to date, we find in the Estimates, page 405, under the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, the item, &#34; Subscription to capital of Amalgamated Wireless Limited 1926-27, &#163;250,001 ; erection of wireless stations and testing and experimental equipment, &#163;2,000.&#34; It seems to me that we not only paid up in full, but have exceeded our liability of &#163;500,000. </para>

                            <para>- I believe it to be a dishonest transaction, but if the matter is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> I leave it at that. It will probably be said that we have Commonwealth representatives on the board. We have, but who are they and to what extent are they answerable to us? They join the board and hear the announcements of the managing director - the gentleman who toured America and the Continent with his staff - and with the other directors they say &#34; Aye &#34; to his recommendations. They draw their fees and depart. To what other extent are they responsible to us? We can no doubt recall them, but we have no supervision of them, no means of knowing what they do, or what are the impulses which move them when they meet on a directorate. From every point of view it is high time that we called a halt respecting Amalgamated Wireless Limited. It would be generous and veracious for the Government at least to admit that it has made a mistake. I would feel much more respect for the Prime Minister, for whom at present I certainly entertain great respect, if he would candidly admit that he has been taken in, and that the influence of the Marconi Trust has been too subtle for him, having got the best of him in making this bargain. He should take the opportunity which now presents itself to cancel the agreement. When this Government keeps on giving away concessions to a contracting party, concessions which have a monetary value, it is doing politically as dishonest a thing as if it were dipping its hands into the Treasury and paying out the cash of the Commonwealth to that party. The Government has to justify its actions. T. shall take the opportunity to check the figures that I have quoted, one item of which is enormous, and may conceivably be a typographical error but, whether it is so or not, the principle is not affected. The Government deserves the severest censure of this House for investing large sums of money in a public company on a purely experimental and speculative enterprise; for entering into a fresh agreement with a defaulting party to a previous agreement, without obtaining adequate security for the interests of the Commonwealth in either agreement; for not attempting to enforce such agreement; for not investigating the real value of the alleged capital of the other contracting party; for paying into the company large sums of money in excess of its proven requirements, without audit or investigation as to how its moneys have been spent; and for allowing the company improperly to levy toll on the general public in respect of broadcasting. </para>

                            <para>. - I have heard the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> speak on many occasions in regard to wireless, and to-day I anticipated that in view of the all-embracing character of the amendment that he has moved, his speech would contain some substance, and constitute at least what might be termed an indictment of the Government and its action. But actually he said nothing that lie has not said many times before, and which he did not mention on a censure motion moved on a previous occasion. It is, however, necessary that I should deal again with the subjects raised by the honorable member. He referred to the beginning of the transaction under review, when an agreement&#39; was placed on the table of this House for the establishment .of a high-powered station in Australia, and the investment by the Commonwealth Government of &#163;500,000 in Amalgamated Wireless Limited. That agreement was the subject of investigation by a committee of which I was  chairman,  and the honorable gentleman a member. When we began our investigations we found that long-distance wireless on a commercial basis was not quite so simple and so sure as certain persons appeared to think. We had to investigate the technical possibilities of wireless for a distance as great as that between Great Britain and Australia. After hearing a great deal of evidence, the committee came to the conclusion that there was a prospect of a service being established and maintained between Great Britain and Australia, and, having regard to the tremendous importance to Australia of new and improved methods of communication, it recommended the agreement for acceptance, subject to certain modifications. To all the proceedings of the committee the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> was a party. He was one of the two lawyers who drafted the amended agreement, and at that time he gave no indication of dissent from the views of the majority of the committee. When the investigation had been completed, and every member of the committee was under the impression that the modified agreement had received unanimous approval, the honorable member forwarded a dissenting report. The honorable member had had ample opportunity to raise many of the objections which he has voiced to-day, but the only question to which he addressed himself was whether the patents which Amalgamated Wireless Limited claimed to own were of the value stated in its balance-sheet. If the honorable member was at that time seised of the importance of the matters with which he has dealt to-day he should have brought them before the committee. The fact that he failed to do so is evidence that these criticisms are mere afterthoughts. The real substance of the honorable member&#39;s objection to the agreement has always been that the control of wireless services should be retained by the postal department, and that no contract should be let to any private company. That view the honorable member is quite entitled to hold, but the majority of honorable members of this Parliament in 1921 did not agree with him, and decided to ratify the agreement with Amalgamated Wireless Limited. To-day the honorable member has told us that we should have examined the assets of the company in order to ascertain whether they actually held the patents, land, and other things which they claim to possess. The honorable member did not make that suggestion in 1921, probably because he knew perfectly well that such a course of action would be ludicrous. When he is thinking of investing a portion of that surplus wealth that I hope he possesses in a. company, the balance-sheet of which, duly certified by a reputable firm of auditors, he has studied, does he proceed to inspect the title deeds of the land which the company is supposed to hold, and does he appoint a valuator to check the values set down in the statement of assets and liabilities? Of course not, and the honorable member was talking arrant nonsense when he suggested that the Government should have made such an inquiry in regard to &#34; Amalgamated Wireless Limited. In dealing with the original agreement he referred particularly to paragraph 6, which contemplated the taking over by the company of the coastal wireless stations which had been, up to that time, operated by the postal department. This clause of the agreement provided that representatives of both parties should be appointed to value the assets to be taken over, and if they could not agree upon a valuation, an independent  chairman  should be appointed. The Commonwealth was to be entitled to set against its subscription to the company the amount of the valuation finally agreed upon. The honorable member for Batman wrongly said that nothing has been done to give effect to that provision of the agreement. Representatives of the parties did examine the stations and plant. Naturally their valuations dif.fered, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swanton,</inline> an independent expert, was appointed to adjudicate between them. Thus all the requirements of paragraph 6 have been complied with. </para>

                                <para>- I indicated that when the honorable member served on the committee he completely forgot to give any of the admirable advice he has given today. In regard to the high-power station and the maintenance of an overseas service, the agreement provided that the company should construct and maintain a high-power station in Australia and reciprocal stations in Great Britain and Canada. Tenders for the erection of the Australian station were called. The honorable member for Batman said that insufficient time was allowed for tenders to be. received, with the result that only the Marconi Company could tender. That is an old charge that has been refuted on previous occasions. The main point of the honorable member&#39;s criticism to-day was that Amalgamated Wireless Limited was relieved of its obligations under the agreement, and that the Marconi Company was relieved of its contract to erect a station in Great Britain. He said that the act passed in 1924 confirmed Amalgamated Wireless Limited in all its rights, and relieved it of all its obligations. After tenders had been invited in the ordinary way, a contract was made by Amalgamated Wireless Limited with the Marconi Company for the erection of a high-power station in Australia. One very prudent condition of the contract with the Marconi Company was that Amalgamated Wireless Limited required it to take over the obligation to provide a reciprocal station in Great Britain. Both when the original agreement waa made, and subsequently when the contract was let to the Marconi Company, it waa believed that the British Government would be prepared to issue a licence for the erection and maintenance of a high power station in Great Britain. The honorable member for Batman had a good deal to say about the British Government&#39;s refusal to do that. One of the witnesses before the select committee was the then Prime Minister, the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who stated that the institution of a chain system of wireless, which involved the erection of a series of stations each with a radius of 2,000 miles, had been discussed at the Imperial Conference in 1921, He had declared that such a system would not suit Australia, which proposed to endeavour to establish direct wireless communication with the United Kingdom, and the British Government had indicated that it would place no obstacles in the way of the establishment of the necessary station. The right honorable member told the committee that there was not the least shadow of doubt that the erection of such a station would be permitted, and that the station would be licensed by the British Government. Subsequent history disproved that statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law had made a statement in the House of Commons that the British Government was prepared to issue licences for the erection of stations for communication within the Empire. The subsequent &#39; actions of the Commonwealth &#34; Government and Amalgamated Wireless Limited were based upon that assurance. Later, however,&#39; the British Government declined to  act in accordance with the promise given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law on behalf of his Ministry, and declared that no licence would be issued for a high-power wireless station communicating within the Empire. I stress the words &#34; within the Empire.&#34;  When that happened, it was obvious that we could not hold the company to the obligation to provide, equip, and operate a station in Great Britain. Consequently, the 1924 agreement was drawn up, and it was endorsed by this Parliament. That agreement relieved Amalgamated Wireless Limited of an obligation which it was impossible for it to fulfil, because of the action of the British Government. Does anybody suggest that there is anything sinister in the fact that the company was not held to its contract, and that damages were not sought for the non-fulfilment of terms that could not be carried out ? That is my first reply to the statement that the agreement was one to confirm the company in all its rights and to relieve it of all its obligations. The suggestion is ludicrous. </para>

                        <para>I am amazed that an honorable member should take up the attitude that the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> assumed regarding the British Government&#39;s action in the matter of licences.  His  enthusiastic support of that action was due to his wish to suggest that there was some sinister connexion between the Commonwealth Government and the Marconi Company. He wished it to be inferred that the British&#34; Government saw through the Marconi Company, and was determined not to grant it a licence. He suggested this, and tried to establish a connexion between the Commonwealth Government and the Marconi Company in order that he might do harm to the present administration. I ask the honorable member to reflect whether, knowing the circumstances as he did, that was a proper thing for him to do. As a matter of fact the Marconi Company to-day has a licence from the British Government to communicate by wireless in Great Britain with foreign countries. But the British Go&#39;vernment has said to Australia and the other dominions, &#34; We shall not grant a licence to you or to any company to communicate by wireless from stations in Great Britain.&#34; Personally, I have taken a determined attitude on that matter, and I propose to continue to do so. I recognize that every government is entitled to say who shall receive a licence for wireless transmission within its territory; but the protest that I have made, and will continue to make, is against the action of the British Government in granting licences in Great Britain for wireless &#39; communication with foreign countries, and refusing to give us a similar licence. </para>

                                <para>- It wishes to retain control of wireless within the Empire. We have indicated our willingness to give any guarantees, and abide by any conditions intended to safeguard Empire communication, that the British Government may choose to prescribe; but we do not subscribe to the view that the whole of our business should be conducted through the British Post Office while wireless communication between other countries may be conducted through other agencies to which licences have been issued. The honorable member, however, suggested that there was some sinister connexion between this Government and the Marconi Company, and that the reason why we could not obtain a licence from the British Government was that that Government was suspicious of the Marconi Company, with which the Commonwealth Government appeared to be so friendly. For that suggestion, there is not the slightest foundation. </para>

                        <para>The other matter that the honorable member emphasized was the cancellation of the original contract for the establishment of a high-power station and the substitution of a beam station in its place. He suggested that there -was not the slightest ground for believing that a beam station would be a success, and spoke as though the conditions - relating to wireless were exactly the same now as they were three or four . years ago. The fact is that great advances have been made, and it cannot now be disputed that the beam system is successful, and can be operated over great distances. To have persisted in the original proposal to erect a high-power station, at a cost of nearly &#163;500,000, instead of substituting for it a beam station at a maximum cost of &#163;120,000, would have meant ignoring these advances in wireless communication. </para>

                                <para>- They do not. The British station was to cost &#163;44,920, if a public electrical supply was available, or &#163;50,420 if that was not available. The figure mentioned by the honorable member for Batman was not the correct one. The honorable member spoke about Australian material in a manner intended to prejudice the fair consideration of the whole matter, and therefore it is necessary for me to give the exact facts. When the question of supplying Australian material arose, the  chairman  of the board, who is one of the directors nominated by the Government, communicated with the Ministry and asked what was its attitude on the matter. I replied that the directors should ensure that the same system was . adopted in regard to purchases by Amalgamated Wireless Limited as operated in Commonwealth departments; that a certain preference, in addition to the tariff protection, was to be given. The actual amount of the preference was indicated, but, for obvious reasons, it is not desirable that it should be made public. There is no justification for the suggestion that all the material was to be imported, and that Australian industries were to be overlooked. The honorable member referred to the fees paid to the board of directors. He took the balance-sheet and quoted the sum of &#163;128,000 which appeared on the expenditure side in the ordinary trading account. He did not explain that that figure represented the expenditure for the conduct of the business of the company for a year, nor did he quote figures from the other side of the balance-sheet showing what business had been done. In the accounts of even the most successful trading concern, the expenditure is affected by the quantity of business done ; but the honorable member tried to give the impression that this &#163;128,000 was made up of excessive travelling fees paid to directors and other improper items. In the Wireless Agreement Act it is provided that three of the directors of the company shall represent the Commonwealth and three other directors the old company, and that there shall be a seventh director, but it is not provided that the seventh director shall be the  chairman.  At the present time, the Government directors are <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Mason Allard, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Vicars, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> D. Millen. The honorable member quoted with a good deal of approval the opinions  of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and he is probably convinced that the interests of the Commonwealth are fairly well safeguarded by having <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> on the board. There are three other directors representing the shareholders in the old company, and the seventh director is the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who was appointed to the board when Prime Minister, and when great difficulty was experienced in obtaining a seventh director acceptable to both sides. The  chairman  of the board is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Mason Allard, a director nominated by the Government. That fact should convince the committee that the Government&#39;s interests are fairly well represented. The  chairman  was elected by the vote of the whole board. Another point that the honorable member dealt with had reference to patents. I shall not deal at length with that matter at present, for legal actions are pending, both with regard to patents for transmission, such as would interest broadcasting companies, and patents with regard to reception which would apply to receiving sets owned by individuals. It was extraordinarily improper for a member of the House to enter upon a discussion of the matter seeing that it is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> Although one might forgive the ordinary lay member, it is difficult to forgive a member who is a legal practitioner, for having expressed the opinion that the honorable member for. Batman did in the few words he said about the patents owned by Amalgamated Wireless Limited, especially as he had no personal knowledge of them. </para>

                                <para>- Although the validity of these patents is the subject-matter of action in our law courts, the honorable member, notwithstanding that he is a lawyer, did not hesitate to suggest that the patents of Amalgamated Wireless Limited were worthless. It was extremely improper for him to do so. Another matter which the honorable gentleman presented to the committee - as he always does in these circumstances in the way that suits him, and irrespective of the facts of the case - had relation to the amount which had been paid by the Government to Amalgamated Wireless Limited in connexion with the operation of our coastal stations. After the agreement was entered into with Amalgamated Wireless Limited the coastal stations, conducted by the Government, were handed over to the company to work on behalf of the Government, but the Government accepted for three years the responsibility for the actual operating losses. On this point the following questions were asked me in this House - </para>

                        </quote>
                        <para>My replies were - &#163;251,958 lis. 9d. and &#163;106,228 lis. lOd. respectively. Those figures show that the Government paid out &#163;147,729 19s. lid. more than was received, or something like &#163;35,000 a year under this heading. The honorable member for Batman told the committee, on the strength of figures that he quoted, that this was a fairly good thing for Amalgamated Wireless Limited, but an amazing undertaking for the Government. The honorable member was a member of the Wireless Committee, and he knows, what is not known to the majority of honorable members of the committee, that prior to handing over these stations the Government was losing between &#163;35,000 and &#163;40,000 a year in respect of them. Under the arrangement with Amalgamated Wireless Limited  it was relieved of every obligation in the matter from the 30th March, 1926. In the future, Amalgamated Wireless Limited will itself bear any loss incurred. I venture to say that on this point, as well as on others that I have referred to, the honorable member presented his case in a grossly unfair way. If he had not known the facts, one could have excused him on the ground that he had quoted the figures in good faith ; but no honorable member of the committee knows the exact position better than he, and his presentation of the case was calculated to mislead the House. The honorable member next proceeded to deal with the subscription of capital to Amalgamated Wireless Limited. Under the agreement the Government is under obligation to provide capital to the extent of &#163;500,001 as and when it may be called up. The utilization of the capital, or the manner in which it shall be called up, depends upon the business the company does. If its operations are successful, and it is rendering a really valuable service to the country, it is quite possible that the whole &#163;500.001 may be called up this year; but if it is not successful, very little may be required. The amount that the Commonwealth has paid over so far is &#163;250,000 10s., representing 10s. on each &#163;1 share it holds. </para>

                                <para>- Prior to the Commonwealth joining the company, its capital was about &#163;200,000. Subsequently, when the erection of high-power stations was contemplated, the capital was increased to &#163;1,000,000, of which the Commonwealth undertook to subscribe &#163;500,001. The balance, consisting of the difference between the amount already subscribed by the old shareholders and &#163;499,999 due bv them, is to be subscribed by the other shareholders. The capital due by them and by the Commonwealth is called up in equal amounts. The idea that Amalgamated Wireless Limited is only another name for the Marconi Company ran all through the speech delivered by the honorable member for Batman; but I do not know how, with the facts in his possession, he could even suggest such a thing. At any rate, I am sure that honorable members will not entertain the idea for a moment when I put the position clearly before them. In the first place, 500,001 of the 1,000,000 shares in Amalgamated Wireless Limited are held by the Commonwealth Government. T  regret  that I have not the names of the other shareholders with me at the moment, but the merest consideration of the list would be sufficient to dismiss the suggestion that the Marconi Company is even a considerable shareholder or could influence a large body of shareholders. The register of shareholders is open for inspection by honorable members at the company&#39;s office. If they would examine it they would find that the Marconi Company owns about 40,000 or 50,000 shares. I am speaking from memory, but my impression is that the number is not above that. Amalgamated Wireless Limited is not, and cannot be, brought under the domination of the Marconi Company. The only way in which the Marconi Company comes into the picture at all is as the successful tenderer for the erection of the beam stations just outside Melbourne. Tenders were invited for this work in the ordinary way, and the Marconi Company was successful. But in the light of all the facts, its passes &#39;my comprehension how any person could imagine for a moment that it controls Amalgamated Wireless Limited. I am sorry that this matter has occupied so much attention, and that the committee has been delayed in its consideration of what I may call more modern affairs. The honorable member for Batman seems to find it necessary to give the subject an airing every now and again, but I assure the committee that there is nothing whatever in his charges. </para>

                                <para>- That is so. A number of honorable members opposite who did not hear the speech of the honorable member for Batman have not hesitated to express their approval of the remarks of the Prime Minister. In my opinion the honorable member for Batman has rendered the country a great service in bringing this important matter before the committee. If all the lights were turned on and the whole history of Amalgamated Wireless Limited disclosed, there would be something approaching a grave scandal. If the honorable the Treasurer were still, sitting on the ministerial cross benches he would support the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> by demanding a full investigation of the operations of this company. The right honorable the Prime Minister tried to make it appear that the honorable member for Batman had done something objectionable, atrocious, absurd, and ludicrous. He said that the honorable member had talked &#34;arrant nonsense&#34;; he did not attempt to reply to him, but tried to discredit him by casting aspersions upon the way in which he had presented his case. It is not necessary for me to tell honorable members, who heard the honorable member for Batman, that he presented his case in a masterly manner. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who is a nationalist, and was a member of the Select Committee appointed to inquire into the wireless agreement presented to this Parliament in 1921, speaking in the Senate on the 11th September, 1924, criticized Amalgamated Wireless Limited for not fulfilling its obligations under the 1922 agreement. He said - </para>

                        <para class="block">Because the honorable member for Batman has pointed out to-day that the beam station is six months overdue, and that Amalgamated Wireless Limited has not carried out the terms of the agreement, he is told by the Prune Minister that he is talking &#34; arrant nonsense.&#34; In the next breath the Prime Minister praised <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> as a man who could be trusted ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> opinion is that the Government had no right to enter into the agreement, that the company has flouted the agreement, and that &#34; the position is becoming almost a scandal.&#34; When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that, he. knew his book; it was then two years after the first agreement had been entered <inline font-style="italic">into,</inline> for he was speaking during the discussion in the Senate on the Wireless Agreement Bill of 1924. Can any honorable member say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> did not  know the facts? What did the Government do to quieten him? It placed him on the board of management. No doubt it was dangerous that such a man should be directing attention to what appeared to him a scandal. He will do his part on the board as well as he can, but he is only one man among seven, and his wings will be clipped. </para>
                        <para>I intend to deal with this subject under two headings. The first is &#34;Broadcasting,&#34; with particular reference to copyright patent royalties, and licence fees. The second heading is &#34; the agreement between the Commonwealth Government and Amalgamated Wireless Limited.&#34; The honorable member for Batman has dealt so ably with the agreement that it is not necessary for me to state all the details, but, as a representative of the electors in this Parliament, I- want to know what the Government is obtaining for the huge sums of money put into Amalgamated Wireless Limited. All honorable members, irrespective of party, should insist upon knowing what the Government has obtained from the agreement, and what it is likely to obtain in the future. Are the gentlemen connected with Amalgamated Wireless Limited to be allowed to flout the agreement, and to make the right honorable the Prime Minister their apologist in this House ? Must we accept the Prime Minister&#39;s statement that the company has done everything that can reasonably be expected of it, and that certain circumstances beyond its control have prevented it from carrying out the terms of the agreement? That plausible excuse might be accepted in the Nationalist party or Country party caucus, but it is not accepted by honorable members on this side of the chamber. The Government has admitted, in reply to questions, that it has paid &#163;250,000 10s. into the capital of Amalgamated Wireless Limited, and &#163;251,900 towards the working expenses of the company.  Is it any wonder that honorable members en this side say that the Government, instead of entering into this partnership, should have nationalized wireless in this country? The Imperial Wireless Committee  of 1924, when reporting on wireless in England, said: - </para>

When the honorable member for Batman makes the same suggestion here the same as the Imperial Wireless Committee made  in England, he is told that he is talking &#34; arrant nonsense.&#34; The Prime Minister was in a tight corner this afternoon, and when he found that he could not reply to the allegations of the honorable member for Batman, he resorted to abuse, which is frequently the refuge of those who are bereft of argument. Amalgamated Wireless Limited has paid to the Government &#163;106,228, and the Government has paid to the company &#163;250,000 10s. towards its capital, and &#163;251,900 towards its working expenses. </para>

The Government apparently desires to shroud the whole thing in mystery, and information concerning the operations of the company has to be dragged from it. The honorable member for Batman was aware that the service was conducted at a loss before the establishment of Amalgamated Wireless Limited. The Prime Minister has said that the loss was approximately between &#163;35,000 and &#163;40,000 per annum. At the time of the establishment of Amalgamated Wireless Limited the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> offered members of this House a sugar-coated pill. He said that, if we put this money into Amalgamated Wireless Limited, we should get rid of the annual deficit of approximately &#163;40,000 on our wireless service and should secure a. most efficient international service in addition. Three years later we find that nothing has been done to give us the efficient international service we were promised when Parliament was asked to put over &#163;500,000 of the people&#39;s money into this company, and the annual deficit in connexion with wireless services is mounting up. The aggregate of the outstanding amount has now reached the sum of &#163;145,672. </para>

Nearly fifteen months have since elapsed, and we have received nothing for the money we have put into Amalgamated Wireless Limited, and are still faced with the colossal outstanding sum of &#163;145,672. The Prime Minister mentioned that Great Britain would not grant Amalgamated Wireless Limited  a  licence to work a high-power station in England as a channel of communication  with. Australia. The right honorable gentleman has given that as the reason why Amalgamated Wireless Limited has failed to carry out its obligations under the agreement. He has said that the refusal of the British Government to grant the company a licence to operate a high power station in England was due to a feud between the British Government and the Marconi Company. Speaking on the 26th of August, .1924, when introducing the bill dealing with the matter, the right honorable gentleman said - </para>

                        <para class="block">As a matter of fact, there was no feud between the British Government and the Marconi Company, but the Ramsay MacDonald Government at the time was averse to granting licences for wireless to Amalgamated Wireless Limited, because it suspected that it was really the Marconi trust, and its policy was to grant licences only for high-power stations controlled by the British Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. The attitude of Great Britain in the matter is shown in the Donald report of 1924, which clearly sets out the view of the experts who inquired into the matter, which was that the public ownership of wireless stations in Britain on the principle of the telegraphs was the ideal scheme. The British Government knew that the real power behind Amalgamated Wireless Limited was the Marconi trust, and the attitude adopted by the MacDonald Government was in the circumstances quite justified. It was known that Amalgamated Wireless Limited represented an amalgamation of the Telefunken Company of Germany domiciled in Australia and the Marconi Company in Great Britain, and the MacDonald Government believed that such an important matter as a high-power wireless station should not be controlled by Amalgamated Wireless Limited. There would not have been any opposition to the grants ing of a licence to the Australian Government. The business thing for the Commonwealth Government to have done was to cable the British Government and ascertain its views upon the proposal before it entered into any obligations with Amalgamated Wireless Limited. That is the course which should have been followed before the people of Australia were committed to an expenditure of over &#163;500,000. We are told by the Prime Minister that his Government is a business government; hut it has not acted as one would have expected a business government to act. If any member of the committee were purchasing a property with a view to building on it, he would enter into any obligations concerning it until he had found out all about the building by-laws in the council area concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ernest</inline> Fisk, when asked by the select committee appointed to inquire into this matter whether he could give guarantees that certain things could be done said that he would have to cable to Marconi. </para>

Is it any wonder that the honorable member for Batman should say that Ernest Fisk was being used by and was a representative of the Marconi trust. At various times Fisk was responsible for newspaper stunts in regard to wireless, and said that he had communicated satisfactorily between his home and that of Marconi. This shows that he was in constant communication with Marconi. He endeavoured to show that the wireless system which he advocated was a commercial system. The honorable member for Batman never denied, what was admittedly true, that wireless communications did pass, but, as he rightly pointed out, there was no guarantee of a continuous service such as that stipulated to be supplied under the agreement. I should like to know from the Postmaster-General when we are to get the beam station which was promised, and which is to-day six months overdue. </para>

I want to know from the Postmaster-General how often these stations issue a balance-sheet, what is their financial position, how much they spend on programmes, what interest they are making on the money invested by their shareholders, and what the public is getting from them for what it pays. Cannot the programmes be improved? The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 24th June, 1926, in its special wireless column, asked for some information on these points. I purpose to quote what it said, because Ministers try to make out that honorable members on this side bring up these questions merely for party political purposes. This is what the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> said - </para>

                            <para>Under the Broadcasting Regulations, which were prepared two years ago, it is competent for the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department to review generally broadcasting conditions in Australia at the end of next month. (That means at the end of this month.) ... As the licences under which &#34; A &#34; Class stations are operating were issued for a period of five years, it is unlikely that any radical change in broadcasting conditions will be made; but there is a wide scope for the department to make alterations of a more detailed nature, which, nevertheless, may have an important effect on broadcasting conditions in Australia. Broadcasting finance is one of the matters which genuinely require attention. . . . Dissatisfaction is steadily growing at the fact that the financial operations of so important a public service as a broadcasting station are not made public. As the broadcasting companies are removed from the category of ordinary private enterprises, by the fact that they are enjoying a monopoly, it is felt that the regulations should be amended to provide for an account being given of the manner in which money collected from listeners-in is expended. . . . Host people will agree with the opinions expressed at Ballarat, on Tuesday night, that action to improve the broadcasting service for country listeners is now justified. </para>

                        <para>What is the Minister&#39;s reply to that statement? Will he present the balance-sheets of the broadcasting stations, and let us know what they are doing? Will he tell us how the listening-in fees are being expended, and whether it is possible to provide better programmes for the general public ? </para>

It is difficult to ascertain the profit that 3LO is making, because no balance-sheet has- been presented. The public does not know whether  listeners-in  are getting a fair return for their money. Practically a monopoly has been given to a small coterie of persons who are using 3LO to advertise themselves. It is estimated that the weekly income of 3LO is &#163;1,000. It costs that company approximately &#163;65 a week for rental paid to Amalgamated Wireless Limited. The orchestra is paid about &#163;60 a week, and about &#163;200 is paid in royalties on the transmission plant to Amalgamated Wireless Limited. The artists are paid, approximately, &#163;200 a week, and the wages of the staff amount to about &#163;50 a week, making a total weekly expenditure of &#163;575. The revenue of the company is &#163;1,000 a week, and taking its expenditure at, approximately, &#163;600, its net profit is &#163;400 a week. The nominal capital of the company is &#163;100,000, but the actual paid-up capital is, approximately, &#163;6,000. Therefore, the company is making a profit of 346 per cent, on the paid-up capital. Under the wireless regulations the Postmaster-General may call upon a broadcasting company to produce its profit and loss account and its balance-sheet, which documents may be tabled in the House. I am anxiously awaiting the tabling of the balance-sheets of 3LO and other companies. We shall then be in a position to know whether, at the expiration of five years - the term for which, the A-Class licence was granted to 3LO - broadcasting should be placed under the control of a public corporation, such as that which will control broadcasting in Great Britain, in accordance with the recommendation made by the British Broadcasting Committee of 1925, and approved by the  British Government. What is the position in Australia to-day? Those controlling 3LO are trying to obtain control of other broadcasting stations, and so get a monopoly. I am told that &#163;1,666 13s. 4d. has been paid by 3LO as a deposit in connexion with the purchase of 3AR. </para>

This national Parliament is discussing a matter of far-reaching importance, involving, among other things, the consideration of the Marconi Trust, whose operations are recognized to be world-wide. It is clearly obnoxious to both common sense and elementary justice if an honorable member, wishing to discuss the subject in all its various ramifications, can be met with the objection that somewhere some person has instituted legal proceedings, which touch it at some point. If the Postmaster-General satisfies you, sir, that a writ has issued affecting specific parties, and that the claim is definitely connected with the matter under discussion, you are acting rightly in preventing the continuance of the discussion ; but I hope that you will not use your position to prevent a complete ventilation of what we consider to be grave scandals in connexion with this matter, merely on the ground that some person&#39; has commenced legal proceedings, which touch one of the parties, or their various interests, at some particular point. </para>

                                <para>-  I am surprised at a member of the legal profession wishing to discuss a matter that is now before the courts. A writ has been issued by Victorian Broadcasters Limited, to restrain the Postmaster-General from paying over to 3 AR. an amount of money due to that firm, the reason for the restraint being that 3 LO. has purchased the broadcasting station 3 AR. The courts have been dealing with the matter, and the Postal Department is refusing to pay over any money until the decision of the courts is given. </para>

                                <para>-  I am inclined to dispute the statement of the Postmaster-General. The matter is not yet before the court. Over a week ago the Postmaster-General prevented me from discussing this matter by saying that it was <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and I have since been assured that I was wrongly ruled out of order on that occasion. I believe that your ruling now, sir, is wrong, and I ask under what standing order it is given. </para>

                                <para>- If the Postmaster-General had not intervened so hurriedly, a great deal of time -would have been saved. .His interruption of my remarks creates the impression that there is about this matter something murky and suspicious which he does not want the public to know. I was about to say that 3AR controls the Tasmanian broadcasting station 7ZL, and holds a large block of shares in the South Australian broadcasting station 5CL. In order to get a monopoly, 3LO arranged to purchase the business of 3AR, but the shareholders in the latter company refused to ratify the agreement made by its directors, and the matter is now the subject of litigation. It is not in the public interest that one firm  should  be allowed to get a monopoly of wireless broadcasting throughout Australia, especially as I have been informed that 3LO is making a profit of 348 per cent, on the capital invested. Wireless will be of immense importance in the future development of Australia, and if properly managed it should convey to the people in the backblocks, and on remote portions of our coast, the educational and recreational advantages to be derived from hearing the best speakers and entertainers in the continent. If, however, the business is to be commercialized, and a few people are to be allowed to monopolize broadcasting in order to make great profits, the best programmes will not be distributed, and broadcasting will not be the popular and the great national service that it could and should be. The first A class broadcasting licences in Australia were issued to Farmer and Company Limited, Sydney, one for New South Wales, and one for Victoria. The latter was sold to 3LO, Melbourne, the  consideration being 39,999 shares paid up to 17s. per share in a company of 100,000 shares, known as the Broadcasting Company of Australia Proprietary Limited, whose broadcasting station is 3LO. The shareholders in that company are Farmer and Company, Sydney, 39,999 shares, paid up to 17s. ; J. C. Williamson Limited, 3,999 shares; J. and N. Tait, 3,999 shares; Buckley and Nunn, 5.000 shares and one-third of the profits derived from the sale of sets; and the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Weekly Times</inline> Limited, 15,000 shares, each paid up to ls. 3d. -Farmer and Company, of Sydney, and Buckley and Nunn, of Melbourne, are practically under the one control. J and N. Tait controls Allan and Company, the music warehouse, of Collins-street, and reaps both the copyright charges and a share of the profits of the broadcasting company. </para>

We also notice that the <inline font-style="italic">Listener In</inline> is connected with this little group. The circulation of that journal is approximately 42,000.

The <inline font-style="italic">Listener In</inline> is the only newspaper in Victoria to which 3LO will supply a full week&#39;s programme ahead, and the Postmaster-General allows that to be done.

                                <para>- Yes. Such an inquiry is urgently needed. The <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> is able to disseminate news by wireless in such a way and at such times that it will not interfere with the sales of its daily newspaper, because it broadcasts only stale news. The news published in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> at 4 p.m. is not broadcast by wireless until 10 p.m. This journal, of course, gets a good advertisement, and so also does the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> but what about the <inline font-style="italic">Age?</inline> The present Government should not be a party to the granting of privileges to a favoured few. Let us now consider the advantages that J. C. Williamson Limited enjoys. Its wireless programmes are so compiled that they do not conflict with its ordinary &#34; shows.&#34; This firm gives publicity to such portions of its other entertainments as it desires to transmit by wireless. It advertises its own artists, who supply listeners- in with &#34; dressing room talks.&#34; I do not know how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hugh</inline> Ward gets on; he, apparently, is &#34;not in the joke.&#34; Only songs on which copyright charges are payable to Allan and Companyare broadcast, other songs are suppressed. That fact alone is sufficient to justify an inquiry. Although there are quite a number of gramophones on the market, &#34; Sonora &#34; records only are played by the Broadcasting Company, Allan and Company being the agents for the &#34; Sonora &#34; gramophone. </para>

                        <para class="block">The broadcasting company&#39;s accounts in Australia should be audited and laid before Parliament. The decision in Great Britain to nationalize broadcasting was arrived at, not by a Labour Government, but by the Baldwin Administration. According to a statement published in the press some time ago, the British Government decided to adopt all the recommendations of the broadcasting committee in detail. The British Post Office will, in future, control broadcasting in Great Britain, and it will not be commercialized and exploited for the benefit of one section of the people to the detriment of the general community. The six big electrical&#39; firms in Great Britain will no longer have complete control of it, as they have had since its inception. I hope the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> will allow that to sink into his mind. The British control will be vested in a broadcasting commission on which the interests of the general public and listeners-in will be represented. The Labour party desires similar action to be taken in Australia. I urge the Government to appoint a royal commission to inquire into this matter. I am sure that careful consideration of the subject would cause the Government to follow the example of Great Britain, and not allow broadcasting here to continue to be controlled by a few private companies. I am glad to say that the Queensland Government took care that no private company should obtain a monopoly of broadcasting in that State. It established its own station, which is known as 4QG. I have dabbled a little in wireless, and in New South Wales I know that 4QG can be heard even better than the Sydney stations. </para>

                            <para>- The Postmaster-General can have inquiries made into that matter if he desires. My point is that the station is run for the benefit of the nation, and not in the interests of a few private shareholders. That is as it should be. We do not run our Education Departments with the idea of making a monetary profit out of them. There is something which far transcends all considerations of that description. In the future, wireless is destined to play a large part in educational affairs, particularly in the back-blocks of Australia. The Queensland Labour Government has no ambition to make a mere financial success of its broadcasting station, but spends all the revenue obtained from it in improving the programmes. It will be regrettable if wireless in Australia becomes a profitmaking concern for a few shareholders in wireless companies. 3LO is making a profit of 346 per cent, on its actual paid-up capital. About twelve months ago, the New Zealand Government, in consequence of complaints that had been made, gave its attention to problems of broadcasting, and introduced a bill, which Parliament passed, empowering it to conduct all the broadcasting business in that dominion. I submit that we should do the same. Another matter for serious complaint in regard to broadcasting is that heavy royalties are demanded on all gramophone records and copyright music that is broadcast. The Australian Performing Rights Association, which represents principally such firms as Allan and Company and Paling and Company, demands substantial fees as copyright royalties from the broadcasting companies. </para>

                                <para>- None at all. The Australian Performing Rights Association claims to control the copyright in Australia of 98 per cent, of copyright musical works, and it has refused to give 5CL particulars of the works it controls. Thus 5CL only has 2 per cent, of available copyright works which it can broadcast without the consent of the association. The board controlling 5CX in a statement on this matter said - </para>

                            <para>Our difficulty is the greater since the copyright can exist without being registered. So far we have been unable to find any means by which we can ascertain whether the Performing Rights Association control any particular copyright work. This morning we asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edwards,</inline> the secretary of the association, to go through our musical programme for to-day, to-morrow, and Monday, and inform us whether any items included were works of which his association controlled a copyright. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edwards</inline> replied that he could not do so without referring the matter to Sydney. </para>

                        <para class="block">The broadcasting companies are undoubtedly being unfairly interfered with, and the whole matter demands investigation. The Australian Performing Rights Association demands from each &#34;A&#34; class station in Australia 10 per cent, of its revenue from broadcast listeners&#39; ordinary licences, after deducting the royalty payable to Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited, for the use of the patented articles at the station. Amalgamated Wireless Limited received 20 per cent, of the 5CL&#39;s revenue from all sources. The listeners&#39; licence-fee is 27s. 6d., out of which the Government takes 2s. 6d. ; approximately 5s. is payable to Amalgamated Wireless; and now this association demands 2s. for each licence. </para>
                        <para class="block">But the payment does not end there. That 10 per cent, confers upon 5CL the right to broadcast not more than 8,400 performances of the association&#39;s copyright musical works for the year, or approximately one such item during each half-hour of its programme, which begins at 11 a.m. and ends at 11 p.m. daily. The management of 50L, commenting on this, said - </para>

                            <para>It will be impossible for 5CL to limit their programme to one musical item every half hour, and if we exceed that number we are likely to become liable to the association for a further payment, for the association seeks to bind us to paying an additional 1 per cent, of our revenue from ordinary licences for every 840 performances in excess of 8,400. If we broadcast on an average two copyright musical items every half-hour, they would seek to call upon us to pay an additional 10 per cent, or 20 per cent, in all. If we entered into the agreement which the association sought to impose on us, we would not know what expenditure we were, incurring until we received the association&#39;s account. In the present state of our knowledge we would have no means of checking that account. These payments for patent and copyright would make such inroads into our revenue that after paying our ordinary working expenses, including engineers, staff, and maintenance of plant, there would be only a limited amount of revenue available for programmes, which would suffer in consequence. </para>

                        <para class="block">I contend that the time is ripe for the Commonwealth to legislate in regard to copyright and patent fees, under paragraph xviii. of section 51 of the Constitution, which confers upon this Parliament the power to deal with &#34; copyrights, patents of inventions and designs.&#34; I have still another complaint. The position in regard to broadcasting band music is very unsatisfactory. At a radio conference held in Sydney in May of this year, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> J. Mc. Maclardy,  of Broadcasters Sydney Limited, pointed out that the Performing Rights Association demanded a fixed licence fee of &#163;100 a year in respect of band music, but reserved the right to alter that to any amount at any time it thought fit. That shows what a tight grip the association has on broadcasting. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Maclardy  has also stated that he had had 250 plays and musical comedies withdrawn from him by J. C. Williamson Limited, about 100 of which had been withdrawn lately, to say nothing of what the actual musical copyright people had withdrawn. No reason was given for the withdrawal of these plays and Broadcasters were not given the opportunity to use them even by the payment of a fee. The Residential Hotels Association took counsel&#39;s opinion as to the power of the Performing Rights Association to enforce its demands, and it appears that, as the law stands at present, it can do absolutely anything it likes in the matter. This also is surely a matter that merits the closest investigation. It is remarkable that at present three royalties are demanded on every gramophone record. One is paid in America, another is paid when a record reaches Australia, and still another when it is broadcast. I am of the opinion that the Commonwealth Government should fix, without delay, the scale of fees that shall be paid in respect of copyrights and patents. At present, the Performing Rights Association is taking about 21 per cent. The copyright law provides for payment of a copyright fee for the life of the author, and for 40 years afterwards; but for a Beethoven sonata, which was recently broadcast, although Beethoven has been dead for 92 years, the broadcasters were charged copyright, because five years ago the composition was reset to trio music in America. </para>

If a music-house has a piece of music that it wishes to place on the market, it sends a full band score to a broadcasting station, and asks the station to play it and place it on the market; and after that it charges royalty on it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. La</inline> Brie, a visitor from the United States of America, who attended the Australian Radio Conference in Sydney, said - </para>

                                <para>- I agree with the honorable member; we ought to have a day&#39;s debate on this question. It has been emphasized by different authorities that, if the patents were valid upon which royalties are claimed, the amounts demanded are still far in excess of what is fair and reasonable. A royal commission would have the power to investigate the whole question of the validity of patent claims, and, if it be found they are valid, to fix a fair scale of payment. At the present time the demands are excessive, and if the dealers in wireless, and the public, could be assured that no retrospective demands would be made by Amalgamated Wireless Limited, much more rapid progress in wireless would be possible. The greedy methods of these patent kings are restricting and obstructing the development of Australian wireless, and are seriously limiting the spread of the economic and social advantages of radio, which plays a great part in the life of the people of Australia. If any one should rise in protest against the action of the copyright associations, of the demands of Amalgamated Wireless Limited for patent royalties, or of the monopolistic grip that 3LO is trying to obtain on broadcasting in Australia, it should be the Postmaster-General. He should support a national broadcasting  studio, at which the services of the greatest artists in the world could be obtained, and in the control of which the chief consideration would not be profits; but the highest standard of efficiency. </para>

                                <para>- Perhaps thousands, by a simple alteration of the coils to suit the wave length. If we had a corresponding station in Victoria, we should have the communication between Australia and Great Britain which the honorable member for Batman says is impossible. The honorable member said that from two to four hours&#39; communication was all that would be possible with the beam system. I had several talks with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marconi</inline> in England, and he assured me that it would be possible to communicate for  seven hours a day, or probably longer. When the sun is in the east, transmission will be in a north-westerly direction, over Borneo, India, and Russia; but when the sun is in the west, transmission will be in a south-easterly direction, across the southern Pacific, the north of South America, and the Atlantic. By that means, full advantage will be taken of the darkness in both directions. Wireless communication between Australia and Great Britain, with the beam system, will soon be an accomplished fact. If we had a high-power station, it would be an accomplished fact to-day. We have not a high-power station ; we called for tenders and it was found that the cost would be in the vicinity of &#163;480,000. Can the honorable &#39; member for Batman tell me why South Africa, India, and Canada have discarded proposals for erecting high power stations, and have decided to erect beam stations? </para>

South Africa let a contract for a high power station, and when it was more than half built.  they  decided to scrap it in favour of a beam station. The honorable member asked why the contract had not been carried out within the prescribed time. If that had been done, we should to-day have a beam station here, with no station in Great Britain to correspond with it. I am informed that the station in Great Britain will be completed in. October, and the station here will be ready at about the same time, so that the two stations will be operating about that time. </para>

                                <para>- What the Government wishes to do is being done, and has now nearly reached a conclusion. The honorable member went on to say that the station in Australia is costing more than the station in Great Britain. The Prime Minister has said that, according to the agreement between the Marconi Company and the British Government, the British station is to cost about &#163;50,000. That is for a single station, and for every additional unit necessary to communicate with Canada, South Africa, or Australia another &#163;29,000 has to be paid. So that the corresponding station in Great Britain is to cost &#163;50,000, plus &#163;30,000. Here, in Australia, we shall have a station with a unit to communicate with Canada as well as a unit to communicate with Great Britain for a sum not to exceed &#163;120,000. </para>

As a matter of fact, under the agreement with the Marconi Company a much greater number of words than 21,000 are to be sent. </para>

Honorable members will remember that we instituted a service to ships at sea, and these vessels are now getting communications broadcast each morning as far as Colombo for certain, and sometimes a good deal further. </para>

The beam system is not direct communication along a definite line.

                                <para>- Showing a deficit according to the honorable member&#39;s statement ; but the question asked by the honorable member for Hindmarsh was how much money was paid to the company for working expenses, and the reply given to him was quite correct. Honorable members will recognize immediately that many of the boats at sea have not paid the amounts due by them, and amounts are still owing to make up the balance. The whole of the nineteen coastal stations were taken over by Amalgamated Wireless Limited, and are now operated by that company. It maintains the stations, and the Government has been relieved of an annual loss upon them amounting to from. &#163;30,000 to &#163;40,000. The figures quoted represent simply an- account between Amalgamated Wireless Limited and the Government in regard to expenditure and revenue in connexion with the nineteen coastal stations as laid down in clause 7 of the agreement. There are several stations in the Mandated Territory that are still run under the agreement, and the adjustment of accounts cannot be completed until amounts owing in respect of those stations are also taken into consideration. </para>

                        <para>I now come to the matter of broadcasting, and here again we have an extraordinary position. Wireless broadcasting, as we know, is only five years old. The whole thing is still in its infancy. In Australia it is only three years old, and we have done remarkably good work here to have reached the stage which we have reached at the present time, with 120,000 licensed  listeners-in  throughout the Commonwealth. The progress made has been remarkable, and the programmes received by the people are extremely good. What happened in regard to wireless in the first stage? It was during my administration of the Post Office that wireless was brought into operation. I had people interested in wireless all over Australia asking that a conference should be held. I convened a conference in May, 1923. That was the earliest meeting of wireless interests in Australia, to try to bring the new science into satisfactory operation. Some 90 representatives of various interests were at that conference, which considered the subject for four or five days. The conference placed its recommendations before me. It come to an absolutely unanimous decision that we should adopt the sealed set system, so that people, could only receive a certain wave length, according to the listening-in set they used. </para>

                                <para>- The recommendation was unanimously approved by the 90 persons present at the conference representing the whole of the wireless interests in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk</inline> must be a very smart fellow if he was able to influence the other 89 representatives present at the conference to adopt his suggestion. The recommendation of the conference was adopted, and regulations were put through. The licence fee was fixed at 10s., and those holding broadcasting sets had the right to charge what they pleased for performances and programmes. Some of the stations were charging listeners-in  &#163;3 and &#163;4 for their programmes, although they could only listen-in to one station. That proved an absolute failure, and the amount of revenue derived by the Post Office Department was only &#163;725. When it was seen that we had made a step in the wrong direction we immediately set to work to remedy the matter, and we brought new regulations into operation in July, 1924. Under those regulations we are now operating. I say, again, that in the short period of two years we have made extraordinary strides in wireless in this country, and have not had the confusion that has taken place in connexion with wireless in many other countries of the world. In America the position was intolerable. Many people were broadcasting, and no particular wave length, was allocated. The honorable member for Capricornia has said that we should be guided by the experience of New Zealand, but let me tell him that in the matter of the development of wireless New Zealand is not in the same street with Australia. </para>

                                <para>- The fees charged in Australia were 35s, in the zone of the first 250 miles, 30s. in the zone between 250 and 400 miles, and 25s. in the zone beyond 400 miles and upwards, and of those fees the Postal Department took 5s. We recognized in the first year that we could manage with a fee less than 5s., and immediately reduced the amount to 2s. 6d. The fees operating now are 27s. 6d. for the inner zone, 22s. 6d. for the middle zone, and 17s. 6d. for the outer zone. I have stated in this House, in answer to questions, that the regulations will come up for review in July of this year. They were fixed for a term of two years, and that term expires this year. The regulations will be revised, but what will be the result I am not at the moment prepared to say. I have been surprised that not one honorable member who has referred to the subject of wireless has made any mention of the alteration of wave lengths. The whole  position  in regard to wave lengths is due to a war between two interests: those who import sets into this country made to the standard of Great Britain or America, and those importing long-wave receiving sets, such as can be used with Farmer&#39;s station or W. A. Farmers Limited. If we altered the wave lengths to-day we should bring about confusion amongst thousands of people. I do not say that we shall not alter them, but their alteration must lead to a certain amount of disorganization. If we brought the whole of the wave lengths within a band of 250 to 550 metres, only particular selective machines would be able&#39; to cut out a wave length that was not wanted. The honorable member for Capricornia says that we should adopt the system followed in Great Britain, and that we should also reduce our licence- fee. The honorable member forgets that in this country we have a population of only 6,000,000, and a vast, territory to cover. In Great Britain, with an area not much greater than Victoria, there is a population of 40,000,000. In that country a licence fee of 10s. might easily be sufficient, but if we retained the licence-fee of 10s. in Australia programmes could not be offered that would be acceptable to the peon le.  Listeners-in  are prepared to pay a reasonable fee for good programmes, and I believe that the programmes that are being broadcasted in Australia to-day are very satisfactory. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member perhaps Has a set that is not selective enough to cut out other wave lengths. The honorable, member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> referred to the possibility of bringing about a monopoly of wireless broadcasting, and also to the fine work that is being done by the Queensland station under the control of the State Government; but the monopolies to which he is referring are not, with the exception, perhaps, of two of them, making the profits that he suggests. We have issued &#34;A&#34; licences as follows : - One in Queensland, one in Tasmania, one in Western Australia, one in South Australia, and two each in Victoria and New South Wales. The honorable member said not one word about the cost of erecting huge plants for transmitting purposes. The initial outlay of the companies must have been enormous, and I venture to say that for the first year the whole of their operations were undertaken at a loss. Fortunately, some of them are now coming into their own. The stations in Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia are probably losing money to-day on their - operations in broadcasting. The gross receipts of Farmers of Sydney for 1925-26 amounted to &#163;30,433. That company has to meet interest on capital and pay its artists. Honorable members will recognize that if the same artists were used, every night there would be a great deal of dissatisfaction. The gross receipts of 2BL station in New South Wales amounted in that year to &#163;15,865. The gross receipts of 3LO in Victoria amounted to &#163;53,661. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member&#39;s figures were approximately right, and they should have been, since I, myself, gave them only last week. The gross receipts of 3AR in 1925-26 amounted to &#163;26,209, and of the Queensland station, to &#163;10,164. It is impossible to provide a series of good programmes For &#163;10,164 a year after incurring the expense of a five kilowatt station, meeting the interest on capital, and paying salaries to artists. The gross receipts of the Adelaide station amounted to &#163;17,721, and of the Western Australian station to &#163;5,253. Those are the amounts received by the various stations after the deduction of 2s. 6d. by the department. </para>

                                <para>- I cannot say. I do not know the cost of working the station nor the amount paid to its artists. All I know is that an exceptionally good programme is broadcast. The honorable member said nothing about that station&#39;s losses when it first began its operations. It is not possible for a monopoly to be created in Australia. The whole of the programmes are subject to the supervision and censorship of the Postmaster-General, or whoever represents him. I am pleased to say that on few occasions have we taken exception to broadcast programmes. One honorable member referred to broadcasting stations being used for political purposes. That is not the case. </para>

                                <para>- 3AR cannot be absorbed by 3LO, because the two stations must operate, and&#39; the revenue must be divided between them in the ratio provided. The number of licences in force on the 30th June was: In New South Wales, 36,055; and in Victoria, 62,290. Victoria has, therefore, twice as many receiving sets as New South Wales. This bears testimony to the excellence of the programmes broadcast in Victoria. The number of licences in force in Queensland was 7,244; in South Australia, 9,410; in Western Australia, 3,874; and in Tasmania 739. It would be impossible for 7,244 persons in Queensland, for instance, to provide sufficient revenue in the way of licence fees to pay for a series of good programmes. </para>

                                <para>- According to the honorable member, the Labour party can do no wrong. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> referred to the monopoly of news by 3LO, but his statement was inaccurate. He also referred to discrimination taking place in connexion with advertising. I would inform him that no discrimination takes place at the stations. Advertising can be carried on only during set hours, and does not form part of a broadcast programme which is paid for by the licence holders. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member referred to the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> news, as broadcast by 3LO as being stale, but it is not so. It is broadcast early in the evening for the benefit of those living  100 miles or more from Melbourne. I, myself, receive that news in my own home 100 miles away. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> news is broadcast by 3LO in the morning, hours before any newspaper arrives at the country districts. I am certain that the broadcasting of news is very acceptable to out-back settlers. When the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Killen)</inline> was taking a trip through the Northern Territory, he received news items on a receiving set which he took with him. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> news is broadcast through 3AR. The news services are remarkably good. The honorable member for Capricornia suggested that the Government should take control of broadcasting as the British Government intends to do at the beginning of next year. I cannot conceive of any Government broadcasting a programme that would satisfy the people of this country. Under Government control, the tendency would be to use the programmes for political purposes. When a plebiscite was recently taken to ascertain the most popular item broad- cast, no one would have prophesied that church services would head the list and racing news be at the bottom. It has cost an immense sum of money to erect the broadcasting stations, and if we forced them to cease operating in twelve months&#39; time after having broadcast excellent programmes, we should be playing an unfair game towards those companies which hold licences. They are licensed for five years, but at the end of the second year we have power to revise the licences. During this month the whole position will be reviewed by the department. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Capricornia referred to copyrights. He probably was not in the chamber when the Prime Minister clearly pointed out that this matter was international in its effect, and that we had no power <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> regulate international law. The Government has done the best thing under the circumstances by deciding to call together all the interests connected with copyrights. The Prime Minister has said that they are to meet together in Sydney, when, he hopes, means will be devised to bring about a more uniform scale of charges. The honorable member for Capricornia believes that those holding copyrights should receive nothing for them, and that we should legislate to prevent royalties from being paid on patents. Surely he must recognize that patents are very valuable to those people who have worked them out and registered them. If the honorable member wishes, I shall include in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the whole of the patents held by the Amalgamated Wireless Limited. </para>

                            <para>.- I would not have intervened in the debate at this juncture, but for the very unsatisfactory reply by the Postmaster-General, and the unbecoming attitude adopted by the Prime Minister this afternoon when he endeavoured to answer the charges made by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> against those who are controlling wireless in the Commonwealth. Without desiring to be unduly personal, I consider that the attitude assumed by the Prime Minister did him little credit, and was lacking in the dignity that we. have a right to expect from a gentleman occupying his high and responsible position.  His  manner was, to an extent, insulting. With a supercilious air of superiority, he declared that the substantial arguments advanced by the honorable member for </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">Batman were arrant nonsense. More than an offhand assertion of that character is required to satisfy the minds of those honorable members who desire to do right in this matter. I congratulate the honorable member for Batman upon his consistent endeavours to place before the House and the country reliable information in regard to the long-distance wireless contracts. Every word contained in the minority report he submitted as a member of the select committee in 1921, and every word he uttered in his speech, in this chamber two years ago, has been verified. Notwithstanding that two years ago&#39; the agreement with the Amalgamated Wireless Limited, which is working in league with the wireless trusts throughout the world, was extended for two years, the company has again defaulted, and no effort is made by the Go,vernment to safeguard the interests of the taxpayers whose money is at stake. Honorable members of the Opposition would be remiss in their duty if they did not offer a strong protest against the manner in which die Government is treating this matter. The Postmaster-General endeavoured to make the Committee believe that the position in New Zealand in regard to wireless was not on all-fours with that in the Commonwealth, and, therefore, was of no concern to honorable members. The fact is that Amalgamated &#34;Wireless Limited endeavoured to secure control df wireless&#39; in New Zealand, and demanded certain patent rights and royalties, but the New Zealand Government summarily rejected these claims and decided to be master in. its own house in respect of wireless . matters. The consequence is that wireless affairs in New Zealand are on a very satisfactory basis, and the people of the Dominion are not penalized by many of the undesirable conditions that are associated with wireless broadcasting in Australia. The Postmaster-General presented a favorable view of the prospects of the beam system of wireless, but Marconi, who is the inventor of this system, and whose opinion is entitled to respect, is not nearly so confident of its immediate success as is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk.</inline> He - has declared that the beam system is still in its experimental stages. On the other hand, the efficiency of the long-distance service controlled by the&#39; British Government was attested by the remarks of the Postmaster-General, who acknowledged that the high-power station at Rugby had fulfilled all expectations. When the Prime  Minister  was speaking, I asked him by interjection why the British Government would not licence a high-power station to communicate directly with Australia, and he frankly replied that the  reason  was that the Commonwealth Government could not accede to the desire  of  the Imperial Government that all wireless stations &#39; in the United Kingdom &#34;should be controlled by the British Postal Department. This is. one of the few matters, in regard to which this ultra-imperialistic Government is at variance with the British Government, and the reason for its attitude on this occasion is its&#39; desire to serve those private interests which are so closely connected with it politically. I have been informed on reliable authority that the Marconi trust holds shares in Amalgamated Wireless Limited, and it is well for the committee to know what influences are acting in restraint of the free exercise of those services which are so intimately connected with the convenience,, comfort, and education of the community. I find that in 1918 Messrs. Siemens, Schucker and Company, Berlin, held 40 per cent, of the shares of&#39; Marconi Limited, and, according to a London bank report, that firm still retains that interest. That means that Amalgamated Wireless Limited is really controlled by this British and German combine. We should be recreant to our duty if we did not protest against the patronage that is being extended by the Commonwealth Government to the trusts and combines associated with wireless. The committee should accept the amendment for the appointment of a royal commission to review all phases of wireless control in the Commonwealth. The startling information given to the committee by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> shows that the interests  of  the taxpayers are being subordinated to certain private interests. When the Postmaster-General . was asked by the honor-  able member for Capricornia why he did not comply with the request of the Commonwealth radio conference, held  in  Sydney on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th May of this year,  he  replied lightly that the reports presented at the conference  did  not justify the opinions expressed by the honorable member. For the enlightenment of the committee, I shall quote passages from the report of the proceedings of the conference to show the esteem in which the system of wireless control adopted by the British Government is held by experts, and their earnest desire that&#39; a royal commission should be appointed to investigate wireless activities in the Commonwealth. The  president  of the conference had recently toured Great Britain, Europe, and America, and his report -to the conference left a very favorable impression of the achievements of the British Government in connexion with wireless. According to a report of the proceedings - </para>

The conference was not only to encourage the best conditions in transmission and reception, but  also  to emphasize the necessity for a royal commission to be called, so that earliest action could be taken upon the reports submitted and approved by the conference. </para>

The Postmaster-General would have honorable members believe that the statement of the honorable member for Capricornia&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">.(Mr. Forde)</inline> regarding the profits made from broadcasting should be discounted. Only this morning&#39; I interviewed a gentleman who is in a position to know the facts of the case, and I- understand that the exploitation taking place in Melbourne is of a&#39; startling character. </para>

                                <para>- I believe that that is the case. All public moneys spent on wireless, either to Amalgamated &#39;Wireless Limited, or to broadcasting companies, should be under the review of the Auditor-General, and balance-sheets should be submitted to the Parliament. I was surprised some days ago when, iri reply to questions, the &#39;Postmaster-General stated that the Government retained only 2s. 6d. out of each licence fee to meet total charges of administration. Yet we find that a certain agency that represents one of the richest combines in the world is collecting for patent rights and royalties more than the sum received by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. If the Government desires to have a good name in wireless matters it will readily agree to the appointment of a royal commission. It appears that a scandal exists in this connexion similar to others revealed during the regime of the present Ministry. Until a Labour administration is appointed, I am afraid -that there is very little prospect of an improvement being brought about. </para>

If the Government does not comply with his request, it will realize before many months have passed that it has seriously blundered, since all sections of the community sincerely desire to have the best possible broadcasting service. They have the strongest objection to exploitation by trusts or combines. </para>

                    <para>.- At this late how, I shall not make a speech, but I have to-day received two communications from cotton-growing associations in Queensland asking me to ascertain from the Prime Minister when the Cotton Bounty Bill will be introduced, in order that they may send representatives to Melbourne to confer with honorable members with a view to getting the Tariff Board&#39;s recommendation of 2d. per lb. adopted. Can the Prime Minister say <inline font-style="italic">when that</inline> bill will be introduced? </para>
