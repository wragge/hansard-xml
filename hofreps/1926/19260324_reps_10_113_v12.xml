                    <para>.- I take this course for the purpose of drawing the attention of the House to the unsatisfactory conditions that prevail in  th©  . coal-mining industry. In 1920  the rigjfct  honorable member for North Sydney(Mr. Hughes),  "who  was then Prime Minister, recognizing the necessity for special tribunals to deal with the troubles in the coal-miniaig industry, piloted through this House the Industrial Peace Act. The coal miners have worked continuously under that legislation., . and it has given eminent satisfaction,  in  so far that the supply of coal, which is so vital to the industries of Australia, has not been held up by disputes in the mines. During the last two years, however, experience has shown that one tribunal  is  incapable of dealing with the large number of disputes that have arisen. The Industrial Peace Act provides that, in addition to the main -tribunal, special boards may -be appointed to 'deal with local disputes. . Because of the large . number of -cases that . await hearing the miners representatives have been advocating for some time the appointment . of such . boards. One has been appointed in Victoria,but for some reason, of which I am not aware, it has not functioned. In New South Wales, many disputes have occurred during the last two or three years, : and the determination of 'some of them has been unreasonably delayed. For instance, eighteen months elapsed before the tribunal was able to deal with a dispute in the coke industry. Industrial legislation, to be successful, must 'provide Tor the prompt redress of grievances. That is essential in the coal-mining industry, because of its peculiar ciroumstances. The industry differs from others in that the miners are employed on contract and paid according to their output. There is no other industry in which the workers' earnings vary so much. Today, men may be working on a clear face, at which they can make good wages, hut within a few days water may intrude, faults may occur, or impurities may be en countered, in consequence of which disputes may arise. Notwithstanding  the attempts made to settle such disputes some of them are not easily adjusted, and, consequently, the men have to go to a tribunal. For a considerable time the coal miners in New South Wales have been advocating the appointment of local boards, and some weeks ago I introduced a deputation <inline font-style="italic">ito</inline> theright honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> asking him to have local boards . appointed. The right honorable gentleman said that 'he was considering the proposal, and would see what could be done. Subsequently, I received a reply to the effect that, owing to practical difficulties, the Government could not see its way clear, at that particular juncture,  tG  appoint local boards. </para>

                <para>Mr.CHARLTON.- No. In these circumstances honorable members wall realize how necessary it is- that something should be done, at once. It may be' contended by some that local boards cannot be constitutionally appointed, and I think that,, in the letter JL received from, the Prime Minister, there was- a hint to that effect. Since the Industrial Peace Act was passed in. 1920 the special, tribunal appointed under it has. been functioning; and has dealt with mining disputes in. a manner satisfactory to both parties, as there have been- no complaints, from the employers or the employees. Both) parties have accepted the decisions of -the tribunal. Provision is made in the Industrial Peace Act for the appointment of local boards. </para>

                        <para>- I think I am correct in saying- that application has been made1 on- several occasions, but the requests have not been1 acceded to. Legislation has been passed to provide for the appointment of: local boards,, and; up- to the present its constitutionality has not been questioned. Local boards- can work only ire conjunction with the special' tribunal,, which has the right to&gt; accept or reject the decisions arrived at im- connexion with local disputes.- The tribunal exercises full control. The coal miners' organization controls an industry the operations of which extend beyond the limits of one State. The Industrial Peace Act was passed as the right honorable member for- North- Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> knows, because- prior- to its passage the coal miners experienced' great difficulty in getting- their grievances considered". They have been waiting for two years to have their cases dealt with) by the Arbitration, Court. Honorable members will- admit that if a dispute which-, arises to-day is. not dealt with promptly, conditions may have altered considerably within twelve months or two years, or at least by the time, the Arbitration Court is able to consider it,, and no useful purpose is* served' in, having, the case considered after such a lapse of time. In recognition of the difficulty surrounding the situation,, the- legislation to which I have referred' was passed. It has given satisfaction to the mining industry, and has been in- operation ever- since the- act was passed. I think I can say that there have been no strikes in the coal-mining industry since this legislation was enacted. To-day, however, there is' dire distress in the industry through no fault of the miners, but owing to the supply of coal being in excess of the 'demand-. When disputes arise, we should do everything we can to settle them. In view of the action recently taken by Parliament in passing the Crimes Act,, it is essential that we should do everything possible to provide adequate machinery for settling disputes of' this character. If there is trouble in the  coal-mining industry, our transport services and trade and commerce will naturally be interfered with, and if such a position should arise, the Government must administer the law on the statute-book. It is provided in the Crimes Act that the leaders of industrial organizations who, after the issue of a proclamation, continue to carry on industrial fights, may be tried and, if found guilty, sent to gaol, and if not born in Australia, deported. </para>

                        <para>- I hope such a thing will not happen, but I am warning the Attorney-General that there are possibilities of action beng taken in the direction I have indicated. If the Attorney-General had a knowledge of the coal-mining industry, he would know that immediately there is a cessation in the supply of coal, which is the life-blood of commerce, industries dependent upon it for a continuance of operations, and all steamers which are not oil burners, are affected, and the trade and commerce of the country is seriously interfered with. </para>

                        <para>- It is interesting, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> to have these interjections,, because they clearly demonstrate that there is a big difference of opinion on both sides of the House in regard to the Crimes Act. If the contention of the Attorney-General is correct, I foresee that very little will be done under that legislation. If a big industrial disturbance occurs the Government will, in view of the mandate it has received from the people, have to give effect to its legislation. That is what was intended. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue><para class="block">We all wish to avoid such a position, and that is the reason why I have moved the adjournment of the House. I would be recreant to my trust and to my constituents if I did not place the facts fairly before honorable members, and point out the position in which industrial leaders will be placed if a big upheaval occurs. I repeat that there are no more loyal men, and that there are none who strive more to prevent industrial trouble than the leaders associated with this organization. I do not think there are any men who could handle the difficult position with which they are confronted from time to time with more tact than do the leaders of this organization. If trouble arises in any of the mines the workers are practically forced into a difficult position; and any delay that occurs in dealing with the situation is serious. The Prime Minister would be well advised to take steps immediately to ascertain just what trouble the miners are facing. If he did so, it would probably allay the feeling of unrest. I have had no private information as to the matters discussed at the meeting of the coal miners yesterday, but the very fact that they met in camera and supplied no information to the press, tells me that the situation is serious. Nothing irritates the coal miners more than delay in dealing with the disputes that arise from time to time. I wish to make it quite clear that I am making no complaint about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibble,</inline> or the coal tribunal. The decisions of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibble</inline> from time to time have given general satisfaction. But it is quite impossible for his tribunal to deal with every minor difficulty that arises. Some honorable members do not seem to realize that coal mining conditions are different from those of every other industry. Miners are paid not by the day or the week, but according to the amount of coal they grass. In such circumstances every impediment to production is serious. It is necessary that there should be some local authority, acceptable to both employees and employers, to deal with disputes immediately. The local boards are composed of representatives of the miners and their employers and their proceedings are more in the nature of a round table conference. The decisions that they give are generally satisfactory. Their reappointment would render it unnecessary to submit every .minor trouble to the coal tribunal, and would leave it free to deal with the major disputes that affect the whole industry. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I was about to conclude my remarks, but that interjection renders it necessary for me to make the position still clearer. I have a lively recollection that some honorable members opposite, and particularly the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook),</inline> have constantly advocated, in this chamber, the adoption of the piece-work, instead of day-work, principle. They complain that when daily wages  are  paid without regard to output, the workers go slow and do not work honestly. But those honorable members are not prepared to do the fair thing when piece-work is adopted. The honorable manner's interjection shows that he would be ready, in any time of difficulty, to say, " Oh, the workers knew all about it." Let me tell him that the coal miners are ready  at  any time to abandon the piece-work principle and work for a daily, or weekly, wage ; but if they did so, the result would not be so satisfactory to the general public as far as price was concerned. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I can quite understand that it is inevitable that some honorable members must be ignorant of coal-mining practice, but they should be willing to be advised by those who do understand it; and they should pay some respect to the opinions of men who have worked in coal mines. Until I came into public life, I had spent all my time in the coal mines, and I claim to know something about the industry. My experience leads me to say, without hesitation, that the appointment of local boards for the redress of local grievances is absolutely necessary. If the coal miners are fairly treated, as they have a right to be, they are as law-abiding as any section of the community. They have no desire to see industry disorganized and men unemployed. That is true of the workers in every industry. The men who hold official positions in the various trade union and labour organizations are the last to wish for industrial disorder. I urge the Prime Minister to agree to  the  proposal that local disputes should be referred to local boards. I have  no  doubt whatever that if the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> were Prime Minister, he would not hesitate to do so.. He established the special tribunal daring his term of office as Prime Minister, because his personal knowledge of the coal-mining industry told him that it was necessary to do so. It is impossible far the coal tribunal ito deal with every minor dispute that arises, for it is kept busy -with the big disputes on general principles that affect the whole Commonwealth. I trust that the Governmentwill get into touch with the representatives of the coal miners, ascertain the nature of the difficulties that they axe at present facing, and take every possible step to avoid another coal crisis. </para>

                    <para>. - I feel sure that honorable members generally will realize that the sole purpose of the Leader of the Opposition in moving the adjournment of the House to discuss this matter was to avoid serious trouble among the coal miners. I agree with him, that the best way to ensure harmonious working is for the Government to appoint local boards to deal with local disputes. I have had a long experience in the coal-mining industry. I was connected with it many years ago, before the colliery owners would agree to adopt any reasonable method of settling disputes. I know of the coal miners' unsatisfactory experiences in the Arbitration Court, and of their hearty desire for the appointment of local boards for settling local disputes. It is idle for honorable members to say that the conditions under which coalminers work are similar to those governing all mining operations. The Leader of the Opposition put it mildly when he said that conditions might change in two or three days. It is because they change so rapidly and frequently that there is difficulty in providing a just method of paying the miners. All sorts of circumstances may arise to make it impossible for the coal miner to grass a normal quantity of coal in a day. As we have already been told, water comes in some  tiroes, and at other times "brass;" is sum et. "Brass" was the cause of one of- the biggest strikes I have known. The point art issue om that occasion was payment fca- what is known as " jerry." Stone. 2 feet thick was encountered in the seam, and miners, determined to have » fair rate- of pay fixed for quarrying it. I can well remember' also the conditions under which men were  obliged  to&gt; work at Coal Creek. That was the most troublesome seam of which I have amy knowledge. The face altered from day to day. One day it rolled up and the next it went down. In endeavouring to settle the disputes of the miners who were engaged in mining it, I drew up five agreements before we were able to make a satisfactory arrangement. The basis-' of the agreement that was ultimately signed was that a local board should be appointed', on- which both the employers and the employees should be represented, to- settle troubles as they arose. The coal miners- are frequently  unfairly  blamed for stoppages of work that occur' on the mines. One .of the troubles that has arisen now has relation to working- with safety lamps in certain mines. I well remember a similar trouble occurring at the Stockton Bore Hole. In my opinion-, there should be- safety lamps in every mine; but payments for hewing where safety lamps- are used should be adjusted. When one compares the convenient awd safe lamp that is now used, with the naked light that the miners used to stick in their hats when working in the terminals, it seems to me to be ridiculous that there should be any question as tfr the wisdom, of using safety lamps everywhere. Men are able to work much more freely with naked, lights than with safety lamps. It is- impossible to refer every small difficulty to the coal tribunal, and I assure honorable members that it is absolutely essential that local boards should be appointed.This matter is so important that it should be dealt with at once.. If act-ion were taken immediately, the Government  would  be doing something towards establishing a- basis for the settlement of disputes in their early stages. I admit that the local boards should not give- awards which would conflict with the general rates, but prompt action in small troubles might prevent, serious consequences. This act has been operating for some years, and no- objection has. been-, taken to. it. The local board system-, would prove to- be more satisfactory to. both sides in a dispute than any other  system.  I shall not refer to the Crimes Act further than to say that- it seems idle to contend that- a. stoppage in the coal industry would not interfere, with trade and commerce. </para>

                    <para>. - I appreciate the motives that have actuated the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> in moving the adjournment of the House to discuss this question, and the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> in supporting the motion. At the outset I wish to make it clear that neither any member of the Government nor myself has any objection to the system which has. been established for the settlement of disputes in the coal'-mining industry. Nor are we lacking in sympathy with the views put forward this morning. I have discussed this matter at length with the representatives of the men engaged in the. industry, and I understand their desire to have the disputes which arise, from time to time settled promptly. Difficulties which in themselves are not of major importance sometimes contain elements of irritation and annoyance; and if settlement is long delayed, the men become restive, and it is extremely difficult for their leaders to hold them. In this connexion- I bear testimony to the work of the men's leaders in this industry; they have done their best to maintain industrial peace and to assist the operation- of the Industrial Peace Act. That act was passed shortly after the war, and in some respects was emergency legislation, dealing with an industry which is fundamental, and on which the trade and the commerce of the country are. largely based. It provides for the coal-mining industry a method for the settlement of disputes different from that which operates in other industries. Not only was it necessary to deal promptly and effectively with disputes in this industry at that time, but reasons have been advanced to show that at all times special means of dealing with such disputes are needed. I do not propose to discuss that subject now, except to say that the principle embodied in the Industrial Peace Act has been more generally adopted in Australia in recent years, and I believe that that part of the community which considers that the principle underlying this legislation provides for probably the most effective means of ensuring industrial peace, is increasing in numbers. There are many phases of this question with which the House will have to deal when the industrial legislation foreshadowed in the Governor-General's speech is before us, but I shall not refer to them to-day. It is hoped that that legislation will be introduced shortly after the Easter adjournment, and we shall then have ample opportunity to discuss it at large. I propose to confine my remarks to-day to the coal-mining industry, and to point to some of the difficulties in the operation of the act, and some of the reasons which have led the Government to postpone the appointment of local tribunals. When at Lithgow about twelve months ago, a deputation representing the employees in the coalmining industry in the western district of New South Wales waited on me with a request that a local tribunal should be appointed for that district. Subsequently, I met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis, Mr. Pillans,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baddeley</inline> in conference, and we discussed the matter thoroughly. It was, however, allowed to drop, until, in November last, representations were again made to the Government for the establishment of local tribunals. Some months ago another deputation, which was introduced by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> waited on me. The appointment of local tribunals was then discussed thoroughly. While I believe that the most effective way to deal with disputes in the coal-mining industry is probably by appointing local tribunals, there are great difficulties in the way of taking that course. There are constitutional difficulties, and also those which would arise from the wide extension of round-table conferences. Let us consider first the constitutional difficulties. Although the constitutionality of the Industrial Peace Act has never been challenged - and possibly it never will be challenged, because the appointment of the special tribunal which deals with the coal-mining industry falls well within the powers conferred on the Commonwealth by the Constitution - difficulties might arise so soon as local boards were appointed, because their appointment would not come within the scope of our constitutional power. Local tribunals have not been established under the act; but unofficial local tribunals have been operating, and have accomplished much good. In one case, however  - in  which  the matter in dispute concerned the pillars left in mines - the right of such a tribunal to deal Avith the case was challenged. Negotiations had proceeded amicably, and it appeared that at last a long-standing dispute was about to be settled. Only the final speech by the owner s representative remained to be made, when the negotiations ended abruptly. The owners sent their representative to Western Australia,  where  the High Court was sitting at the time, and had the conference stopped. Similar action might not occur often; but it would always be possible for it to happen when disputes were being dealt Avith by local boards. No tribunal for the preservation of industrial peace could function satisfactorily in such circumstances. A further difficulty is that there is no  power  to compel either side to a dispute to appoint representatives to a board, or to compel the attendance of such representatives when appointed. Local tribunals can function only when there is absolute agreement between the two parties as to the method of settling a dispute. </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing in the  law  to compel them to attend a conference. Before an unofficial local tribunal can function the two parties must be desirous of coming together. Unfortunately, at the present time, there is not unanimity between the employer and employees  in this matter. The miners' representatives say that, in the interests of industrial peace, local tribunals arc desirable; but the mine-owners are satisfied with the special tribunal which, they say, is operating satisfactorily. They do not want the local tribunals. They contend that their attitude is justified by the fact that, in four years, there have been only two disputes, and that local tribunals would tend to cause disputes. I make no comment upon that; my point is that, at present, there is not unanimity, and that therefore local tribunals cannot function. So long as one party to a dispute can hold up proceedings by applying to the court, or by withdrawing its representatives, no satisfactory basis for the settlement of disputes by this method exists. We should consider whether it is not possible to place our tribunals on a surer foundation. This is the main reason that has influenced the Government to express the belief that it would be a mistake, at the present time, to do what has been suggested. We are, however, considering what can be done to meet the situation, and, as I have indicated, there will be an opportunity within the next six weeks or two months to discuss these industrial problems from every angle. It would be unwise to appoint local tribunals unless there was complete unanimity, and while there was doubt as to their constitutionality. I have, of course, confined myself to the position in New South Wales, whence this request has come. I am aware that boards exist in Victoria and Queensland. With a wide expansion of local boards, functioning in different districts, difficulty might ' be caused by different decisions, and, possibly the establishment of different standards. If we are to have round-table conferences, there must be some central co-ordinating body to prevent conditions and decisions varying in accordance with the varying opinions of the different tribunals. It would be well, therefore, to wait until we can discuss the promised industrial legislation, which will be introduced in the near future. As a practical solution of existing difficulties, I propose to approach <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibble,</inline> and to ask him to take the earliest opportunity to ascertain what are the particular disputes which, if not dealt with promptly, may lead to the stoppage of work and cause serious trouble. In any case, the establishment of local boards - if that course were adopted - would take a little time; but if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibble</inline> can deal with those disputes which contain the greatest element of danger to the community, I think that that will be the most satisfactory way of meeting the difficulty at the moment. </para>

                    <para>.- I am keenly disappointed with the statement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> that the Government does not intend to appoint the local boards to deal with miners' disputes. He has told us that we must wait until the whole industrial position is dealt with in legislation, which will be introduced in two or three months' time. In his concluding remarks the right honorable gentleman evaded the issue by intimating that he would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibble</inline> to deal with one or two of the most serious matters in dispute. There has been trouble for several years in the South Coast mines, in my district. When the Industrial Peace Act was passed in 1920 I asked the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who was then Prime Minister, if the Government would appoint the local boards, and T was told that the matter would have consideration. There has been a persistent demand for the appointment of these boards for many years, and it appears to me that, in refusing to appoint them, the Government is in the position of Nero, who, we are told, fiddled while Rome was burning. If newspaper reports are true, there is a great deal of unrest in the coal-mining industry, and there is every possibility of a wide-spread industrial dispute which will affect other industries throughout the Commonwealth. In the circumstances it is futile to suggest that we should wait until we are revising our industrial legislation two or three months hence. The Prime Minister was coldly analytical of the request made by my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> He emphasized that the Government had to consider the question from the constitutional stand-point. If the right honorable gentleman had analysed similarly one of the bills that was rushed through Parliament earlier in the session, to deal a blow at trade unionism, the statute-book would not have been disgraced with that piece of legislation. Now, when it is a question of acceding to the request of am important industrial organization, we are told that any action which the. Government may take must be within tha few; that the Government must take no risks. The organizations concerned want to keep the wheels of industry going. Any man who says that the average coal miner is. anxious to cease work is saying something that is absolutely untrue. The- following letter, which was sent to me under date 19th June last, sets out the position very clearly: - </para>

                    <para>The pillar question. That is the bone of contention ali along the line in the southern district. I can give you, briefly, what the men want, and have wanted since 1914. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibble</inline> framed his award for the southern district, not under the Industrial Peace Act, he forced differential rates upon it, namely: Headings, which is now 4s. If d. ; boards, 3s. 1*id ; pillars, 3s. 7d. per ton. The majority of the work in this district now is pillar work. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibble-</inline> has been asked repeatedly  for a definition of a pillar-working place since 1914, but, up to date, has refused to do so. The proprietors, taking advantage of this, are getting the biggest part 3f their output from pillar working, and you will see the difference of rates as above; and they are the final arbiters on the definition, and are getting the majority of the  bord  work cut at pillar rates, and part of the narrow development work, usually 4s.  1 3/8d.,  out for- 3s. 7d. a ton. The deficiency trouble is largely due to this defect, and most of the stoppages are due to it. Men have to hole and shoot pillar work, -which is a standing joke to any practical miner in the country. The sole object of the agitation is to get some tribunal to sit and hear the arguments against this legalized robbery. Until something is done on these lines there will always be trouble in this district, especially on the deficiency question. You see the scientific way our wages are being reduced, and we have no redress, only the old, old way. </para>

                <para class="block">The writer of that letter is not looking for industrial trouble. He has always done his best to get disputes settled amicably, and he now say3 definitely that, as the men have no tribunal, there is no other way of settling a dispute, except to strike. There are fourteen or fifteen pits in my district, and there is a great deal of trouble over deficiency claims. The men's complaint is that there is no tribunal to which they can readily appeal. Very often a strike is caused because a trouble has to spread through more than one district before, under the existing system, the original cause can be investigated and possibly settled. The original intention was to appoint local boards. As the Industrial Peace Act is being administered I am afraid that, instead of conducing to industrial peace, it- causes: trouble to spread. The trouble that occurred at- the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kembla</inline> mines,, not so long ago, was due to deficiency claims. The proprietors of the mine deducted dirt, with the result that many miners were only making 13s. and 14s. a shift, instead of 19s: 9d., the. minimum hewing rate. They endeavoured  unsuccessfully to obtain redress. Eventually they went on strike, and were brought before the court under the Masters and Servants Act of New South Wales, and fined. In default they were ordered to- undergo fourteen days' imprisonment. In this way men are being oppressed to the breaking point, and it appears that they have now reached that stage in New South Wales. In many of the mines dirt and varying conditions will be encountered. They may persist for three, four, or five days, and the men may continue working, knowing that in. time the conditions will alter. Because these tribunals do not exist to give ready redress, grievances are not remedied until the men, being unable to tolerate them any longer, throw down their tools. If the creation of these boards would be unconstitutional, the whole act is unconstitutional. It has, however, continued in operation for a long time. It would be an almost perfect piece of legislation if the boards were functioning. If the Government wishes to overhaul the industrial machinery of this country in two or three months' time, that is its business; but in the meantime it should appoint the boards. If the boards prove unsatisfactory amending legislation may be introduced, but something must be done immediately to keep the men at work, lt is of no use telling the mon that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibble</inline> will deal with these matters. They know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibble</inline> cannot do so. The Prime Minister may regard certain matters as being important, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibble</inline> may think that other matters are more important. While <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibble</inline> is deciding something of importance in the south, his presence may be needed in the north or the west. If it was worth the risk of violating the Constitution to pass an act to deport trade union leaders and make them criminals, it is worth the risk of doing something that may be unconstitutional to keep the wheels of industry turning. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has called the attention of the Government, the Parliament, and the country to a possible industrial conflagration, and asks that something be done, so that should the fire break out it may be kept under control with little effort. It would not become me to speak with the same assurance as the honorable gentleman on the subject of the coal mining industry, since I have no first-hand knowledge of it. But, as he knows, I have spent a great deal of time among the coal miners, and have heard both parties in the industry state their views. It was my misfortune to be associated with the coal miners in, perhaps, the greatest industrial upheaval that has taken place in this country. On that occasion I heard their case in detail; and as Attorney-General and Leader of the Government, the troubles of the industry have been set before me on very many occasions. Prom my experience I should say that once this threatened strike starts it will be beyond the power of any man or any law, no matter now framed, to stay it. Like some malignant disease it will run its course. But now it is compassable - it may be dealt with. I do not say that the miners have a case. I know nothing about it; but I accept the Leader of the Opposition's assurance that they are dissatisfied. Speaking as an old trade union leader, although never a leader of the coal miners, I have never known an occasion when they were not dissatisfied. That, however, by the way. Dissatisfaction among coal miners is not purely local; it is world wide. Only the other day we were told in the press that the greatest industrial upheaval that America has ever known had just terminated by a sort of <inline font-style="italic">modus vivendi,</inline> after inflicting almost incalculable loss upon the industry and the community generally, and we know that Great Britain stands on the threshold of a monstrous upheaval which may shake the country to its very foundations. The honorable gentleman says that in the coal-mining industry in Australia there is dissatisfaction, that it is widespread, and that there is no remedy outside the provisions of the Industrial Peace Act. I am sure the House will allow me to say with what great satisfaction I learned from the lips of the honorable gentleman that the act has been most effective, as I said it would be, when introducing it, in dealing with industrial troubles. My honorable friend says that outside the act there is no means at the disposal of the miners for a peaceful and legal redress of their grievances, and he demands the appointment of local boards. He says that if I had been in office I should have granted his request. My attitude has been rightly interpreted by the honorable gentleman. "Without committing myself to an endorsement of his statement that there are good grounds for the dissatisfaction, I say that the facts must be faced. The greatest factor in industrial troubles is not material, but psychological. Half the troubles in the coal trade arise out of the nature of man. If they say there is a dispute, there is one. If they say there are good grounds for a dispute in this instance, they make out a prima facie case, and their request for legal means of redress ought to be granted. The act provides, in sections 21 to 26, for the appointment of local boards. The scope of those boards is limited, their functions duly set out in the sections dealing with them. The honorable member for Werriwa (Mt. Lazzarini) says that some time after the act was passed he asked me to appoint one of these boards. I do not remember the incident, but I accept his statement. The act, however, had only just been passed, and I naturally fell back on its machinery, which in effect provides that local boards shall be the creatures of the special tribunal. </para>

                        <para>- Section 23. subsection 6, provides that the special tribunal may remit certain matters to local tribunals. I think the honorable the Leader of the Opposition has made out, subject to any constitutional difficulties that may exist, a case for  the appointment of local boards. We must accept the honorable gentleman as the mouthpiece of the miners, and when he says that there is dissatisfaction, that it is likely to grow, and that there is no legal redress outside the act, he makes out a case for the appointment of boards, and they should be appointed. I understand that the Government says there are constitutional difficulties in the way. 1 do not know whether there are. There may be. But when the act was being drafted, I naturally discussed such a possibility at great length, and provided in section 2 for saving out of the wreck whatever was possible. Section 2 reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">No one knows what the constitution means. And there is only one way of finding out. If you wish to find out what the powers of the police are, the most effective way perhaps is to go up to a policeman and put the matter to the test. In that way you may find out what an assault on the police means. Why listen to long dissertations on the law? Put the matter to the supreme test. Just go outside, strike an inoffensive policeman, and you will learn all about it. And so I say the only way to ascertain whether this provision of the act is or is not constitutional is to put it in force. Create the boards asked for. If that is done either of the parties, or both, under section 27, may submit the matter to the High Court. The High Court or a Justice of the High Court may determine whether in fact an industrial dispute within the meaning of the act exists ; whether a dispute is impending or whether a board has exceeded its jurisdiction. All these things are referable to the court. In my opinion, if a local tribunal is outside the scope of our powers, a special tribunal is in the same category. The Government should appoint the boards, and see what happens. I have practised in the Arbitration Court, and have amended the arbitration law, I do not know how many times. I have advised unions to appeal to the court, and know something about the arbitration law and industrial matters generally. My experience is that the most  effective  machinery is that which is most flexible, and the most flexible is the machinery set out in the Industrial Peace Act. It contemplates the creation of district councils, composed of members of the workers' and employers' organizations, dividing the whole Commonwealth into districts in which employees and employers would have quasi-legal powers, and, in fact, legal authority to deal with certain matters. They would be overlords of industrial matters within the Commonwealth. The Industrial Peace Act, in my opinion, is framed on right lines, and the boards asked for by the Leader of the Opposition should be appointed. In expressing a doubt as to the constitutionality of the act, however, the Government strikes a most serious blow at it. For its creator or the inheritors of its creator to declare the act <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Constitution, is to create an almost insuperable difficulty. The Government says, in effect, " This act is no good, and so we do not, we dare not, put it into force." That is an invitation to challenge its validity. If those who have to administer it said, " We believe in it," then in all probability their action would not be challenged. I do not know that the employees in this case would challenge a reference to a local board. They might, but I should not care twopence if I thought that the appointment of a board was the best way to find an outlet for the grievances of the employees. I would let them see that the law really provides them with some sort of remedy, and would do what they ask. </para>
                    <para>There is one other subject about which I wish to speak, and it is this : Although time flies very rapidly, it may not have escaped the memory of honorable members that we went to the country on a matter very similar to that which the Leader of the Opposition has said is likely to arise if the unrest in the coal industry is not allayed. The condition of affairs then existing arose out of a firb which at one time could have been covered by a bushel basket. But by judicious fanning, and through other causes about which I do not wish to say anything just now, it grew into a conflagration that covered the whole industrial heavens. We went to the country to see whether, above everything else, we could not ensure industrial peace. As a result we have the Crimes Act, which says to the people, " If you break the peace in regard to matters of trade and commerce, transport or industry, then you must look out!" We have made a new law to punish those who break the industrial peace. That is all we have done since the elections to ensure industrial peace. The Leader of the Opposition this morning asked the Government to do something else. He says, ' ' If you do not do what I ask there may be trouble which may bring certain people under the Crimes Act." The Attorney-General says, "No, the coal-miners will not come under it." He may be right, but if he is it is the most complete condemnation of the act that could possibly be conceived. The position is most serious if a monopoly or a scarcity of coal can be brought about. Let us remember that if the coal-miner says, " That coal is black," it is black, whether it is brown or any other colour. If he says that it is " blacE," then every engineman on our railways, every man wanting coal to run his ship or his factory, will be affected. If that is not a blow at commerce, industry, and transport, I do not know what is. So I say that if the act does not deal with that kind of thing it ought to be amended without delay. I know what a strike of this kind means. Strikes aimed at transport are most deadly and insidious. I was drawn into such a strike when the organization with which I was connected had nothing on earth to do with the dispute, and, in my desperate efforts to maintain industrial peace, I subsequently became almost the head and front of the offending. </para>

It may be that there is; but if the men will not resort to it; if these men are obstinate - as obstinate as I am, if honorable members please - then that means of redress must be ruled out of consideration. I asked to-day why the men did not go to the State industrial court. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. With the honorable gentleman's qualification and  the Prime Minister's explanation, the position is that a reference to a State tribunal would not be effective, because die coal-miners are members of a Federal organization. I say, from my own experience, that the miners of New South Wales will not accept it. That is why we made provision for these local boards. Why the miners will not acccept the State tribunal I do not know. Once more I say that the basis and real foundation of half our industrial trouble is psychological. Men have inherited traditions and hatreds, and have memories of wrongs done to them which they cannot forget in a minute or in a year. In my opinion, the Government ought to take action. Their attention has been called by the spokesman of the miners to a condition of things which he declares to be grave. We are shortly to have a recess which may last for some weeks. If in the interim this little conflagration should become a mighty industrial fire, there will rest upon us a terrible responsibility, because, as I have said, no law can put out an industrial fire once it reaches a certain magnitude. I have led strikes when more drastic legislation than any we have passed was directed against strikers. I refer to the Wade Act of New South Wales. I know what I am talking about. Once the trouble goes beyond a certain point we cannot stop it. The fire must burn itself out; the disease must run its course. It is a simple thing for which the Leader of the Opposition asks. He asks for the appointment of local boards under the Industrial Peace Act. The Government says that that would not be constitutional. I do not care two straws whether it is constitutional or not. If the Government will act by appointing local boards it will have done all it can. do. It will not be placed in the position of giving men who ask for bread, a stone. It will not be merely talking about law when men ask for the redress of their grievances. If it is not constitutional to do what I suggest - if our powers do not enable us to deal with such a matter as this in the way for which the act provides - then we must amend the constitution to give this Parliament ample authority. If we have no power to preserve industrial peace, then we must get it, and without delay. The Government have a majority, and should at once pass such an amendment and put it before the people. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to delay the House long, as I wish to give an opportunity to the Attorney-General to say a few words in reply to the debate. The discussion has emphasized one or two very important general points. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has asked that a pending dispute, -which may be of great magnitude and. involve this country in conditions such as we have experienced in the past as the result of a coal strike, should be referred to a board. The Government turns a deaf ear to the request. The Prime Minister has said that what the Leader of the Opposition has proposed is the proper way to deal with the question. He gave it his blessing, but he refused to give it his consent. That is the kind of thing which leads from one difficulty to another. This policy of inaction by the Government is the cause of much trouble. It went to the country, as the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has said, with a flourish of trumpets, and claimed that it was the one and only Government to bring about industrial peace. It has returned from the country, and has done nothing yet for industrial peace. It has provided punishments for strikes, but nothing to prevent them. One of the most serious things which the head of a government eau do is to challenge the constitutionality of an act which it has been called upon to administer. That is practically what the Prime Minister did to-day. He said that a local board appointed under a section of the act would be unconstitutional, and that, indeed, if the act itself were challenged, it, or a large portion of it, might be declared to be unconstitutional. Yet that measure has done more than any other legislation passed by this Parliament to preserve peace in the coalmining industry, which, of all industries was considered one of the most difficult to manage. I dissent from the statement of the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that the bulk of the disputes are of psychological origin, and are based on old hatreds and  memories of past wrongs. My answer to that is that existing wrongs - real grievances that occur in the every-day lives of men working in the bowels, of the earth - are the causes of friction and enmity, and unless these real, and immediate wrongs and grievances are remedied quickly they develop into serious disputes.. The Prime Minister advanced two reasons for the non-appointment of local boards. Firstly, he said, such boards would be unconstitutional. As the right honorable member for North Sydney said, the only way to test whether or not the legislation is constitutional is to put it in operation. The law providing for ' the appointment of boards is on the statute-book, and it is the duty of the Government to test it in practice. I submit, however, that if a board, created under the act, would be unconstitutional, the act itself is unconstitutional. The Prime Minister's second excuse for not putting the Industrial Peace Act into full operation was that the Government proposes to submit to Parliament legislation upon industrial matters,, and the miners are urged to wait until this new panacea is evolved. This policy of waiting may land the country in serious trouble. When, on another occasion, we asked that the problem of unemployment be dealt with by the Government, we were told to- wait until the Royal Commission on Insurance had submitted' its report. This counsel of delay is futile when problems of industrial unrest and unemployment are so pressing. The Prime Minister told the House that, twelve months ago, a deputation waited on him at Lithgow, and made the same request that was .put forward by the Leader of the Opposition to-day. Yet we are asked to wait another two months while the Government further ponders the problem. I warn Ministers that there is trouble looming on the coal-fields, particularly in New South Wales, and if it develops in that State it will quickly spread to other places. If trouble does break out, the Government already has the- Crimes Act with which to punish the workers. The Attorney-General said that no employee in the coal-mining industry will be affected by that legislation. Technically, the honorable member's statement may be correct; I do not dispute his interpretation, of the law; but if it is right it emphasizes those absurdities in the Crimes Act, to which the right honorable member for North Sydney drew attention. If trouble occurs on the coal-fields, and the miners go on strike and declare the coal black, they will be immune from any punishment under the Crimes Act; but an engine-driver who. in loyalty to his comrades, refuses to handle " black" coal may be put in jail. What justification can be offered for such illogical discrimination? This legislation was only make-believe, intended to save the faces of the. Government after a stunt election. Honorable members opposite went before the electors and talked of industrial peace, although they represent those forces in this country that have resisted every effort by the workers to establish machinery for the peaceful settlement of industrial troubles. If honorable members will cast back  their  memories a quarter of a century to the inception of wages boards and arbitration courts, they will find that every request for the establishment of pacific tribunals was fought and resisted in every possible way by the employers, and the arbitration machinery was put on the statute-book only by the strength of organized labour. Even now, only when the workers strike, or threaten to strike, can they get redress by constitutional means. But during the recent election the press was filled with lies about the workers flouting constitutional means, and declining to submit their grievances to peaceful arbitrament. Every request by the workers for the establishment of constitutional tribunals has been denied. Yet the Crimes Act has been placed on the statute-book in order that men who go on strike to secure justice may be declared criminals. The Industrial Peace Act has been in existence for years. Its purpose is to ensure industrial peace. But its operations are limited, and, in many cases, nothing is done to remedy long-standing grievances until something serious happens. Unions have spent thousands of pounds in trying to get their plaints heard by the tribunals established in accordance with the law of the land, and the employers have raised all sorts of dirty, mean quibbles in trying to prevent their reaching the court, or, if they got that far, in- contesting the legality of the proceedings. And still the workers are told that they are the law breakers, and that they should abide by constitutional means. The  action  of the Prime </para>

                    <para>. -  The importance and urgency of the question raised by the Leader of the Opposition must be recognized by every honorable member. The Government earnestly desires to do everything possible to utilize existing machinery for the maintenance of industrial peace, but some honorable members appear to have misunderstood the explanation given by the Prime Minister. The Industrial Peace Act cannot function without the co-operation and consent of both sides in an industry. Both employers and employees must appoint representatives to sit on the special tribunals and local boards. Although those boards are appointed by the Governor-General they must be composed of representatives of employers and employees, and no meeting can be held unless a statutory quorum is present. Accordingly, if either the employers or the employees refuse to appoint representatives to the board, or to allow their representatives to function, the board cannot operate. The employers in the coal-mining industry have been requested to join in the appointment of boards; but, unfortunately, in the northern, southern, and western districts of New South Wales, they have, for reasons which they set forth, and which I shall not attempt to canvass at this stage, declined to have anything to do with local boards. Therefore, it is impossible for the Government to appoint such boards. </para>

                        <para>- I am discussing now the powers of the Government under existing legislation, and I am pointing out that the co-operation and consent of the two parties are the first essentials. In the absence of the consent of the employers, it' is impossible to appoint a local board. The constitutional difficulties mentioned by the Prime Minister do not directly arise at the present time; they relate, not to the mere appointment of the board, but to its functioning. The power of this Parliament in relation to industrial disputes is restricted to disputes which are interstate in character. The Industrial Peace Act necessarily provides that local boards shall deal only with interstate disputes. If such a board does deal with an interstate dispute it acts constitutionally. </para>

                        <para>- I am coming to that point. A dispute affecting a particular mine is the kind of matter with which local boards are intended to deal. If a board's jurisdiction were challenged by one party, the question would arise as to whether the trouble was part of an industrial dispute. If it were, it could be rightly dealt with by the local board, as many such matters are dealt with by the Arbitration Court, but only because they are part of or incidents in an interstate dispute. The constitutional difficulty associated with the Industrial Peace Act does not appear on the face of the statute, but is incidental to its operation. That was illustrated recently when the employers obtained an injunction or prohibition from the High Court. </para>

                        <para>- A dispute in a mine as to, say, the working of a particular seam by the men employed in that mine, is not in itself an interstate dispute. There may be, however, an interstate dispute involving a particular local dispute. In each case the nature of the dispute is a question of fact to be determined by the court. The matters with which local boards are intended to deal are essentially of a local character, and that brings us face to face with the real diffi-  cult}', namely, that the Commonwealth powers are limited to disputes extending beyond the limits of one State. We have to face the facts as we find them. The employers refuse to appoint representatives to sit on a local board; therefore; no board can be appointed, or, if appointed, it cannot meet with a quorum. The act contains no provision for compelling persons appointed by the Government to sit on a board ; it is therefore impossible for a board to be appointed under existing circumstances. The Prime Minister has said, however, that the Government will take steps to utilize fully the existing machinery by asking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibble</inline> to arrange for an early hearing by the special tribunal of the disputes which are at present causing irritation amongst the coal miners. Fortunately, both sides have accepted the jurisdiction of the special tribunals, and it is hoped that they will continue to function. The Prime Minister's proposal offers an immediate means of dealing with the situation, and is much preferable to plunging into difficulties which would probably lead to litigation, delay, expense, and disappointment. I submit that the Government is adopting the wisest course in seeking to use to the full, and immediately, the existing machinery, which is acceptable to both sides. </para>

                        <para>- On the 11th March the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman),</inline> asked whether consideration had been given to the series of grave charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. N;</inline> Francis in the <inline font-style="italic">Aussie</inline> magazine, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson,</inline> concerning the alleged maltreatment of aborigines by Japanese and others in the northern parts of Australia, and, if so, what action had been taken or was proposed to be taken in connexion with the matter. At the time of the honorable member's inquiry the articles in question had not been seen by the Minister for Home and Territories, but an opportunity has since been afforded him of perusing them. The articles demonstrate clearly that the allegations made are as to the treatment of aborigines in 'Queensland. No reference whatever is made therein to the aborigines of the Northern Territory, unless one vague reference to " the North" could be construed as such, but, even in this case, no particulars are given and no evidence connecting that reference with the Northern Territory is furnished. As previously stated in the answer to the honorable member's question, the care of the aborigines within the various States of the Commonwealth is the responsibility of the respective State Governments, and it would appear that the allegations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Francis</inline> are the concern of the Government of Queensland and not of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- On the 17th March the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> referred to the ravages of the borer in Australian timber and asked whether the Government would cause an investigation to be made with the object of eliminating the pest. I am now in a position to inform the honorable member that this question concerns the Department of Health only in this way: The Quarantine Act is designed to prevent the introduction into the Commonwealth of plant diseases and insect pests, including such things as timber borers. It is probable that many kinds of timber have their own specific parasites, while other parasites are common to different countries or to different classes of timber. New phases of this question, therefore, are constantly arising and have to be dealt with as they arise through the detection of these borers in imported timber. Each new variety of parasite has, in its turn, been dealt with when discovered, but it is to be expected that others will from time to time be found under one of the many conditions in which wooden articles arrive in the Commonwealth as imports. No general principles can be formulated adequate to cover all possibilities, but the greatest care is being taken to detect new channels of danger and to deal with these as detected. The major portion of the borer problem to-day, however, is the occurrence over a wide area and on a considerable scale of borer insects, either indigenous to or long established in Australia. As stated by the Prime Minister in the House on the 22nd instant, the whole question of carrying out investigations regarding white ant and borer pests will be referred to the Institute of Science and Industry when reconstituted. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave.)</inline> - As a number of questions have been asked in the House from -time to time in connexion with the construction of the Grafton-Kyogle-South Brisbane Railway, I desire to state that the work of connecting Sydney and Brisbane by a standard gauge railway is governed by an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales aud Queensland, dated 16th September, 1924, which agreement was in that year ratified by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Queensland. Under the agreement the work  i9  vested in a railway council, consisting of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, the Chief Railways Commissioner, New South Wales, and the Commissioner for Railways, Queensland. The council has entire control of the work, and determines the order and the terms and conditions under which the works are to be carried out. Under the agreement, the cost of the works is, in the first instance, provided by the Commonwealth. The States of New South Wales and Queensland pay their quota on a population basis, the Commonwealth contributing one-fifth, and, in addition, for the time being bearing the quota which, had Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia been parties to the agreement, would have been borne by those States. The work consists of re-laying and strengthening of the railway between Grafton and Kyogle, and the construction of a railway from Kyogle to South Brisbane. The work between Grafton and Kyogle, which is being carried out by the Chief Railways Commissioner for New South Wales, acting as agent for the council, is now well in hand. Considerable work has also been done by the Commissioner for Railways, Queensland, acting as agent for the council, in the vicinity of Rocklea towards South Brisbane and also towards the border. Last year the Railway Council invited tenders, which closed on the 1st September, 1925, for the construction of two portions of the railway, 26^ miles being in New South Wales, and 60J miles in Queensland. One tender was submitted for the work in Queensland, and two for the work in New South. Wales. At the time of the closing of the tenders, sealed estimates by the railway construction engineers of New South Wales and Queensland were also submitted. The total of the two sealed estimates was considerably lower than the total of the two lowest tenders. The council proposed to arrange that the work be undertaken by the Railways Commissioners of -New South Wales and Queensland respectively, and advised the parties to the agreement accordingly. These proposals formed the basis of negotiations between the Commonwealth Government and the States of New South Wales and Queensland. A conference of the representatives of the three parties was held in Melbourne in January last, resulting in an understanding that the sealed estimates of the chief railway construction engineers should be regarded as a firm tender, subject to the following stipulations : - </para>

                    <para class="block">After several conferences between the Railway Council and the Crown Solicitors of the Commonwealth, New South Wales, and Queensland, contract agreements have now been signed by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the respective Premiers on behalf of the States of New South Wales and Queensland, whereby the works will be carried out at the rates shown in the sealed estimate. If the total of the two lowest outside tenders is compared with the total of the amounts for which the respective States, on behalf of their Chief Railway Construction Engineers, have now contracted to do the work, it will be seen that a considerable sum of money is saved to the Commonwealth and the other parties to the agreement. The lowest public tenders, including departmental supervision, which necessarily has to be incurred, and which must be added when comparing with the State contract price, were as follow: - </para>

                    <para class="block">The saving on the lowest public tenders is therefore £201,968. Compared with the lowest public tender in Queensland, the contract with the State represents a very large saving. Compared with the lowest public tender in New South Wales, the contract with the State represents an increase of approximately £1,S00, and in this latter case the council has not accepted the lowest tender, but has decided that the preferable course would be to have the work carried out in the same way that it is being done in Queensland. The estimated cost of the whole work was £3,500,000, -and under the Grafton to South Brisbane Railway Act .1924 authority is given for that sum to be advanced by the Treasurer to the railway council in control of the work. The estimate of £3,500,000 was prepared by the Royal Commission on the Uniform Gauge in 1921 without proper surveys; but, when the tenders and sealed estimates were received, the railway council prepared a full estimate based on reliable data, and the work is now estimated to cost £4,000,000. A bill will be introduced to Parliament shortly to provide for the extra £500,000.

                        <para>. - Sub-item AA of this item is intended to rectify an anomaly. A previous parliament decided to admit knitted cotton piece goods in tubular form free of duty, principally with the object of helping the meat packers to pack their export meat acceptably. But for some years the importers have avoided the incidence of the  tariff by splitting their tubular knitted goods and bringing them out here as cotton piece goods and thereby importing a semi-manufactured article duty free. Parliament decided to close up that loop-hole by adding the words " or otherwise " ; "but another loophole has been discovered ; and in order to close it and make the position unmistakably clear I move - </para>

                        <para>. - In view of our having amended sub-item AA, it will be necessary for us to make a consequential amendment to sub-item n to exempt specially from this duty the items that we have just included under sub-item AA. I draw attention to the reduction made in this item, and also to the Government's policy in connexion with Britishpreference. In the last tariff the duties imposed on silk piece goods were 15 per cent., 15 per cent., and 20 per cent. British, intermediate and general, respectively. In the proposals now submitted they are 10 per cent.,12½ per cent., and17½ per cent. respectively. In other words, the general duty has been reduced by 2½per cent., and the British duty by5 per cent., which increases the British preference. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Mr.C.RILEY (Cook) [3.3].- The 1921 tariff provided for duties of 15 per oent., 15 per cent. and 20 per cent., British, intermediate, and general respectively. Within the last two years a silk weaving mill has been established in Sydney, more than £10,000 capital being employed in it. It seems strange that just at the time that the factory has overcome its initial difficulties it should be further hampered by having the duties reduced. Bather should they be left as they are, not only to encourage the mill to which I have referred, but also to assist in establishing further silk weaving mills in Australia. I admit that the argument which has been used in connexion with Australian cotton and wool spinning and weaving factories does not apply to silk weaving factories, because we do not grow the raw material in this country. Nevertheless, we should do all that we can to promote the establishment of factories to deal with silk from the spinning stage onward. Even if the Minister is determined to reduce the British tariff from 15 per cent. to 10 per cent., there is no justification for a reduction of the duty on foreign goods. Australia imports, chiefly fromJapan, silk goods to the value of £5,000,000 per annum. We should encourage our own industries rather than import Japanese goods. I suggest that this matter be referred to the Tariff Board, with a view to assisting the local industry by allowing the raw material to enter free of duty. There is little justification for the proposed reduction of duty. </para>

                            <para>.- The Tariff Board has investigated this matter, and these reductions are made in accordance with its report. I am aware that there is a small silk-weaving factory in New South Wales, but I do not know whether it makes one special line of silk only. The Tariff Board in its report stated that no local industry would be affected by this proposal.  " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WATT</inline> (Balaclava) [3.6].- I ask the Minister whether the 15 per cent. British duty which it is now proposed to reduce to 10 per cent, was not merely a revenue duty, and not one imposed to protect an Australian industry. Apart from its effect, I understand that the duty was imposed because silk clothing was supposed to be a luxury. If the object of this reduction is to give the British manufacturer a greater proportion of our silk trade, the Minister should not reduce the whole of the three columns. I think that he should give the committee some further explanation, apart altogether from answering the question raised by the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. C. Riley),</inline> whose desire is to still further protect the industry to which he has referred. It would appear that we are throwing away revenue for no apparent purpose. </para>

                        <para>.- Although the Minister said that the intention was to increase the British preference, the additional advantage is only 2-t per cent. It would be better if he would agree to the general tariff remaining at 20 per cent., instead of reducing it to 17-J per cent. That would give a preference of 10 per cent, to the British and more protection to the Australian manufacturer. Most of the competition is in connexion with the general tariff. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to refer to item 105k For a long time the industry concerned has been subjected to unfair competition from countries where cheap coloured labour is employed. If we are to maintain the high standard of living which we have set up, we must make it possible for industries to pay Australian rates of wages. Before this tariff was introduced, many of the mills in Australia found great difficulty in carrying on. But the amended tariff has benefited them considerably; some Queensland mills have now six months' work ahead of them. The Australian mills have been handicapped greatly because of the importations, mostly from Japan, of large quantities of inferior material. Some of it was almost rubbish, yet it was got up in such a way that it was purchased in large quantities by Australian housewives, who realized later that it was not so good as it was represented to be. I wish it to be understood that I am not opposed to protection, especially so far as this industry is concerned; but I hope that this tariff will not mean that the Australian consumer will be called upon to pay more for materials not manufactured in Australia. I refer to alpacas, silesias, mohairs, and lustres. These goods are not manufactured in Australia, but they contain wool. I have made careful inquiries, and have ascertained that there is not the slightest prospect of them being manufactured in this country, manufacturers having their hands quite full with other work. I should like to know if the articles referred to come under item 105f (3), dutiable at 15 per cent. British, 20 per cent. intermediate, and 25 per cent. general. </para>

                        <para>.- In view of the vote taken yesterday on cotton- tweeds, and the very obvious determination of the committee to support the extra textile duties, I do not propose to speak against any of the remaining textile items in the schedule, but I wish to make it quite clear that this does not in any way indicate a change of opinion on my part. I am convinced that the imposition of these duties will bring about a revulsion of feeling, and, eventually, a demand for their withdrawal. I hope that the committee will give careful attention to the extra duties imposed in the division relating to metals and machinery. I intend to take every opportunity to secure a revision of the extreme protective duties. </para>

                        <para>.- As a believer in the future of our woollen industry, the British preferential duties imposed under sub-item 105f (1) and (2) have my unqualified support. I hope that as the result of these duties the woollen industry in Australia will go ahead by leaps and bounds. Lustres or alpacas are used extensively as linings for the higher grade ready-to-wear and measure garments for men. Manufacturers of this class of goods come into direct competition with manufacturers of imported ready-to-wear suits. Alpaca or lustre lining is used because, unlike cotton lining, it is uncrushable, and gives the finished garment a better appearance. The manufacturers wish to be in a position to compete with the imported article, and they have asked me to see if it is possible to have the material admitted duty free, if they enter into an engagement to use it exclusively for linings. </para>

I had inquiries made, and found that practically every big draper makes regalia ' of some sort. The department felt, therefore, that if regalia were admitted indiscriminately duty free, we should not only inflict an injustice upon a section of the trade in Australia,' but also involve the department in all sorts of administrative difficulties. For that reason, I am unable to do as the honorable member suggests. </para>

                        <para>.- The 1921 tariff provided that woven materials in the piece or otherwise, including ribbons and galoons having not more than 40 ribs to the lineal inch, and not more than 3£ inches in width, should be dutiable, ad valorem 35 per cent. British, 40 per cent, intermediate, and 50 per cent, general. It is now proposed that ribbons and galoons shall not have more than 48 ribs to the lineal inch. The object is to protect the Australian industry. Galoons are manufactured for hat purposes principally, but under this bald definition a number of other ribbons may be included. Let me give <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> few illustrations. I am sorry that I have no samples of ribbons, but they  aTe  valuable, and I do not wish to hand them round for honorable members to experiment with. A watch-guard is usually a black ribbon, and, in addition to being ribbed, it has a moire finish. It is not made in Australia, nor is it likely to be made here, but it comes within this definition. There are also a number of faille ribbons in light colourings which are used for hair ribbons and millinery purposes. Their importation can in no way interfere with the ribbon industry in Australia. A number of fancy ribbed ribbons are used for lingerie. </para>

                            <para>- I am arguing that a large number of ribbed ribbons, which it is not intended shall be dutiable, are dutiable. I have mentioned instances of ribbons upon which duties have been collected during the last few months. I have been shown another ribbon used for lingerie. To come under this item, a ribbon must have no break from border to border; but under -the departmental interpretation this particular ribbon, because it came within 48 ribs to the inch, although it had a fine satin or silk thread near the border, and a pico't edge, was treated as dutiable. I suggest the addition to the item of the words " and not made in Australia." That would give the Customs Department a clear indication of what was meant, and if in future those ribbons were made in Australia, they would automatically come within the provisions of the schedule </para>

                        <para>.- I am glad to see this item on the schedule, because it re-establishes for the ribbon industry the protection that was denied under the 1921 tariff. Before the 1921 tariff the item was as- it is now, but in 1921 the duty was applied only to ribbons up -to 40 ribs to the inch. The effect was that college bands, which were being successfully manufactured in this country, were admitted free. That provision was made with the object of allowing  millinery ribbons to be imported free; it does not affect them to any appreciable extent. When the item applied only to ribbons up to 40 ribs to the inch, the importers were able to import, free of duty, college bands with 41 ribs to the inch. I have samples with 32 ribs, 40 ribs, and 44 ribs to the inch ; and I venture to say that no honorable member, without measuring and counting the ribs, could distinguish between them. In. Melbourne there are two well-equipped mills making these ribbons. I invite honorable members, as a matter of interest, to inspect those mills. When I saw them first they amazed me. I have to thank the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. G. Francis)</inline> for pointing out to me that this industry existed in my electorate, and, apart from the knowledge I gained, I have to thank him, also, for the entertainment a visit to those factories provided . This industry is not a parasite on Australia, for almost immediately after the 1921 tariff was passed its price list was lowered. I should imagine, from the information I have received from experts, that all the ribbons referred to by the honorable member for Angus <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parsons)</inline> could be made with a larger number of ribs to the inch than 48. They are of the finer class of ribbons. Watchguards, for instance, can be made with 49 ribs to the inch. The duty applies only to ribbed ribbons that have up to 48 ribs to the inch. College bands are not made with over 48 ribs to the inch. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has not grasped my point. I speak with the knowledge of an expert, for I had two and a half years' experience in a wholesale ribbon department, and am still able to judge the value of silk within1d. or1½d. a yard. This question of ribbons does not appear to be understood by honorable members. If the committee will postpone the item for a quarter of an hour I can obtain some specimens of ribbon to illustrate my point. I reiterate my previous suggestion that the difficulty could be overcome by adding the words " and not manufactured in Australia." </para>

                        <para>. - I ask my honorable friend to accept my assurance that this is a rectification of a wrong done in 1921. All ribbons that come under the item can be manufactured in Australia. If there are any that cannot be manufactured here they will be dealt with very leniently by the department under other items of the tariff. </para>

                        <para>. -  I obtained full particulars of the industry in Australia some time ago, and speaking from memory I think there are about seven small factories making artificial flowers and employing 200 employees, principally girls. So far as the Government is concerned it will do nothing to starve this small industry out of existence. This item has for years been a source of worry to the Trade and Customs Department. The old tariff levied a specific duty on "sprays, trails or posies," and in order to effectively protect the revenue it has been found necessary to open up almost every case of artificial flowers imported and go through it in order to collect the different duties on the two varieties of imports. The department and the Tariff Board considered this matter very carefully. Something has to be done to protect the local industry against the importation of cheap artificial flowers at the ends of seasons. The little industry that has already been established has many difficulties to face owing to its products being dependent upon seasonal trade. I have said that the item has been a source of worry to the department because of the necessity of opening up cases of artificial flowers on the wharfs, and this has also been harassing to importers. It was felt that it would be a fair compromise to simplify the item and impose an ad valorem duty covering all imports under this item. </para>

                        <para>. -  Although I do not pretend to have made exhaustive inquiries into this matter, I was given some figures concerning it two years ago, and they have remained in my memory. That is why, when speaking generally on the tariff, I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs to supply the committee with exact particulars concerning this industry in Australia. I was told that there was but one artificial flower factory in Australia, and that it employed 35 girls. In view of the Minister's assurances to me I think it is regrettable that he is not today in a position to give the particulars for which I asked. He says he thinks that there are about seven factories employing about 200 persons, principally girls. It appears to me that under the new form in which the item is drafted, artificial flowers will include " sprays, trails or posies." </para>

                        <para>.- During last week-end I made inquiries into the artifical flower industry. I do not vouch for their absolute accuracy, but I give the facts as they were given to me. I have them from the manager of the millinery department of a very large company, and they are confirmed by my own experience. During the war period an artificial flower company, known, I think, as the Australian Flower Manufacturing Company, was started in Sydney. It manufactured a certain quantity of artificial flowers, but got on to the rocks and was reconstructed from time to time in different hands. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so. The artificial flower trade is a very peculiar trade. First and foremost, it is a fashion trade. Flowers are in fashion in one season, and out of fashion in another. During last winter season, with the exception of a few celluloid trimmings, flowers and trimmings were scarcely used at all. The ladies of Australia, for some reason, probably because of the fashion of shingled hair, went in for close fitting felt hats in conformity with the straight lines of their costumes. The result was that people who imported artificial flowers and millinery ornaments, and I was one of them, had to scrap the stuff. The industry is dependent entirely upon fashionable trade. What is going to be worn is decided, not here, but in the fashion centres of Paris, London, and New York. Rightly or wrongly, Australian women follow the dictates of the creators of fashions in those centres. Our seasons follow the seasons overseas, and the artificial flower industry in Australia is for this reason placed at a very great disadvantage. I believe that the best thing to do would be to pay the people engaged in this industry what it is worth, and put them to some more profitable occupation. Honestly, for the reasons I have given, I do not see that there is any future for the artificial flower industry. My informant, who is a personal friend of mine, and a brother member of the lodge to which I belong, told me that the manufacturers of artificial flowers came to him and said, " We cannot sell you anything original, but we are prepared to copy anything." He tried to give them orders on those lines, but the trouble was that by the time the copy was delivered it was too late for the season. I had many years experience of the millinery trade, and I may say that whilst a few years ago fashions in millinery ornaments changed about every six months, to-day, what is right in January may be wrong in February. The honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes)</inline> has pointed out that this is an item which concerns our women folk.. I am not going to move for a reduction of the proposed duty, brat I have placed the facts concerning it before the committee so that honorable members may vote upon the item with some knowledge. If the Minister thinks that it would be better to reconsider the item, I shall have no objection to that course being followed. </para>

                        <para>.- Artificial flowers for . millinery purposes made in Australia compare favourably in quality and price with the imported article. My experience is opposed to that of the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parsons).</inline> I had a fairly extensive experience of the trade, and did not find it necessary to go outside of Australia for the purchase of these goods. </para>

                            <para>- For the information of the honorable member I may say that I handled them for years. I was in the trade all my life until I came into this House. I had a sister in the business with me, who was considered' in the trade to be exceptionally expert in the making of millinery and in creating hats. During the period to which I refer, running into nearly seven years, artificial flowers were not imported to any extent for the business which I conducted.. The Australian article was right in quality, iu line with the fashions, and was considerably cheaper than the imported article. I was not aware that the Australian Flower Manufacturing Company went into liquidation, as the honorable member for Angas has said. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Boothby {Mr. Duncan-hughes) seems to think that the interests of 200 women may be lightly brushed aside, but it is as serious a matter t,o take their livelihood from them as it would be to take their means of living from the same number of men. Many of the women engaged in this industry may be .helping to keep the families to which they belong, or to support widowed mothers. If we can put a duty of 20 per cent, on silks as a luxury, there is no reason why the duty on artificial flowers should not be allowed to remain. I contend that there is an opening 'for the expansion of this industry in Australia. It is a small- industry, wherever it is engaged in  but it will expand here with the increased requirements of th.fi people. I agree with the Minister that this Parliament ought not to strangle it. </para>

                        <para>. - I draw the attention of the committee to the additional duties upon this item. Do honorable members think it is justifiable to further increase the cost of clothing to this extent? For instance, honorable members will see that on a costume, dress or robe of silk, or containing silk the general tariff is 15s., and 45 per cent. ad valorem; in other words if the landed cost of a Paris robe were 40s, the duty would amount to 64s. I suggest that if the duties imposed by the 1921 tariff were retained, local industry would be receiving a fair measure of protection. In the windows of the huge emporiums of Melbourne we can see for sale at from £7 7s. to £15 15s., robes which probably cost not more than 30s. or £2.

                        <para>.- I support the amendment, and am glad that the Minister has accepted the recommendation of the Tariff Board to reimpose the duties on imported carpet felt. As he has said, a very fine industry has been established in my electorate, and under the direction of an expert felt maker from England the factory is producing all types of felt, including all wool felt, carpet felt, under carpet felt, slipper felt, cattle ruglinings, saddle cloths and a- few other small items. The works are capable of supplying the whole of Australia's requirements in these articles. The increase in duties has been asked for by the company, not with a view to increasing the price in the local market, but merely as a protection against unfair competition from abroad. The works are capable of producing 20,000 yards of felt per week. Carpet felt to about the value of £120,000 is imported annually, and Parliament should encourage a local industry which will retain that money in Australia. I call the attention of honorable members to samples of slipper felts; carpet felts, under carpet felts, and saddle cloths. Local manufacture of these articles will help considerably other branches of the woollen industry, the tanners and manufacturers of gelatine. Under carpet felt is made from cowhair. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Until recently there was no use for cow-hair, and tanners employed a process that actually destroyed it. Felt manufacture having created a market for cow-hair, the tanners have changed their process, and they and the makers of gelatine will save many thousands of pounds annually. It is a great pleasure to visit the felt factory and see the quality of its products.. Australian felts are superior to the English article in the opinion of experts and many large retailers. Since the Sydney factory has been producing felt the English combine has reduced the price of one class of felt from 7s. to 5s. 9d a yard, and the second quality from 5s. 9d to 5s 2d. a yard. If the Ford Motor Works require large quantities of upholstering felt, the factory in my electorate will be able to supply it. I trust the Minister will give favorable consideration to the question of protecting cattle rug lining, which is not provided for under this item. I hope that its inclusion will be favorably considered by the Government,and that in the next schedule submitted to Parliament provision will be made for the adequate protection of cattle rug lining. </para>

                        <para>. Under  this item provision is made for the imposition of a duty of 20s. British, 30s. intermediate, and 40s. general on scrap iron and steel imported into Australia I trust the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> and the members of the committee will agree to allow the articles mentioned in this item, which are absolutely essential in foundry work, to. enter Australia free of duty. If we increase the cost of producing articles in which these commodities are used, we shall be placing many manufacturers who are using scrap from and steel entirely out of court. Scrap iron and steel must be available to enable foundries. to carry on their work. When this subject was being investigated by the. Tariff Board - I am not blaming the board - those controlling foundries were unaware that an inquiry was being: conducted by the board at the request of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. It is in the interests of the manufacturers and workers of Australia and' our progress generally., that material of this description, which is required for manufacturing purposes, shall not bear this impost. Prior to the war there was not  much necessity for a duty on scrap iron and steel, but during the war period, when there was little opportunity of supplies being obtained from overseas, discarded machinery and scrap material was brought from all parts of Australia. In Western Australia such machinery was dispatched hundreds of miles by rail to the various foundries, in which a mixture consisting of 50 per cent, of scrap iron and 50 per cent, of pig iron was used in foundry work generally. Some large and important firms are interested in this question, including C.  Monteath  and Sons, J. Nixon and Sons, Mephan Ferguson Proprietary Limited, John Danks and Sons Proprietary Limited, P. Laughton and Son, and J. and T. Muir. In dealing with the duty on scrap iron, these manufacturers state - </para>

                        <para>It is apparent, from the reports which were published in the press at the time of the adoption of this schedule, that the reason for the imposition of the duty in question was in order that there should be a larger consumption of pig iron, with a consequent advantage to the local manufacturers of the latter commodity. It is unfortunate that the matter came 'before the Tariff Board without the knowledge of the  ironfounders  of Australia generally, and, if the hearing of the case was advertised at the time, the advertisement was not even noticed by any manufacturer or organization of manufacturers, and, consequently, no case was presented on their behalf before the Tariff Board. We would, therefore, like the opportunity to take exception at this stage to certain of the evidence tendered before the Tariff Board, and to emphasize the point that, owing to the increased cost of castings, there has been such a falling-off in demand. </para>

                        <para>That it would bc extremely likely that not only will the object of the imposition of the duty in question fail in its purpose, but, in addition, a number of  ironmoulders  and workers in this country will be thrown out of employment. We can cite instances, particularly in cast-iron pipe foundries, where numbers of hands have already been paid off, and there is every prospect of further considerable reductions of such stairs. This position is being brought about owing to the high cost of production of cast iron pipes in Australia, which is not only holding up many schemes which engineers have in contemplation, but is forcing them to the adaption of inferior substitutes, and rendering possible the importation of cast-iron pipes from  abroad  at a lower price than that for which they can be locally manufactured. </para>

                        <para>Specifications of cast-iron work almost invariably provide for the admixture with pig-iron of previously melted iron. This course tends to purify the mixture, and, unless the ultimate cost of the commodity is going to be vastly increased by two separate meltings of pig "iron, the end is attained by the -use of machinery scrap. The use of scrap in iron foundries* is universal and practically essential, but it is not obtainable in Australia in sufficient quantities to meet the demands of Australian foundries, and must, of necessity, be imported. During the war, when it became impossible to import supplies from abroad, dealers in cast-iron scrap scoured the length and breadth of the country for all descriptions of disused mining and other machinery which previously it would have been unprofitable to break up and transport to the iron foundries. Prices of this material rose to an exorbitant figure, but the imperative necessity for its use compelled iron foundries to purchase it irrespective of price. Thus scrap, which immediately before the war was selling at about £3 to £3 10s. per ton, rose in price to as high as £14 and £15 per ton, but still found purchasers. </para>

                    <para class="block">The impression was created that prior to 1919 our importations of pig iron were very small, and that because, in 1922-3, more than 24,000 tons were imported, the interests of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company were being adversely affected. Even if more comprehensive figures were not submitted to the board by the witnesses that it examined, I submit that it should have taken steps to obtain them. Had it done so it would have found that as far back as 1906 we imported more than 16,000 tons of pig iron annually, and that in 1914-5 a good deal more than that came here. In the period 1906-1915 the figures varied from something over 22,000 tons, to about 14,000 tons. It will be seen therefore, that for very many years, until the war dislocated all our industries, the Australian iron founders imported large quantities of scrap iron. Honorable members should realize that a mixture of pig iron and scrap iron is necessary to obtain a first-rate casting for making stoves and other similar articles. The importations of scrap iron in the war years were small because it was quite impossible for them to be large. Great Britain needed all the scrap iron that she had for her own use. In the interests of. good workmanship it is a false policy to attempt to force iron founders to use more pig iron than is desirable. For water hydrants, stoves, and a good many other articles that 1 could enumerate, a special quality of casting is necessary. The manufacturer says in effect, "If I am obliged to use more pig iron than is necessary to make a good casting, I shall have to turn out inferior work." If a duty is imposed upon imported scrap iron, the founders will have to use iron pipes in its stead, as they have already done in some cases, to obtain the proper mixture of materials to make good castings. The imposition of this duty can only result in the unemployment of many men who are now working in iron foundries. It is not necessary for the protection of the industry, and I urge honorable members to vote against it. </para>

                        <para>.- This duty is being imposed because scrap iron has been dumped in Australia, to the detriment of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. Iron founders are using it instead of locally-manufactured pig iron. I am certain that our iron founders could find in Australia all the scrap iron that they need, if they would search for it. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company has to use scrap iron, and it is able to obtain it locally, and so could every other engineering company that needs it, if it cared to search for it. Weshouldnot allow scrap  iron  from other countries to be dumped here, and so limit the use of our own pig iron. </para>

                        <para>.- The iron founders have declared definitely that scrap iron is essential to their industries, and that they are unable to obtain sufficient supplies locally. I regret that misleading figures were submitted to the Tariff Board by the persons in favour of the imposition of this duty; but that does not relieve the board of the obligation to satisfy itself that the wise presented to it was based on a sound foundation. The figures quoted by the honorable member forSwan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> show that from 1906 to 1914-5 Australia made large importations of scrap iron. The figures fell off during the war years, because of circumstances over which the iron founders had mo control; but as soon as the dislocations caused by the war were overcome, large importations were again made. But the importations in 1923-4 totalled only 17,000 tons, as against 16,000 tons in 1906, in spite of the development that had occurred in the meantime m the Australian engineering industry. That shows conclusively that scrap iron is not being dumped here. If honorable members insist on the imposition of this duty they will be adopting a shortsighted policy, of the penny-wise pound-foolish description, that will frustrate the achievement of their object. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company is making very good progress with its ironworks,andreasonable and regular advances are shown in its production of pig iron. Seeing that it has been shown beyond question that an admixture of scrap iron and pig iron is desirable to obtain satisfactory castings for certain manufactures, we should not place an obstacle in the way of the iron founders getting the scrap iron that they need. The recommendation of the Tariff Board is based on a one-sided investigation; and on the facts before it, the committee should vote against this sub-item. It has not been shown . that there is an abnormal influx of scrap iron into this country, but, on the other hand, it has been shown that our manufacturers have been unable to obtain adequate supplies locally. </para>

                            <para>- A method which enables us to use our waste material 'to economic advantage appears to me to be a good one. Should scrap iron be unobtainable, and the pig iron have to be melted twice, the cost of cast-iron pipes will become so great that substitutes will be used, or cast-iron pipes imported from other countries where the cost of manufacture is less. During the war period Australia was scoured for sources of scrap iron.  I  know that every available piece of scrap iron on the Western Australian gold-fields which could be economically used was gathered up and used; but in spite of What was then done, the local supplies were inadequate. We have now, however, got back to normal pre-war conditions. There has been no unduly increased importation in recent years, and no competition with pig iron. On the contrary, the importations of pig iron have dropped from 150,000 tons to about 50,000 tons annually. That shows the  enormous increase in the business done by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, owing to the absence of competition and the protection, which has been accorded it in other directions. If the importation: of scrap" iron is prohibited, serious- injury will be done to- a fundamental industry which,, because in is capable of decentralization:,, is found in all parts of the Commonwealth., and. gives employment to many men.. The iron founders throughout Australia,, who- are already experiencing, difficulty, view this matter with alarm. They state that they could cite instances of numbers of men having already been put off,, and that there is every prospect of further reductions of their staffs being- made. I asked  at  representative of' the firm- of Mephan Ferguson, of Footscray, to-  give  me a specific instance. Me- said that in his own- foundry fifteen men- had  already  been put off, and! that more  would  follow them' later  because  of insufficient supplies oi raw material. Hie added that the cost of smelting pig iron, twice had prevented his fern, from obtaining orders which it might otherwise have received!.. The absence of scrap iron is seriously  handicapping  this industry and causing-  unemployment.  Conditions during the coming winter will be- serious enough, without increasing the number of the unemployed. Imported  scrap  iron can be obtained in Western  Australia  for £6 5s.. a ten. whereas pig iron from the Broken Hill Proprietary Company cannot be landed there under £10 5s a ton. </para>

                            <para>- Let us suppose that the mixture contains equal' quantities of pig iron and scrap iron. In that case trie cost of the raw material would be £8' 5s. a ton. If, however,, the people of Western Australia are forced to use pig. iron  only,  the- cost will Be £10' 5s. per ton-, in addition to the expenses incurred in connexion with the second smelting of the material. Should the proportion of the scrap iron in the admixture be reduced, the position becomes worse. The iron founders are in a very grave position, and their position will soon be reflected on that of other sections of the community. The Tariff Board's recommendation was based on inaccurate and misleading information in that it took into consideration only the changes in- the importations- since the war and disregarded, the pre-war figures. The embargo on the export of metals from England during the war period was entirely responsible for- this Australian industry being so seriously handicapped awing to. the shortage of scrap iron. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know the reason. It may be that it pays those in the eastern States better to. ship their scrap iron to. the East than to send it to Western Australia. There- may be some-. local handling of scrap iron ia the: manner indicated by the honorable  member,  but that does- not- necessarily represent the movement in Australia- as a whole.. I am credibly informed that at the present time sufficient quantities of scrap iron cannot be obtained in Australia. I repeat that this is not a- centralized industry; it is- established in- every State. It should, therefore, be possible to draw upon local' supplies- in each State. If Australian founders- could get their' requirements in Australia would- they import them from abroad ? Let me now refer to another aspect of this question. The greatest demand- for. this material ls probably in. connexion with the manufacture of cast-iron pipes. </para>

                            <para>- I did not say that it was not. But more of it is used in? the manufacture of cast-iron pipes than in. any other individual instance. The additional cost of these pipes resulting from these higher duties will fail upon municipalities, trusts, and other public bodies which are supplying public utilities. The additional cost will, therefore, have to be met by increased taxation. I believe that common sense will prevail in connexion with this item, that honorable members will realize the force of the arguments that have been put forward. I hope that no undue obstacle will be placed in the way of reducing these duties. </para>

                        <para>.- I point out to the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann)</inline> that the reason that those engaged in the iron and steel trade as ironfounders  are able to obtain imported scrap iron is that quantities of this material arrive here as ship's ballast. Many of the railway companies of Great Britain practically give away their discarded railway chairs to the shipping companies to be used for ballast purposes. On arrival of the vessels in Australia, the material is unloaded. Manufacturers here naturally desire to obtain it, as the shipping companies are prepared to sell it at a low price, thus seriously menacing our own Australian iron industry and trade. Consignments of. scrap have been sent from Australia to Japan; some of it, I regret to say, from Government railway workshops. </para>

                            <para>- It is not a good policy to export material which could be used in Australia, and for our own manufacturers to use material which has been brought here as ballast. That source of supply may be cut off at any time,  and we should, therefore, conserve our own supplies, and learn to be self-reliant. I favour using in Australia all the material that can be made available for, and by, Australian industries. </para>

                        <para>. -I challenge the statement made ' by the manufacturers. My factory life extended over a period of seventeen years, and although ' casting was not my job - I was a  japanner  - for the sake of physical exercise I' spent many hours breaking up pig iron for the cupola, and I saw many castings in the chill and in the sand. At no time do I remember seeing a great quantity of scrap iron mixed with pig iron for use in the cupola, though a good deal of it was used for small castings, notably bedsteads. As the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster)</inline> knows, the firm which employed me did a great deal of stove casting, and were practically the only people who did bedstead casting. Usually pig and scrap iron are used on a fifty-fifty basis to secure the required tensility for water piping. This mixture gives a quicker, and therefore a better, result from the stand-point of cost. We used to start the cupola early in the morning, but would not be able to cast until about 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock. If pig iron is broken into small lumps naturally it melts more quickly, and the cost of the operation is reduced. This, I think, is one of the reasons why scrap iron is used with pig iron. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly the honorable member for Swan is right, but I doubt if the use of scrap iron is imperative. I am inclined to think that it is used  becauses  it produces a quicker flow of metal. Every one who has had any experience of casting knows that a mixture of metal that has been already smelted with pig iron will induce a more rapid flow than if pig iron has to be fired down by itself. </para>

                            <para>- I do not question the technical knowledge of the honorable member for Perth, but I think that scrap iron is used because it is the cheapest mixture. It is gathered generally by bottle-gatherers or marine-store dealers, who have to accept the price ruling at the various foundries. As stated by the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin),</inline> a certain quantity has been exported to Japan from South Australia. That subject was ventilated in the South Australian Parliament. The Premier, when asked if the successful tenderer was sending the scrap iron from the Islington workshops to Japan, replied that he had no knowledge of the transaction. Apparently the contractor, like the average business man, was not concerned whether the interests of Australia were affected. Japan paid the highest price, so he sent the scrap iron to that country. As the honorable member, for Hindmarsh stated, scrap iron is brought to Australia as ballast. It pays ship-owners to ballast with that class of material instead of sand or stone, because it is a marketable commodity, and revenue from its sale is offset against the cost of the voyage to Australia in search of cargo. The figures relating to the position indicate clearly that we should take definite action. For the three years prior to the war, the importations were approximately 22,000 tons a year. The honorable member for Perth has stated that we are now getting back to normal. Our importations in 1921-2 totalled 18,942 tons; in 1922-3, 24,282 tons; and 1923-4, 17,461 tons. These figures amply justify the recommendation of the Tariff Board. Ironmoulders  naturally have to advance a reason to justify their opposition to the duty; but, unless I have a definite assurance from a practical  ironmoulder,  I shall refuse to believe that castings from pig iron, and without the admixture of scrap iron, are too brittle. Though I was not an  ironmoulder,  when employed in an Adelaide factory I could do, and did, a little bit of everything. I was familiar with the ramifications of the entire establishment. I cannot accept the statement circulated to honorable members unless a qualified person will prove that the admixture of scrap iron is necessary in order to use the pig iron produced in this country. The figures show that unless prompt action is taken the local industry will be ruined by the ballast that is brought from countries where scrap iron is plentiful. One honorable member has suggested that scrap iron collected from the fields of war is being sent all over the world. I  do not know whether that is right. Our object is to protect and develop Australian industries. I said, in the case of whisky, that as we had the raw materials and the workmen in this country, it did  not require any further evidence to induce me to vote for the duty, and my attitude is the same on this item. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> appears to argue on the same lines as the Tariff Board. He has an opinion, and is going to stick to it unless he hears from practical men who understand the business; but he is not prepared to listen to what practical men may say. The statement that has been put before the committee is clear, moderate, and reasonable, and it is made by practical men in the industry. They have been obliged to state their case to this committee because the Tariff Board had not their evidence before it. It has already been explained that these persons, for some reason, did not know of the meeting of the Tariff Board. If it was advertised, they did not see the advertisement. The consequence is that the recommendation of the Tariff Board was made after hearing only one side of the case. Honorable members are. surely not satisfied that that was just. It was all very well for the honorable member for Adelaide to pour out an unceasing niagara of words, and to refuse to listen to a demand that he should elucidate certain points. He spoke of imports and exports, and apparently argued that, while selling scrap iron to Japan at a reasonable price, we were importing it from Europe. What harm is there in that? If we can bring scrap iron from other countries for less than we can sell it for to Japan, is it not to our advantage to do so? Should we not be fools, and worse than fools, not to do it ? Is it not to the economic advantage of this country to do it? Yet the honorable member contends that we should not import scrap iron because we are exporting it. The whole question depends upon where we export it to, where we import it from, and what prices we pay and obtain for it. In this trade the demand for scrap iron is well known, and the price has risen far above what it was in pre-war days. The price increased from £3 to £14 a ton during the war. The Australian requirements being known, is it likely that men would send scrap iron out of the country fora price lower than they could obtain here, or for any but a greater price? The honorable member for Adelaide has taken an utterly absurd and one-sided view. He seems to think that scrap iron is used to facilitate melting in the cupola. That is not so. It is used to produce the correct and proper quality of metal in the final casting. He spoke of adding aluminium to pig iron for making water pipes. The idea is absurd. When engineers and responsible men who are carrying out public works specify the mixing of scrap iron with pig iron, they are acting in accordance with the best experience, and with a knowledge of the subject which, I venture to say, is even greater than that of the honorable member for Adelaide. </para>

It is well known to the most uninformed person that the making of pig iron is one of the most elementary and primary processes in the manufacture of iron. It is just the extraction of the iron from the ore. The names of the manufacturers who have protested against this duty are household words all over Australia. They are - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is a definite statement regarding the technical requirements of the trade. While I accept the opinion of the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> on many things connected with iron work, I maintain that about the foundry business these men have made a statement that cannot be challenged. We have to determine whether it is better to manufacture pig iron, which the savages of Central Africa did hundreds of years ago by most primitive means, or to save industries which manufacture pipes and similar things for local use. It would seem that one of the two must be sacrificed. The Governments of Western Australia and some of the other States, have got into hot water for buying from abroad pipes that could be manufactured in Australia, But why were they not manufactured in Australia? It was because of the high cost of obtaining the raw materials. Monteath's, at Subiaco, and MephanFerguson's, at Maylands, both suburbs of Perth, have had to shut down from time to time because they were unable to meet competition from abroad. They stated that their difficulty was that they could not obtain cheap raw material. Their position, however, was better then than it will be under this tariff. Certain representations have been made to the Minister by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. I admit that that company, in establishing the iron industry at Newcastle, with its many ramifications, has done something that Australians must be proud of. But we have to balance the value of manufacturing a few hundred tons of pig iron against the value of manufacturing pipes and similar articles. If this duty is collected, the pipe-making industry will be extinguished. Even from the point of view of the Minister for Trade and Customs, a duty that destroys an industry is economically unsound. One honorable  member said, with a wave of the hind that the figures quoted to the Tariff Board satisfied aim that the industry needed protection. He quoted the figures submitted to the Tariff Board by the Broken Hill Company. On page 2 of the- circular sent to honorable  members  it is stated that in the year 1918-1919 only £1,464 worth of .scrap iron was imported, and that in 1323-1924 £82,000 worth was imported. That statement, on the face of it, must .have impressed the Tariff Board. I regret that the board has been so busy that it has not been able to go further into this matter. The circular also states - </para>

                    <para class="block">The figures -quoted before the  Tariff  Board applied to the period when it was impossible to obtain scrap iron from Great Britain. The importations increased as scrap iron, which was  no  longer necessary for war purposes, was released in that </para>
                    <para class="block">Country. The figures were calculated to make the Tariff Board believe, and the Tariff Board's report was issued to make honorable members believe, that we were importing an enormous  amount  of scrap iron in increasing quantities, and that it was therefore necessary to impose the duty. The increased amount imported in 1'923-1924, as compared with that imported in 190G, was negligible. In those circumstances there is no necessity that a "very prosperous company should be "benefited by placing an impost on other industries of greater importance than the manufacture of pig iron. </para>

                            <para>- That  is so, and- that is why I ask the thoroughgoing protectionists in this committee., who are anxious to establish highly specialised  industries,  tatter t&amp;an those that employ primitive methods, to take the figures to heart. The people who supplied this document did <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> with a <inline font-style="italic">-view to</inline> pitting the position as they find it. We know from oar own experience that their  industry  has been a struggling one. Imports, from Germany particularly, before the -war swept the local manufacturer off his feet, yet to-day the Government proposes to  place  the industry in a still worse position, and protectionists in this chamber are prepared to assist the Minister for Trade and Customs to do that, on faked evidence. A duty on strap iron will affect another very important industry, and that is the copper mining industry.  On  this subject I have received a letter from the manager of the Pilbarra Copper Fields Limited, a company which is carrying on its -operations at Whim Creek, away in the north-west of Australia. In ordinary circumstances the difficulties of making copper mining pay in such a remote district, far removed from the seaboard and other portions of Australia, where wages and stores are necessarily high, and where it is difficult to obtain supplies because of -costly transport, are bad enough, without the imposition of a -duty on the raw material that is essential for the extraction of copper. This item is a two-edged sword. It will -seriously affect certain industries we are trying to establish in a small way in Western Australia, and it will destroy this copper mining industry in the north west of that State. The letter to which I have referred, dated the 18th December, 1925.' I sent on to the Minister for Trade and Customs, and received the departmental reply, Communication forwarded with your letter is returned Herewith. The representations made in  connexion <inline font-style="italic">with</inline> the matte- will receive due consideration/' The due consideration they nave received is the tariff  before  us this afternoon. </para>

                        <para>It is, however, probable that it will try to find its salvation through a certain form of heap-leaching that I have evolved here. An essential - indeed, the biggest - factor in the treatment is iron. The copper is precipitated on iron, and it consumes about li tons of iron to precipitate 1 ton of copper. The cost of iron, therefore, becomes a leading consideration, and on it will perhaps depend whether we can achieve our end or not. </para>
                        <para>The iron may be used in three forms - (1) Scrap. If we wanted only a small quantity, our best would be tin scrap - from canning works, old tins of all sorts, &amp;c. We used this in 1920, when we used under a ton a day. It does not seem that we can possibly secure enough of this without going too far afield, i.e., without it being too dear. Heavier scrap is too dear as to transport; its shape is against it, i.e., making bad handling and big measurements (freight). (2) Sponge iron. This would be made wherever offered the lowest cost as delivered on the mine. But the position <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> making it is not perfect. </para>

                        <para>Where cheap' fuel and ironstone occur close together it will be all right. On this mine the cost may be too high; and the making is a specialty. (3) Pig iron. We may therefore be forced back on this. It is commonly used - Rio Tinto, some United States of America mines, &amp;c. But it would be impracticable to use Australian (Newcastle) pig. The cost would be far too high. It could be imported at a cost that would probably be workable if duty were exempted. It is about 70s. to 80s. a ton in Britain now, and probably very low freight could be obtained for it. Even then the cost here would be high, but not so high as to prohibit the business. </para>

There would be no possibility of it being put to any other use than that described, there being no other use for it for a radius of hundreds of miles..... Could you advise me provisionally as to whether, in such circumstances, we would be able to secure exemption from duty.

                    <para class="block">I quote that letter to show that whilst a duty is being imposed on scrap iron, Australian industries dependent upon its use are likely to go to the wall unless they are given a fair deal. In the circumstances I trust that the Minister will defer the item. Sufficient evidence has been brought forward this afternoon to show that there is no danger of increasing the importations. I- trust that the Minister will listen to the representations made to him. </para>

                        <para>, - I do not profess to know anything at all about pig iron, but I remind honorable members who have opposed this duty that during the war the industries for which they have spoken were deprived of scrap iron; and, .notwithstanding that, they carried on their business as moulders and supplied all the wants of the Commonwealth. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins,</inline> who has a large foundry, in which he employs a great many moulders and turns out a great quantity of work, uses pig iron. That castings can be manufactured direct from pig iron has been demonstrated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins,</inline> who has one of the biggest foundries in New South Wales, from which he turns out hundreds of thousands of tons of castings. If an honorable member were an employer, and had put money into the Broken Hill company, as numbers of the general public have done, he would not expect the Government to allow scrap iron to be imported duty free to compete against the article manufactured by the company in which he was interested. It would not be fair to the people who put their money into this business to allow scrap iron to be imported duty free to compete with the manufacture of pig iron. The industries referred to by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> and others were carried on without scrap iron during the war period, a time when there was a greater demand on the resources of this country. </para>

                            <para>- Public works were carried on during the war period. No company treated Australia better than did the Broken Hill Company during that period. It stand in the breach, supplied all the Commonwealth requirements, and assisted the. Empire by sending steel rails to the Old Country. Now we are asked to do away with the duty on scrap iron and allow ships from all parts of the world to bring scrap iron as ballast to Australia, where it will be used in competition against the products of the great industries that have been established here. I congratulate the Government and the Minister for Trade and Customs upon the appearance of this item in the schedule. </para>

                        <para>.- As this item concerns very closely the basis of the iron and steel industries, I also am in agreement with the Government in its endeavour to place those industries on a solid footing, by allowing them to provide our own raw materials. We have, throughout Australia, great deposits of iron ore as good as any to be found elsewhere. We have deposits of several kinds of iron ore, which, when brought together, produce iron and steel 'of the necessary texture required for castings. I cannot understand representatives of Western Australia decrying one of the greatest iron deposits we have, up at Yampie Sound. There are two deposits there, one owned by the Queensland Government, and the other by a Western Australian company, which, for many years, has been endeavouring to secure the capital to exploit it. For Western Australian representatives to tolerate the free importation of scrap iron, which would prevent the starting, let alone the nourishing, of that great industry, is something I cannot understand. If scrap iron is imported free, there will be no development at Yampie Sound. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and it displaces, also, the labour involved  in the production of the Australian material. If we desire to put the iron and steel industries of this country on a sound basis, we - must start from the bottom and not from half-way up. We must develop the base of those industries, which is iron. We have the iron ore, and the necessary machinery for its manufacture into iron. All that we need is protection to enable our iron and steel industries to be soundly established. The# iron and steel industries are the basis of a nation's industrial development, and no nation which has not advanced them to a very high standard can become truly great. They are also essential to national defence, and for our self-preservation we are compelled to foster them. </para>

                        <para>.- Although an ardent protectionist, I confess that the representatives of Western Australia, particularly the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green),</inline> have made out a case which calls for an answer from the Minister. I would like him to explain to what extent the production of pig iron to replace the scrap iron now used will promote the development of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. Of course, I realize that the arguments advanced by the Western Australian representatives in opposition to this duty will be equally applicable to any other protective duty in the schedule. I sympathize with the State on account of its economic disadvantages, which this Parliament has recognized by the payment of a subsidy. However, on this item I have an open mind. The iron and steel industries are of fundamental importance to the defence of Australia, and my vote will be determined by the information given by the Minister as to whether the production of pig iron, to take the place of imported scrap iron, will increase employment, or have an important bearing in other respects upon the development of the iron and steel industries. I am informed that every tariff in the world imposes a protective duty on scrap iron. </para>

                        <para>. - I am astonished that members of the Labour party' should desert their protectionist principles by supporting the importation of iron, of which this country has such enormous resources. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> said that some little company in Western Australia will not be able to produce copper if it is not allowed to use imported scrap iron. After it has passed through the batteries, copper ore is treated with iron and sulphuric acid in tanks, in the same way as gold in tailings is precipitated in cyanide vats.. It is not necessary to use pig iron or scrap iron for that purpose; there are enough old tins in this country to precipitate hundreds of thousands of tons of copper. I shall never vote for the free admission of any article that can be produced in Australia. No vote of mine will be cast to rob Australian workers of their livelihood. To the limit of our capacity we should manufacture everything we require, and protect ourselves against the cheap products of Japan and other countries. </para>

                        <para>.. - I am surprised that there should be- any opposition to this item, which merely places imported scrap iron, which comes into competition with pig iron, on exactly the same footing as imported pig. iron. I. am also puzzled- by the periodical outbursts of antagonism to the magnificent icon and. steel industry at Newcastle. Honorablemembers, weald' do weft to recollect that 1G,0QQ men are employed in the works at Newcastle, and statisticians tell us that every man. employed, on full wages supports three or four other persons.. As a naturalized Australian.,. I am proud of the efficiency of those works, and optimistic regarding the farther development of a most important basie industry. It converts raw material from the soil into finished products, and but for its operations, the Australian community would be heavily penalized in regard to the prices, of iron and steel. When the 1921 tariff was before the House the iron masters, complained grievously of unfair competition through* the importation of scrap iron, and' I believe- they were promised that this material would be placed  ant  exactly the same footing as pig iron. The promise was not honoured. Thecommittee now has an opportunity to honour it by imposing a duty that is reasonable and consistent with the policy of protection. The representations made by the users of scrap iron are not altogether ethical, or above suspicion'. The manufacturers are protected in respect of the goods they produce, and I have no sympathy with any man who, while enjoying reasonable protection for his own products, objects to the producers of the raw materia! he uses getting similar assistance. The Tariff Board's report upon scrap iron shows that in 1923 Australia imported 10,279 tons of cast iron chairs and 14,003 tons of cast iron scrap, or a total of 24,282 tons. In 1924 the total importations of the same material were 17,461 tons, and, for the nine months ended 31St March, 1925,. 17,243 tons, an average during the last three fears of over 20,000 tons per annum. </para>

                            <para>- At that time the Newcastle works, were not producing pig iron. If manufacturers must- have a certain amount of scrap iron for their industries, they can get plenty of it in A.us- tralia. The United States of America, Canada, and Prance impose tVw same duty on. scrap iron as on pig iron, because obviously those commodities come into competition with each other. The honorable member for' Kalgoorlie said that scrap iron was required in the precipitation of copper. The process to which he refers needs, no- iron chairs and cast iron scrap, but sheet iron. Will the honorable member inform the committee how much copper is produced annually by the company to which he referred? </para>

                            <para>- No. These firms have gone to considerable trouble to make special representations to the Minister, and have pointed out how the imposition of these duties will affect tha industry in which they are engaged. They state, that it needs scrap iron and pig; iron in order to carry out their foundry work. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited can supply a casting material by making a double smelted pig iron at a higher cost, but if additional expense is to be incurred in the manufacture of articles in which iron is extensively used, the industries will be injured and numerous artisans, will be thrown out or employment. Here is a big company making millions in profits.. </para>

                            <para>- How much money has been put into its works out of profits ? The Minister should consider the small amount of capital put into the company when it was originally established. We know that it borrowed large sums on debentures which it is gradually paying off. I have not the latest balance-sheet before me, but there is not the slightest doubt that its assets, which are of enormous value, have been provided largely out of profits. In time the Broken Hill Proprietary Company's works will be the largest in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Machines used  in  the Newcastle mines are not obtained from German manufacturers, and the only explosives employed in the coalmining industry are those which appear  on  the British: list of explosives permitted  in  coalmining. The firm of Hoskins and Company desire this slight protection, as the Minister pointed out, in order to place scrap iron on the same basis as pig iron. We have heard a good deal to-day how manufacturers are being hampered by having, to use pig. iron in making certain articles, but the proposed duty will not interfere with their operations in the slightest degree. Many of the firms which the  honorable  member for Swan has mentioned are brassfounders, and not cast-iron pipe makers. Hoskins and Company, of Sydney, manufacture pipe from Australian scrap iron mixed with their own pig iron the proportion of scrap to pig iron being varied according to the article being produced. Our Western Australian friends, who are doing all in their power to destroy this important industry in New South Wales, have not been fair enough to inform the committee that the manufacture of wire  and  farming implements is shortly to be undertaken in the western State. I trust this is the last we shall hear from those honorable members in the corner who wish to damage every Australian industry. </para>

                        <para>.- Can the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> give any reason for this extraordinary increase in duty on pipe fittings?The increased duties on fittings imposed under the 1921 tariff, which enormously increased the cost of pipes manufactured in Australia, were thought to be ample. Under this item it is proposed to increase the duty on fittings not more than 2 inches in diameter by7½ per cent. The increases made in 1921, assuming the importations to have been the same as in 1923, represented an extra expense of £780,000 a year. That is a most extraordinary increase, and I think the Minister should give some reason for its adoption before asking the committe to agree to it. </para>

                        <para>.- The degree of protection set out in the schedule was recommended by the Tariff Board. Under the old tariff, there was no differentiation between beams, channels, joists. girders, columns, &amp;c, not drilled or further manufactured, and those that were drilled and further manufactured; consequently quite a lot of them were coming in drilled with holes, planed, levelled, and fabricated generally. It has been decided, therefore, that on these there shall be, in addition to the ordinary duty, an ad valorem of 25 per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent. The object of this is to ensure that the work necessary on these items shall be done in Australia. So far as I know, no application has been made to the Tariff Board for an increase in the duty on the raw material from which they are manufactured. </para>

                        <para>. -  I should imagine that the first reason for their non-manufacture in Australia is that tin plates are not made here. The Danes and Swedes have specialized in making separators. Although there is a preference of 10 per cent. in favour of British separators, Great Britain does not do 10 per cent. of Australia's £250,000 worth of business annually in the line. The policy of the Government in these matters is not to put a duty on articles which are not manufactured here, and where there seems to be no prospect of manufacturing; so that the people may get their requirements at the most reasonable price possible. </para>

As it is drafted it will permit the free entry of certain parts of the overhead gear of sheep-shearing machines that are manufactured in Australia, namely, the tubing which conveys the power from the drive wheel to the hand-pieces. We do not manufacture hand-pieces here, but we have made other parts of sheep-shearing machines for the last twenty years. Under this tariff overhead gear and grinders will be subject to a duty of 10 per cent. under the general tariff, and 5 per cent. under the intermediate tariff, but no mention whatever is made of the tubing required to transmit the power to the hand pieces. Not one, but several sheep shearing companies began to, manufacture, during the war, the whole of their overhead gear, tubing and grinders; but they will be unable to continue to make it without protection. Can the Minister say whether a provision to protect power transmission gear was inadvertently omitted from the schedule? </para>

We have been told that Australians can make any class of machinery, yet thousands of machines for use in the coal mines of this country are to be admitted free.

Most of the coal-mining companies in Australia are wealthy concerns. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Brown, of Newcastle, is a millionaire.

The value of the coal-cutting machines imported into Australia in the last year of importation was £15,209. That is approximately the average value of the importations for the four or five years previously. Of that amount, machines imported from Great Britain represented only £222. In accordance with the policy of the Government that, where -a duty is unnecessary, and revenue acquirements permit, no duty should be imposed, .a -free schedule has been adopted in this instance. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot understand why this item has been made Tree. The Minister has said that as these machines are not made here they are to be admitted free in accordance with the usual policy of the Government, irrespective of the country  of  origin. That that is not the policy of the Government honorable members will see in connexion with item 174  -  machines, machine tools, and appliances. Under that -item the Minister has power to permit goods not made in Australia .to come in free if manufactured in Great Britain, and subject to a duty of 10 per cent, if made in foreign countries. The coal-miners are probably the best-paid workers in Australia, and it is well known that the mine-owners make substantial profits every year, and are .among .the wealthiest section of the community. Yet the Minister is prepared to allow thousands -of machines required in the coalmining industry to enter free of -duty, whereas other mining machinery is subject to heavy -duties. Previously, the duty was intermediate 5 per cent., and general 10 per  Bent.  Owing to the high -cost of machinery, coupled with high wages, the gold-mining industry is declining. The copper industry, also, is waning for the same reasons. The Mount Morgan mine has been closed. Although it is known that there are big copper deposits in Queensland, Western Australia., and the Northern Territory, any machinery required to develop those deposits is subject to a duty of 55 per cent, should it come from foreign countries. Yet coal-cutting machines, no matter where they are made, are to come in free. </para>

                    <para class="block">Representations have been made to the Government in connexion with this item, but a decision has not yet been arrived at. We all want it to be clearly defined and as generous as possible. At present, great difficulty is experienced in administering this item. I -assure the committee that the purpose of the postponement is to improve, if possible, the verbiage, and to make the position perfectly clear. </para>
                    <para>Mr.GREGORY (Swan) [3.13].- When this item was first introduced four years ago, I strongly opposed it on the ground that Parliament alone had the right to increase or to reduce taxation.I realize that in administering it the Minister roust sometimes find himself in a difficult situation. Requests come from all parts of Australia for certain machinery to be admitted free if made in Great Britain, and that for foreign machinery the duty should be not more than 10per cent. Can the Minister inform us whether, in. the light of his experience, he approves of the item? The first tariff provided that the Minister had to report to Parliament, giving a list of the machines which had been imported, and which, if not on the free list, should, in his opinion, have been admitted free. If Parliament endorsed his recommendation, a refund of duty was made to those who had paid it. In view of the administrative difficulties, it is doubtful whether this item should be included in the tariff. Only the Minister can say whether the old system or the one that has been in operation during more recent years is the better one. I appreciate his difficulties in dealing with these matters. Some extraordinary decisions have been given. On one occasion a Minister ruled that tram rails were appliances of a machine, and allowed them in duty free. </para>

                        <para>.- I hope that when the Minister brings -the item before the committee again he will be in a position to give honorable members information as to its administration. Certain statements brought under my notice by a section of electrical manufacturers suggest that, in the past, very many remissions in duty have been allowed under this item, particularly in respect of the heavier types of machines. I have no wish to discuss the item at this stage. I merely wish to direct the attention of the Minister to the allegations that have been made. I have faith in the integrity of the Minister, and believe he will give effect to the protectionist policy of the Government. I hope he will be in a position to remove doubts in the minds of certain manufacturers who are interested in theschedule. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister, when redrafting this  item, should give special attention to the difficulties experienced under it in the 1921 schedule. I think I am right in saying that when an item such as this, dealing with machines, machine tools, and appliances, is passed, honorable members have not a very clear understanding of its technical difficulties. We all have a gemeralconception of machines and machinery. I suppose that the average person will include many varieties of electrical machinery in his definition of an electrical machine. In one case an electric transformer was dutiable, whilst an electric alternator was allowed in duty free. The ordinary man in the street would include both in his definition of an electrical machine, and would be puzzled if any distinction were made between them. The Customs authorities informed me that they had consulted the Crown Law Department, which, no doubt, referred the matter to a technologist in order to get a technical definition of a machine. To be perfectly safe, they say that a machine must have moving parts. An electric transformer has moving parts, whilst an alternator is stationary, but, like a transformer, it transfers electrical energy, and is essentially a machine. </para>

                            <para>- No; the rulings given, as the result of consultation with the Crown Law Department, have entirely altered the interpretation. An alternator is not regarded as a machine, and, therefore, it is not dutiable, whereas a transformer, being classed as a machine, has to pay a high duty. This fine distinction, although it may be technically correct, savours a little of pedantry. It is desirable that we should aim at uniformity. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that the Minister is in agreement with me. I understand that the question which I have raised will be dealt with when the new item is again before the committee. I suggest, therefore, that the position should be more clearly defined, and that the Minister should take a broader view. It is unfair that the department should be bound down by a legal decision. I admit that the position of the Minister is somewhat difficult. Necessarily he has to refer to some authority; but, in thiscase,as I have shown, the scientific definition of the machine is something which Parliament did not take into consideration at the time. </para>

                        <para>.- A few weeks ago I addressed an inquiry to the Minister, at the request of Messrs  G.  Gramp and Sons, of Rowlands Flat, South Australia, with reference to a remission in the duty on a machine known as Coffey's still. I now remind the Minister of the request, in the hope that he will give it further consideration before the item is dealt with. The Minister suggested that I should bring the matter up when the Tariff was being discussed. </para>

A recent royal, commission, of which I was a member, took evidence in Queensland, and was told that the cement works there could, without any additional duty, compete with foreign manufacturers within a certain radius of Brisbane, but that to do so at distances along the coast a further duty was necessary. They appealed to the then Minister for Trade and Customs, and obtained an increase of duty. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member said that the cement manufacturers were making fortunes rapidly. ' If that is so, the Minister should take some of the existing duty off cement. The honorable member cannot have the argument both ways. Australian cement manufacturers are trying to compete with foreign cement manufacturers, but the Government is hobbling them by taxing their machinery. Honorable members seem to be concerned about roads. I agree that they are as important as railways, particularly in the large States. This Government has accepted some of the responsibility for road, making, and has advanced money to the States for that purpose. It never should have obtained that money, but it is receiving so much revenue through the Customs that it does not know what , to do with it, and members and supporters of the Government are making themselves good fellows by handing it out. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so, but it is the taxpayers' money, nevertheless. Roads must be made, and yet we tax road-making machinery. It is Gilbertian. We should regard roads as more important than road-making machinery. It is difficult for some of the roads boards to obtain machines, and they do not want to hand large sums of money to the Treasurer for the privilege of importing them. I feelingly support the amendment. I should be willing to vote for the complete removal of the duty. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not understand why the duty has been raised on these items. It is not often that I find myself in agreement with the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> and that circumstance is so striking that it ought to convince the Minister that he is in the wrong. Certainly this country wants good roads, more, almost, than it wants anything else. It seems to me that  27£  per cent, is a reasonable protection in the circumstances. I have recently travelled over Australian roads that are simply indescribably bad. No words that I can use would express my feelings about them: and if I have to couple with the names of the responsible shire councillors the name of the Minister, my mouth will be very full. The duty on cement-making machines, road-making machines, and stone-crushing machines should remain as it was.' </para>

                        <para>.- I support the amendment on the ground that increasing the duties will hamper development in Australia. Some time ago I approached the Government to try to obtain a remission of duty on a cement-making plant that was being purchased by a firm starting operations in Tasmania. That company invested a large amount of money and tried to purchase the machinery in Australia. It then went to America, where it obtained quotations, but the Americans would not give a gjiaoranteer that the machines -would stand up to the work.. </para>

                        <para>.- One of the difficulties- about this item is that it refers, to&gt; many aa?ti©les which have no relation to one another. I do not know whether the Crown Law. Department has given the Minister a definition of" Aerial ropeways exclusive of cable." That is a curious thing, and -why it should, be in  the same category as road-making machinery is hard to understand. The duty should not be increased on cement-making,, road-making, and stone-crushing machines, for the very good reason -that no grounds ha.ve been given, by the Minister for the increase. Is a large number of these machines being imported ?. Is any Australian industry being injured? I understand that the facts are quite the reverse. In Queensland, Australian-made machines have been in use for years-; in fact, the cement-maifcers there never user anything- else. Speaking generally, I. should: say that road-making machines, such as road rollers, could not profitably be imported, in view of the heavy freight and duty.' . 1 cannot understand why the- duty should have been raised unless- it was that the Minister saw air item that had not been, raised, and raised it. Nothing is of more importance to. this country than the improvement of transportation. "We are trying to improve it, but under this item we put an. obstacle to. the way of the- first step; towards: making good roads.

After providing money for road construction, it seems strange that the Government shtjiitld place- this, obstacle in- the- way of the making o£ roads: Anything we can do to cheapen cement should be done-,, as. it will have a very desirable effect in cheapening the cost of houses. </para>

They should begin at the bottom and rise proportionately.

                        - That may have something to do with it. I had an opportunity of examining the cement-making industry in Queensland, to which, the honorable member referred. It was in a bad way, hut that was due to its geographical position In Victoria we have some of the

I am confronted in the same group with another item, which it is imposing a -very great strain on me to ask me .to .support. It is asking me to go very far ito agree to the duty on road-making machines. The improvement df means of transport is of such .paramount importance to the Commonwealth that the Government has pledged its revenue for ten years to the extent of £2^,000,000 a year for the making of roads. That is a munificent contribution to an obligation of the -State Governments. At this stage I -do

                        but I am surprised that fee should discourage the making of roads by &amp;e most efficient methods. The Government, in making a grant of £2,000,000 a year for the construction of roads, merely 'gives back to the people -money which it has taken out of their pockets through the (Customs. In doing so, however., it has made a very proper condition indeed, .and that is 'Chat the roads are to be made by contract, and if that condition cannot he fulfilled the Government must be satisfied that

                            <para>- -Members of the Country party say that we need good roads in the country districts, but we cannot get them by reducing the duty on cement-making machinery. They are not going to be made of cement. The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> said that I knew nothing at all about the manufacture of cement, and that he knew all about it. I had the honour of a seat on the Arbitration Court in New South Wales, and inquired into the cement-making and other industries. Because of the information I thus obtained about the profits made in the cement-making industry, I know that it is one of the most prosperous in Australia. Therefore, I object to a reduction of duties on cement-making machinery which the wealthy companies can well afford to pay. The engineering trades are experiencing a very bad time. I do not know of any skilled artisans who are suffering more at the present time than the engineers, hundreds of whom are out of employment. At the same time a great deal of machinery that could be manufactured locally is being imported. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt that the Minister will do so. Australian engineers have patented a concrete-mixing machine which has helped substantially to reduce the cost of concrete roads and buildings. That machine is being made in Balmain, and why should not the manufacturers be protected? The Minister is doing right in encouraging the engineering trade to make all the machinery that Australia requires. The statement by the honorable member for Franklin that concrete mixers cannot be made in Australia is incorrect. I know where such machines are being made. The mechanism is simple, and the only obstacle to an increase of local production is the competition of cheap importations. I hope that the Minister will not be persuaded to compromise on this item. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to have that admission. I understood the honorable member for Franklin to say that the industry had not been established, and that cement-making machinery could not be made in Australia. As a matter of fact, it is being manufactured in my own electorate. The industry already employs a fair number of men, and given adequate protection the employment will be increased threefold. I am not surprised at the attitude of the members of the Country party because they resist every plea for Australian industry except where their own interests are at stake. They are very ready to vote for duties on Fiji bananas and black-grown sugar. The honorable member for Forrest is a very sound protectionist in respect of millet.. </para>

                        <para>.- If the Minister agrees to the proposed reduction of duties, I hope he will not separate the cement-making and road -making machines, as the honorable member for Wannon suggested. The honorable member said that" the cement industry is very successful and can well afford to pay extra duties on the machinery it re quires. If the companies are making so much money, the best thing we can do is to encourage competition. </para>

                            <para>- They are too well protected, and I would like to see the duties on cement reduced; but, if that is not done, the lowering of duties on cement-making machinery will encourage competition and so help to reduce the price to the consumer. The duty will press heavily, not oh the established factories, which will have to import machinery for replacements only, but on new concerns that have to incur a large initial outlay on plant. There is a close connexion  between  cement-making and road-making, because the most advanced practice in civil engineering is to increasingly build concrete roads. .-. are especially necessary for heavy motor traffic, not only in the cities, but also eventually in the country districts. </para>

                            <para>- 'Concrete roads are being built throughout America and eventually they will extend into Australian country districts. There could be no better encouragement of the cement-making industry than the  Commonwealth's road policy, which will involve an expenditure of £2,000,000 per annum for ten years. This expenditure should encourage new firms to establish cement factories throughout the country, and that should lead to a reduction in the price of cement, thus bringing concrete country roads within the realms of probability. </para>

I am not so much concerned in the duties on cement-making machinery. The wealthy companies engaged in the manufacture of cement can well afford to pay higher duties on the machinery they require. Road-making machines are in an entirely different category. Good roads in Australia are absolutely essential for the welfare of the whole of the people.

Honorable members om this side o£ the,- chamber are also, in favour of good roads. The members of the Labour party have, supported the&gt; payment by the Commonwealth, of subsidies to. the States- to- assist- in. the. construction, of roads. If we are doing that protection should be afforded to those manufacturing road-making machinery. The honorable member fear Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell.)</inline> urged that nothing had been said to justify the increase. Some honorable members on the corner beaches say. that roadmaking machines are being imported-, and others assert that they are being made in Australia. It is true that we are manufacturing these-' machines, which- are quite as good as those produced in- any other part of the world. </para>

British company submitted a price of £2,500 and an Australian manufacturer quoted£2,540 It will probably be said that,, as. the tenders were praefcically the same, there is no reason for an increased duty. That is a fair, question., and one which I intend to. answer. The price in 192,5 for a road roller of British manufacture was £1,380. How is it that a British manufacturer could reduce his price from. £2,500, as. quoted in. 1921, to £1,380 in 1925 ? There has also been a big reduction in wages in Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>-  I know the- conditions in- Australia. The point at issue1 <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> that wages have deeKned <inline font-style="italic">iea-</inline> Great Britain-, whilst in Australia the same standard has been maintained. Thewages for a skilled labourer in this: industry in Great Britain are 56s. 6d.,. and in Australia 103s. 6d. a '"week, or a. difference- of about 92" per cent. in. favour of Australia. The wages, for unskilled labour in Great Britain in this industry are 40s. and in Australia 85s-.. a week,, or a difference, of 112 per cent. The price- of raw material in Great Britain ranges from £4 5s. to £5 5s. , whereas, in. Australia it is <inline font-style="italic">£7</inline> a ton or a little over, or a difference of 50 per cent. In Great Britain steel bars cost and in Australia the cost is £'14 per ton. In these circumstances the, duty should be increased'. We are endeavouring to maintain a high standard in Australia. The conditions which obtained' in Great Britain in- 1921 have- changed entirely, and instead of the proposed rate- being Mgh, as some- honorable- members suggest, it is, in&gt; my opinion, inadequate. J have given honorable- members, a few facts which are worthy of their- closest attention. It seems impossible to satisfy the honorable, member for Forrest. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse-)),</inline> whoi believes that floods, famines, and fives are due either to the operation, of the Navigation Act or the tariff.. I am sxxmewkat surprised,, however,, at the attitude of tha honorable, member for Wanno-n <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Rodgers1),,</inline> who. delivered, a. strong.- protectionist speech during the general debate on the tariff a few days ago-,, and who- flayed' the honorable member for Forest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> and has colleagues for their freetrade tendencies. He said that they were- protectionists on some items and freetraders on others. He criticized their actions most severely, but is now guilty of the acts of which he accused them. He said' he believed1 in a high duty being imposed on cement-making machinery, but he fell1 dWn- flat as a freetrader on the question: o-f road-making machinery. </para>

He is a high protectionist for cement-making machinery, but almost a freetrader for road-making machinery. </para>

                            <para>- It was not. As a matter of fact, I had intended to speak on two items of the schedule that were passed to-day; but we are dealing with the schedule so rapidly that it is difficult for an honorable member to keep pace with the business. I venture to say that no honorable member has taken a keener interest than I have in these proceedings. Why should we discuss under this item the necessity for good roads? The question before us is, whether there is a case for the imposition of this duty or not. In my judgment there is. The changed conditions of the last few years have made the previous tariff insufficient. Let us deal with this item on its merits, and leave the question of good roads for discussion on a more fitting occasion. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot support the amendment by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> I favour the item as it stands. If the Minister thinks it advisable to reduce the British preference to 30 per cent., I shall be willing to support him, but in no circumstance will I vote for a reduction of the intermediate tariff from 45 per cent., or the general tariff from 50 per cent. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> said that to get good roads he would get machinery from anywhere. I could agree with his statement if he added to it, " in Australia." I shall do everything in uiy power to prevent German machinery from entering into competition with the Australian product. In my opiuion, Germany will shortly be our most serious competitor. It has not been possible for us to get rid of millions of pounds of our national debt by a stroke of the pen or a wave of the hand, as Germany has done, and consequently we are not in anything like the favorable economic position that she occupies. I am surprised that honorable members who saw the wisdom of supporting an almost prohibitive duty on cotton tweeds are swallowing the bait of the freetrade members of this chamber, and opposing the duty on roadmaking machinery. I say quite definitely that I shall refuse to support any reduction of the general and intermediate tariff on this item, although I am prepared to support a small reduction of the British preferential tariff. </para>

                        <para>.- I see the logic of the stand taken by the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson),</inline> but there is sometimes a conflict between logic and merit. This proposed duty ranges higher than the average duty on agricultural machinery, which is regarded as adequate. There are many involved types of agricultural machines. On the merits of the case, I favour the proposed reduction. As to the question of road construction, I should like to see every penny of the Commonwealth grant of £20,000,000 for Australian roads go to Australian workmen and Australian industry. I am aware that the spending of the money will be vested chiefly in our local governing bodies, and that, in the main, they have a conscience which leads them to give a preference to local industry. Two or three cases which indicate a reverse attitude have been given a good deal of publicity in this debate, and probably rightly so, but nevertheless I believe that the bulk of this money will be spent in the interests of Australian workers and Australian industry. There is a point in regard to the duty on textiles that the honorable member for Bass should remember. The tax on that item is levied on the whole community, but the tax on road-making machinery is really an additional burden on local ratepayers, who, as land-holders, are already heavily taxed. The cost of road-making in Australia to-day is outrageously high. </para>

                        <para>.- I should not have participated again in the debate on this item but for the remarks of certain honorable members who represent city constituencies, and who are not at all careful about the terms in which they refer to honorable members who differ from them. A conflict of two ideals causes strange things to happen at times. Let me quote, as an illustration, an experience of the Western Australian Government. It had decided to purchase another ship to replace one of the fleet of the Government line. Of course, it desired to have the ship built in Australia, but it called for tenders in Australia and England. When they were opened, it was found that a ship built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard would cost nearly twice as much as a ship built in England. The Government then had to decide between two ideals - one, the development of its State shipping line; and the other, the encouragement of Australian industry. The problem was rendered the more difficult of solution by reason of the fact that the Government shipping line was losing from £70,000 to £100,000 a year. </para>

                            <para>- The Government decided that it would save its shipping line, and have the vessel built in England. After the decision was announced, a deputation from the Trades Hall waited upon the Premier to request him to alter it. When the members of the deputation stated their case, the Minister laid all his cards on the table, and asked them to say whether, on the facts, it was possible to have the ship built in Australia, and the deputation decided that it could not honorably say that it was. On the definite matter of road-making machinery, we ought to bear in mind that good roads are essential to the development of Australia. If this duty is ratified, heavier burdens will be placed upon local governing bodies which are charged with the responsibility of road-making, and it will be impossible for them to operate satisfactorily. Some of the roads boards in Western Australia are trying to co-operate in the purchase of up-to-date road-making machinery, but the imposition of this duty will render it almost impossible for them to do very much. Surely a 27^ per cent, protective duty is sufficient for the Australian manufacturers. If they put their shoulder to the wheel and work hard they should be able to compete without a duty. . As far as cement-making machines are concerned, all I desire to say is that if the Australian manufacturers could market their cement alt a- little lower price, the output would be increased tenfold. It is all very well for the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. Riley)</inline> to say that cement is cheap around Sydney. The reverse is the case at places distant from the capital cities. In the north of Queensland, for instance, where they need cement for making channels, dams, roads, and a hundred and one other things, it is too expensive for the people to think of using it. It is a heavy commodity, and the freight from the capital cities to the distant parts of the Commonwealth, makes the price of it almost prohibitive. The only way that the people who need the cement most can get it at a reasonable price is to establish sma 11 cement works in their own localities; but the imposition of this higher duty on cement-making machinery will make it more difficult for them to do even that. Are we never going to give any consideration to the requirements of our outposts ? It is less costly to ship cement from England than from Sydney to the north Queensland ports. I trust that the amendment of the honorable member for Swan will be carried. </para>

                        <para>. - I had intended to reserve my remarks on the general question . of machinery until the next item was before us. I have listened carefully to the arguments that have been advanced during the last hour for and against, this duty, but before embarking upon my m contribution to the debate, I wish to remind honorable members that they still have a good deal of work to do in order to complete their consideration of this schedule. Perhaps the few observations I have now to offer may .clarify the position. I am prepared to meet the committee to some extent in .this matter, but I first want to say most seriously that in no circumstances, unless by <inline font-style="italic">force</inline><inline font-style="italic">majeure,</inline> will the Government agree to reduce the general tariff rate on machinery. The Industries Preservation Act, -during the past two or three years, has been operating in a good many instances against German goods because of the depreciated German currency. The Prime Minister stated  About  nine months ago that the German currency was no longer depreciated. But while the .gazettals remain - and I refuse to lift them - I am afraid that we must admit that, under present circumstances, we hame no legal .power tin collect dumping duties on that section. For that reason, the Government will not agree to reduce the duties imposed upon foreign machinery. This is  . OUT  rampart against und:ne competition from countries from which competition may rapidly come. I think that all honorable members are sympathetic towards the Mother Country, and  to  show that the gesture of preference which has been made still remains, in spite of all that has been said, I am prepared, on behalf of the Government, to accept an amendment reducing the British preferential rate on road-making machines n.e.i., and stone-crushing machines from 35 per cent, to 30  per  -cent. ; but I am. not willing to  reduce  the dirty on foreign goods. </para>

                        <para>.- I suppose that I shall have to be satisfied with the Minister's proposal, but, before I withdraw any amendment, I must express my disappointment with the nature of the debate. With the exception of the honorable member  for  Yarra {Mr. Scullin), one honorable  member  after another was prepared to agree to .any duty without submitting any reason for doing so. The honorable member for Yarra certainly clarified the position, and explained his reasons for supporting the duties, but other honorable  members  were prepared to stand behind the Australian manufacturers .and to impose any duty, irrespective of its virtue, or the necessity for its imposition. I should not be surprised if in the near future the Minister and many honorable members demanded something in the nature of prohibition. The 'honorable member for Yarra told us that in 1921, just after there had been asn. extraordinary increase in the duties, there were thousands  more  men employed in this industry than are employed in it to-day. The natural corollary is that if .the 'duties are further increased, no persons will be employed in the industry. That is the direction in whch we are drifting. We had a magnificent export trade in agricultural machinery before high duties on that machinery were imposed. We have now lost that trade. For the same reason we have lost the trade which we previously had in -superphosphates. The honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> cannot -see why -the duties on cement-making machines should be reduced. Does he know that the cement companies of Australia are making enormous profits? Does he desire that any new companies which may engage in this business shall be handicapped in their competition with the older companies? It is only about two years ago that these companies, which are now so wealthy that they have to hide their profits, got the Minister to impose a special dumping duty on cement landed here at less than certain freight rates. The price of cement in Australia is approximately three times the price in the United States of America. </para>

                            <para>-  There is a great demand for cement throughout Australia. If some companies are making such enormous profits it would be wise to allow other companies to enter into competition, with them. If necessary, the cement duties could also be reduced. I object to honorable members being prepared to impose additional duties when there is no justification for the increase, and when the higher duties will only mean extra profits to the manufacturers. It is heartbreaking to find honorable members willing to go to any extreme in the imposition of duties, regardless of what the people will be called upon to pay. I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- I must express my surprise at the action of the Minister in proposing this amendment. It appears that, having accepted the suggestion of certain members in the Ministerial corner, he has got what he deserves, because be had no sooner expressed his willingness to reduce the British preferential tariff than the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Gregory) immediately found fault with him. I submit that these machines are in exactly the same category as other machinery manufactured in Australia. There is no difference in principle. We are all desirous of having good roads in Australia; but we are not justified in refusing to have the machinery necessary for constructing those roads manufactured in Australia. The Minister said that he would not agree to an alteration of the duty on machines imported from foreign countries. He also pointed out that there was a possibility of some of these machines coming from Germany. I have no objection to giving preference to Great Britain; but our first duty is to our own manufacturers. If we can manufacture any article here, and by its manufacture give employment to our own people, we are not justified in giving an undue preference even to Great Britain, although we are justified in giving that country an advantage over foreign countries. Can the Minister say that these machines will not be taken from Germany to England unassembled, and, after assembly there, sent bo Australia? I have a lively recollection of what happened a few years ago when I moved a censure motion because of the Government's attitude towards the iron and steel industry. I pointed out then that iron and steel goods from Germany were sent to England, where they were put together, and afterwards shipped to Australia, the British exporter claiming that he was entitled to British preference because the machinery was 25 per cent. British manufacture.. As a result of the importation of iron and steel into Great Britain, British workmen were displaced, and many iron and steel works in the Mother Country were closed down. </para>

                            <para>- When I was in England many British iron and steel works had closed down owing to continental competition, and there was practically no demand for British coal. It was complained that much of the unemployment then prevailing was due to the importation of iron and steel from France, Belgium, and Germany. The position is no better to-day, so we should hesitate before we do anything that might give preference to iron or steel products from countries with a depreciated currency. After the complete exposition of the case for the Australian manufacturers given by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> there is no need for any honorable member to traverse the same ground. I am surprised that the Minister has backed down. This is the second time he has weakened this evening during the debate on the schedule. </para>

                            <para>- I do not mind compromise, but when I see a disposition on the part of the Minister to give way too readily, it is about time for us to protest. We stand for the encouragement of Australian industries and the employment of our own people. That the majority of honorable members are declared protectionists was clearly shown in the division last night, when 46 members voted for a certain item, and only eleven were opposed to it. There is only a small minority opposed to these duties, and I regret that the Minister has, in a moment of weakness, given way on this item. It will not affect our road-making policy one iota. Even if it did, in view of the fact that the Commonwealth is providing so much money for road-making, we have every right to see that our own people secure employment in the manufacture of machines for road-making purposes. Those honorable members who object to these duties are inconsistent. They are in favour of borrowing money to bring immigrants to this country, but will do nothing to encourage industries that will provide employment. The only way to provide employment and develop this country, and increase its population, is to foster its industries. The development of the secondary industries creates a market for the produce of the man on the land. There is no escape from that  conclusion, and I am surprised that representatives of country constituencies cannot see the force of the argument. Without a home market, the man on the land is doomed to failure. Dozens of settlers, many of them returned soldiers, are in difficulties to-day because they have not a home market. </para>

                            <para>- This tariff will not increase the cost of living to any appreciable extent. A gentleman interested in motor accessories was speaking to me this evening. He said that, prior to the recent duties being imposed, certain accessories cost over £8. A factory for the manufacture of them was started in Australia, and the Australian-made accessory was placed on the market at a price less than that of the imported article. Immediately the importers brought their price down to £4, a reduction of 100 per cent. The price of the Australian article is now within 5s. of the price of the imported article. That shows how the importers exploited the market before there was protection. The greater the output of an article, the lower is the cost of production. If there is not a market for a large output, it is usually impossible to produce at a cheap rate. That is why I believe in protection for a young country like Australia. In support of the tariff, it is only necessary to point to the progress that America has made under her tariff. </para>

There is no reason* why Australia should not establish industries, employ her people, and develop her country as fast as America has done. We ought to be able to increase our population more rapidly than we have done during recent years. I am surprised at the Minister giving way to the oppostion on this item. If he is going to give way on other items that we still have to consider, honorable members on this side will have to put up a fight. These machines can be manufactured in this country just as well as many other things with which we have been dealing. </para>

                        <para>.- Two amazing things have happened this evening. We have had the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> advocating increased duties on coal-cutting machines, and the spectacle of the "man of iron," the Minister for Trade and Customs, allowing the schedule to be amended by a reduction. It seems to me that the dreary drip of freetrade declamation that we have had from the Ministerial corner has worn away the protectionist stone. I stand behind my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> in objecting to this alteration of the schedule, and I hope that every honorable member on this side will protest against the weak action of the Minister in yielding to the representations from the corner. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is misrepresenting me. I said that there was something in the honorable member for Kalgoorlie's argument which required answering by the Minister. Later the Minister answered it to my satisfaction. I claim to have been consistent throughout this debate. I should like to know what increased cost will be incurred in the construction of roads by the slight increase proposed in the British preferential rate on this item. The arguments put forward in favour of the reduction are hair-splitting. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has pointed out that our most dangerous competitor in the engineering field is Great Britain. Any honorable member who has visited Australian engineering shops will have been informed that English competition is most to be feared. The general manager of the </para>

                    <para class="block">Broken Hill works, and the manager of any engineering works in any of the States, will confirm that statement. It is not an anti-British sentiment; it is brought about by the depreciated wages in that country. I showed the other night that while prices of certain electrical and engineering requirements had fallen by 70 per cent., wages had fallen by only 30 per cent. We have just as much to fear from dumped goods from England as from any other country. A duty of 35 per cent., in view of all the facts submitted during the second-reading debate and in committee, is hardly sufficient to meet the competition of English manufacturers of road-making machines. I strongly object to the proposed alteration of the schedule. </para>

                            <para>- I have pointed out before that the engineering industry of the Commonwealth is in a deplorable state. Thousands of men were walking about the streets hoping that the duties to be imposed on machinery would lead to their re-employment. A reduction of 5 per cent, in the duty on road-making machinery is not going to lessen the cost of making roads. I have said before that a reduction of the duty on cement-manufacturing machinery will not lead to the construction of good roads in country districts. In most country districts the roads have not yet reached such a stage of development as to make the use of steam road rollers possible. I think the Minister would do well to report progress now, and when we have slept on the matter we shall be able to-morrow to dispose of it very easily. Did the reasons given by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> convince the Minister that he was wrong when he submitted these duties in the tariff schedule <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

Honorable members on this side are not prepared to see the manufacturers of this country brow-beaten by members of the Country party, who do not believe in the establishment of secondary industries. What they want is a high price for maize, a good market for wheat, a duty of £4 per ton for potatoes, cheap freights, cheap labour, and good roads. If they get these things they have no care for any one else. The division which took place on the duties on cotton goods showed that this committee is protectionist to the backbone. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no doubt that before agreeing to submit the amendment suggested to him, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> thoroughly considered the matter. I am absolutely confident that he has the interests of the country at heart. He would not have moved the amendment if he did not think that the industry is sufficiently protected. I do not think that the schedule as printed cannot be improved. I was one who yesterday asked the Minister to withdraw a certain item in order that the proposed duty might be increased, and I should do the same to-night if I thought that should be done. I am essentially interested in primary production in this country. As a primary producer, I consider that a protectionist tariff is in the interests of primary producers. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, the best market we can get for our primary products is our home market. I want to see that market increased as much as possible. Last year a friend of mine was starting a new industry, and told me that he had brought out sixteen British expert operatives, with their families to work in it. He said to me, "Do you not think I have done more for the country in bringing these men out to work in a secondary industry than I should have done if I had brought them out to start growing fruits for drying for a market that is over-supplied?" I had to admit that I thought he had done right. It is only a little over twelve months since I was in Western Australia, and a royal commission was taking evidence on the disabilities of that State as a partner in the federation. Either honorable members from that State, who are taking such a prominent part in this debate, and not representing the views of the people of that State, or a most remarkable change in public opinion has occurred there. I was in. Western Australia when the royal commission was taking evidence in regard to the disabilities of that State under federation, and the fact impressed upon me by witnessess and conversations with citizens was the handicap imposed upon Western Australia by the removal of the interstate tariff barriers that existed prior to federation. They pointed out that their young secondary industries were not able to compete against the larger and better-established industries in the eastern States, which had a bigger local market and could produce on a large scale. </para>

The. duties on this item will help to keep going an important secondary industry, and, if they are reduced at the instance of Western Australian members, the secondary industries in the eastern States will suffer as those in the west through the loss of tariff protection. By supporting the secondary industries we are acting in the best interests of our country. In my own electorate there is an iron foundry employing  3,000  men. </para>

                            <para>- My personal political interests would be better served if that industry were in the honorable member's electorate, but I am voting for a policy that I consider beneficial to Australia. A ' few miles from the iron foundry is a cement factory employing  900  men, and nearby is a town of  5,000  people- who are entirely dependent upon  that factory. Any one who has seen that town, entirely supported, as it is, by this one factory, and does not realize the value of the market, thus provided for our primary products is lacking in judgment. I feel sure that the Minister agreed to the amendment with his eyes open, and I, as a primary producer, will support him in giving such protection as he thinks necessary to enable the secondary industries to develop and so increase the home market for primary products. </para>

                        <para>. - This is only the second occasion upon which a tariff schedule has been introduced with the endorsement of the Tariff Board, after full investigation of all the duties proposed. The amendment involves a reduction of the duties recommended by the board, and every true protectionist must oppose that on principle. If the Minister had realized the trouble that would result, he would not have accepted the amendment, but would have allowed the question to be decided by a vote of the committee. The Minister may have thought that, by making a small concession, he would overcome a little opposition, but he has encouraged the fighting spirit of honorable members in the Ministerial corner. They have tasted blood, and will clamour for more sacrifices. I do not object to those shandygaff freetraders, or advanced revenue tariffists, fighting for principles in which they believe, but eleven members must not be allowed to think that they can override the protectionist sentiment of this committee and the people. If the electors could vote on this issue, they would declare for a protective policy, possibly equalled only by the tariffs of the United States of America and Japan. The extent to which Germany protects her interests is indicated by the fact that a small phonograph, a typewriter, or a pocket pedometer has to pay a duty of £12 </para>

                        <para>These might be termed the general engineering items, and, therefore, at the outset, it is desired to stress the importance of the engineering industry to Australia from the national stand-point, and the necessity for having thoroughly well-equipped engineering shops fully manned in the matter of defence will appeal to all. It is regrettable that in recent years this industry has been through a period of severe depression that almost crippled it, but it is gratifying that a timely rescue was brought about by the introduction of the new tariff schedule. The Tariff Board, after an exhaustive inquiry, was unable to see its way to recommend duties to the extent that had been applied for, and their recommendations are the duties included in the new schedule. Two of the disabilities that Australian engineers have to contend with are the high cost of raw material, and that of labour, compared with those of the United Kingdom, apart from the position obtaining in foreign countries. For these reasons it has been impossible to obtain a fair quota of the trade, which is reflected in the number of large orders which have been sent overseas. One of the large engineering firms kept a record of tenders submitted during the period 1st July, 1923, to 31st March, 1924, which totalled£ 2,428,921, but all the business they secured was 6.6 per cent., the largest proportion of the balance being placed overseas, the difference in Australian quotations with tenders from other countries ranging from 25 per cent. to 77 per cent., after allowing for duty, freight, and all landing charges. It might be pointed out that, with regard to efficiency, the firm referred to is recognized as being one of the most up-to-date and efficient shops in Australia. Taking all things into consideration, and the special conditions the workmen enjoy in Australia as compared to those in Great Britain, by reason of the fact that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court award provides a weekly wage, payment for holidays, and sickness, and restricted juvenile labour, it is safe to say that wages in Australia are fully 100 per cent. higher than in the United Kingdom. It cannot be denied that the skill and ability of the Australian engineer is quite on a par with those in competing countries, and the work turned out compares favorably, so that all that is necessary is for the industry to be sufficiently protected to place it on an equal footing in regard to all the circumstances with its competitors overseas. To show the importance of the industry, according to the returns of the Commonwealth Statistician for the year ended 30th June, 1924, in connexion with engineering and foundries, it may be noted that there were 1,343 factories, employing 33,052 hands, and paying in wages £6,949,295, with value of plant and buildings £10,918,919, and the value of output £24,151,439. It may be said that for Australian requirements there are classes of machinery which are not made in Australia, in many instances because of the limited demand it is not a commercial proposition to produce them here. Attention is therefore directed to item 174, which provides for the free admission of such. It is urged that the items and duties in the schedule be ratified as of great necessity to the well-being of Australia. </para>
                        <para class="block">Such a statement from the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia must appeal to every honorable member. While I trust that Great Britain will continue to prosper, I hope that she will wipe out that infamy which permits her to receive a preference on the basis of goods being 100 per cent. of British manufacture, whereas in many cases they consist of only 75 per cent. of British manufacture, the balance being imported from Germany or some other foreign country. The Minister, I believe, in answer to a question I submitted some time since, said that the proportion of British manufacture required to secure the benefit of the British preferential tariff, in respect of imports from Great Britain, had been increased from 25 per cent. to 75 per cent. Even this is not fair to the British workman, and in justice to Great Britain I am anxious to see an alteration made. The Minister agreed, I suppose, for the sake of peace and quietness, to take 5 per cent. off the British preference, but if he persists in that practice he will find himself engaged in the most lively tariff debate that he has ever known. After all, honorable members who are trying to reduce the tariff are only shandy-gaff freetraders. I have no objection to German manufactures coming here under reasonable conditions. A few years ago the phrase "Made in Germany" rang throughout the world. I believe that similar prominence could be given to the phrase " Made in England " if the British people set to work. I conversed with a good many English people, a year or so ago, when I had the pleasure of touring South Africa in the company of the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> and Conservatives and Liberals alike told me that they thought it was a blot on the escutcheon of Old England that she should, by a subterfuge, introduce into Australia manufactures that were said to be British, but which, in fact, were not. For many years Australia has elected huge majorities of protectionists to this Parliament with the object of developing a really sound protectionist policy. The honorable member for Swan, in the course of this debate, said that a certain machine cost three times as much in Australia as in the United States of America. I should like him to give me proof of the statement. In conclusion, may I say that the glove has been thrown down. If the Minister attempts to whittle down his tariff, we shall understand that he has picked it up; and we shall fight without quarter. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall not delay honorable members very long. I merely wish to say that when I ask a question in this Blouse with the object of ascertaining the price of Australian butter here and in England, I expect a plain answer to it. If every householder in Australia who buys a lb. of butter is contributing 3d. to a fund to enable butter to be exported on a profitable basis, let them be told so in unequivocal language. I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Markets and Migration a question on this point, and I hope he will not be offended when I say that I got a fat lot of information from him. When I inquire, for the purposes of comparison, the price per lb. that butter is being sold at in London and in Melbourne, on a given date, I do not desire to know the price per cwt. I only want a plain answer to my question. </para>
