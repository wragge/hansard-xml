            <para>- Two consignments for London were rejected, and bounty upon them refused, because the quality was not in accordance with the standard set up by the department. Unfortunately, those consignments got away before we were able to stop them ; but a communication regarding the matter has been Bent to the High Commissioner, and I have, for the future, given strict instructions that examination shall take place before export. If wine proposed to be exported is found not to be of good merchantable quality, as provided in the regulations, not only will bounty be refused, but the export of the wine will be prevented. </para>

Has the Minister noticed that it is therein alleged that these brushes were sold to that traveller by a wholesale house in the city, and are of Japanese manufacture! The honorable gentleman will recall the fact that I directed his attention, to the importation of tooth brushes that were being sold in this country, branded " Made in Britain," although they had been made in Japan. </para>

            <para>- I understand that the Prime Minister has placed certain proposals before the Premiers of the various States, and amongst them one dealing with capitation payments. Has he in any way put before the conference the scheme that was proposed by the Labour Government some years ago, and likewise, by a previous Treasurer from that side of the House' - that the capitation payment should be reduced each year at the rate of 2s. 6d. a head for ten years, instead of being discontinued altogether in one year! </para>

              <inline font-style="italic">.- (By leave.)-</inline>The date of the removal of the Seat of Government to Canberra has been under consideration by the Government and in the minds of all honorable members for many months past, and I am now in a position to indicate to the House the decision of the Government as to the' most suitable date for the transfer. Two dates have been suggested - the 26th January, which is Anniversary Day, and the 9 th May, the anniversary of the date upon which this Parliament first met. It is obvious that either of those dates would be thoroughly appropriate. A decision to meet on the 26th January, the anniversary of the first colonization of Australia, would, I believe, meet with general acquiescence. Similarly, the 9th May is an appropriate date by reason of the fact that it is the anniversary of the first meeting of this Parliament, and will mark the completion of the first year of the second 25 years of Federation. After a full consideration of the whole question, the Government's decision has fallen on the 9th May. That decision was determined largely by insistent practical considerations. Although the Parliament House at Canberra could be ready for an opening ceremony' on the 26th January next, it would be impossible to arrange for the housing and office accommodation of the staffs that would have to be then in Canberra if the Parliament had to function from that date onwards. </para>

              <para>- It was suggested that the Parliament might function at Canberra with skeleton departmental staffs; but examination revealed many objections to that arrangement. One of these was that officers would have had to go and return between the Seat of Government at Melbourne and Canberra every week. The proposal, upon investigation by the Works Committee, was found not to be satisfactory; it would have involved tremendous expense, and would have led to inefficiency in the departments. Consequently the idea was abandoned, and every effort was concentrated upon the transference of the Seat of Government from Melbourne and the opening of the Parliament at Canberra concurrently at the earliest date when it would be possible for the Parliament to function there continuously. Of course, if the opening of the Parliament there took place on the 26th January, it would be only a few months before the transference of the Seat of Government from Melbourne would be made ; but our legal advisors have definitely laid it down that the Constitution would not permit of the Parliament again meeting in Melbourne after it had met at Canberra. </para>

              <para>- It may be necessary for us to sit during the early months of next year; but if the Parliament were opened at Canberra on the 26th January next, and it were found impossible for it to function there, we should be placed in the very difficult and embarrassing position of having no place in which to function, notwithstanding that it was desirable in the interests of the Commonwealth that the session should continue. Consequently, the Government have come to the conclusion that the position will be best met if the official opening of the Parliament takes place at Canberra on the 9th May next. By that date it will be possible to actually move the Seat of Government there. A matter for later determination will be whether we shall continue to sit in Canberra immediately after the official opening. Possibly May is not the best month of the year in which to hold a session in Canberra,, as the sudden change of climate might prove harmful to some honorable members. But if a session were held in Melbourne in the early part of next year, it might be possible to have the official opening of the second session of the year in Canberra on the 9th May, and then to adjourn until the Budget was ready for presentation some time in August or the beginning of September. I recognize that many honorable members strongly hold the view that the 36th January is the most appropriate date, but Ministers do not regard this function as one with which they alone are concerned. The final determination of the matter must, however, rest with the Government, and we feel that the decision at which we have arrived is the best possible in the circumstances. </para>

          <para>There are one or two other matters with which it is desirable that I should deal. The possibility of transferring the Scat of Government to Canberra so that the Parliament could function continuously from a given date is governed by the ability to transfer the necessary staff. A portion of the staff of every department is to be transferred in the initial move. or. as it has been called, the first wave. The whole of the staff of the' Parliament, numbering 84, will be transferred. The Prime Minister's Department will take the whole of its central administrative staff. It is obvious that that department, and possibly the Attorney-General's Department, will need to have most of its officers transferred when the first move is made. The number of officers in the Prime Minister's Department who will be moved is 54. Other transfers will be: The staff of the office of the Official Secretary to the Governor-General, numbering 7: the central administrative staff of the Attorney-Gener.al's Department, numbering 33 ; 60 officers of the Treasury; 50 officers of the Home and Territories Department, 96 officers of the Works and Railways Department, 41 officers of the Department of Markets and Migration, and 85 officers of the Department of Trade and Customs. In each of those cases the transference will be one of the central administrative staff. The Department of Defence will have a secretariat of eighteen officers, the Postmaster-General's Department a secretariat of four officers, and the Health Department a secretariat of two officers.. There will also be two officers of the Inspector's staff of the Public Service Board, and three officers of the Inspector's staff of the Auditor-General's Department. The total number of officers to be transferred in the first move will </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>Bruce. be 539. In addition to those, there will have to be a staff 'G&gt;£ the Government Printing Office, which has not yet been selected. Subsequent to the first  move  as housing and departmental accommodation become available, further members of the various departments will be transferred to Canberra. </para>
          <para>I doubt whether most people realize the magnitude of the move we are about to make. A large amount of staff work will have to be done to ensure that the transfer is made smoothly. The organization of the transfer has been placed in the hands of Colonel W. P. Farr, an officer of the Defence Department, who has been appointed Director of Transportation. </para>
          <para>There was a brisk demand at the first auction sale of leases held at Canberra in December, 1924, when 290 residential and 104 business sites were offered. On the day of the sale 100 residential and 47 business sites were sold, and since then many other sites have been disposed of. At a further sale, to be held on the 29th May next, 80 residential and eighteen business blocks will be offered. There are indications that the business section of  the  .community has considerable faith in lie future of Canberra. That has been shown by the way in which business interests have bid for sites there. Arrangements have been made with the Commonwealth Bank to provide liberal assistance to civil servants who may desire to build homes, and  advances  will also be made on liberal terms for the construction of business premises. Any one desiring to build business premises will be able to do so on terms as favorable as those obtainable in any other capital in Australia. Members of the Public Service have naturally felt .some apprehension about the move to Canberra; but I am confident that, when they have had an opportunity of seeing the future Capital city, and have learned how much assistance will be given to them in establishing homes there, they will realize that they will be able to live there happily and contentedly. In order that members of the Service who will be transferred may have an opportunity of seeing their new home, and selecting residential sites, it has "been decided to give a concession of 50 per cent, of the return railway tickets issued for such of them and their wives as care to visit Canberra for that purpose. </para>
          <para>There is still another problem associated with the transfer. It is most undesirable that the large number of public servants to be transferred should be forced to sell their homes in a depreciated market. To overcome that difficulty, and to insure officers against loss in selling their homes, the Government is completing a scheme under which public servants who are to be transferred to Canberra may hand over their homes for realization on the basis of a fair -valuation. The amount at which a home has been valued will be placed to the owner's credit, and will be available to him immediately towards the cost of building a home at Canberra. I believe that that provision will relieve the anxiety of civil servants who, with considerable difficulty, have acquired their homes in Melbourne. The method of valuation will be laid down in the scheme, and I believe it will be regarded by members of the Service as equitable. The valuing will be done, not by the Government, but by independent valuers, and the interests of both sides in the transaction will be safeguarded. The Federal Capital Commission is preparing a pamphlet containing the plans of different types of homes, with particulars of their price for outright purchase or hire purchase, or their rent. Each officer in the Service will be given an opportunity of choosing a house from the plans. All honorable members must recognize the necessity for making this transfer on a basis that is undeniably equitable to the officers of the Service. The proposals I am now indicating are, I believe, equitable, and I have no doubt that the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra will intensify the national spirit of Australia. </para>
          <para>I have been asked to provide certain reports for honorable members; I shall endeavour to do so, and it will then be possible for them to discuss the subject to-morrow. </para>

Arrangements might easily be made for the ceremonial opening of the Parliament at Canberra, on the 26th January. No date more fitting for it than that of the first settlement in Australia could be fixed. After the ceremonial opening Parliament could be adjourned until the Government was prepared - in May or in June - for a continuous session. </para>

      <para>Mr.NELSON  (Northern Territory) [3.54]. - The bill now before the House provides machinery to enable the Government to substitute the freehold for the leasehold system of land tenure in the Northern Territory. One would think that, having decided upon the substitution of the freehold for the leasehold system there, the Government would have proposed the same thing for the Federal Capital Territory. But in view of the way in which the leasehold system is working out at the Federal Capital, the Government would do well to pause before departing in the Northern Territory from a system which is having such beneficial results to the Commonwealth at Canberra. I have noticed in to-day's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> a paragraph headed " Booming Canberra - Soaring Land Values - From 15s. to £7,000 - Keen Competition by Business Firms " - </para>
      <para>Queanbeyan,  Tuesday. - Messrs. W. B. Free- body and Company, of Queanbeyan. have begun building on a site of  a  quarter of an acre at Canberra  a  picture theatre, the estimated cost of construction being £15,000. The  land was  obtained by bid for £7,000 at  a  public auction. The Commissioner's reserve price was only £1, 300. When this land was resumed by the Government the cost of purchase was £3 per acre, thus a block bought for 15s. has been leased for £7,000. This is evidence of the extraordinary increase in land values occasioned by the Federal Capital Commission's administration. The block has a frontage of about 200 feet on one of the main roads of the city. </para>
      <para>Commenting to-day on this remarkable leap in land values, the  chairman  of the commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> H. Butters, said: - "Any public criticism, justified or unjustified, which may be levelled at the Government in regard to the Canberra undertaking, must take account of the circumstances that this project will, without the slightest doubt, pay for itself within twenty -five years. The Federal Capital is going to be the most profitable public utility the Commonwealth has. What was practically waste land, selling for a song, when it was sold at all, is now being sold by the foot, and it is going off like hot cakes. The commission is -putting up for auction next Saturday 80 residential sites and 20 shop sites. Wo purchased by the thousand acres; we are leasing by the foot, and people arc buying." </para>
      <para class="block">This quotation justifies my statement that it would be well for the. Government to pause before introducing the freehold system in the Northern Territory. It is clear that the enhancement of land values at the Federal Capital will prove of great advantage to the Commonwealth. The Minister in charge of this skeleton bill proposing so drastic and momentous a change in land administration in the Northern Territory has said that the measure is to apply only to agricultural and residential areas. I point out that an agricultural area may extend to 20,000 acres. As a huge expenditure of Commonwealth money is contemplated in the Northern Territory in the near future the Government should wait to see what effect that expenditure is likely to have on land values in that territory before proceeding with this measure, and permitting the alienation of Crown lands in fee-simple to the advantage of land monopolists. We do not want further land monopoly in the Northern Territory. As under this measure the Government will be dealing with large areas of Crown lands ranging up to 20,000 acres in extent, it behoves this Parliament to walk very warily and to be assured concerning the precautions taken against the possibility of land monopoly. I do not think that the machinery provided by this bill is sufficient to prevent the acquisition of the freehold of huge tracts of land under a system of dummying. Having regard to the contemplated expenditure of public money in the Northern Territory, it might be  possible under this bill for speculators to dummy large areas of country up to 20,000 acres in extent with a view to the subsequent consolidation of the freehold blocks. I am personally in favour of the leasehold system. I consider that we might look forward to satisfactory land settlement development in the Northern Territory, if the term of the leases were increased to 99 years. Even then we should endeavour to make it impossible for any man or combination of men to bring about land monopoly. We have had an extensive experience of land monopolists in Australia. As a result of their operations land has had to bc repurchased by governments at high prices to provide opportunities for settlement. A 99-years lease of an agricultural block of 20,000 acres should attract settlers. I think that quite a majority of leaseholders  to-day prefer the leasehold to the freehold system. Land administration is a most important function of the Government, and in encouraging settlement in the Northern Territory we should take every possible precaution against land monopoly. The Government, particularly in the Northern Territory, seems to be only playing with land settlement. No leases, pastoral or otherwise, have been granted in the Northern Territory for some considerable time. A bill providing for the administration of land in the Northern Territory was passed in this House over twelve months ago, and notwithstanding many attempts to secure leaseholds there, settlers have been unable to obtain them. I understand that this is due to the fact that the board created under the legislation to which I refer, has never functioned as this Parliament intended it should. It is true that pastoral occupation licences are being granted, but it does not follow that the persons holding those licences will later on acquire the lands as leaseholds. When the Northern Territory Land Act was under consideration, I pointed out that notwithstanding the fact that it did not provide for improvement clauses in leases the fact that the Government retained the right to impose stringent stocking conditions would be' sufficient to make the leaseholders improve their holdings in order to carry more stock. Although twelve or more months have passed, some of the best land in the Territory is still lying idle, no improvements have been effected, and the stocking conditions have not been insisted upon -by the board appointed at great expense by this Government to carry out the purposes of the act. It is futile to talk about granting freeholds when under the present system of . leasehold the lessees are not complying with the conditions of tenure. The Government now proposes to grant freeholds under certain conditions, but if experience is to guide us, we may expect little from freeholders. If conditions are not enforced more stringently than they have been in the past, no progress will be made at all in the development of the Northern Territory. The principle of leasehold is much to be preferred to the complete alienation of Crown lands, which is now contemplated under the bill; but as a number of my constituents desire to own the freehold of their blocks, I shall not oppose the bill. I trust that proper safeguards will be imposed to prevent the operation of monopolies in the Northern Territory. </para>

          <para>. - I regret that the Government intends to alter the policy that has hitherto been followed regarding the tenure of land in the  Northern Territory. We are about to appoint a commission to administer the Northern Territory, and to spend millions of pounds in its development by the construction of railways and roads, and this, to my mind, is a step in the right direction. Under this bill, as the honorable member for the Northern Territory said, speculators may take up land and greatly retard the development of the Territory. It is quite possible that they alone will derive the benefit of any further expenditure there. We know what the sale of land means to this country. If the leasehold system had applied to the capital cities of Australia, and the Government were now collecting rentals for city properties, we should almost be free from taxation, and development would have taken place without there being any need to borrow money in Australia or abroad. Under the system of private ownership of land, higher prices mean higher rents. The pernicious system of selling public lands is a disgrace to this country, and has been the means of greatly retarding its growth. The Labour party when in power established the principle of leasehold in the Northern Territory. It is true that since then the Territory has not developed to any great extent, but this has been due solely to the war. Had it not been- for the war, Darwin would undoubtedly have progressed. Now that we are paying attention to the development of the Territory it is really a mistake on the part of the Government to substitute freehold for leasehold. What is to- become of the great, tracts of land in the Northern Territory that are now held under leasehold ? Are these leaseholds, to be cancelled and the holders compensated, or do they stand until the end of time ? In the opinion of the Government the leasehold system as applied to the Northern Territory has failed. Yet the policy adopted respecting, the Federal Capital territory is to lease the land, and I venture to. predict that in time to come the city of Canberra will be the finest in the Commonwealth, if not in the world. When that time comes, a great revenue will be derived from that territory. Of course, there can be no comparison made between the Northern Territory and the Federal Capital territory, because the latter is much nearer the centres of population. Many municipalities throughout the world owe their development to- the enormous revenues that they receive from the leasing of reclaimed lands and remodelled buildings. The municipality of Glasgow 30 or 40 years ago adopted the principle of leaseholds, with the result that to-day in, that city there <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> practically no-municipal taxation. An enormous revenue is derived from its tramways, gasworks, and other municipal utilities. </para>

            <para>- No, but I think that the honorable member will agree that a settler on a block of 200 square miles should be entitled to buy the freehold. That is the type of mam that I wish to encourage to settle- in- the Northern Territory. I do not hold with the honorable member's statement that a man can get a good living from a holding carrying 500 sheep. A settler wants a bigger holding than that. It seems to me that, in granting the freehold of agricultural blocks, the Government is putting the cart before the horse, because there is no possibility of agriculturists selling, their products until the population in tie district is large enough to purchase them. The Government will not encourage people to settle in the Territory by holding out the bait of freehold for agricultural selections. Our experience of the disasters in the settlement on. the Daly River should convince us that near-by markets are necessary if agricultural blocks are to be worked successfully. It would be better for the Government to choose a block in the Northern Territory of perhaps 50,000 or 100,000 square miles, subdivide it into small holdings, and sell the- freehold on extended terms, at the same time rigidly enforcing conditions relating to stocking and improvements such as now exist in regard to leasehold, but which, unfortunately, have not always been insisted upon. If the strict letter of the law were enforced in the Northern Territory nearly every leaseholder would be compelled to forfeit his block. </para>

Of course, the Minister will not accept an amendment to this bill, but I ask him to seriously consider my suggestion, and make a statement to the House regarding the possibility of extending the freehold principle to pastoral lands. I regret that the Government is starting at the wrong end by granting the freehold of agricultural lands, and not of those larger holdings, whose development will be the greatest factor in bringing, prosperity to the Northern Territory. </para>

          <para>. - I cannot regard the granting of the freehold of agricultural lands in the Northern Territory as anything but a retrograde step. In conjunction with the declared policy of the Government to expend large sums of money in the making of roads and railways there, it is paving the way for the land-jobber. Naturally, public expenditure upon the making of outlets to markets and the provision of improved transport facilities will benefit agricultural lands more than any other, because whereas stock can be travelled on the hoof long distances to market, agricultural products must be carried by vehicle. Therefore, agricultural land will have a considerable increment in value immediately, and 30 years hence will be very valuable to the land-jobbers who have acquired it. Land bought to-day for 10s. or 15s. an acre will in time be repurchased by the Commonwealth for closer settlement purposes at £5 or f&lt;! an acre. That has been the experience in every State. The land-jobber and the speculator never develop a country. Leasehold must be of advantage to the genuine settler, because he can .start to make a living straightway with only one-third of the capital he requires if he has to buy land. Under the freehold system, as land increases <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> value holdings cam be obtained only by the payment of enormous sums, and in some hand-locked districts of New South Wales and Victoria a man cannot acquire an area unless lie has so much money that he is able to retire, and, therefore, does not need to buy. This Government is about to create the same conditions in the Northern Territory. Are we never to learn the lessons taught by past follies? Small country towns in every part of Australia arc languishing because all the lands surrounding them are locked up in private possession. That is one of the outstanding evils of the freehold system. It is absurd to say that leasehold has been a failure in the Northern Territory. I think the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson)</inline> was right in saying that the Government cannot grant the freehold of agricultural land and refuse the freehold of pastoral land. The pastoralists will demand that the same principle be applied to them as to the agriculturists, and they, too, will be able to acquire the fee-simple to their holdings. We should preserve the leasehold system wherever possible; although it may not suit the capitalist who desires to buy up the countryside and manipulate land values, it is much the best system for the genuine settler. Future generations will regret very much this partial abandonment of the leasehold principle. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>FENTON  (Maribyrnong) {4.29]. - I well remember the adoption of the leasehold system in 1910, in respect to the Northern Territory lands. Following the passage of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill which was introduced by the Fisher Government after many promises had been made by other governments, this Parliament passed a bill relating to the administration of that vast province which had been transferred from State to Commonwealth control. In the administration of the Territory many mistakes have been made for which critics have severely blamed this Parliament and various administrators ; but, probably had the critics had the responsibility of controlling that huge area, the results would have been even worse. Section 11 of the Northern Territory Administration Act of 1910 says very definitely - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>No Crown lands in the Territory shall be sold or disposed of for .any estate of freehold except in pursuance .of some contract entered into before the commencement of this act. <inline font-style="italic">lt</inline> he has not already done so, I hope the Minister will inform the House of the area of the Territory which had been disposed of prior to the Commonwealth assuming control. I admit that if two systems of tenure are operating side by side a good deal of friction is liable to result. This Parliament applied the leasehold principle to the Northern Territory, Norfolk Island, and the Federal Capital Territory. The folly of granting freeholds is demonstrated by the cost in which the Commonwealth was involved in repurchasing private estates in the Federal Capital Territory. It may be that some areas there are still held in fee-simple, but I hope that the day is not far distant when they will be resumed and converted to leasehold. This Government, however, has departed from the leasehold principle in connexion with Northern Territory lands, and I fear that it may some day take a similar retrograde step in regard to the Federal Capita] area. Some honorable members suggest that no business can be done in leasehold lands, but the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. Riley)</inline> has effectively answered such objections by quoting the conditions in Glasgow. A striking illustration of the success of the leasehold system in Melbourne is afforded by the Howie estate, which in the early days of this city was bought for about £300, and is worth today upwards of £1,000,000. It is centrally situated, and, owing to the enterprise of governments, municipalities, and private individuals, has enjoyed a considerable increment in value. Yet the Howie family has never disposed of any of it except upon building lease, at the expiration of which the land and the buildings thereon revert to the original owners. There is a great difference between a private landlord and a government manipulating land on the leasehold principle, and making money from it. There is, of course, a difference between the value of the corner block in Melbourne to which I have referred and land in the far distant Northern Territory, but the principle involved is the same. If it had been decided originally to apply the leasehold principle exclusively to the lands of Australia we should to-day be free from a great deal of the heavy taxation that we now have to bear. The fee-simple of the land having been disposed of, the revenue from it is flowing into pri- </para>

The Anglican church authorities own a block of land with a big frontage to Bourke and William streets, which for a number of years has been let out on building leases, and from which a large amount of revenue has been derived. Hundreds of square miles of land are held by individuals in the Northern Territory. If I have sensed aright the feeling of honorable members, it will not be very many years before that land will have its value enhanced by the construction of railways, roads, and other means of transportation, and the added value will benefit pridate individuals instead of the authority responsible for providing the means of communication. The present proposal is to apply the freehold principle only to agricultural lands, but before long it will be extended to pastoral lands, and private individuals will acquire for a mere song the best land in the Northern Territory. This is an attempt to drive a wedge into the leasehold system. I remember the introduction some years ago of a bill by the Honorable P. McM. Glynn, under which it was proposed to apply the. freehold system to the 3,000 acres of land that remained in the possession of the Crown on Norfolk Island. That measure was held up in this chamber for several days because it proposed to depart from, a cherished principle. This proposal, I believe, will have very much more serious results. It cannot be said that the adoption of the leasehold system is a departure from established custom, because, to a certain extent in Victoria, and to a much larger extent in New South Wales and Queensland, land is held under that tenure. I realize that the Government are determined to push the bill through, and are bound to have the support of a majority of honorable members. There may be one or two protests, such as that which was made by the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson).</inline> The objection of that honorable member, however, was not to the adoption of the freehold system, but to the fact that pastoral areas were not included. I have no doubt that that and similar protests will satisfy the consciences of those honorable members who make them, and that a majority of honorable members will favour the removal of this provision from the act. </para>

        <para class="block">So far as I can remember, the leasehold system in relation to the land of the Northern Territory was originally adopted almost unanimously by this House. I am not aware that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> has shown that the absence of freehold has limited settlement in the Northern Territory. It is quite likely that a number of interested parties have, either jointly or severally, expressed the desire to be given the freehold of their agricultural holdings. That, however, should not influence either the Government or the Parliament. We sometimes have to steel ourselves against the solicitations of interested parties, especially when a great principle is involved. I shall not be induced to agree to this concession, because there have been requests for an alteration of the existing system. The younger members of the Government party will live to regret having given their consent to the replacement of the leasehold by the freehold system. This will open the door to speculators, and unless the Ministry is very careful the lands of the Northern Territory will be practically given away. When railways and other means of communication are provided the value of those lands will be enhanced, and newcomers to the Territory will find that, instead of being able to obtain land from the Government at reasonable leasehold rates, they will have to pay " through the nose " to the private individuals who hold it. I protest against this proposed departure from a very valuable principle in regard to land settlement. </para>

          <para>. - I cannot understand how the Government can consistently ask for our endorsement of a proposal which will have the effect of preventing the Commonwealth from enjoying the advantage that is conferred by the enhancement of the value of land. The leasehold principle applies to the lands in the Federal Capital Territory. That policy has been endorsed by the Parliament at different times, and distinct advantages have accrued to the Commonwealth. But despite that illustration of the desirability of the Crown retaining the powers of title over land, the Government proposes in relation to another part of the Commonwealth an entirely contradictory policy. The Minister has not said anything which justifies this proposed change of policy. Knowing the forces that are operating within the Northern Territory, we should not be doing our duty if we permitted such a sweeping change to be made without challenge. Certain interests in the Northern Territory desire to obtain a firmer grip of the land than they have at. present. I recognize that the bill does not "deal with pastoral leases; they were fully dealt with in a past session, when a grave injustice was done to the people by deliberately depriving them of rentals due to them . Although that legislation has little or no relation to the present proposal, it certainly indicates that the interests which took such an unfair advantage of the people at that time are still active, and are claiming freehold titles over other lands which I, as a representative of South Australia,  am not prepared to grant. I think I may claim, without offence to other honorable members, that the representatives from South Australia feel that they have a more direct interest in the future of the Northern Territory than the representatives from other States. </para>

            <para>- And we do not wish to leave it on the doorstep. We wish to feel that we are providing it with nourishment in the form of wise legislation, upon which it will thrive until it has become a strong, healthy unit of the Commonwealth. It cannot develop properly under a system of freehold tenure. If it be wise to have a leasehold system in the Federal Capital territory, it cannot be unwise to have the same system in 'the Northern Territory. We have experienced the evils of freehold tenure in the different States, where land jobbery has been rampant, and the speculator has profited at the expense of the community. The speculator says. " If you do not speculate you do not accumulate," and he makes certain that he, at least, accumulates. Financial interests in all parts of Australia are taking advantage of the development of the  community to reap the reward! that rightly belongs to the  community.  They have secured' a grip of the. laud required by the community, and are charging excessive prices for it. That has been made possible by the granting of freehold titles. The State Governments have experienced great difficulty in regulating the activities of these men, and in preventing them from perpetrating wrongs on the people. The Federal Government, by lending itself to a vile, vicious, and evil principle, will bring itself into disrepute. Revenue which should come to the Commonwealth will <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> into the pockets of private individuals. If those individuals were- doing anything to promote the higher interests of the Commonwealth, and were contributing to the added values of the land they deal in, I might be able to concede some merit in the arguments of the Minister ; but I know that they "toil not, neither do they spin," and that, while contributing nothing to the progress- of the community, they receive the fun advantage of any progress brought about by the community. Thus they prey upon society. The Government has . departed from a cardinal principle in land policy, and unless there are more substantial reasons for the change than those advanced by the Minister. I must register my opposition to it. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> advanced many logical arguments why the Government should not proceed with this policy. We, on this side, have often accused the Government, not without justification, of lending itself to wealthy and vested interests, and in its laud policy it has again justified the allegation. I shall await with interest the reply of the Minister. It may be that he thought there was little or no need for a long explanation of the proposal, because the greater the explanation the greater the condemnation would be likely to be, and " the least said tha soonest mended." The Minister - did not waste much eloquence on this proposal'. </para>

The Government proposes to make provision for freehold in the Northern Territory, and Ave should like to know whether this is merely a first instalment, and whether similar proposals are yet to be submitted for other Territories of the Commonwealth. We should learn from the experience of the past, even in a young country like Australia, that the land should be kept in the hands of the Government, and should not be handed over to private individuals for speculation and exploitation. The people as a whole should reap the benefit from added values given to laud as the result of community efforts. I express my resentment at and condemnation of this proposal, and if my voice and vote influence the Government to refrain from doing what they propose to do under this bill, I shall feel that I have performed a duty to Australia. </para>

          <para>.- What I regret most in connexion with this measure is the very little interest that appears to be taken by honorable members in the great land question. It has been a burning question in Australia for a great number of years, and has been associated with the greatest scandals and abuses of our national life. The adoption of the freehold system has been the means of inflicting the greatest hardship upon the community. We give away the fee-simple of lands which should have been retained by the State for those who are to follow us. By giving away the lands which should be regarded as the birthright of future generations, we place the destinies of Australia in the hands of a few. We have in this Parliament a Country party, the members of which, on every opportunity, assert that the land is the chief source of all wealth. Philosophers and social reformers whose opinions are respected have warned governments that to give to individuals the fee-simple of Crown lands is cruel and unjust to present and future generations. I cannot understand the indifference of honorable members to so important a question. They should rise in their places and use their intelligence to prevent the injustice which is sure to follow from the application of the land policy contained in this measure. We cannot say what the future wilt be, but we know that, in the past, private individuals have unjustly acquired wealth as the result of land transactions. The land policy proposed in this bill is destructive. Under the freehold system, people desiring to- hold land have to carry a burden that, in financial phraseology, is described, as a "blister." If they were able to take up land on the payment of a nominal rent to the Crown, their savings might be invested to enable them to secure a return from their land, instead of having to be used to pay interest on a mortgage. Honorable members on this side are prepared to devote some of their time to the history of land transactions in this country, and to the views of those who have made land administration a special study. I do not say that Henry George, Blanchard, or the author of <inline font-style="italic">Looking Backwards,</inline> are correct in the views they have expressed, but they certainly have submitted good reasons to justify us in taking action to prevent land robbery by private individuals. A friend of mine who was a member of the New South Wales Parliament, and was in favour of the leasehold system, said on one occasion that public men, and amongst them some members of Parliament, carried stones in their pockets with the object of floating mines, and carried plans of land which could be acquired from the Crown at a cheap rate and subsequently sold at double and treble the price to persons in want of land. The freehold system cripples the progress of the country. Those who are opposed to the leasehold system are interested in monetary institutions that ave out to extract as much from the people as they can. People are invited to believe that there is some special  virtue  in a freehold, but we know that a great many have had to leave their land before they could remove the blister to which they had had to submit in order to secure it. When I find so- much indifference to this question displayed, I feel that there must be something underlying this, proposal. There is grave suspicion that there is going to be  a deal in connexion with land in the Northern Territory as a  result  of it. The Minister said that some governments have- broken away from the leasehold principle, and yet he is prepared to father this proposal, which will be a burden and a curse to future generations in the Northern Territory. Future settlers in the Territory will curse those responsible for taking away from them the ownership of its lands. Where to-night is the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Elliot. Johnson),</inline> the great apostle of the leasehold system ? The honorable member was. returned to Parliament and retained his seat for a number of years as the advocate of that system. Where is the honorable member now, when the Government proposes to depart from that system ? It only shows how the people are deceived by some public men. Look at the misery imposed upon the Irish, people because the lands of Ireland were locked up in freeholds in the hands of titled persons who did not care what became of the country. In Scotland the Crofters were obliged to pay for the right to occupy a few acres of land to grow food for their families, because those lands were held by persons whose policy was to get all (hey possibly could for themselves and let every one else go to the devil. It is not to the credit of the . Government that it does not make an effort to retain the leasehold system in the Northern Territory. We know how well that system is operating now at Canberra. The people of Australia should thank the Labour Government for deciding, when the Federal Capital Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth, that the tenure should be leasehold, and the revenue therefrom accrue to the nation. It was a bold and beneficial policy. Yet this Government intends to violate that principle in respect of the Northern, Territory. In the interests of om- future generations, we should retain the fee-simple of Crown lands. In my young days, my objection to mortgages prevented me from obtaining land. I worked hard at my trade, but not until I was 60 years of age was I able to obtain a home of my own. If the land in the Territory were held under leasehold, the rentals therefrom would materially assist in the reduction of taxation, and in the provision of roads, railways, and other transport facilities. This bill will certainly permit of land speculation. Land jobbing is a profession nowadays. A speculator purchases land,' allows it to lie idle for a few years, and then sells it, on mortgage, to a small settler <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> an exorbitant price. In time of drought the settler is unable to meet his payments, and the property reverts to the speculator. The same process is continued until the speculator become rich at the expense of the small settlers. All honorable . members claim to be statesmen. There is a vast difference between a politician and a statesman. The first wishes to make sure of his seat at the next election, and the second is anxious only for the future prosperity of the country. If honorable members would only view this bill as statesmen, and with clear vision, they would strongly oppose it. I am satisfied that the measure has been introduced at the instigation ' of persons interested in the Northern Territory, who desire to speculate in freehold. In view of the past scandals in land transactions, we should strenuously oppose any attempt to sell the freehold of Northern Territory lands. In the constituency that I represent, land has been sold at £1,600 a foot. If the Government had been collecting rentals from such properties, the development of the interior of Australia would now have been an accomplished fact. The bill affects immigration. "We must place our immigrants on the land. Many of them have less than £100, and in order to purchase freeholds they will be compelled to carry a heavy mortgage on their holdings, necessitating weekly payments of from 20s. to 25s. If these men, during drought time, are unable to meet their payments, their holdings will revert to the mortgagor. The Queensland Government has adopted the system of leaseholds. Along each side of the railway lines of that State is a strip of land, half a mile in width, which is retained as a Government reserve. </para>

            <para>- Every State but Queensland settled returned soldiers on freehold land. The Queensland Government placed them on the Government reserves alongside the railways at moderate rentals, and they planted fruit trees and set pineapples between the trees. As a pineapple plantation gives a return in the first year, they were able immediately to earn sufficient to provide the necessaries of life, and were not handicapped by a heavy capital outlay for the purchase of their holdings. </para>

            <para>- The proposal to grant the freehold of agricultural lands in the Northern Territory is outrageous. When men lease land at a nominal rent, they have more chance of getting a prompt return for the work they put into their holdings. The majority of honorable members opposite are the friends of banking institutions, and get their votes, and they are now trying to serve the interests of their supporters. That is a very poor spirit. Honorable members should take a more statesmanlike view of this proposal. I am satisfied that future generations will bless them if they refuse to part with the fee-simple of our large public estate in the Northern Territory. We cannot expect' people to settle there unless they have a chance of acquiring a piece of land for their own purposes without having to pay a heavy purchase price. The earth and the fulness thereof belong to all the people. </para>

            <para>- What is the use of expressing noble sentiments to men who pay no more attention to them than if their heads were so many bladders of lard ? It is bad for the country that some honorable members should take so little interest in public questions, and should allow themselves to be misled by people who have private ends to serve. The man who owns the land owns the people on it. In some of the older countries of the world the masses of the people are at the mercy of Tory landlords; and for the benefit of a few covetous individuals the Government proposes to introduce old-world abuses into the Northern. Territory. I have never claimed to be a disciple of Henry George, but I believe that in the interests of the commonweal this Parliament should prevent the evils of land monopoly in the Territory it controls. I have known 1,200 people in New South Wales to scramble for one block of land. The Government's policy will bring about a similar state of affairs in the Northern - Territory. Existing evils are not easily removed, but though the past is beyond recall, we can profit by earlier mistakes and mould the future to our will. Now is the time for this Parliament to take a  stand against a policy that- will prove detrimental to the interests of the nation. I deplore the lack of true patriotism in those who are supporting this bill. I have never missed an opportunity to prevent or remove abuses, and I should be recreant to my duty . to the electors of East Sydney if I did not emphatically protest against the alienation of Commonwealth lands. After all, freehold is merely a fetish ; many people have inherited a prejudice against leasehold, and attach an exaggerated value to the fee-simple. It is to the interest of some people to perpetuate the popular misunderstanding of the principle that is involved. We could not do greater harm to future generations than by depriving them of the opportunity to share iu that which Providence has provided. The freehold system has been perpetuated because of ignorance. To-day we are an enlightened democracy, and if we act wisely we shall create wealth for the whole of the people of Australia instead of allowing it to be enjoyed by only a few individuals </para>

          <para>.- I sympathize with the desire of the Government to apply the system, of freehold tenure to certain areas in the Northern Territory. Only by that means shall we induce closer settlement there. There is not u State in Australia in which one cannot obtain the fee-simple of laud that is required for agricultural and similar purposes. The great objection to the leasehold system is that the government of the day may so alter the conditions of the tenure that the tenant is unable to carry on. I do not believe that one honorable member opposite would choose for himself the leasehold tenure in preference to the freehold. I am anxious that the Northern Territory should be developed. At Canberra recently the Government sold the leasehold of certain land. Those who purchased leaseholds subsequently found that it was impossible to obtain financial assistance to enable them to build thereon. Even the Commonwealth Bank declined to make a loan until it was guaranteed under a special agreement with the commission. In Western Australia at one time the Government wished to provide homes for working miners. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Throssell, then </para>

        <para class="block">I believe that the power to sell ought to be embodied in the act. Of course, large pastoral and mineral areas should not be sold. In Victoria in the early days considerable difficulty was experienced because mineral rights were not reserved to the Crown. In recent years the practice has been to reserve those rights. There is nothing in the act to prevent the Minister from selling land that contains gold or other minerals and not reserving all minerals to the Crown. Must we depend upon provision being made in an ordinance that no land shall be sold so as to give a pre-emptive right to a depth greater than  30  feet? In Western Australia, a man who buys land is given the pre-emptive right to a depth of only  50  feet. If metals are discovered below that depth the State has the power to grant leases for the purpose of carrying on mining operations subject to compensation being given to the holder of the land for any surface damage that is done. Any ordinance framed under the measure should make a similar provision in regard to the lands of the Northern Territory ; and  in addition it should provide for the absolute reservation to the Crown of all mineral rights. </para>

He further stated that the Government of every State in the Commonwealth gives applicants for Crown land a freehold title. I combat that statement.

That is happening all over Australia to-day. The disastrous effect of freehold tenure upon development is illustrated in every State of the Common- wealth. In the Northern Territory, the effect will be diametrically opposite to that which the honorable member for Swan imagines. </para>

            <para>- I have not heard any convincing reason for this drastic change. There may be a show of argument for retaining freehold tenure in Great Britain and other European countries. In countries where there is no leasehold agricultural land there is a disposition to attribute any agitation for leasehold tenure to the faddist and visionary; but even in Great Britain no less an authority than Herbert Spencer, the greatest exponent of individualism that Great Britain has ever had, who has been spoken of as the greatest philosopher of this or any other age, opposed the freehold tenure of land. Henry George, against tremendous odds in the individualistic country of the United States of America, wrote a book called <inline font-style="italic">Progress and Poverty,</inline> the conclusions of which, in my opinion, have not been refuted by any one. Persons in the Old Country may not be prepared to tread a path not trodden previously. In that country the difficulties to be overcome in abolishing the private ownership of land are great; the land would have to be nationalized, and large vested interests bought out, and that might be financially impossible. But Australia is differently circumstanced with regard to the Northern Territory. There we can try out the leasehold system, and it was the wish of the Federal Parliament in 1910 that it should be tried out. The Minister and his colleagues are trying it out in the Federal Capital Territory, with the result, as stated by the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson),</inline> that from one small area of land, which cost the people of this country 15s., the Government has drawn unearned increment amounting to no less than several thousands of pounds. That huge profit under a freehold system of tenure would have gone into the pockets of private speculators, hangers-on, and those who sit tight and wait. Who was responsible for the large increase of land values in, say, Bourke-street, Melbourne? Who was responsible for the fact that several blocks in that street have returned £250,000 to the owners of them? Was that result achieved by individual effort - that individual effort which honorable members opposite are so anxious to preserve, and which we on this side are not prepared to question? Was it by any man's personal energy? Was it by the application of brains to the betterment of humanity? Was it because of the invention of a machine to lighten the work of industry? It was due, not to any of these things, but to the owner, through luck, in many instances, sitting down in Melbourne in the early days- </para>

            <para>- That is quite true, for while venturesome spirits went to the diggings and the back country, persons with less energy sat down in the city and pocketed the unearned increment created by the gathering of population around them. We have the example of Canberra, where the leasehold system is being tried. As the leasehold system is being discarded in the Northern Territory, one wonders whether a similar change will be made in the near future at Canberra. . May not the friends of honorable members opposite - the men who finance the National party at election times - apply pressure to obtain the freehold system at Canberra, just as they have done in the Northern Territory? From my observations, freehold tenure, instead of assisting industry in Australia, is ham-stringing it. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> said there was not an honorable member on this side who held freehold land who would be prepared to exchange it for leasehold land. That is a wonderful argument, is it not? He asks mo whether I would be prepared to exchange something to which the community has given a greater value for something of less value. Of course I would not. But we must not pander to the cupidity of men who wish to have a freehold for which they never bargained. The honorable member for Swan and his friends play up to the cupidity of people. The freehold system is menacing development, and surely that fact should appeal to him. He and I, in our frequent visits to Western Australia, pass through the wheat lands of South Australia. Beside the line from Adelaide to Port Augusta there is land which sells for £20 an acre. It includes some of the finest wheat land in South Australia, hut wheat, it is said, cannot profitably be grown there. The reason is that the land is over-capitalized. The same handicap exists in other primary industries. A large number of the retired people in Adelaide were formerly farmers who sold their land at £12, £15, and £20 an acre. While they walk about Adelaide in their store clothes - for they are unable to discard the saving instinct that a man has to develop on his own farm - and while they collect their rents, the . poor beggars who bought their land at £20 an acre find themselves faced with the impossible task of trying to make a profit out of 18 bushels of wheat to the acre. </para>

            <para>- If he can; and that raises the point I wish to emphasize. He buys the land not to grow wheat on it, but in the hope of a rise in values. He buys as a speculator. If he is a farmer he knows that he cannot make a profit by growing wheat with a yield of 18 bushels to . the acre on land costing £20 an acre. Many persons who go on the land in South Australia pay a £400 or £500 deposit, and in good faith try wheat-growing in the first instance. When they find that they cannot make wheat-growing pay, they try to sell the land at £21 an acre. Wheat-growing on such land does not pay. </para>

            <para>- It is not; I say that as a wheat-grower. The honorable member should " stick to his last." He was a storekeeper, not a wheat-grower. Western Australia is favorably placed for wheat-growing, because land is cheap there, but, inevitably, with freehold tenure, the same thing will happen as has happened in South Australia and elsewhere. The farmers will sell out at an increased price, and, ultimately, we shall hear the wheat-grower of Western Australia declaring that wheat-growing does not pay. It has been represented that, in. the great wheat-growing centres of the middle west of the United </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">States of America, land has increased so much in value as a result of speculation, that wheat-growing no longer pays. The banks financed many of the farmers, and there has been a big financial crash. The land was valued at from £20 to £30 an acre, and hundreds of the banks who backed the farmers on that valuation have gone into liquidation. The same thing is taking place in the eastern States of Australia, not only in wheat-growing, but also in dairying. The western district of Victoria is, I should say, the fairest part of Australia. Land there is valued at from £100 to £120 an acre, and rents are as high as £5 and £6 per acre. What do we find there? We find the Paterson butter scheme in operation to raise the price of butter so that the poor devils on the over-capitalized land may make a living. They are awakened by the alarm clock in the morning, and on every farm the husband, wife, and children take a share of the work. As a result of freehold tenure, profitable industry has become almost impossible. The Northern Rivers district of New South Wales is possibly the richest country in Australia, with the exception of some parts of Queensland. In that country, the great difficulty is to keep the feed down, rather than to avoid over-stocking the country; but even in that part of Australia, I have conversed with persons who say that it is impossible to make a profit out of anything but butter because of the high price of the land. We have had as a visitor this afternoon a member of the Parliament of the sister dominion of New Zealand. He says that the fact that land there suitable for dairying sells at up to £120 per acre has made it impossible to make the production of butter a paying proposition in the dominion, which should be the home of the dairying industry. A leasehold tenure has not prevented the best efforts being put forward by those engaged in several industries in Australia. So far as I know there is not an important mine in Australia that is not situated on a leasehold. Those engaged in the mining industry do not require freeholds for their operations. It is true that when the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> was a member of the Western </para>
        <para class="block">Australian Government he was approached by mining men who wanted the freehold of their mining leases, but the honorable member resisted all such applications. He was against a freehold tenure for mining lands, but is now in favour of a freehold tenure for lands in the Northern Territory. I fail to see any consistency in his attitude. The great pastoral areas of Australia are efficiently worked under the leasehold system by people who might reasonably be expected to desire the freehold of their holdings. The wool industry, which is possibly the most important we have in the Commonwealth, is successfully carried on under the leasehold system of land tenure. Let us consider what is taking place in Queensland where the leasehold system is being tried. Since 1915 it has been impossible for any one to obtain other than a leasehold tenure of agricultural lands in Queensland. The fact that at the recent State elections the Queensland Government was again returned to power after a tenure of office extending over eleven years, proves that the people of that State endorse the land policy of that Government. In the last eleven years the population of Queensland has increased by 180,000. No other State in the Commonwealth can show such progress. For the first nine months of last year the population of Queensland increased by 15,000, whilst no other State showed an increase during the same' period of quite 5,000. Queensland under the leasehold system is advancing by leaps and bounds. A system of land tenure found suitable for tropical Queensland should be equally suitable for the Northern Territory, where the natural conditions are much the same. This Bill proposes the adoption in the Northern Territory of a land system, which has brought about an impossible state of affairs in the mother country. The cupidity of private individuals in Great Britain induced them to acquire the freehold of areas available for agriculture; but instead of being used to grow cereals, which Great Britain needs, those valuable lands have been turned into deer parks. A man must work a leasehold if he wants to make a profit out of it, whilst the tree-holder sits down and waits for the unearned increment in the value of his land. There is an example of this in the rich district of Toodyay, in Western Australia, which I know, and which is in the electorate of the honorable member for Swan. The district has made no progress in the last 60 years. Its population is if anything less now than it was 60 years ago, because the early settlers acquired the freehold of their lands, and have been waiting to reap the unearned increment. They are like the people at the back of the Government in this proposal, who are clamouring for freeholds in the Northern Territory. They want to get something for nothing, by robbing future generations of Australia of their birthright in the Territory. </para>

          <para>.- I have to thank the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Man-)</inline> for his courtesy in letting me see an advance proof of the speech that he made when introducing the bill. If I were a believer in the private ownership of land I should say that it was a very fine speech, and, I dare say, would approve of it; but as I have long held that the land should belong to the people as a whole, I must oppose the bill. I do not believe in private property in land. The land belongs to the people. God gave it to them to be made good use of. Some of the most terrible iniquities have been perpetrated upon the people of many lands under the system of private ownership. The great Jewish race was in the past remarkable for its system of land tenure. In no other country was there so much happiness and prosperity as in Judea. When the jubilee year came there, every family or its descendants whose land had been alienated had it returned to them. There is no doubt that had the ancient Jewish people been allowed to remain under its own laws the world would have been much happier and more just than it is to-day. Members of that race could not sell land for a period of more than 50 years, or' beyond the jubilee year. If 25 years had passed since the last jubilee year, land could be parted with only for the remaining period. If 40 years had passed, land could be sold only for ten years. In the jubilee year rejoicings rang through the length and breadth of the country, and in biblical language, every man dwelt " under his vine and under his fig tree." </para>

            <para>- Was it not persecution that made the Jewish people apt to get that which was easiest to carry when they were forced to leave their homes? The change which came about in that race was due to its persecution by peoples who called themselves Christian, but were not so in spirit. No man of modern time has studied the values of land more than did Henry George, and when a monument to his memory is erected, it will tower in company with the monuments of those who have most benefited this world. The Labour Government tried an experiment in the Northern Territory. The only other experiment that I know of made under the British flag to abolish private ownership of land was in the colony of Hong Kong, where previously the old bad habit of selling land had held sway. That was discontinued, and in its place came the 999 years' lease. There are a few of these leases. There is also the 99 years' lease, and the 75 years' lease. When any land is reclaimed it is valued at a fair rental, but to get the difference between corner blocks and blocks alongside, they are put up to auction with right to lease, and the rental is based on a fair value. As a result of this system the revenue of Hong Kong increased by leaps and bounds. When the leases expired splendid buildings became the property of the Government. No country under the British flag showed an increase of revenue equal to that of Hong Kong at that time. What was the experience of Japan ? On the advice of the great philosopher, Herbert Spencer, the representatives of the Japanese Government framed their foreign policy. He advised them how to avoid quarrels with foreign nations. He told them to sell no land, and to keep other countries at arm's length; not to let foreign races have mining rights nor allow their ships to trade on the Japanese coast. Herbert Spencer never imagined that Japan would grow to such a warlike nation as she is to-day. He asked the representatives of the Japanese Government not to make public his advice to them until after his death. In Japan no outsiders, except various religious bodies, are allowed to acquire land, and even in the case of religious bodies the land is gradually being re-bought. This leads up to the splendid experiment that we are trying in the Northern Territory. No one will deny that Australia is the heritage of the white race. I resent this attempt to substitute the system of freehold for that of leasehold, just as much as I resented the action of the Government that changed the leasing of mallee lands, to private ownership. At that time any man could get a leasehold block for 2s. 6d. The petty argument was raised that the settler could not borrow money on the land from a financial institution. I suppose one would be safe in dividing, financial institutions into three categories - good, bad, and indifferent. The good institution would be the bank which lent money at moderate rates of interest; the indifferent institution would lend money at a little more than a fair rate of interest; and the bad institution would be the money lender. Would not Dante have been justified in consigning money lenders to the deepest of his seven hells? Every honorable member knows what happens to those who get into the clutches of money lenders. The paltry excuse was made that the leaseholders would not be able to borrow from financial institutions. The action of the government of that time was not worthy of a great national government. If this Government holds the same view, why does it not extend the functions of the Commonwealth Bank, as was intended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley, the founder and father of that institution. At present the Commonwealth Bank is only a banker's bank, no different from other banks except that it is more powerful. If that bank functioned as it was originally intended to function, financial assistance would be given to the farmers. This measure is called a bill for an act to amend the Northern Territory Administration Act 1910. Clause 3 reads-" Section 11 of the principal act is repealed." That section reads - </para>

            <para>- Then, in respect of agricultural land, one-tenth of it must bc cultivated, and sold at not less than 2s. Cd. an acre. Fancy, in these clays of teeming millions in overcrowded countries selling land here at 2s. 6d. an acre! The Government will say that that is its true value at present. I should be willing that a man should have land after he had cultivated it over a period of years and made good. Garden blocks must be within 10 miles of a township, and sold at not less than 10s. an" acre. Then there are tropical lands. A company may take up land not exceeding 20,000 acres, on leasehold for fourteen years, and afterwards obtain it at 2s. 6d. an acre. That might be the present value of the land, but values change. A man who is dying from thirst would give any amount for a glass of water, but would any honorable member say that that was the fair value of the water? We want to settle white men in the Territory, and give them a chance to make good. How many thousands of persons would have settled in Western Australia if they had had to obtain financial assistance to pay for their land?

        <para class="block">Approximately £100,000 of the people's money will be expended in taking a referendum upon certain proposed amendments of the Constitution, in regard to which this Government has kindly condescended to consult the people. If we trusted the people as we should, they could express their will by referendum, independent of any government or parliament. Many honorable members who say that they trust the people speak with false hearts, and their tongues in their cheeks. If the people, in their wisdom, declare that the Government should be allowed to sell land in the Northern Territory, I shall accept their verdict, but they should have the opportunity to declare, as I believe they would, that this land shall be held for the benefit of future generations. If the Government will not allow this question to be determined by referendum, it does not trust the people. The paltry excuse of expense cannot be urged, because if the Government's constitutional proposals are approved by this Parliament, a referendum will be taken, and one more question upon the ballot-paper will make no difference. In the State of Ohio, in . America, at the first operation of the referendum, the people on one day voted upon 43 separate questions. The Australian people have already voted in three or four referendums, and surely they can be trusted to decide at one appeal three questions. The only additional expense my amendment would involve would be the cost of printing an extra question on the ballot-paper. We who sit in this chamber are only passing objects on the river of time; we must face our creators within three years. Have we a right to say that millions of acres in the Northern Territory shall be offered for sale? It is true that the freehold system is to be applied only above a certain degree of latitude, but judging by past history, it is only the thin end of the wedge. One of the greatest philosophers has said that no ruler, or government, or parliament has the right to make laws that future generations must obey, and in making my protest against this bill, I affirm the right of any succeeding Parliament to undo the evil that this Parliament is about to do. I warn those who may acquire the fee simple under this legislation that, if I am returned to the next Parliament, I shall be prepared to repeal this legislation without compensation to the freeholders. As an Australian who loves his country, and wishes to hand it down as a great  heritage to the white race, I am opposed to one-fifth of the continent being alienated from the. Crown. The proposal to refer this question to a' referendum seems to disturb some honorable members. I have heard many public men say that they would be proud to be the servants of the people, and,' if returned to Parliament, would do this and that. But having been elected, they soon forgot their promises. Very often this chamber has rung with the voices of men who spoke in opposition to what they had declared on the public platform. Many years ago, when I introduced the practice of dividing the Victorian House of Assembly on all controversial questions, Duncan Gillies stated that, though a member might be able to explain away a speech, he found it very difficult to explain away a vote. Next to the single tax ideals promulgated by Henry George is the policy of land nationalization. The Northern Territory is the only portion of the Commonwealth, except the Federal Territory, where all the land is the property of the nation. If we part with the fee-simple of lands in the Northern Territory, who can be sure that a similar policy will not be applied to the lands in the Federal Capital Territory? Collins-street is the centre of Melbourne, and the land fronting it is the most valuable in Victoria; indeed, its value per foot is second only to that of certain Sydney properties. Between Swanston-street and Williamstreet, one may see a succession of noble buildings, in each one of which there is a waste wall. In other words, between adjoining premises there are two walls occupying from 3 ft. to 5 ft. 6 in., of one of the most valuable frontages in Victoria. Add to the value of the land thus occupied the amount of labour and material put into the walls, and it will be found that, at a moderate estimate, £250,000 to £300,000 has been thus wasted in that section of Collins-street alone. If the Commonwealth owned the whole of the square bounded by Collins, Bourke, Swanston, and William streets, and erected a block of buildings twelve stories high upon it, would it be necessary for a person desiring to go to another room a few yards away on the same floor to descend by lift to the street, walk to another entrance, and take another elevator? </para>
        <para class="block">No; he would be able to walk along a patio or verandah to any part of the block he desired to reach. The waste I have mentioned is one of the awful results of undisciplined private ownership of land. It is certain that if one person owned the whole block, he would not devote so much space and material to dividing walls. An eminent architect to whom I referred this matter said that, by the erection of four huge pillars, all the huge cost of party walls could have been avoided, and upwards of £250,000 saved. If my amendment is defeated, it will at least have served to spread the gospel of the referendum. I know that it will receive the endorsement of the Australian Natives Association, which is the most powerful friendly society in Australia to-day ; and I believe it will be supported by the strongest newspaper in Victoria - the Melbourne </para>

          <para>. - The settlement of the Northern Territory has been a problem, not only to this but also to preceding Parliaments; but notwithstanding the efforts that have been made, that problem appears to become greater as the years pass. Many millions of pounds have been spent in an endeavour to do something with this vast territory, but it appears to me that it will be a sink for many more millions for years to come. The extent to which we shall be committed, to enable something of a practical nature to be achieved, is not at present apparent. I greatly fear that even the expenditure of millions of pounds upon the railways that are projected will not give us the results for which we all hope. I recently attended a lecture that was delivered by Professor Griffith Taylor, of the Sydney University, who, I believe, has been all over Australia. </para>

            <para>- I think he claims to have been through it, and to know all about it. He pointed out that over 60 years ago pioneers penetrated into the central portion of Australia in the search for land suitable for agricultural settlement. He does not deny that the lands of the Territory are suitable for pastoral purposes, but he claims that the investigations of these men proved that it was unsuitable for closer settlement. They went over every foot of the land, but their search was not rewarded with success. He also pointed out that the argument advanced 32 years ago in favour of the extension of the railway in certain directions was that closer settlement would follow, and the line would prove a profitable investment. He said that when the line was opened four families resided in one particular place - which he mimed - but to-day their number had been reduced to two. </para>

            <para>- Unfortunately, I cannot remember the name of the place. Professor Taylor claimed that the best agricultural land in Australia was to be found on the fringe of the continent, for a distance of 200 miles inland ; .and that the further you approached the interior the more arid the country became. Listening to his lecture, I was not encouraged to believe that even the extension of railways through the central portions of Australia and into the Northern Territory would lead to agricultural settlement. He pointed out that those who left the coastal fringe and went further inland 'gradually drifted back if land was- available for cultivation. He claimed that, so long as land could be obtained within that area, it was futile for us to expect people to go further inland and devote their attention to less promising fields of cultivation. </para>

I am bound to pay some regard to the opinions of those who claim to speak with authority, so long as those opinions are sincerely and honestly expressed. The present Government, realizing the difficulties of the position, and being possessed with a desire to promote closer settlement, propose to experiment with freehold in place of leasehold tenure for certain classes of country. The future alone will disclose the success or failure of that experiment. I cannot see any very great objection to the attempt being made. My friend the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> claimed that this proposal was contrary to the principles which HenTy George advocated.

            <para>- Land nationalization was the ideal of Alfred Russell Wallace. Henry George has shown that there are several weaknesses in that system. In one of his chapters dealing with the land question, he has pointed out that it does not matter very greatly whether you have leasehold or freehold. In effect, he says, " Why bother a'bout leaseholds ; why not continue to attempt to sell and bequeath land in the same way as we are doing at the present time? There is no harm in doing that. If it makes it easier to put the land to its best use, it is as good a principle as any other, provided the privately unearned increment is preserved for the community which owns the land." Stating it briefly, in other words, he said,  ' Why bother about the shell so long as you retain the kernel?" If a system of freehold tenure will bring about closer settlement and the cultivation of the land by giving to those who are using the land a greater sense of security, the experiment is worth trying, provided we adopt Henry George's principle of conserving the rights of the people in the land by taking the fair annual rental value for it. </para>

            <para>- I understand that that is what is proposed. Further, in carrying out the principles of Henry George, the Government should concurrently remove taxes from the production of the people on the land. That is the essential basis of Henry George's doctrine. He does not advocate taking the rental value of the land for public purposes, and in addition, taxing the product of the man on the land ; but his proposal is to relieve the producer of all taxes except the obligation to pay to the community the fair rental value of the land which should provide the fund for government, in lieu of taxation on commerce and industry. </para>

            <para>- Yes, partially; but unfortunately our leasehold system carries with it the disadvantage that the primary producers have to pay numerous burdensome taxes on the things they need for production. That is what Henry George opposes, and I think he is right in opposing it. Unfortunately, we have become obsessed with the idea that the only way to prosperity is to take money out of one pocket and put it in another. </para>

            <para>- But by that method one never gets any farther, or any richer, and both the community and the individual consumer becomes poorer. The Government should be commended, rather than condemned, for making a serious effort to give a sense of greater security to persons who take up land in the Northern Territory. By granting freeholds the Government is trying to solve a vexatious problem, and so long as it conserves the interests of the community by taking the fair annual rental value of the land, there can be no objection to the scheme. </para>

          <para>.- I once travelled with the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Elliot Johnson)</inline> from Darwin southward for  200  miles, and saw no land suitable for closer settlement, except on the banks of the rivers. The difficulty of settling a large country like the Northern Territory arises largely because of the enormous cost of finding markets. For  200  miles south of Darwin, and towards the Gulf of Carpentaria, the greatest hope of development is in mining, but without roads or railways development is impossible. </para>

          <para>- It was rusting for no other reason than that there were no means to get the minerals away. The only way to develop the country is to lease big areas for pastoral purposes, to provide encouragement for mining, and to make provision for transport. Freehold tenure, at the present time, will not promote development. </para>

            <para>- Having stated that Professor Griffiths Taylor has never been to the Northern Territory, I content myself with saying that I support the amendment. Professor Taylor was in the northwest of Western Australia, but he did not go into the Northern Territory, although ho condemned it as an arid country. When  Stefansson,  who went through the country, was asked what he thought of it, he said, in a characteristic reply, " If there is a desert or arid country in Central Australia, all I can say is that I have been through only the oasis of the desert." That is the only reply that any intelligent man, with powers of observation, could give. The lands of the Northern Territory belong, not to the present ruling political party, but to the Australian people, and it is they who have the right to say under which system the land shall be disposed of. If the people are of the opinion that the leasehold system is the best, they should be given the opportunity to say so. We should remember that we are not legislating for the immediate future only, but for posterity - for those who, in the future, will benefit from the public money we are now expending. Seeing that the Commonwealth Government will create the unearned increment, it should have some voice in the disposal of it. With the inflation of land values that automatically occurs under a system of freehold tenure, there comes a time when the price of land is so high that profitable production is impossible. We then find that land can bc used successfully only for the erection of huge buildings. The Government should provide land in the Northern Territory at reasonable prices, under good conditions, with long leases; and that is all the Government should  concern itself about. The leasehold system has been proved to be successful in other parts of Australia, and particularly so in the Federal Capital Territory. A geographical boundary is drawn in the bill. In the tropical zone a holding of 20,000 acres is allowed. It has been argued that the land in the tropical zone of the Northern Territory is not suitable for agricultural production. </para>

            <para>- I am pointing out that the amendment is deserving of special consideration because of the proposal to grant 20,000-acre leases in the tropical zone of the Northern Territory. No provision has been made to prevent men dummying 20,000-acre blocks, and so perpetuating the evils of land monopoly. It is contended that land in the tropical zone is unproductive from an agricultural point of view. I remember when areas of this land were put under rice and yielded as much as 4-0 bushels to the acre. At that time quite a number of settlers asked the Government of the clay to supply them with a rice-cleaning plant, ana guaranteed that each of them would plant not less than 80 acres with rice. The Government would not come to the assistance of those settlers, and that fact, coupled with their isolation, made rice production impossible. Now, in view of the huge expenditure contemplated, it is to be expected that means of transport will be provided which will remedy the isolation of settlers in (the Northern Territory. </para>

It is proposed that a referendum shall shortly be taken on certain questions, and it should not add greatly to the expense of that referendum if an additional question were put to the people at the same time. If they decide to support the freehold system, the Government will be justified in going on with this bill. If, on the other hand, the people decide in favour of the leasehold system the Government should regard their determination as a mandate to retain the land for the people who own it. </para>

          <para>.I rise for the purpose of registering my protest against the passing of this bill. I do not propose to discuss the measure at length. The principles which it is designed to abrogate are principles for which the Labour party has stood during the whole of its political life, for which it has strenuously fought, and which in several particulars it has had put into concrete form in legislation. The principle the Labour party laid down is that the unearned increment in the value of land belongs to the people who gave the land its value. The principle which the party has opposed is that the speculator and land jobber should by placing artificial values on land reap a reward that he never earned. A principle for which the Labour party has fought is that at least the Territories of the Commonwealth should belong to the people of the Commonwealth. The party laid that down and insisted upon it in connexion with the Federal Capital Territory upon which Australia's Capital City is to stand. It laid it down, and insisted upon it in connexion with the 525,000 square miles of the Northern Territory, which make up so large a part of Australia, and which up to the present has belonged to the Commonwealth. The members of the present Government were hardly warm in their places before they proposed to abrogate' these vital principles, and give back to their land-jobbing friends the heritage which belongs to the people of Australia. Apparently they thought that the atmosphere of the House this afternoon was suitable for such a purpose. They have reckoned without their hosts. Although some of us have been engaged elsewhere, it is a matter for congratulation that a number of forceful speeches have been made from this side, which I hope in some measure record the sense of indignation we feel at the introduction of this bill. We have not the numbers to prevent its passage, but we have the responsibility of recording our protest against it, and that we shall do. There is not, and never was, an argument to justify, under any circumstances, handing over the people's lands to private individuals. The lands of this, as of every other country, are the natural heritage of the people. They are the arenas designed by an all-seeing Providence to enable those people to work out their destinies, and the people are entitled only to the fruits which they win from them. Individuals are not entitled to monopolize the surface of the earth. They are not entitled to become jobbers, creating artificial conditions which will produce artificial land values which have no relation whatever to production. </para>

        <para class="block">I have recorded my protest. I conceive this bill to be an outrage upon Australian sentiment.' The House has declined to send it to the people for consideration' by means of a referendum. The Government proposes to pass it by force of numbers, but how many honorable members on the other side have attempted to justify it ? If there are any they have been able to justify it only on the basis of the private claims and greed of individuals as against the general wellbeing of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>. - The bill proposes to eliminate section 11 of the original act, which provides that no Crown lands in the Northern Territory shall be sold. I have listened- with great interest to the speeches of honorable- members, and with much amazement to some of them. The discussion centres in the question whether the Territory shall be opened up under the freehold or the leasehold system. Honorable members opposite have said that, in Queensland - which State, they say, is destined to become one of the greatest, if not the greatest, in the Commonwealth - the leasehold principal obtains, and they have pointed to that State as an example of the wonderful benefits to be derived from that system. Let me take the Queensland figures relating to land settlement under freehold and leasehold. For the ten years prior to the Labour Government taking office, 23,954 applications were made for land, and for the ten years since the Government took office, 12,437 applications. For the ten years prior to the Labour Government taking office, the land in occupation increased by 91,347,000 acres, and for the ten years since the Government took office it decreased by 23,841,000 acres. </para>

            <para>- I am quoting from the report of the Queensland Statistician. Some honorable members allow their feelings to run away with them .when they say that, under the bill, the Government intends to rob the people of their land. The honorable member for  Batman said ' that the people's birthright was to be given away to the Government's land-jobbing friends, who would subdivide the land they acquired and sell it back to the Government for closer., settlement purposes. As, the- Government does not intend to sell the freehold of pastoral lands, how could the land be subdivided and re-sold to the Government? The honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr'. Nelson)</inline> said that the land ought to be cut up into closer settlement areas and leased to the people for sheep-raising purposes in blocks of 500 acres. I ask him what sort of a living could a man make on 500 acres. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> asked whether any of the land in the Territory was at present held under freehold. I "wish to inform him that there are about -600,000 acres held under freehold in small areas. The South Australian Government, many years ago, made land available under the freehold system, in blocks of 320 acres, and for each block taken up the applicant was granted 3 acres of freehold in one of the town areas. I listened with a great deal of interest to the statement of honorable members opposite that the Labour party has always stood for the leasehold system. I would tell them that the Labour party can be likened to the preacher who in the pulpit says, " Do as I say and not as I do." No honorable ' member of this House would take up land on leasehold rather than on freehold, if he intended to settle on it. I ask honorable members opposite to practise what they preach. The natural inclination of any man who wishes to open up country, or to obtain land in the city, is to have a home and a garden plot of his own. We hope to awake in the minds of the workers in the towns of the Northern Territory the desire to obtain 10-acre blocks, 10 miles outside the town limit, on which to plant orchards and vineyards, and in that way  supplement their wages. Honorable members say "  Give  the small man a chance." The Government now proposes to give the small man a chance, and to give the country a chance by the appointment of a commission to administer the Northern Territory. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> asked whether the purchaser of a block would have a right to the minerals found thereunder. The Commonwealth is at present working under the South Australian law respecting minerals in the Territory, and the law is that all minerals found are the property of the Crown. The bill, when passed, will not bring the freehold system into operation; it simply proposes to eliminate section 11 of the original act. The Government will later bring down ordinances which must lie on the table for 30 days. It will be within the rights of honorable members to object to anything contained in those ordinances, and to move to prevent the granting of certain freehold rights to people in the Northern Territory. The same procedure will apply to mining rights. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> asked who were clamouring for the freehold  system. That question might be asked of the honorable member for the Northern Territory, who knows that a considerable number of people in the Territory wish to own their own blocks. </para>

            <para>- I should like to give the land away. I should be prepared to give a block of land to every pioneer who helps to develop the outback country. One honorable member opposite instanced the settlement of returned soldiers by the Queensland Government on a certain area of land, and if his statement is true, the action of the Queensland Government in that case is no credit to it. I do not blame the leasehold system for that; nor do I say that the freehold system would have saved them. The soldiers should never have been settled on land which was unsuitable and bought at a price which precluded the possibility of its being worked profitably. When the soldiers, were starved off their holdings, the Queensland Government did not come to their assistance; the Commonwealth Government had to pay to them sustenance to keep them from the poorhouse. Any man, soldier or civilian, who goes into the country to pioneer new land has a right to  expect  this and every other government to stick to him. </para>

The opportunities to acquire this land already exist. After the war three returned soldiers started from South Australia with a flock of sheep for territory they had selected in the centre of Australia on 30-years' terms. Everybody thought that they were going upon a fool's errand, but they have made good, and paid back every penny they borrowed. Those men embodied the pioneering spirit which this Government wishes to encourage. If we can give to the north of Australia a better chance under freehold conditions, it is our duty to do so. </para>

          <para>.- I assume that the purpose of this bill is to confer greater powers upon the Institute of Science and Industry. Whilst I approve of that, I suggest to the . Prime Minister that, instead of investigating abstruse problems, the solution of which may benefit humanity in the dim future, our scientists would be better employed in the consideration of matters of more immediate concern to the people who provide the money for this research. For instance, the Institute might inquire whether the foods of the people are prepared and distributed under healthy and scientific conditions. In regard to bread, it might ascertain what would be a fair price to allow the farmer for his wheat, and the miller for converting it into flour, and what amount the baker should charge for bread over the counter, independent of any additional charge he may make for delivery and credit. If the preparation and distribution of bread were placed on a sound, economic basis, the producer, the miller, and the baker would each get a fair deal, and the consumer would be protected against exploitation. At the present time the people of Victoria are being strongly advised to eat raisin bread. Are honorable members aware that the addition to a 4-lb. loaf of a handful of raisins, which may be bought wholesale for8d. or 8½d. a lb., raises the price of the loaf from1s. to  2s.? The people are robbed, yet the producer does not receive any benefit. Let the Institute of Science and Industry investigate the question whether preservatives in food are injurious to health. Whilst scientists are not prepared to say that preservatives or chemicals in foods are the cause of cancer, neither the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Neville Howse)</inline> nor the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Nott)</inline> will deny that cancer has become more prevalent since preservatives have been used in food. There may be . other contributory causes, but it is held by dietists that preservatives are a great cause of cancer. If the Institute of Science and Industry clears up that matter it will have expended its funds wisely. Can any honorable member say that colouring matter used in the manufacture of lollies is healthy? If it is not, its use ought to be stopped. Health is the greatest blessing that the human unit can possess. It should be very carefully guarded, and with the assistance of the Institute of Science and Industry it can be very greatly improved. </para>

          <para class="block">This measure amends the Institute of Science and Industry Act 1920, and alters the constitution of the Institute of Science and Industry in several respects. The object of the Government is, not to create a great new centralized institute of research, but, for the benefit of both the primary and secondary industries, to bring about co-operation between existing agencies and to enlist the aid of the pure scientist, the universities, and every other agency at present handling scientific questions. Every honorable member must consider it to be essential for Australia, with its splendid opportunities and difficult problems, to make every endeavour to bring to the solution of those problems whatever assistance science can offer. The only consideration which would deter honorable members from supporting this measure would bt the feeling that it might lead to duplication and the overlapping of effort. I can assure them that the exact opposite will be the result; the bill will in no sense lead to a duplication of the efforts of the States, nor will it bring about any overlapping of scientific research in relation to our industrial or other problems. What we propose is essentia] in a country such as Australia. Recent industrial developments prove that science can greatly assist in bettering the conditions of the workers and in bringing greater prosperity to our people. Those nations which to-day are progressing most rapidly industrially and commercially are enlisting its aid to an extraordinary degree. The United States of America, I believe, lead the world in that respect. Their development has been amazingly rapid. Although the area of that country is slightly less than that of Australia, it carries a population of between 115,000,000 and 120,000,000 people, and yet its problem is how to obtain a sufficient number of workers to take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves. It is freely stated that America could easily absorb another 1.000,000 people to the advantage of the present inhabitants. Seeking a reason for that amazing state of affairs, one realizes what a great part has been played by scientific research. What strikes one most forcibly is that America's efforts m the direction of scientific research are not limited to governments nor even to great associations of employers; individual employers are expending vast sums of money in attempts to improve their methods and generally to advance heir efficiency. Many individual manufacturing corporations maintain their own laboratories for experimental work, and.  employ staffs of trained scientists. The largest concern is the Du Pont de Nemours Company, which has 250 chemists engaged on experimental  work  throughout the year. The Pennsylvania Railway Company has no fewer than 361 scientists employed in its testing laboratory, and the General Electric Company has 150. The first cost of the laboratories of these great manufacturing corporations or transport agencies was as high as £100,000, and the annual cost of some of them runs to a figure equally great. In all there are over 30 large laboratories belonging to individual firms, and a score of associations of manufacturers are engaged in work of- a similar nature. An extraordinarily interesting feature of the position in America is that, although these great research activities are conducted by individual firms or associations, almost without exception the utilization of their discoveries is not confined to their particular business. These discoveries are made known to the industry generally on the principle that the improvement of its efficiency benefits all concerned. We can learn a great deal from America in that respect.. The National Canners' Association spends about £10,000 a year, and, connected with almost every industry in America there are associations which are carrying out research work for the benefit of their members. This covers a wide field of activity, and applies to lumber, paint, woollens, paper, refrigeration, dairying, cement, tiles, bricks, and almost every other product that can be mentioned. It is notable, also, that American industries are co-operating with the universities. Great industrial enterprises send their problems to the universities to be investigated by pure scientists, and thus science is being applied to the solution of industrial problems. In addition, there are institutions of a public or semi-public character, like the Mellon Institute, which is associated with the University of Pittsburg. In that institute there are no fewer than 80 highly-trained research fellows, who are carrying out work on selected subjects. Research fellowships are given to men who are selected by an industry, and those men go into the institute to solve, or attempt to solve, particular problems. Generally, they are afterwards absorbed into the industry, and, naturally, they raise its standard and assist its scientific development. . We have done a little in this country in promoting standardization, but some persons have been appalled at hearing that the Government ought to spend £2,000 to assist the work. Within the limited means at its disposal, the Standards Association in Australia has done valuable work. But its activities should be extended. The Bureau of American Standards occupies buildings which cost £300,000, and its annual expenditure is about £460,000. All that money is being spent to bring about standardization, which is regarded there as essential. One can readily realize how  much  can be saved by standardization. We often fritter away time, money, and energy in producing ten articles when, if we had standardization, one would do equally well. With standardization we could reduce capital expenditure and overhead charges, and at the same time enormously increase production and efficiency. We must undertake research work, and the time is over-ripe for it. I cannot now speak of all the activities of America, but I must mention the Carnegie Institute, which has an endowment of £4,500,000, and innumerable other institutions are carrying out similar work. Before the war Great Britain's activities in this direction were not so great as one would have desired, but there has been, within recent years, with the more intense competition that has followed the war, a realization of the need for research work. Machinery has been established, and is being rapidly extended, for carrying out valuable industrial and general research work. The problem is being dealt with differently in Great Britain and America, and there is something to be learned from a comparison of the two methods. In America there is great activity, but no real co-ordination of effort. Great Britain is attempting co-operation from the top, and that should be our aim, for in this direction the Commonwealth Government can give particularly useful assistance. The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in Great Britain was established in 1917, a year before the war closed, and a fund of £1,000,000 for the endowment of research associations was created by the Government, and has grown considerably since. The expenditure of the </para>
          <para class="block">British Government for the co-ordination of industrial research work, and for carrying out such work, has nearly doubled in the last three years, and during the current year will probably reach £550,000. The department is endeavouring to stimulate industrial research by manufacturers and associations of manufacturers, and has already promoted the formation of 25 associations of manufacturers to deal with different phases of industrial problems by bringing scientific methods to bear upon them. The British Government is also endowing university research work, and in 1924 made 258 grants, totalling £35,000, for that purpose. Evidence of the development of thought on this subject in Great Britain is contained in the recent report oi' the Coal Commission. In dealing with the troubles in the coal industry the commission recommended that for a period of seven years an average sum of £50,000 annually should be set aside for scientific investigations into problems associated with the industry. Japan, which has experienced probably a more phenomenal industrial growth than any other country, is spending £300,000 on a national laboratory. The Indian Forestry Department is known throughout the world ; it is carrying out valuable research work relating to forestry and limbers. Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa - our sister dominions - are trying to do something effective in the same direction. </para>
          <para>I shall not deal exhaustively with the bill, but I wish to say a word about the Institute of Science and Industry, which was created in 1920. The bill alters the basis of the original proposal. While the institute did not realize all the hopes entertained of it, it is wrong to suggest that it has done nothing. It has done quite a large amount of valuable work, but disappointment has been felt because the aims and ambitions of those who created it were probably too large to be realized in practice. The money provided for it was not sufficient to enable it to function successfully. T hope that on the present occasion we shall remove both these weaknesses in the scheme by not attempting to do too much, and by ensuring that for the next few years it will be impossible for the institute to be starved, and its activities rendered of no value. I should like to refer to some of the work which the institute in its present form has done, because </para>
          <para class="block">I think there has been a considerable amount of quite unjust criticism of it. I admit that it has not done all that was anticipated; but it has still done very valuable work, for which it is entitled to credit. </para>

              <para>- That is so. It has done very valuable work in connexion with the manufacture of paper pulp from Australian timber. It has done good biological work in the control of the prickly " pear, and it has, I think, successfully solved the problem of " bunchy top " in bananas. . Certainly the institute has not been a complete failure, as some people would suggest, but I think that every one recognizes that the time has come when it should be re-organized and placed upon a different basis. The Government, feeling that very strongly, last year summoned a conference of scientists, industrialists, and representatives of the commercial community. That conference was held in Melbourne, and made certain recommendations. The Government also invited <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Heath, who is at the head of the British Research Council, to visit Australia. He was in Australia for some three or four months at the end of last year and the beginning of the present year. He made a most valuable report to the Commonwealth Government, and to a considerable extent the proposals I am now bringing forward are based upon that report, which honorable members have had an opportunity of reading. </para>

The position as existing under the present act is to be completely altered. The whole of the control of the institute under the existing act is in the hands of the Director. By the new proposal it is contemplated placing the control of the institute in the hands of a Central Council, which will be the body advising the Minister. There will also be created six State committees. </para>

              <para>- I do not think there is ' any question of that. The Central Council will be composed of three members appointed by the Commonwealth Government, and the  chairman  of each of the State committees. These nine will form a body to advise the Government on all questions requiring scientific investigation. In addition to these nine members, additional members, whose assistance may be required because of their special scientific knowledge, can be co-opted. The reason for this is that it might be found that the Central Council did not include a representative of some particular branch of scientific research which it would be most desirable to have represented on the council. For example, there might be no biologist amongst them, and it is essential that there should be a biologist upon an advisory council of this sort. Under the bill it" will be possible for the Central Council to secure the assistance of a biologist, or any other scientist whose help it would be desirable to have. </para>

              <para>- That will be made quite clear during the consideration of the bill. Of the Central Council of nine the three members appointed by the Commonwealth Government will form the executive. They will not be permanent, but part-time officials, but it is proposed that they should be paid fees,, and should advise the Minister on all questions. It is not contemplated that the Central Council shall be called together more than once or twice a year. A period of the year when it will probably be called together will be the month of March, when the whole council will meet to prepare the estimates and programme for the forthcoming year. Apart from that annual meeting at which the general policy of the institute will be laid down, and the estimates for the forthcoming year prepared, it is not contemplated that the full council shall meet except in extraordinary circumstances, when some particular problem arises upon which it is necessary to arrive at a decision. In ordinary circumstances the work of the council will be carried on by the three executive members appointed by the Government. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The Government is extremely fortunate in having obtained the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius,</inline> an engineer, of Sydney, to act as  chairman,  and with him <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Newbigin,  and Professor Rivett of the Melbourne University, who have agreed to act as representatives of the Government on the Central Council. That council will deal with the general programme, the budget, and the activities generally of the institute. It must determine the programme of work. It is not contemplated that research work will be carried out by the institute, but that it will be undertaken wherever the best facilities exist for carrying it out. For instance, the problem with regard to fuel waste would probably be best dealt with in Western Australia, and the Western Australian committee would be responsible for carrying out the work which the council determined should be carried out in that State. It is necessary that the institute should co-operate; but I wish to make it clear that research work wall be carried out in existing institutions, such as the universities of the States, and I am confident that we shall get the most cordial co-operation, from the States. </para>

The State committees will have power to bring forward problems which they consider should be dealt with by the council, and where research work is being carried out in their own States, they will be responsible to the council for it. In this I think there is the germ of a scheme which should ensure the co-operation of the entire community. </para>

              <para>- Three members will be nominated by the Governments of the respective States, from the staffs of their scientific and technical departments, and three other members will be what might be called pure scientists. Probably they will be members of the staffs of the State universities. These six members, with a  chairman,  to be appointed by the Governor-General, will co-opt two or three more so as to make each committee thoroughly representative and efficient. Several of the State Premiers have indicated that they are prepared to co-operate in the scheme, and to afford every assistance. The actual functions of the State committees are set out in the bill. The purpose of the committees will be to advise the council as to the problems to be investigated. If a committee is directly interested in any problem affecting its State, it will investigate it, form its own conclusions regarding it, and make a recommendation to the council that research work upon it should be undertaken in the next year's programme. It will also be the function of the State committees to keep in touch, and to cooperate with the various other bodies which may be interested in a particular work; to assist the council in organizing the work carried out in the States, and to make inquiries and to furnish reports on matters referred to it by the council. If the executive requires further information from any State, it may utilize the State committee, and get the assistance required. </para>

          <para>But when we embark upon a campaign of scientific research, unless we have trained scientists to carry out the work, we are not likely to get very far. It is regrettable that we have already lost the services of so many of the best men trained in our universities. Our objective, in launching this scheme, is to ensure that we shall have the assistance of men trained in Australia, and retain their services for this country. </para>
          <para>The only other point to which I desire to refer now is the proposed change of the name of the " Institute of Science and Industry" to "Council for Scientific and Industrial Research." We are making the change because we believe it will more truly indicate the functions of the new body. It is to be a council for scientific and industrial research. A further reason for the change is that the corresponding body in Great Britain is known as the " Department of Scientific and Industrial Research," and the Canadian body is styled " The Advisory Council of Scientific and Industrial Research." These bodies are receiving general recognition in other countries, and as we propose that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research shall have similar functions, it is very desirable that the name should be similarly recognized for the character of its work. </para>

              <para>- Certainly. If a certain line of scientific research is thought desirable, the need for it will be brought before the council. The council will then investigate the matter, and request the committee in the State concerned to go into the whole question and advise what course should be adopted. </para>

              <para>- That is so. Admirable work is being done by the Standards Association. The council has given much consideration to immediate problems, and I think that the House will be interested to know what lines its investigations will take. It is considered that immediate investigation should be made regarding liquid fuels, cold storage, and the preservation of foodstuffs, forest products, animal diseases and pests, plant diseases and pests, and fruit-growing problems. All these matters are already receiving the consideration of the executive. Certain estimates in regard to them will, probably, be embodied in the general Estimates for the forthcoming year, so that an immediate start may be made. Every one will recognize that liquid fuel, for example, is an important subject of investigation. Unfortunately we have no indigenous oil supply, and consequently are importing 90,000,000 gallons of petrol a year. There is a wonderful possibility before us if we can find a solution of the liquid fuel problem. The institute up to the present has unquestionably suffered considerably owing to insufficiency of funds for its work. When an effort is being made to stimulate scientific research in  relation to  the problems of industry, and the best scientists of the country are showing a sincere desire to help to overcome our difficulties, it is most undesirable that their labours, which may have cost, perhaps, £10,000, should be lost because of the exigencies of a particular treasurer. The council might be on the brink of finding the solution of an important problem, requiring only an expenditure of £1,000 or £2,000 to complete its investigations, and its efforts would be defeated if the Treasurer of the day decided that no further money could bo made available to it. To obviate such. &amp; position, it ib provided in the bill that for the purposes of scientific and industrial investigation, in pursuance of this measure, there shall be appropriated from the Consolidated Revenue Fund the sum of £250,000. It is not contemplated' to expend that sum in one year. That amount should carry the institute on for some time; but the money will be placed in a trust fund, where it will be available for the purposes of the council. To ensure that full parliamentary control shall be exercised over the expenditure of this money, it is provided that nothing shall be spent from the trust account except in accordance with estimates of expenditure approved by Parliament. The council will meet and prepare its budget for the following year, putting down the amount it considers desirable for the research that is being done. Those estimates will be presented to the Minister, and if he approves of them they will be embodied in the general Estimates submitted to Parliament. If they are passed by Parliament, the money will immediately be made available out of the trust fund. That will avoid any possibility of a treasurer, through financial stress, curtailing the expenditure of the council at a time when it may need the full amount of its estimates to carry on its investigations. The sum of £250,000 will ensure that during the next three or four years there shall be a ' fund available for a serious effort to deal with our industrial scientific problems. I am confident that the council's work will in four or five years' time be so obviously beneficial that no one will have the courage to attempt to destroy it. The bill should generally commend itself to the House. Every honorable member must be desirous that a serious effort, should be made, with the assistance of science, to solve the great problems now hampering industrial development. I believe that the bil! provides for this. It will prevent overlapping and duplication, and with the assistance of our scientists, we shall achieve a result that may go far beyond what can be anticipated at present. </para>

          <para class="block">That the bill be now read a second time. </para>
          <para class="block">This is a short bill providing for the appropriation of the sum of £100,000, which was set aside last year for the purposes of the Institute of Science and Industry. It is proposed that, so far as practicable, this sum shall remain untouched, and that the interest upon it shall be employed for the purposes set out in the bill. As I pointed out in introducing the previous bill, Australia has not nearly a sufficient number of trained scientists for research work, and it will be impossible to obtain them unless some assistance is offered to young men who may be prepared to train themselves for such work. The proposal in the bill is. that the income from this amount shall be employed in giving assistance by way of scholarships, at universities in Australia or abroad or at any institution where training can be obtained in particular branches of science. 'The bill arises out of a suggestion by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Heath, who in his report to me, and in his remarks to most people to whom he spoke, emphasized the great necessity for definite steps to enable Australia to procure the services of the requisite trained scientists. He made the suggestion that as the Government bad set aside the sum of £100,000, the money could be employed in no better way than in creating an endowment fund, the income of which would be used to assist those who were prepared to take up research work, by enabling them to obtain the necessary further training. Under the bill it is provided that the funds shall consist of - </para>

          </list>
          <para class="block">A number of leading citizens have recognized the need for men trained in research work, and have desired an opportunity to contribute towards this worthy object. It is felt that the bill will give them an opportunity to make gifts or bequests for the purposes of the fund. The trustees will be the executive committee of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, appointed by the Commonwealth Government. One of the things it is proposed to do by means of this endowment is to send abroad for further research work men who have had distinguished university  careers.  They will each receive £300 a year for two years, and an additional £150 for the payment of fares abroad, and the undertaking will be required of them that, after they have , completed their course, they will return to Australia and give their services to the council  for  a stated period. The idea of having an endowment fund providing a regular and certain income, and enabling the work of the institute to be carried on independent of the needs of the Treasurer of. the day must appeal to honorable members. This will encourage young men to take up the study of science, because they will have good prospects . for the future and the assistance necessary to enable them to carry on their work. It will also prevent Australia from losing so many young and brilliant men as it has lost in the past. I commend the measure to the cordial support of honorable members generally. </para>
