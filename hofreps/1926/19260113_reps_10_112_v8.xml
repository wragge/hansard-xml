      </quote>
      <para>Those who  have been  for  many  years members, of  this  House are well  aware  of the  qualifications  of the  honorable  member for Darling Downs, but I  remind  those  honorable  members who are new. to  the  House  that  he  has been  a  member  of this Parliament ever since its' first session. He has held many and various portfolios in many and various Ministries, and never at any time in his long career has there been the slightest whisper of suspicion about. or reflection upon his honour and integrity as a public man. His extended experience has given him, perhaps, a wider knowledge of the rules and procedure of Parliament than is possessed by any other member of this House. He possesses a judicial mind and will, I am confident, discharge the duties of presiding officer with strict impartiality. I think I am justified in saying that he is the ideal man for the position of Speaker. </para>

          <para>.- I rise to enter my protest against the nomination of the honorable member for Darling Downs for the position of  Speaker.  The present personnel of this House is the result of an appeal to the country upon certain legislation and Ministerial acts which were based upon the Government's interpretation of the Constitution. The Government acted upon the advice of men occupying high positions, who were supposed to understand the Constitution. Upon the issue placed before them by the Government, in accordance with the legal advice of these gentlemen, the people voted ; but after the election the High . Court declared that the legislation passed by the last Parliament, at the instance of the Government, and the acts of Ministers thereunder, were <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> The Government then found it necessary to shift from the position of the Attorney-General the Minister who had given the misleading advice, and to appoint another lawyer to do the job in the hope that a second mistake would  be avoided. To elevate the disrated man to .the position of  Speaker  of this Parliament will be to do an injustice to the community. To some extent, I concur in what was said by the honorable member for Warringah regarding the qualifications of the aspirant to this office, but those qualifications do npt give him a right to the position. Technically, the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Speaker</inline>is elected by the House, but actually the election has been cut and dried in caucus in accordance with the terms of the pact between the parties supporting the Ministry, and at the right time something may well be said about- the honour of pacts. The honorable member for Darling Downs has been nominated by a Nationalist, and. the nomination, has been seconded by a member of the Country party, so we may regard his election as assured. The point I am emphasizing is that no sooner . was the election over, and the constitutional position in regard to deportation declared by the High Court, than the honorable member for Darling Downs retired from the position of Attorney-General, in which he had made such a mess of things. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member, who is so obsessed with thoughts of bolshevism and communism, and can see nothing but those forces- overwhelming the Commonwealth, and dismembering the Empire, had a duty as a legal member of this Parliament to point out to the Government the mistake it was making in connexion with the deportation proceedings. He has legal knowledge and experience, and draws a high fee from the country for making his knowledge available to this Parliament, but when the Government was in need of some advice, the honorable member was found wanting. I voice the view of the class I represent, and I know well that if a man working at Canberra, or on the north-south line, made a huge blunder, he would be "fired" immediately instead of being transferred to a sheltered position. The nomination of the honorable member for Darling Downs for the position of  Speaker  is an affront to the community; it is immoral. After his long years of office, I should have thought that the honorable member would have been content to retire to the back benches, and there ponder over the mistake which led to a lowering of his political status.  His  resignation from the Ministry was not unexpected by me. I have been waiting for the resignation of another gentleman who was concerned in that bungle; it has not occurred yet, but in future when we quote the <inline font-style="italic">Annotated Constitution,</inline> we shall not refer to the authors of it as "Quick. and Garran," but as " Quick and the dead." I object to the nomination, and shall vote against the motion. </para>

          <para>. - I agree with a good deal that the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> has said respecting the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom).</inline> He is respected by every honorable member of the House. He has always been courteous and obliging, and has shown himself anxious to give the best advice possible on all matters submitted to him. But he has my sympathy this morning. It is not right that the Government should seek to shelter itself behind him, nor that it should try tq. hide its mistakes by displacing him from the Attorney-Generalship. He gave certain advice, which the Government accepted. If the advice was wrong, the Government made a mistake in accepting it. It is not an elevation of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom to take him from the Attorney-Generalship and make him  Speaker.  I look upon what is proposed as a slight put upon him. The honorable gentleman who took <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom's place in the Ministry gave the Government exactly the same advice as his predecessor.  I  well remember him doing so from his place on the cross benches opposite. He went as far as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom, if not farther. He said that the Deportation Bill was quite constitutional, and quoted statutes and precedents in support of his contention. If <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom made a mistake, so did the present Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham).</inline> I do not suggest that any Minister is infallible. </para>

            <para>- I do not. In this case the High Court has given a liberal interpretation of the Constitution, whereas the advisers of the Government gave it a narrow interpretation. When the life and liberty of the subject are at stake, the Constitution should be interpreted liberally. In the past we have complained of decisions of the High Court. We have contended that it should have been more liberal in its interpretations. The freest and widest possible interpretation of the Constitution should be given when the liberty of the subject is at stake. If the men who were arrested, under the Deportation Act committed a crime, surely our ordinary legal machinery is adequate to deal with them. It ought not to be necessary to pass a special act and to stretch the provisions of the Constitution to punish their offence. This was done simply to give the Government an election cry. We know that very well. The party to which  I  belong is suffering for it at present, and we believe that the whole country will suffer for it later on; but we shall bear our sufferings cheerfully, for we know that ultimately our time will come. In agreeing to take the Speakership, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom is saving the face of the Government. If I had been in his place and had been asked to retire from the Attorney-Generalship - the next position in the Cabinet to that of the Prime Minister - and to accept the Speakership, I should certainly have declined. Speak1 ing personally, I look upon <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom as a friend. I believe that he has the friendship of every honorable member. He will have difficulty in fulfilling" the duties of  Speaker  with the dignity and success of the last  Speaker,  but I believe that he will do his utmost to be courteous and kind to honorable members generally. It has been stated that he is in ill health, and that for this reason he retired from the Attorney-Generalship. I trust that his health may improve, and that we may have the pleasure of seeing him smiling at us with his usual cordiality from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> chair. Seeing that the Government has seen fit to remove <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom from the Attorney-Generalship, I should like to know whether it proposes to re-organize the Attorney-General's Department. The officers of the department have given the Government bad advice. It cannot be expected that the Attorney-General shall devote the whole of his time to preparing legal opinions for the Government. If there was* anything wrong with the constitutionality of the Deportation Act, there is something wrong with the department. If there was anything wrong with the drafting of the bill, there is something wrong with the department. What has <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran to say about the matter ? He is the public servant who should be the guiding star of the Cabinet &gt;n constitutional matters. Every bill thai, has come from the Attorney-General's Department lately, especially those dealing with taxation matters, has needed amending, in consequence of faulty drafting, a month or two after Parliament has passed it. This is the fault of the Attorney-General's Department. The department should be thoroughly overhauled, so that we might be able to place SOme reliance on its work. I regret very much that the ex-Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> has been slighted by the Government, and I regard this proposal as a sop. The Government, by offering him the Speakership, is trying to heal the wound that it has inflicted by removing him from the AttorneyGeneralship. </para>

          <para>. - I very much regret that certain things have been said this morning. Our present business is to determine which of our number shall hold during this Parliament the high and dignified office of  Speaker.  I had no intention of speaking on the matter, but I feel that I must do so in justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom. It is quite obvious that two honorable members who have spoken this morning are under a misapprehension.  U has been suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom was asked to retire from the Government because of a certain decision of the High </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Court. I endeavoured to correct that mistake while the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> was speaking, but I was not able to do so. The honorable member said that he desired to be fair, and I, therefore, ask him to call to mind the exact facts of the case. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom intimated to me on the 5th December, six days before the High Court judgment had been delivered, that he wished to be relieved of his portfolio. This fact has been published, and is public knowledge. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom had held office in various Ministries for a longer period, probably, than any other Minister with one exception.  His  desire to retire had nothing whatever to do with any judgment of the High Court. I should like honorable members to bear in mind that later on there will be ample opportunity to discuss the High Court judgment and the very wide constitutional questions that are associated with it. In determining this question, however, I hope that all opinions as to whether the Government acted wisely or not in connexion with the deportation legislation will be put on one side. To-day we are electing a  Speaker,  and the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> has intimated that he is prepared to accept the position. Honorable members should, in considering the question before them, pay no regard to any opinions they may have as to how far the legal advisers of the Government - were wrong in connexion with the Deportation Act, and how far the decision of the High Court in this matter was a reversal of its previous decisions. I ask the House to accept my assurance that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom's retirement had nothing to do with the decision of the High Court </para>

          <para>. - I cannot blame the Prime Minister for defending the proposal, or others for criticizing it. On many occasions in the past I have defined my attitude to the Speakership. Instead of the  Speaker  being elected and removed from the turmoil of politics for three years, he should be elected every session. The constituents of an honorable member who is elected  Speaker  ought not to be deprived of his services for as long as three years. I welcome the ex-Speaker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> back to the political arena. He will no doubt recollect that I objected to his taking the Speakership, and that I said that the subsequent political history of those who became Speakers reminded me of the words, <inline font-style="italic">Hie</inline><inline font-style="italic">jacet</inline> so  often  found upon tombstones. I am glad that  he  did not write  the end  of his political career in accepting  the  Speakership, and I hope  that he  will add another to the only exception that we have had in Victoria to the general rule. Only one  Speaker  in this State - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Bent - afterwards rose to political greatness. From Attorney-General to  Speaker  is certainly a descent. A  Speaker  is required to hold the scales fairly, and I am certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom will, do so. I have always found him a courteous, studious gentleman in every sense of the word, and I regret that he is leaving the turmoil '.f politics. The Prime Minister stated, correctly, that his resignation was received before the decision of the High Court was announced, but the Prime Minister knows that what the decision would be was common knowledge throughout Australia at that time. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline>Garran at least' should be taken to task. I would dare the Prime Minister, or any other honorable member, to support publicly the gift of £1,000 to that gentleman and other officers of the Attorney-General's Department. That gift was authorized by the Prime Minister, and notified in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette.</inline> Who on earth reads the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette</inline> ? The voice of the man who drew public , attention to it cannot now. be raised here; he has been silenced by the vituperative, slanderous, and lying efforts of the press, supported by the money-power of this country. I have never had any time for Johnson, Walsh, and Garden, whom the Government has used as bogies to frighten the people. Honorable members opposite have come back m their numbers, but I cannot believe that they all accept the lies that the press and the wealthy section of the community uttered during the election. If this Government will bring about one desirable reform, namely, the establishment of the initiative, referendum, and recall, I shall be glad to leave politics. I should like to put to the country the question, " Which is right, the High Court judgment, or the mean, contemptible attacks on the liberty of men who, at all events, are British <inline font-style="italic">1 "</inline> Would any member of the Ministry care to face the electors and say, " I support all the lies that have been uttered about these three men ? " In my 37 years' experience of political life I have not seen a Government placed in a more despicable position by a judgment of. the High Court, and I thank Heaven that there is a High Court. It is said that the Prime Minister intends to go forward with his deportation policy, but if he will take the advice of one who, at all events, tries to be an honest opponent, he will now drop the subject, and regard the rights of citizenship as sacred. At present fie is proposing to build on a foundation that may be used by his successors, and then it may be his turn to thank Heaven that there is a High Court. </para>

          <para>.- I do not propose to oppose the election of the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> as the  Speaker  of this House, my main reason being that I feel certain that any such opposition would not be effective. Although the honorable member is at the present moment seated among us in sartorial simplicity,- I am confident that the upholsterers are already actively engaged in preparing the garniture which we shall shortly see adorning him, and which will contribute so much to his dignity and beauty, as well as to his material warmth and general comfort during the months of January and February in which the House will be in session. I can only hope that when he assumes the robes of his high' office he will succeed in looking a little less ferocious than his immediate predecessor. Of his predecessors it is perhaps fitting that I should say a word or two. I shall go no farther back than to my amiable and honorable friend, the member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Elliot Johnson),</inline> who has pursued the path of greatness, from the throne to the bathroom, at the behest of the Nationalist party. Referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom's immediate predecessor, . I must say that in following him <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom will be required to live up to a very high standard of excellence. The  Speaker  of the last Parliament, the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> was nearly always fair, and, when he could not see his way to be fair, he was entertaining. I am very glad that he finds himself impelled to resume his position in the fighting ranks of Parliament to give effect to the emphatic mandate which he has recently received from the pawnbrokers of St. Kilda. It has been suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom will not be elevated by his election to the position of  Speaker,  but that he will be - to quote an honorable colleague and coin a word - "delevated" to that high office. With that view I do not agree, because I can see no reason why the Government should penalize <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom for having given advice which, though bad from the legal point of view, helped it to win the election. It would be an act of base ingratitude - and, in this connexion, I can appreciate the indignation of the Prime Minister - for one who had rendered such distinguished service to the. Government in its hour of trial to be disrated after the Government had gathered the fruits of his advice. And, in any case, why should one honorable member be displaced by another whose advice was equally bad? It must be consoling to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom to cast his eye along the brilliant phalanx of legal talent on his side of the Chamber, and to know that, without exception, they concurred in the unsound advice which  he gave to the Government. I have always made it a matter of duty to defend, to the best of my ability, that profession of which I am an inconspicuous member, even, though the darts and arrows have been thrown sometimes by honorable members on this side of the House, and I regret that recent occurrences- in Federal politics have not made my task any easier in this respect. The present circumstances remind me strongly of an analogous case in which a person consulted an eminent surgeon regarding the state of his health, only to be told that his case was not one for a surgeon, but for a plumber. Among the members of the Labour party in this House, we have some tradesmen, and, in future, when intricate and involved constitutional questions arise, I shall be very deferential to any views which they may express regarding them. Having no desire to further delay the proceedings, I repeat that L do not agree with those who have suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline><inline font-style="italic">Groom,</inline> by his election  to the Speaker's chair, is to be disrated or relegated to the place of general ablutions; rather do I hold that he is about to be honoured and given a well deserved reward for his services. It has been stated that his elevation will enable him to enjoy a rest from the more strenuous duties of a ministerial position, but in this connexion I utter a word of warning. If <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom seeks a rest, it is possible that he will not obtain it while occupying the Speaker's chair. I regretfully admit that we on this side . are somewhat short-handed, but I assure honorable members that, notwithstanding that handicap, our output during the coming session will be not less than heretofore. I do not think I need add anything further, except to pay my tribute to the personal qualities of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom. I have known him for many years, during which we have both been members of this House, and I have  a very high opinion of him personally. Indeed, I have not so poor an opinion of him as a lawyer as have some members on the other side of the chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom is a genial and friendly man; he does not easily make enemies, and, in the discharge of the responsible duties of his high office as  Speaker  of this House, I am sure that he will be absolutely fair to all honorable members. When I said just now that i did not offer any opposition to his election as  Speaker,  only because any opposition on my part would not be effective, I must be understood to mean that I regarded this matter as having been already settled elsewhere - although a pretence is now made of consulting honorable members on this side - and that, therefore, it would be useless for us to oppose the nomination. I hope that in the discharge of his high office he will enjoy sustained good health. So far as I am concerned, I shall lend him all the help I can, consistent with the performance of my distinguished and onerous duties as one of the members of a reduced Opposition. </para>

From the day when she landed in Great Britain to become the bride of King Edward VII., she endeared herself to the people of Britain and the Empire by her kindliness, generosity, and sympathy with every class and section of the community. We remember with gratitude the wonderful work of Queen Alexandra during the tragic years of the Great War. In every endeavour in every walk of life for the elevation, help, and encouragement of the people, she played a foremost part, and throughout her life she was accorded the heartfelt homage of all the people of the British Empire. To  His  Majesty the King and to all the other members of the Royal Family we desire to extend our sincere sympathy.

        <para class="block">Parliament, and  our  sympathy with  those whom  they  have  left behind.  The  frequency  of these occasions emphasizes the trials of the service rendered in the Parliament  of  this country,  and  the  great  strain  which political life places  upon  those who undertake it. For  a  considerable time the honorable  gentleman whose death we mourn  to-day had not been in robust health, but the announcement of his death on the eve of the general election came as a shock to all of us. It was a matter of particular sorrow to those who had been associated with him in this Parliament; but even amongst the outside public, who knew him only by reputation, there was general regret. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonald</inline> had a very long and honorable career in the public life of Australia, commencing in 1893 when he first entered the Parliament of Queensland. At the advent of federation he entered federal politics, and at the time of his death he was one of the few remaining members of the first Commonwealth Parliament. "With his passing, another link with that historic assembly has gone. Throughout' his parliamentary career he played a very  active  part.  He was a Temporary Chairman  of Committees in the first Commonwealth Parliament- from 1901 to 1904. During the  years  1905  and  1906  he served  on  a  select committee and also on a royal commission. In 1906 he was elected Chairman of Committees, a position he held until 1910, when he became Speaker.  That high position he occupied for a total  period of six years - first from 1910 to 1913, and then from 1914 to 1917. During his occupancy of that high office he did much to add to its dignity and honour. He upheld the great traditions pf British Parliaments, and earned the respect and regard of h'onorable members on all sides of the House. Those brief facts show how strenuous was his public career.  His  was a continuous record of honorable service of which any man might well be proud, bub the continuity and strenuousness of his service probably hastened his death. This House feels deeply his loss, and desires to express to his widow and daughter its deep sympathy. I  hope that the knowledge of the extent to  which his public services were appreciated will help to comfort them in the period of sorrow through which they are now passing. </para>

          <para>. - I join with the Prime Minister in deploring that so often in recent years occasion has arisen for motions of this description. Two gentlemen who were members of the first Federal Parliament, .both of whom were nominated at the recent election, and one of whom was returned, have been prevented by death from taking part in the proceedings of the House to-day. The death-roll of this Parliament during the last eleven or twelve years has been very heavy. To-day we are mourning the loss of one who was a colleague and personal friend of mine. He was a member of this House from its inception, and throughout his long public life gave of his best in the interests of his country. All honorable members will agree that the late Charles McDonald, worked strenuously. He had strong convictions, and was unwavering in ohern, but withal he was kind and considerate, and allowed to every other honorable member the right to differ from him. He ' held many positions in this House, and as presiding officer for six years discharged his duties in a wholly satisfactory and efficient manner. For a considerable period he experienced bad. health, and no greater testimony to his worth could be found than the fact that although his physical disabilities prevented him from taking as active a part in parliamentary life as he had formerly done, the electors continued faithful to him. I hope that the knowledge that the deceased gentleman lived a useful life, and was respected by every member of the House and the community generally, will be of some consolation to his sorrowing widow and daughter, and the other members of his family. </para>

        <para class="block">The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Austin</inline> Chapman was another of the few remaining members of the first Commonwealth Parliament. He had been a member of this House continuously from the time of its inception until the hour of his death. On this, the first, day of the first session of the tenth Parliament, we are assembled under a very real cloud of gloom, because only last night <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Austin</inline> Chapman passed . away. In ordinary circumstances he would have been with us to-day ; instead, we have the knowledge that he is no more.  His  death is so recent that it is difficult to say all that one feels in regard to him. For some time a Ministerial colleague of mine, he was a man for whom I had the greatest possible respect, and even affection. He had made for himself, in some respects, an almost unique position in this House. Although for many years he had suffered from serious physical infirmities, he bore them heroically, and never allowed them to interfere with his work in this Parliament.  His  courage evoked the admiration of all honorable members, and created in our hearts a very great affection for him.  His  passing has also ended a very long and continuous career in the public life of Australia. He was first elected to the Parliament of New South Wales, in 1891-. He remained a member of that assembly until he became a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament on the inception of Federation. Early in that Parliament he attained Ministerial rank, as Minister for Defence, which position he held in the years 1903 - and 1904. Other Ministerial offices which he held were : Postmaster-General, from 1905 to 1907; Minister for Trade and Customs in 1907 and 1908, and again in 1923. He retained his last portfolio .until his retirement, on account of ill health, in May, 1924. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Austin</inline> Chapman's name will always be associated in our minds with certain great reforms which he continually strove to achieve. He was a very keen advocate of progress in our postal service generally.  His  name will always be associated with the advocacy of penny postage for Australia. He also rendered great service in connexion with the provision of old-age and invalid pensions, for which a great many indigent men and women have had, and many still have, cause to bless his name, and thank him. He was a notably vigorous advocate of the early removal of the Seat of the Commonwealth Government from Melbourne to Canberra, for which he worked strenuously and continuously. It is a matter of very great regret to all of us that, although we are so close to the establishment of the Federal Capital at Canberra, he was not spared to see the accomplishment of the project, and to join us in our new home there. We all have the feeling that, through the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Austin</inline> Chapman, we have lost a sincere friend and a loyal comrade, and we sorrow because he is no longer among us to take the active part which he formerly took in the public affairs of Australia. We trust that the appreciation and honour in which he waa held by those who were associated with him in this Parliament, by all who knew him in public life, and by many who never met him personally, may do something to temper the grief of his wife and family during the sad time through which they are passing. </para>

          <para>.- I endorse the sentiments expressed by the right honorable the Prime Minister. I have followed the public career of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Austin</inline> Chapman for a very long time - long before I entered political life. T well remember when he was first elected to the Parliament of New South Wales. At that time - before the Labour party was formed  -  I was a very strong protectionist. I was much attracted by the politics of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Austin</inline> Chapman, though then I had not met him. Some years later, I had the privilege of meeting him, and ever after we were the best of personal friends. I differed a good deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Austin</inline> Chapman in politics, but I always admired him as a man. He never permitted political differences to interfere with the administration of the various departments which he controlled. He was uniformly fair and just. That, I consider to be a fine tribute to be able to pay to a mau who was for so long in public life. He played a prominent part in the affairs of this country, and as the Prune Minister stated, ho was a keen advocate of the early removal of the seat of the Federal Government to Canberra. I sincerely regret that he was not spared to participate in that event, but I suggest that when the Government is established at Canberra, it should do something to commemorate his memory. My sympathy, and 1 believe the sympathy of every honorable member of this House, goes out to his wife and family in their sad bereavement. I trust that it will be some consulation to them to know that their husband and father had the good wishes and respect of every member of this Parliament and of the people of Australia. That he was highly respected in his own district was eloquently shown by the majorities with which he was returned at each election. </para>

          <para>.- I should like to add my personal tribute, to the memory of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Austin</inline> Chapman. It was with great sorrow that I learned of his passing. I had been personally associated with him in many public matters for many years. He was always actuated by the highest motives, and he had a sincere love for Australia, and desired to see it progress. He was at heart a thorough, straight-going democrat. Through his death the public life of Australia is indeed the poorer. . No man could have worked more unselfishly than he did for the establishment of the Federal Parliament at Canberra, and I express my appreciation of his sen ices in that regard: I hope that the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> for honouring his memory at Canberra will be adopted by the Government. He carried out his public duties with energy and ability, and his memory deserves to be perpetuated.  His  work here is clone, but he will be remembered for it; </para>
