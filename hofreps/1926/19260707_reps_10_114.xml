The firm from which this intimation came is, I understand, that ofW. D. and H. 0. Wills. I recognize that there are always two sides to a question, but I ask the Attorney-General if he will make inquiries and consider whether something cannot be done to prevent any firm, large or otherwise, from refusing to sell its goods to shopkeepers who earn their living by retailing them? </para>

            <para>As a rule when members of Parliament ask pointed and embarrassing questions of Ministers while the House is sitting they possess some information, apparently reliable, on which their questions are based. It might be interesting to know what prompted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath</inline> (V.) to ask the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> a question in the House of Representatives yesterday in regard to certain building operations at the Federal Capital. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath</inline> asked if the Assistant Minister would take care to ensure that in the erection of further buildings at Canberra the Government would not fall into the blunder which it had made in building the secretariat. The architect of that building, he said, had &#39;been . paid a commission of &#163;38,000. He hoped that in future the erection of all Government buildings would be carried out by the department&#39;s own public officers. The Assistant Minister replied briefly that the first secretariat built at Canberra had been erected by departmental officers, and the second secretariat, which was in course of construction,, was being wholly supervised and built by the Department of Works and Railways. In neither instance had any money been paid to architects. </para>

            <para>- Prior to the making of the existing sugar agreement, the Government was asked by those interested in Western Australia to grant certain concessions on freight, and in other directions, to enable sugar to be retailed in that State at the price at which it is retailed in the capital cities of the other States, namely, 4&#163;d. per lb. That price would allow a reasonable profit to the retailer, but in Perth and Fremantle the retail price of sugar has remained at 5d. Special concessions were given . to the grocers of Western Australia, so that they could retail sugar with a reasonable profit to themselves at  4&#189;d.  a lb., but as they have not sold it at that price the Sugar Board has withdrawn the concession. The action of the board has been confirmed by the Government, because it believes that concessions given for a certain purpose should not be continued unless that purpose is fulfilled.  &#39; </para>

            <para>- Yesterday afternoon, I received a telegram from the representatives of the cotton-growers in Central Queensland asking me to endeavour to have the Tariff Board&#39;s report on the cotton bounty tabled, and a decision registered by the Parliament as to whether the board&#39;s recommendation that a bounty of 2d. per lb. be paid, should be adopted, instead of the bounty of $d. and ltd. per lb. announced by the Government. Will the Minister inform me when the report will be printed and made available to honorable members, and whether honorable members will be given an opportunity to register their views on the matter, and decide what tha bounty will be? </para>

            <para>- I tabled the report referred to by the honorable member yesterday, which was the first available opportunity for doing so, and I shall endeavour to expedite the printing of it. The proposal of the Government is to pay l&#163;d. per lb. on certain grades of cotton, and fd. on low-grade cotton. It is intended to place the proposals of the Government before the House  at an&#39; early date, and honorable members will then have an opportunity to discuss the matter. </para>

            <para>- It is inaccurate to say that I have retreated from any position I have taken up on the referendum proposals. The criticism of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Robinson, as published in this morning&#39;s press, is based upon a completely mistaken idea of what I said in the speech which he has criticized. I find it difficult to account for that mistake, as the reports of my speech which I have read do not contain any statement oven resembling that which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Robinson apparently believes I made. </para>

I now find that the 25 tons of potatoes which were condemned in Melbourne were shipped direct from New Zealand, and did not come via Sydney. The potatoes which I had in mind were passed after examination in Sydney, but were not brought on to Melbourne. </para>

            <para>- No. Owing to the difficulty in securing the services of plasterers for the construction of Parliament House, Canberra, the commission entered into an arrangement with the Plasterers Union, Sydney, whereby the union kept the commission supplied with plasterers for this work. It may be mentioned that the standard Government conditions of contract provide for first preference to returned soldiers, and thereafter preference to unionists. </para>

            <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation. When moving the second reading of this bill, I said that, upon the first portion of the line, that between Grafton and Kyogle, a distance of 85 miles, approximately &#163;675,000 had been expended to date. What I should have said was that the estimated cost of the work, if carried out on the daylabour system, between Grafton and Kyogle was approximately &#163;670,000, and that up to the end of last month, about &#163;320,000 had been expended on the work actually done. </para>

            <para>.- I do not intend to oppose the bill, since its chief object is to approve of an additional expenditure of &#163;500,000 on the necessary work of constructing a railway of the standard gauge from Grafton to South Brisbane. The main provision is in clause 4, which substitutes &#163;4,000,000 for &#163;3,500,000. The Grafton to South Brisbane Railway Act 1924 made the necessary financial provision for the Commonwealth Treasurer to borrow a sum not exceeding &#163;3,500,000, together with such further sum as might be necessary to meet discount and flotation charges. We are told that the sum of &#163;3,500,000 was only a rough estimate of the cost of connecting Kyogle with South Brisbane by a 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. gauge line. I understand that the estimate was made on data supplied by New South Wales and Queensland, and that no detailed survey and estimate were prepared at the time, in fact, had not been prepared up to the time of the passing of the act of 1924. In 1921, a royal commission, on information received from the States concerned, estimated that the line would cost &#163;3,500,000. No detailed surveys or estimates were prepared until after the Grafton to South Brisbane Railway Act was passed in 1924, and the Railway Council, under the provisions contained in it, had them made. The rough estimate prepared in 1921 was the .  basis on which the Government proposed the expenditure of &#163;3,500,000 on the line, but the estimate prepared by the Railway Council shows that theexpenditure of an additional &#163;500,000 will be necessary to. complete the work. It. seems to me that the Government made agrave error in not having a detailed survey and estimate prepared in 1924, long before the bill was submitted to Parliament. </para>

              <para>- I mean this Government. This matter should have been taken in hand in ample time to&#34; have proper information prepared for submission to Parliament. It should not be necessary for a government to come to Parliament twelve or eighteen months after the building of a particular railway was approved, and say, &#34; That .was only a flying survey, and a tentative estimate. It .is now necessary for Parliament to approve of the expenditure of an additional &#163;500,000 on the work.&#34; The Government, in this case, could have instructed its railway experts to go over the proposed route and make a careful estimate. Petty-minded, party politicians may try to throw the blame for the introduction of this bill on other shoulders, but the responsibility undoubtedly rests with this Government. I feel sure that some honorable members will take the opportunity that the introduction of the bill affords to enter upon a general discussion on the whole question of the merits of the Grafton to South Brisbane railway; and, in my opinion, the Government should have been sufficiently far-sighted and business-like to avoid that. I do not wish to lay any blame for this bill at the door of those who prepared the 1921 estimate, for it was made five years ago, and conditions have changed a great deal since then. My point is that it was the duty of the Government to obtain a reliable estimate for submission to Parliament in 1924. It has a Railway Department, and an able commissioner with a good engineering staff under him. and it could have had a sound and reliable estimate prepared. I understand that on the recommendation of the Railway Council the whole of this line is to be built under the day-labour system, and I am pleased to note that a saving will be effected by the adoption of that system. </para>

              <para>- The Government must have thought so, or it would not have approved of the adoption of the policy. The tender submitted by the Queensland Railways Constructional Engineer for that portion of the line which will pass through Queensland territory was &#163;1,130,142, which included supervision charges, while the public tender for the work was &#163;1,333,941, or &#163;203,799 more than the departmental tender. In these circumstances it is no wonder that the Government adopted the proposal that the Queensland Railway Department build the line by day labour. If the department is able to do the work for less than its tender it will reap the advantage. </para>

              <para>- I could point the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(&#34;Mr. Maxwell)</inline> to many instances in which Queensland Government departments have submitted prices for work for which public tenders have been called, and have been able to do the work by day labour with a substantial saving to the country, for there has been no contractor&#39;s &#34; rake off.&#34; It is highly desirable that the Kyogle to South Brisbane railway&#39; should be built as speedily as possible, having due regard to the stability of the line. The Commonwealth entered into an honorable compact to complete the work, and it must now be carried out. A conference of State and Federal Ministers, in July, 1920, decided that a commission should be appointed to report upon the unification of railway gauges, and in order to avoid parochial prejudices the commission was constituted of two experts fi om outside Australia, and one Australian engineer. The Commonwealth and States agreed to abide by the decision of the commission, the Commonwealth to pay one-fifth of the total cost of unification, and the five mainland States to pay the balance. The commission recommended  that 4 ft. 8-&#163; in. should be the standard gauge. Considerable difficulty was experienced in getting al&#93; the States to agree to a policy for the benefit of Australia generally, but finally an agreement was made between the governments of the Commonwealth, New South Wales, ana Queensland that the portion of the route between Grafton and South Brisbane should be converted to the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. That agreement was ratified by their respective Parliaments in 1924. Unfortunately, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia took a rather parochial view of the project, and refused to meet their share of the expenditure. The line was commenced; but now it is necessary, in accordance with the advice of the Railway Council, to provide a sum of &#163;500,000 in excess of the original rough estimate. Under the amended agreement embodied in this bill the Commonwealth has to provide &#163;800,000; Queensland. &#163;468,000; and New South Wales, &#163;1,288,088, whilst the Commonwealth will also find &#163;935,439 in behalf of Victoria, &#163;305,073 in behalf of South Australia, and &#163;202,783 in behalf of Western Australia, making the total cost to the Commonwealth, &#163;2,243,299. This House should not hesitate to approve of the bill, but 1 hope that the Minister in his reply will state definitely whether any alteration in the proposed route is contemplated. T read a statement in <inline font-style="italic">Smith&#39;s Weekly</inline> that the route is to be varied to serve certain interests. I hope the Minister will definitely contradict that assertion. </para>

              <para>- No, not on fairly level country; but the railway experts have said that the journey from Brisbane to Sydney will be reduced by six hours. This is the first instalment of the unification of railway gauges, the need for which must be recognized by all members of this Parliament. For 25 years the standardization of gauges has been discussed at conferences of railway commissioners and engineers. Australia is not singular in having to deal with a break of gauge problem. Both England and the United States of America experienced the disability to travellers and the handling of freights caused by a succession of breaks in the railway gauges. The unification of gauges in England became a subject of public agitation as far back as 1846, and it was not until 1872 that this most desirable reform was brought about. One fact that should commend the line to honorable members is that it. will pass through some of the richest land in Australia, which is occupied, not by wealthy pastoralists, but by thousands of small primary producers who are engaged in dairying, and the growing of sugar cane, bananas, and other fruits. It will serve the smaller men who have established themselves upon the land, and will bring them into direct contact with the Brisbane market. If honorable members will consider this proposal from an Australian standpoint, they will not hesitate to vote for the bill. I hope that the other recommendations made by the royal commission in 1921 will soon be submitted to this Parliament with a view to connecting all the Australian capitals by a line of uniform gauge. For the reasons I have mentioned, I hope that the bill will have a speedy passage. </para>

            <para>of the Commonwealth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham).</inline> That historic ceremony seemed to anticipate that this proposed additional expenditure will bo sanctioned by this Parliament. I do not intend to discuss generally the desirability of standardizing the railway gauges, because that principle has already been affirmed by the Commonwealth Parliament. I have studied the report of the Minister&#39;s secondreading speech in order to ascertain why this extra &#163;500,000 is required. The reasons furnished by the honorable gentleman do not seem adequate. Possibly, he could furnish some further information which would ease the minds of honorable members. The principal excuse advanced by him was that the estimate made in 1921 was approximate only, and based upon incomplete information. I notice that in the agreement made between the Commonwealth and the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland, a standard working week of 44 hours is mentioned. In 1921, the 44-hour week was not in operation, and possibly the original estimate was based on a 48-hour week. The Minister seemed to skim over this delicate point, but the increase of 14 per cent. in the expenditure almost corresponds with the percentage of extra cost that a reduction of working hours from 48 to 44 would mean. Possibly the 44 hours week is the real reason for the extra cost. The amount to be paid by the Commonwealth was, under the original agreement, &#163;1,962,887, but under the amended agreement that has been increased to &#163;2,243,299, a difference of &#163;280,412. The Commonwealth is to pay more than half the total increase merely because two partner States have agreed to adopt the 44 hours week. </para>

              <para>- Yes, because for the time being it is paying the shares of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. I am sorry that South Australia did not take a broad national view, and subscribe to the agreement as it should have done, because even now the Commonwealth is incurring expenditure in standardizing thegauge of one railway in that State. I wish to know from the Minister whether the increased cost to the Commonwealth of &#163;280,000 is due solely to the operation of the 44-hour week? </para>

              <para>- The agreement provides that the amount shall be increased or decreased as the cost of the work is affected by arbitration awards of State and Federal courts. I understand that this clause is common in contracts. Some time ago a contract for the North Shore bridge was let by the New South Wales Government to Dorman, Long and Company. Recently the crane drivers employed on that work went on strike, and, without parliamentary sanction, an arrangement was made to pay them a higher wage. As a result, the original estimate of the cost of the bridge has been considerably increased. If similar occurrences are possible under this agreement, 1 suggest that the South Grafton to Brisbane railway is likely to cost considerably more than &#163;4,000,000. In that event we shall have another amending bill brought down to this House as the work progresses to meet the additional expenditure. I have no objection to the building of the line, but we should enter into a fair and reasonable contract for the proper carrying out of the work. The expenditure must be safeguarded. </para>

              <para>- Exactly; but under the agreement any additional expenditure has to be approved by the council. Parliament is finding the bulk of the money, and, therefore, it should control the expenditure. The agreement requires revision, and I suggest that any additional expenditure in connexion with the line should be approved, not by the council, but by the Minister. If he acts wrongly we can draw attention to it in this House, but if the council acts wrongly we have no redress. I regret that in this bill, as well as in the original bill, no mention has been made of the construction of the bridge over the Clarence River at Grafton. That bridge is very necessary if the line is to be a success. At present the train from Sydney runs as far as South Grafton. The passengers are then transported by motor lorry and punt across the river, and the mail and luggage vans are taken across by ferry. The New South Wales Government gave an undertaking that the bridge would be constructed at the time the railway was opened. The tenders for the construction of the bridge closed on the 15th of June last; two tenders were received, one from Dorman, Long and Company, whose price was &#163;16,000 below the  departmental estimate, and the other tender from Jno. Grant and Sons, Limited, whose price was &#163;750 below the departmental estimate. Yet the New South Wales Government has rejected both tenders, because it considers them to be excessive, and has decided to carry out the work departmentally. I suggest that there is something sinister in that action. When the 1924 bill was under discussion, I drew attention to the fact that no mention was made in it of the Grafton bridge, which was a very necessary part of the scheme for the unification of gauges. The through train journey will not be possible until the bridge has been built. At that time it was stated that we could accept the bona fides of the New South Wales Government. I then expressed my fears that it would not honour its obligations. In view of the suspicious circumstances surrounding the construction of the Grafton bridge, it is now apparent that that government does not intend to honour its promise. I suggest to the Minister that he should approach that government to see whether it intends to carry out its undertaking that the bridge will be opened when the railway is completed. The Queensland Minister for Works stated at Kyogle that he expected that the State&#39;s portion of the line from South Brisbane to the border would be completed in March, 1929, nearly three years hence. The conditions of contract applying to the erection of the Grafton bridge provided for its completion within three years of the acceptance of the tender. As no tender was accepted, and as the New South Wales Government intends to carry out the work departmentally, apparently no time limit is to be imposed. I suggest that the State Government&#39;s deficit of over &#163;1,250,000 last year is prompting it to shelve its undertaking to the Commonwealth to complete the bridge within three years. </para>

            <para>. - I regret that there has been such a large increase in the cost of constructing this line that the Railway Council have to ask the approval of this House for a further sum of &#163;500,000; but, having; given serious consideration&#39; to all the circumstances, L shall support the ratification of the new agreements. I shall not at this stage repeat all f said last year in support of the construction of the line,, but I rise to urge that the line be constructed with the utmost expedition. I. was privileged to be present at the historic ceremony, at Kyogle, of turning the first sod in connexion with the construction of the line. The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green)</inline> was also present, and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> performed the ceremony. It was then stated to me by representatives of the Railway Council that, if the proposals of the council were given effect, the first train would run over the line from Brisbane to Sydney in March, 1929. I understand that there is some anxiety at the present time as to whether that prophecy will be fulfilled, as there is some doubt whether the Loan Council will make the necessary money available. The council&#39;s requirements for the first year amount to about &#163;1,000,000, and it is suggested that the amount to be made available will be considerably less than that. In that event, the programme cannot be adhered to; and the completion of the line will be delayed. &#34;Withholding the financial requirements of the council will not only delay the completion of the line, but will also add to its cost. Men will have to be dismissed, and purchases of material restricted. I hope the Minister will give the Blouse an assurance that he will do all he can to provide the council with the money it requires within the limits of the amounts approved to construct the line expeditiously. The need for unifying the railway gauges between the capital cities, and the national importance of this line, I stressed when supporting the proposal for the construction of the line last year. I take this opportunity of thanking the Minister for acceding to my request that preference should be given to returned soldiers in the construction of this line. I hope that he will make sure that the policy will be continued. </para>

            <para>.- I am surprised that this bill has been brought forward by the Government. Tenders were called for the work in April, 1924, and the closing date for submitting them was the 1st September, 1925: In the advertisement calling for tenders it was not stated that &#34; the lowest or any other tender will not necessarily be accepted.&#34; It is usual, when governments call for tenders, to include such a stipulation, so that there may be no moral or legal obligation to accept the lowest tender. It was not until the tenders for the No. 1 and No. 2 sections were before the Tender Board that the board decided that the New South Wales and Queensland Governments should do the work. That was a wrong procedure, and it will lead to contractors refusing to tender in the future. The Tasmanian firm of Cheverton and Company submitted a tender to do the work, on a 44-hours; basis, for &#163;1,011,975 15s. That tender was below the departmental estimate, but it was not accepted. The firm spent &#163;5,250 in preparing the tender, it paid 25 guineas for .the form on which to tender, and it lodged &#163;10,000 deposit with the tender. That tender was rejected simply because the New South Wales and Queensland Labour Governments wish to do the work by day labour, so that no one will know the cost. In this country we have surely had enough experience of the day-labour system. The board acted unfairly and unreasonably. The Government, on the recommendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> who is a member of the board, now asks for a further &#163;500,000.- Why should such a request be made after the tenders, which were lower than the departmental estimate, have closed ? The Minister distinctly stated that, if the cost was more than the estimates, the difference would be met by the State Governments. The No. 1 contract in New South Wales was for &#163;1,059,868, plus departmental supervision of &#163;32,000, making a total of &#163;1,091,868. The No. 2 tender was &#163;1,011,975, with departmental supervision of &#163;32,000. The total of those two tenders was &#163;2,135,843. The original bill provided for &#163;3,500,000, and yet the Government is now asking for a further &#163;500,000 to complete the job. It is a scandal to put contractors to the expense of tendering, and then to turn them down without reimbursing them for their expense. The Minister will have to satisfy me as to the necessity for this &#163;500,000, as to the amount of the tenders submitted by contractors, and as to what the cost will 1-e to the New South Wales and Queensland Governments; and, if he cannot do that, I shall vote against the bill. The people of New South Wales and Queensland will have to pay the difference in cost between doing the work by contract and by day labour. The procedure does not reflect credit either on the Government or the  council. Contractors look to a government - particularly the Commonwealth Government - to treat them fairly. The firm I have mentioned tendered in the belief that it would receive a fair deal. The Government has not paid a penny of interest on the &#163;10,000 deposited by the firm, although it held the money for several months; and it has not repaid any part of the 25 guineas paid by the firm for the tender-form. The firm should have been allowed to do the work. If the Government can show that the firm is not competent to do the work, its refusal to accept the tender will be justified, but it has not attempted to do that. Having had experience as a contractor, I know what it means to be put to the expense of preparing tenders, and then, although the lowest, to have them rejected without reason. The Government should not hesitate to compensate the firm to which I have referred for the time and expense to which it has been put. A request to this effect has been made and refused. The bill should be rejected, because it&#39; will impose a further burden on the people of New South Wales and Queensland. </para>

            <para>.- Most honorable members will regret the necessity for the bill. The public will be astonished to learn that reasonably correct estimates of the cost of the work were not submitted in the first instance. It is unnecessary to traverse the whole ground covered by the Minister in moving the second reading of the bill, but the Minister might well furnish additional . particulars showing who was responsible for the faulty estimates supplied. We understand that in this matter the Commonwealth Government is acting in co-operation with the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland, and that a railway council has been formed.

              <para>- It should have been decided in the first instance that &#163;4,000,000 was required. The Ministry naturally accepted the estimate of &#163;3,500,000 when the railway council asked for that sum. I have no doubt that a number of honorable members scrutinized the original bill very carefully, and hesitated to commit the country even to the expenditure, of &#163;3,500,000. The position is entirely unsatisfactory now that a further sum of &#163;500,000 is sought. I hope that the Minister will apportion the blame among those responsible for the discrepancy, because the people have a right to know whether the fault lies with the Commonwealth or the State officials. Another wrong impression conveyed by the honorable member for Capricornia was that this was to be a day-labour job. I point out that the schedule to the new bill distinctly refers to the States of New South Wales and Queensland as contractors. I have a great deal of sympathy with the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> in his complaint regarding the way in which private contractors have been treated in this matter. It appears to me that Queensland and New South Wales intended from the first that the work should not be let to private contractors. The history of the negotiations shows that those States determined from the beginning that the work should be done departmentally on the day laboursystem, no matter by what subterfuge. In such circumstances tenders should not have been invited. </para>

              <para>- But, taking the work as a whole, the price of the lowest private tender was below the Government estimate. I am sure that the public will welcome this measure as a step towards the unification of our railway gauges, and I hope that the scheme will be continued with the hearty cooperation of the various States. The absurd position has arisen, however, that while we are asked to vote  &#163;4,000,000  in connecting New South Wales and Queensland by means of the standard gauge of  4  ft.  8&#189;  in., South Australia is spending tens of thousands of pounds in converting  3-ft. 6-in.  gauge lines to the  5-ft. 3-in.  gauge; I refer to a branch line which will connect with the proposed new railway between Port Augusta and Adelaide. It is a criminal waste&#34; of public money to convert existing narrowgauge lines to the  5-ft. 3-in.  gauge when there is a proposal to complete the  4-ft. 8&#189;-in.  gauge fromFremantle to Adelaide. I hope that the Minister will take note of the statements of the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green)</inline> and the complaint of the honorable member for Franklin, and that he will give a more satisfactory explanation of the additional sum of  &#163;500.000  asked for. </para>

            <para>.- I am glad to know. that a standard gauge railway is to be built between Sydney and Brisbane. . In this case there isno obstacle in the way of unification, and it will be possible to travel, at any rate, from Albury to Brisbane without a change of trains. But the position in South Australia is quite different. In my opinion, it is immoral for any government, or railway department to call for tenders for a big work such as the construction of the line from Kyogle to South Brisbane, and to reject the lowest tender. It is a most unbusinesslike proceeding, and would not be tolerated by high-minded men unless there was an excell ent reason for it. </para>

              <para>- In carrying out a large number of works in New South Wales and Queensland, the State Governments, instead of saving money, have doubled their estimates in the end. I have received first-hand information concerning the losses sustained there. It may be possible to make out a good case for the granting of an additional  &#163;500,000  in the present case;but the House is entitled to full particulars. I know that the first estimate was necessarily an approximate one, and that when a complete survey is made there may be a big discrepancy between the first and second estimates ; but when an engineer submits approximate figures he generally makes allowance for unforeseen expenditure. It is possible that the additional cost of  &#163;500,000,  which, at present, seems excessive may be satisfactorily explained; but I have a shrewd idea that the introduction of- a  44-hour  week in New South Wales is largely responsible. As the Commonwealth Government has one representative on the Railway Council, and the States of New South Wales and Queensland have each one representative, it will be difficult for the Commonwealth to avoid the extra expense which will necessarily be involved by the introduction of a shorter working week. It is not surprising to find that a tender for this work has not been accepted, particularly as the Governments of the two States concerned favour the day-labour system. It is very difficult for persons other than railway engineering experts to thoroughly understand all the technicalities of the agreement, but having given it my closest attention I think the Commonwealth isadequately protected. I understand that the agreement was entered into before a  44-hour  week was introduced in New South Wales. </para>

              <para>- Yes, and that is, doubtless, largely responsible for the additional expenditure to be incurred. The Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act of the New South Wales Government is one of the wildest and most outrageous measures ever passed in a civilized community, and, from the public viewpoint, is almost criminal. It is specifically provided in the agreement that the contracting parties shall observe the arbitration court awards of the States concerned, but I do not know if the agreement is intended to cover the extra cost that may have to be incurred by the Railway Council in consequence of the passing of the amended Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act of New South Wales. The honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> referred to the conversion work now being undertaken in South Australia, which he said was involving that State in unnecessary expenditure; but I do not think South Australia will be willing to participate in a general scheme of unification for the next twenty years. In view of all the circumstances such a scheme is at the present moment impracticable, as the money required for such an important work, particularly in South Australia, can be spent on more urgent developmental works. </para>

At that time many honorable members on this side of the chamber believed that there were insufficient data, and that the plans and details submitted were altogether inadequate to enable a proper decision to be reached.

              <para>- Seeing that I am not prepared to pillory myself, I am not prepared to pillory others. In introducing this bill, the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> explained that the estimate of &#163;3,500,000 upon which the agreement was based, was prepared on data submitted by the States and checked by the royal commissioners; but that no proper survey of the sections had been undertaken either in New South Wales or Queensland, so that it could be regarded only as an approximation. This came as a something of a shock, even after the lapse of two years, to those who tried to delay the beginning of the work until full information could be obtained; and it was a further shock to hear the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> criticize the Government for rushing into the commitments. I think it should be said on behalf of even those members who advocated delay, that whilst in theory they agreed to the proposal as a step towards the unification of our gauges, they wished that the project, being a practical proposition, should be dealt with in a practical way. I thought that, if my memory serves me right, the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> was one of  those who were most insistent that the Government should begin operations without delay. I have taken the opportunity to refer to the speech that he delivered on that occasion, and I find that he appears to have changed his views remarkably since then. But, apart from his speech, J find that he voted against the proposal that the work should be referred to the Public Works Committee for inquiry and report.

            <para>The railway will take approximately three years to construct, and will give employment for that period to at least 1,000 workmen. A railway should not be built specially for the purpose of relieving unemployment, but the construction of this railway will relieve unemployment in both New South Wales and Queensland. For some time past, the Queensland Government has been constructing a number of railways, some of which are nearing completion. Some of the men employed on them will shortly be out of work, and, as they are accustomed to railway construction, they could be re-employed on the Kyogle-Brisbane line. </para>

              <para>- It is a day-labour policy, and I am safe in saying that it has saved the State of Victoria hundreds of thousands of pounds which, under the contract, system, would have gone into the pockets of private contractors. In these circumstances, I am surprised to hear honorable members barracking in this chamber for the restoration of the contract system. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> appeared to have a grievance because the lowest tender was not accepted, but surely he knows, as I and every other honorable member does, who has had anything to do with public works, that a clause appears in every form of tender, which&#39; reads, &#34; The lowest or any tender not necessarily accepted.&#34; That is inserted for the reason that otherwise persons quite incompetent to do the work, might submit a low tender for it, and consequently get it. In some cases, it is economical not to accept the lowest tender; it might even be desirable to accept the highest; but to suggest that in every case the lowest tender should be accepted, is foolish in the extreme. I know that, from my experience in municipal work; and every honorable member who has had any similar experience, or has been connected with shire councils, must also know it. In spite of all we hear about workmen slowing down, I am sure that no Victorian Government, irrespective of its political complexion, would revert to the iniquitous contract system of railway construction. In the light of the experience of the Victorian Government, surely no honorable member could think of going back to it. If, by constructing this line with day labour, we can save &#163;200,000, by all means let us save it. The honorable member for Franklin is really not up to date with his facts respecting much of the work that is carried out by day labour in this and other States. The honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> should know that considerable savings were effected by the day-labour system on railway construction in Queensland. </para>

The honorable member for Lilley, who is thirsting for information to-day, accepted the assurance of the Prime Minister that the first agreement was sound, although it involved the expenditure of &#163;3.500,000. I can only conclude that &#34; the whirligig of time brings in its own revenges.&#34; I have in my mind&#39;s eye the picture of the present Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> standing where the honorable member for Maranoa now sits, severely criticizing the bill and moving an amendment that the proposal be referred to the Public &#34;Works Committee for consideration and report. I presume that, since lie is now a member of the Cabinet, he will support the measure. At all events, he turned the first sod a few weeks ago. When the bill was being discussed in 1924, the majority of honorable members asked for further information. The Government relied on the report of a commission of experts appointed to inquire into and report upon the unification of the Australian railway systems. There was no detailed survey of the route, although, as the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster)</inline> pointed out, the approximate estimate allowed a fair margin to come and go upon. I submit, however, that for that length of railway construction, it is difficult, in the absence of a detailed survey, to give anything like an accurate estimate of cost. I am not blaming the Governments of either New South Wales or Queensland. They have a right, as partners hi the agreement, to be considered. I am not greatly concerned about a deficit of &#163;1,500,000 for a great State like New South Wales. For several, years, heavy expenditure has been incurred in the regrading of the New South Wales railways, and it is possible that, before many years have elapsed, that expenditure will result in the saving of many millions of pounds which otherwise would have been incurred in operating the system in that State. I take the view that where savings can be made ultimately, there is justification for the expenditure of even loan money on work of that nature. Credit is due in this matter to the MacGowan Government, which initiated a comprehensive programme of regrading work. I rose chiefly to combat the statements made by the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook).</inline> I do not care whether a man is a big contractor or not. I believe in justice. I think I know what is in the Minister&#39;s mind, because I heard him say, by way of interjection, that one reason why the public tenders were turned down was that they were &#163;200,000 above the departmental estimate. It is only right that the Queensland and New South Wales Governments, which are so vitally concerned in this undertaking, should desire to save unnecessary expenditure, and I believe that, as a contribution to the unification scheme, the work now being undertaken will be carried out under the day-labour system well within the margin stated by the Minister. </para>

            <para>. - I thought that, in my second-reading speech, I had made the position abundantly clear to all honorable members, and that there was no room for doubt. I had gone to a good deal of trouble to get all the. information available, and did not overload my remarks with an undue amount of verbiage, which does not count for anythings. I endeavoured to put the case in a nutshell. The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green)</inline> asked to be supplied with information as to how much of this proposed increase of- &#163;500,000 in cost is due to an increase in wages and the adoption of the shorter working week in New South Wales and Queensland. We can only say approximately that the increase in wages and the shorter hours are responsible for &#163;150,000 of that amount. We must also take into consideration the increased cost of material in 1925-26 as compared with 1921. I was surprised at the remarks made by the honorable member for Franklin. He said that the tenders were opened before the sealed estimates were lodged. That statement was unworthy of the honorable member, and it was incorrect. The sealed estimates and the public tenders were lodged at the same time, and were opened at the same time. I can assure honorable members that there was nothing questionable about the&#39; action of either the New South Wales or the Queensland Governments or the Railway Council in connexion with the opening of the tenders and the sealed estimates. The honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes)</inline> also expressed concern about the increase in the estimate of the cost of the undertaking. Perhaps it will clear up all misapprehensions if I state how the &#163;4,000,000 is made up. The contract let to the New South Wales Government amounts to &#163;1,045,806, and the contract to the Queensland Government &#163;1,130,142, making a total of &#163;2,175,948. To the amount to be paid for work in Queensland we have to add &#163;75,000, representing the altered basic wage rate in that State. I may add that a similar charge would also have had to be added to the amount of the public tender. The total amount for the tenders, and the amount to cover the increase in the basic wage, would be &#163;2,250,948. Honorable members may be interested to know how the balance is made up. Provision for the survey of the line, the acquisition of lands, for rails and fastenings, signalling and interlocking, railway station at South Brisbane, also for locomotive depot and transhipment station at South Brisbane, railway and watering stations <inline font-style="italic">en route,</inline> construction work from South Brisbane station outside that for which the contract has been let, accounts for a total extra expenditure in New South Wales of &#163;112,000, which also includes extra expenditure for a 44-hour week; and in Queensland of &#163;967,000, or a total of &#163;1,079.000. For re-laying and strengthening the existing railway between Grafton and Kyogle the amount provided is &#163;670.000. All these amounts, added together, make up the &#163;4,000,000. Had a public &#39; tender been accepted instead of the sealed estimates, which became a firm tender on behalf of the States, the additional amount for which we should be asking would be, not &#163;500,000, but over &#163;700,000. The sealed estimates and public tenders were lodged and opened simultaneously. The acceptance of the sealed estimates will mean a saving of over &#163;200,000, in comparison with the lowest public tender. </para>

          <para>Mr.HILL. - I cannot say that, but I can foresee no probable additional liability, provided that wages and hours remain for the work as they are now. The sealed estimates submitted by the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland constitute a firm tender. They will have to meet any losses that are made in the carrying out of the work, and, of course, they will have the benefit of any saving that is made on the estimated cost. We anticipate that the amount mentioned in this bill will cover the whole of the Commonwealth&#39;s liability in connexion with this line.- The Government was shocked when the estimates were opened and found to be larger than we had anticipated, but, as custodians of the public purse,we had no option but to accept the estimates of the State Governments. </para>

              <para>- That is quite wrong. Thu honorable member pointed out that 1 did not support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> that the bill be withdrawn, and the proposal referred to the Public Works Committee. He is quite right there, and I would again oppose any step to delay the building of the line. I opposed the attitude of the honorable member in 1924 because I considered that his attitude, and that of the honorable member for Boothby, was dictated by parochial opposition in their own States to the construction of a line that would benefit mainly New South Wales and Queensland. The withdrawal of the bill, and the reference of the proposal to the Public Works Committee at that time, would have involved considerable delay in the commencement of construction, at a time when many railway works in Queensland were nearing completion, and hundreds of workers were likely to be seeking employment. Furthermore, I regarded the line as urgently necessary, and as having been too long delayed already. My statement this afternoon was that the Government was culpable in not having had the proposal fully investigated between the date when the agreement was reached with the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland, and the introduction of the authorizing bill in 1924.

              <para>- I do not intend to touch on that matter at the present time, but I may say, in passing, that although estimates are frequently exceeded, there are many cases in which the expenditure on works is less than their estimated cost. I merely rose to say that I opposed the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Kooyong, twelve months ago,, on the ground that to refer the work to the Public Works Committee for investigation would have held it up for for some months. My criticism to-day is levelled against the Government on the fact that during the twelve months that intervened between the signing of the agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of the States of New South Wales and Queensland and the passing of the bill in 1924, more reliable estimates of what the line would cost were not prepared. There has been absolutely no change of attitude on my part. The onus is on the Commonwealth Government, and it is useless now to blame the States. </para>

          <para class="block">Thus one individual, appointed by the unanimous decision of the council, may confer with the contractor and come to an agreement with him as to whether there shall be an increase or a decrease in the amount to be paid to him. But, in this case, the contractor is either the New South Wales Government or the Queensland Government. Although the Commonwealth Parliament will be finding more than half the money for the building of this railway it will have no say whatever in regard to any increases or decreases that may be agreed upon by the Railway Council or some person acting on its behalf. If occasion should arise to censure any increased expenditure in connexion with this work, this Parliament will be robbed of its power to hold any Minister responsible. I suggest that the Commonwealth Minister for Works and Railways should retain the power of veto, and be held responsible to this Parliament for any increased or decreased expenditure which may be brought about as the result of an agreement arrived at under sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of clause 4 of either schedule. Because of laxity in the drawing up of the agreement between the New South Wales Government and Messrs. Dorman, Long and Company, the contractors for the construction of the North Shore bridge, the State Government has recently been called upon to incur an additional cost to meet the claims of certain crane-drivers for wages exceeding the award rates.

            <para>. - The honorable member will recognize that there are obvious difficulties in the way of amending an agreement which has already been made, and which this Parliament, is now asked to ratify. At the same time, of course, before ratifying any such agreement, honorable members should be perfectly satisfied that it is in a proper form. The honorable member is afraid of the risk of further sums being&#39; required from the Commonwealth because of additions which may be agreed to by the council. In contracts for works of considerable magnitude, the most common method of dealing with additions or deductions on account of changes made during the course of construction because of deviations from the specifications, alterations of the conditions or changes in wages, is for the engineer in charge, who is supposed to exercise an impartial discretion, to give a certificate that the additions or deductions have been made for the various reasons I have mentioned. In this case, however, the Commonwealth is afforded an additional &#39; protection. No sum can be claimed or paid by way of addition on account of the matters referred to in sub-clauses <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> andb of clause 4 of the schedule unless it is&#39; agreed to by a person representing the constructing authority,which is in this case a railway council, representing not merely  the,Commonwealth  but alsothe States of New South Wales and Queensland. It is therefore difficult to introduce into the schedule aprovision which would give the Commonwealth alone a veto in relation to the operation of the agreement. The fact that nothing can be claimed by way of addition by the contractor unless there is an actual agreement between some one representing the contractor and some one representing the Railway Council, affords sufficient protection for the public interest which, in this case, is not only the interest of the Commonwealth, but also that of either of the States concerned. It would be rather embarrassing to insert an amendment on the lines suggested by the honorable member. It would not be in line with the general trend of the agreement, and at the same time it would not increase to any considerable extent the protection afforded by the agreement as it stands. In any case the words suggested by the honorable member would not strictly meet the situation. In order to make his amendment properly effective, he would need to add words to the effect that no additions or deductions should be made or allowed unless the Commonwealth Minister approved. Otherwise the sub-clause would, as it were, be loft in the air. Furthermore, the amendment would set up a most complicated procedure. A claim made by the Railway Council for a deduction, or by the contractor for an addition would be considered and agreed upon by the representatives of both parties, and over and above their agreement the Commonwealth Minister would have the power of veto. The suggested amendment is inconsistent with the general idea of an agreement for a joint enterprise  between  the three Governments. The honorable member could safely leave the agreement in its present form, because, in the case of a joint enterprise between three Governments, it is the only effective protection that can be devised against a contingency such as that referred to by the honorable member. </para>

            <para>.- I referred to this matter because this agreement is different from any other which has come under my notice. In this case three Governments form a railway council, which is charged with the work of constructing two lines of railway.When two of those governments are acting as contractors under the authority of the Commonwealth, there is always the possibility of the public interests not being sufficiently safeguarded. I am not, in any way detrimentally, referring to those governments. The Railway Council representing the three governments concerned will decide on increases and decreases in costs incurred by the contractors, who will be two of the governments concerned. </para>

              <para>- That is so, subject to variations under the agreement. But it would be introducing an entirely new element into the agreement to place the Commonwealth in a superior position as suggested. The whole of the enterprise is based upon the assumption that those who are to spend the money are desirous of obtaining the best value for it. The suggested alteration would, of course, make it necessary to cover the whole of the ground again, and to make a fresh agreement with a new clause, because one party cannot alter an agreement. Other matters might be reopened during the discussion, and I suggest to the honorable member that as three parties are finding the money it must be assumed that each of them will do its best to obtain full value for its share of the expenditure. The clause should be allowed to stand as it is. </para>

              <para>- That might have been urged when the Railway Council was originally being constituted. But the original agreement which has been approved by this House provides for the constitution of the Railway Council, consisting of the Railways Commissioners of the Commonwealth and of the two States concerned. Paragraph 10 of that agreement provides that the council shall have the entire control of (1) the works contemplated by this agreement; and (2) the expenditure thereon; and, in effect, control of every other matter involved in the construction of the work. I suggest, however, that it is too late to review the constitution of the Railway Council. </para>

            <para>.- At this stage the Government might see fit to accept- &#39;a few suggestions from me respecting its future policy. It is absolutely essential that the trans-Australian railway should be ballasted throughout. That work has been progressing slowly, with the result that the time taken in the journey from Western Australia to the eastern States is unduly prolonged. If this work were now put in hand, it would give employment to men, particularly in the district around Kalgoorlie. Recently the Golden Horseshoe mine was closed down, and from 300 to 400 men were thrown out of employment. By utilizing their services we could reduce the cost of ballasting considerably. There is also the unification of the gauge of that line from Kalgoorlie toFremantle to be Undertaken. I know that that work was to have been carried out by the Western Australian Government, hut, unfortunately, it is not in a position to do it, and while the Commonwealth Government is coordinating with the Governments of NewSouth Wales and Queensland to continue the trans-Australian line on a uniform gauge to Brisbane, it might consider the unification of the gauge of the line from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle, a work which must eventually be done. </para>

            <para>. - Not being a member of the legal profession, I am unable to deal adequately with the legal technicalities of the bill. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> whispered to me that the bill is formal, and might readily pass the House without opposition. I should like to oblige him, but, after all, I believe that a big principle is involved in the bill, short as it is. The honorable gentleman may consider it proper to give pensions to those who are to occupy seats on the High Court bench. Although, in many respects, those who occupy judicial postions are different from ordinary members of the Public Service, there are yet quite a number of public servants filling distinguished posts who are contributors to the superannuation fund. No doubt the legal knowledge and&#39; other qualifications that are possessed by judges are a justification for paying them very high salaries. But admitting that, it appears to me that we propose to make very substantial provision for the years that follow their retirement. Many public servants are performing, perhaps, as important work as that which falls to the lot of those who occupy judicial positions on the High Court bench. In a democracy, the distinction between public officials should not be drawn so sharply as is proposed by this bill. I have not had the time, perhaps not the inclination, to ascertain whether such a provision as this is in operation in Germany, France, the United States of America, Canada, or even Great Britain. It would be reasonable to ask the judges to contribute to the superannuation fund. A number of public servants are at present making substantial contributions to that fund in order that they may, upon retirement, have the benefit of an adequate allowance. They will look askance at this proposal, and they will be justified in seeking a reason for being treated differently from others after they have devoted the best years of their lives to the Public Service. I have nothing to say against our judges; but can it not reasonably be contended that they are merely members of the higher grades of the Service? I understand that the AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> argued that we might not obtain the services of the very best legal talent unless we made some provision for pensions. I think I can safely say that judicial positions under the States have been filled by men who have been splendid ornaments to the bench. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Leo</inline> Cussen is a notable example. When he was appointed, pensions were not provided for Supreme Court judges in Victoria. </para>

              <para>- That was another reason which the Attorney-General ad- vanced  in favour of this provision. He hinted that he had knowledge of a judge who had &#34; lagged superfluous &#34; on the bench. Why should not those who are receiving large salaries contribute to the Commonwealth superannuation fund? Rather than make provision for the payment of pensions, I would make the salary so attractive that the best men would be induced to accept judicial positions from the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- The same considerations that now impel them to remain upon the bench will operate even if provision is made for pensions. A man who receives &#163;3,000 or &#163;4,000 a year may continue to hold his office even though he has lost some of the mental alertness that characterized him at the date of his appointment, because it may not suit him to retire upon half his salary. I believe that in &#39; some countries, judges are not appointed with a life tenure. The Constitution contains a provision, under which judges may be retired if a resolution to that effect is passed by both Houses of the Parliament. I wish to speak plainly without &#39;being cruel to those who may occupy seats on the Bench. It would be the bounden duty of any government that believed that a judge had lingered too long on the Bench to ask Parliament to pass such a resolution. If it became known that the House contemplated the passing of such a resolution, the judge concerned would no doubt readily accept the inevitable and retire gracefully. If such a step were in the interests of justice and of litigants before the court, and would make for the better administration of the law, a government that did not take the necessary action would be recreant to its duty. I believe that there are in the legal profession in all the States young and rising men who would accept a position on the High Court Bench for the honour rather than the emoluments attached to it. The Attorney-General must know many men in his profession who regard a seat on the High Court </para>

          <para class="block">Bench as one of the highest judicial appointments in the Commonwealth. Some of our High Court judges have travelled to other parts of the world, and it only needs to be mentioned in legal circles that they are members of the High Court of Australia for them to be received with honour wherever they go. A parallel position is that of Governor-General of the Commonwealth. Our GovernorsGeneral as a rule draw incomes from sources in the Old Country, and they come here for the honour of the position offered them, not for the salary paid to them. On their return to the Old Country they enjoy greater distinction for having been Governor-General of Australia. These positions give a man an opportunity to establish a&#39; reputation he might not otherwise, enjoy. I do not wish to be personal to the AttorneyGeneral, but I believe that, financially, he would be better off if he were not Attorney-General. He is first legal counsellor in the community, and I have no doubt that, in his heart, he enjoys the distinction. In accepting the position he must have considered, not the salary, but the honour of it, and the opportunity it afforded to him to render service to his fellow-countrymen. I do not think the judges regard their positions primarily from the monetary point of view. I do not know that there has been a request from the members of the High Court Bench for pensions.- </para>

              <para>- That supports what&#39; I have been saying. Many of our judges abandoned lucrative practices in order to take positions on the Bench, and it is safe to say that some of them are receiving thousands of pounds a year less than they would be receiving if they had continued to practice as barristers. They have for years, without any hint of pensions being paid to them, carried out theonerous duties of their office, and I believe that in the future equally gifted men will be ready to serve their country in the same capacity. The payment of pensions to judges without requiring them to contribute towards those pensions makes an undesirable distinction in the Public Service. I have no hesitation in comparing with the judges the men who administer the public departments. It is true that we place a Minister at the head of a department, and say that he controls it, and although he may do so from a ministerial point of view, by placing his signature to documents, the live factor is the administrative head. A Minister must be exceptionally well informed, and have more than the average backbone, to oppose the views of the head of a department and insist on his own views being carried out. Those officers contribute large sums to the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund, and they are carrying out duties not less important than those of judges of the High Court. I believe that I am expressing the general opinion of the community. While we do not accept the advice of the man in the street on every subject, we should accept it on this. Lf he is consulted he will say, &#34;It is true that a position on the High Court Bench is one of the highest positions that can be given to a member of the legal profession, but the occupant of it ought not to be specially favoured by receiving a pension on his retirement. No provision should be made for him which is not made .for other members of the Public Service.&#34; I could go to my. constituency and convince any class of audience that it is not right to make distinctions between members of the legal profession and others in the Public Service. After a judge has held office for not less than fifteen years, he will be entitled to a pension equal to one-half of his annual salary. Should he retire because of a permanent disability or infirmity, &#34;he will, if he has served in the office for not less than five years, be entitled to an annual pension at the rate of 21-100ths of his salary. The honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Manning)</inline> has indicated certain amendments to be moved when the bill readies the committee stage. </para>

            <para>.- I trust that the arguments which have been advanced by- the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> will cause the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> to recommend to Cabinet that the clause dealing with pensions be deleted from the bill. Surely the Attorney-General will agree that, if a scheme of superannuation is good enough for the ordinary public servant, it should apply also to justices of the High Court, who are in- a far better position to contribute towards a superannuation fund than is the average public servant. The granting of pensions to one section of the Public Service only sets a bad example. We on this side stand for equal opportunities for all. We do not desire that in Australia there shall be a privileged class; but that undoubtedly will be the result of legislation of this kind. The Attorney-General does not approve of trade union secretaries advocating special privileges for members of their unions; yet he must admit that those secretaries are acting in the interests of a group of workers whose remuneration is only an infinitesimal part of that which it is proposed shall be paid to these judges. I trust that he will not persist in advocating the payment of pensions to men receiving as much as &#163;3,500 per annum. What special work is performed by a judge that entitles him to greater consideration than that accorded to the ordinary toiler in some useful occupation ? Judges are usually sons of wealthy parents, and, by attaining to judgeships, they are enabled to rise higher in the social scale than are ordinary manual workers. We have not yet arrived at the stage in which a superannuation scheme is provided for every worker in the country, but this bill proposes to pay large pensions to men already receiving high salaries without their being asked to make any contribution, towards those pensions. I submit that that is wrong, notwithstanding the example set by some other countries. It may be urged that, unless pensions are offered, the most suitable men will not be induced to apply for these positions. I admit that the AttorneyGeneral has a greater knowledge of the legal profession than I have, but I feel sure that there are men in that profession who would accept office without a pension in order to render a public service. So soon as special privileges are proposed, the bargaining element enters. That is undesirable. If a superannuation scheme were substituted for this system of pensions, we on this side should offer.no objection. &#34;We believe that it would not prevent men of ability, integrity, and broad outlook from applying for the positions. Should the Chief Justice remain in office for fifteen years, he will receive, by way of salary, a total of &#163;52,500, and each of the other judges &#163;40,500. No retiring age is provided in the bill for these judges, so that, should they be still hale and hearty at the end of fifteen years&#39; service, they may continue in office and draw their salaries. </para>

              <para>- This proposal is, in its way, just as objectionable to me as would be a proposal to set up in Australia an established church similar to the Church of England in the Old Country. Both this and that are relics of bygone ages which should not be introduced into Australia. While I yield to no one in my admiration for the work of the Anglican Church in England, I should object to its establishment in Australia as an institution of the State. As a matter of fact, that has not been attempted in any British colony or dominion except the West Indies, and establishment was abolished there in 1868. Some of the bishops of the Churchof England in England are entitled to a seat in the House of Lords. That privilege, in my opinion, should be discontinued. Just as we would not think of establishing a church on those lines in Australia, so we should not think of following the English custom of providing pensions for judges. The provision of a pension is not likely to influence gentlemen of high standing in the legal profession to accept judicial positions. I should be quite willing to provide a contributory scheme of superannuation for judges similar to that which applies to ordinary civil servants, and I trust that the Government will consider providing one in lieu of this proposal. </para>

              <para>-  I shall never preach economy of the kind that the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> advocates.  His  idea of economy is to cut1s. a day off the workers&#39; wages. He lives in the spirit of the times in his own State described in Marcus Clark&#39;s book, <inline font-style="italic">For the Term of his Natural Life.</inline> We should effect many necessary social reforms before thinking of providing pensions for highly-paid judges. For instance, we should provide a pension for widows. Under present conditions if a family breadwinner is cut off his widow is obliged to go out and work for her children, when she should be able to remain at home and care for them. We should say to her, &#34; Your place is at home looking after your children; you ought not to be doing other people&#39;s washing for a living.&#34; What happens now is cruel in the extreme. But although proposals for the expenditure of &#163;34,000,000 on migration, and for the payment of substantial pensions to judges in receipt of &#163;3,500 a year, come before us we hear nothing from the Ministry about the introduction of a bill to provide pensions for widows. We should also liberalize the conditions governing the granting of invalid pensions before giving any attention to this proposal. Under present conditions it is not possible for even a totallyincapacitated person to obtain the invalid pension unless a medical practitioner will certify that he is permanently totally incapacitated. There are always hundreds, if not thousands, of men and women in the community totally incapacitated for months at a time, and actually destitute, who cannot obtain a pension because they are not permanently totally incapacitated. They cannot earn a shilling, and yet we are prepared to leave them to starve by the wayside. A man who breaks his leg is surely totally incapacitatedf or a time, yet he cannot obtain a pension, though judges who may have been receiving a salary of &#163;3,000 or more a year for 20 or 30 years are to have a pension of &#163;1,500 a year. I am not opposed to the principle of paying pensions. I believe that every person, on reaching the age of 60 years, should be entitled to a pension -without the stigma of charity attached to it. </para>

              <para>- That is so. Every man who works produces sufficient to provide his wages and also a pension on reaching the age of 60. To-day the minority is living in luxury on the profits gained from the work of the majority, who have to struggle to make ends meet, and may not even accept pensions in their old age without the stigma of charity attached to them. Salaried judges should be placed in the same position as salaried civil servants. If the Government desires to provide pensions to needy classes in the community, I suggest that it should give some attention to the claims of members of Parliament, and treat them, from the pension standpoint, in the same way that it treats civil servants. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parsons)</inline> does his work honestly, and guards the interests of his constituents well, he may have a life tenure of office, but at present he is only an apprentice. If he tears up any more Australian cloth in this House he is most unlikely to have a life tenure. Members of Parliament are not likely to get rich on their salary. At the moment I am not advocating the increasing of it,&#34; but I sec the possibility of that being necessary after the transfer is made to Canberra. An honorable member who does his honest duty to his constituents is unable at the same time to engage successfully in any line of ordinary business, I know that, for I have tried to build up both a grocery and a fruit and greengrocery business, and have failed in both cases. It is impossible to devote the necessary attention to business details And after ten or twenty years in Parliament, it is very difficult for an honorable member successfully to take up outside occupations, or to pick up the tools that he left so many years be fore. The honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes)</inline> can afford to smile, for I understand that he has an income of &#163;20,000 a year. I do not complain of that, but I must say I envy him. No proposition has been made by the Government to provide a pension for members of Parliament. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> know how difficult it is for even honorable members who hold Ministerial rank to make ends meet. I suggest to the Government that before it gives any further consideration to the provision of pensions for judges, or to the spending of millions of money in bringing migrants here, it should do its duty to our own people. It should say to widows with young families &#34; If it were necessary for you to be at home with your children before their father died, it is  a  thousand times more necessary for you to be home with them afterwards.&#34; We should not force them to go out into the world to earn a living for themselves and their families^ The Government should also give &#34;more consideration to those who fall by the wayside, and who, while not permanently totally incapacitated, are temporarily totally incapacitated. The invalid pension should be available to them. I am strongly opposed to the bill, and I trust that, even at this eleventh hour, the Government will with-&#39; draw it. </para>

            <para>.- I cannot claim the honour of representing the Leader of the Opposition on this occasion, but I remind honorable members that he had secured the adjournment of the debate and proposed to speak on the bill, and to oppose, on principle, its passage. I do not think that anybody will very strongly object to that portion of the bill which is designed to prevent the too early translation of the High Court to the airy and healthy, but somewhat bleak, plains of our new country residence at Canberra. It seems to me an act of mercy on the part of the Government to propose that, bv the easy method of proclamation, the High Court shall be enabled to function a little longer in more comfortable circumstances than would obtain if the head-quarters of the court were almost immediately, in accordance with the Constitution, transferred with the Seat of Government to the Federal Capital. In regard to the general  question of pensions for judges of the High Court, it is a little . invidious to have to discuss the monetary rewards of those gentlemen while they are still in the flesh; indeed, it is embarrassing at all times to discuss anybody&#39;s wages publicly. But the principle involved in this bill makes it necessary for members of the Opposition to be articulate, and to express fearlessly and firmly the views they hold. Members of the Labour party have a verydefinite mandate in regardto questions such as that raised by this bill, and unquestionably that mandate does not include large grants out of the public revenues to those who are most comfortably situated while so much remains to be done for those who are in real need of assistance. The judiciary constitutes a very important part of theFederal scheme, and the- High Court itself occupies an honoured place in the Constitution. I do not propose to use my position in this Parliament to give expression to anything which would derogate in the least degree from the honour which is due to the gentlemen who have the distinction of occupying seats in the highest court of the land. I am prepared to admit that their duties, although congenial, and well within their grasp and power, are fairly exacting, and have been rendered more so by the peculiarities of the Constitution under which they work. They have been appointed the umpires to determine in disputed cases just what this Parliament has endeavoured to say, what is the will of the people as expressed through Parliament, and what was the people&#39;s intention when they approved of the written Constitution. Sometimes the judges of the High Court have been subjected to somewhat unfair criticism. On one occasion I listened in this chamber to strictures passed upon the judiciary by the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green),</inline> who asked whether the High Court or this Parliament was to rule in Australia. An inquiry of that kind could arise only from a misunderstanding of the position of the High Court in the constitutional scheme. If the position of the judges is clearly understood, however one may quarrel with their judgments on particular matters, one must, in fairness, acknowledge that they are endeavouring to do honestly - and for the most part are doing ably - the job for which they were appointed, and which, under the Constitution, either they or some other jurists must do, namely, as umpires, to interpret the meaning of the written laws we pass and the Constitution under which we work. They have, of course, other powers and duties with which I am not at present concerned. It is true that judges are recruited from a class of society in which I, as a legislator of the Labour party, am not at least primarily interested but those on the High Court bench have maintained a high . standard of rectitude and . ability that bears favorable comparison with that of the judiciary of any . other country. Although it might not be seemly to discuss the judges individually, I feel bound to say that the High Court, as at present constituted, is more liberal and Federal in its outlook, and more courageous in its federalism, than was the High Court of the earlier days of federation. </para>

              <para>- That duty remains. The fact is that the late Chief Justice <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, great law-giver and eminent jurist as he undoubtedly was, took a view which in the clash between Federal and State authorities was usually favorable to the pre-eminence of the State. I have already admitted that the views of the judges were in each case honestly held and quite free from any conscious political or other bias, although, unfortunately, it is quite impossible to get rid of that unconscious bias which is caused by environment, training, and the sphere in which one is educated and developed. It is undoubted that in a number of ways recent decisions of the High Court have, in effect, reconstructed the ambit of the powers of this Parliament. I need only instance the recent decision regarding State instrumentalities, and that other judg- ment in the <inline font-style="italic">Engineers case</inline> by which the doctrine of implied  prohibition  was </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Bet aside. Both those decisions enlarged, in effect, the powers of this Parliament. Even in the more recent <inline font-style="italic">Cinema, case,</inline> in which the High Court again overruled in part an earlier decision of that tribunal, the powers of the Federal Arbitration Court were incidentally widened. Of course the High Court does not, and cannot in fact, deliberately enlarge or diminish the powers of this Parliament. All it can do is interpret what Parliament has enacted, but the views of the learned judges are very important in their effect upon the Commonwealth Parliament&#39;s constitutional power to legislate. For that reason, their decisions .are of vital concern to us who labour, sometimes so ineffectually, under constitutional limitations, some of which we are even now endeavouring, as the Labour, party on previous occasions endeavoured, to remove, by means of a referendum. So I submit that the exacting and responsible duties of the High Court are rendered more difficult by the limitations which we have imposed upon ourselves, in a measure to our own undoing, and by the resultant complications which the High Court must unravel as best it can. I have endeavoured to put on record my view as to the eminence of the justices of the High Court in the judicial world, and as to their faithful discharge of the very onerous duties resting upon them. But I cannot find any principle upon which this Parliament should agree to the payment of substantial pensions to these members of the Public Service any more than to any other members of the Public Service, or to those persons referred to by the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath),</inline> who, by virtue of their special and peculiar necessities, have claims upon  the government in any civilized society. The Attorney-General said that our judges were the only persons in the Commonwealth Public- Service not drawing pensions, and he contended that they should be the first to whom pensions should be given. I presume the honorable member was referring to the fact that by virtue of recent legislation a superannuation scheme is applicable to the various grades of the Commonwealth Public Service. That is a scheme to which I lent and would lend again my full support, because I think it sound in principle; and I should be quite agreeable if it were proposed that our judiciary should participate in such a scheme. But surely the Attorney-General knows that in the early days of this Parliament the propriety of granting pensions merely for length of service, and for which members of the Public Service would qualify after ceasing to belong to it was hotly debated and decided against for very good reasons. At a later date, on the 19th December, 1918, we were discussing a proposal to give a special pension to the then Chief Justice of the Commonwealth, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, I ventured some remarks which I think are applicable to the present circumstances. I said - </para>

            <para>Bearing in mind the question of pensions to the aged and the invalid, I contend that the only ground on which pensions of any kind are justifiable in a civilized and progressive community is to make provision for those exceptional cases of sickness, invalidity, and weakness which cannot be provided for by any just system of distribution of the world&#39;s good things. I say this, quite recognizing the fact that it may be &#39;suggested for a moment that I aim giving only half-hearted support to old-age and invalid pensions. I give these pensions a full measure of support, because they represent just those exceptional cases for which any civilized community must make provision, even though the wealth of the community were distributed with ideal fairness. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The cases I referred to. include, of course, by implication, widows and infants not otherwise provided for ; in a word, they include all persons who through no fault of their own find themselves unable to make adequate or, perhaps, any provision for themselves. I claim that it is the first duty of a properly ordered nation t&#34; take such cases to itself. This may be described as socialism, but if any test, humanitarian or christian, is applied to it, it will be admitted that any society which pretends to be ordered and decent cannot overlook the claims of such persons upon it. In the course of the  Fame  debate in 1918 the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> made a very useful contribution from which I shall quote. He said - </para>

            <para> A distinct and definite offer was made to him of the highest legal .position in tlie Commonwealth. There was no monetary inducement for him to accept the offer - indeed, the acceptance of it meant a financial loss to him. But one remembers that the position he was offered was one of very great honour, such as no man would lightly set aside. I, for one, have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, conscious as he was of his mature powers, and keenly alive to the important duties that would attach to his new position, felt that in accepting it he would be able to render very valuable service to the Commonwealth. That conviction, 1 believe, was largely the determining factor in inducing him to accept the position. </para>

            <para>The fact that the Chief Justice occupies a high and responsible position entitles him to no more credit for faithfully doing his duty than is due to the humblest servant of tha State who renders honest, conscientious service. If that be so, I should like to know on what ground this proposal of the Government can be justified. That is &#34;my difficulty. It is such a proposal as this that brings us hard up against a painful fact - a fact that, to my mind, is a standing reproach to our social system.

              <para>- I quite recognize that, but the honorable member&#39;s interjection, while it might fairly be used in favour of an increase in salary, cannot be used in favour of setting up . the entirely new principle of granting pensions, not as a reward for .services rendered, in the sense that a salary is, but as compensation given at the public expense for an indefinite period after the services have ceased. The two things are quite different. I have never moved in this House for a reduction of salaries, nor have I ever, to my recollection, supported any proposal to reduce a salary. The Labour party, of which I am a member, has always taken the stand that it is sound economy to pay good salaries and good wages to workers. The honorable member will see that the proposal before the House is to resuscitate a system which found great favour in older and more  unregenerate  days than the present, but which, with the coming of the new Commonwealth, and the birth of new ideals, was properly discarded by our earlier statesmen, including Labour- statesmen. Referring to the first portion of the quotation I have made from the speech of the honorable member for Fawkner, the present judiciary has undoubtedly entered into a contract with the people. It is no doubt true that all the justices, in accepting positions on the High Court bench, made certain financial sacrifices, but after all they are not the only persons who have made financial sacrifices to serve the public. It is to the credit of the British race that the allurements of public office have always been sufficiently strong to induce men to make sacrifices in order to serve the public. As the honorable member for Ballarat has indicated, many men have made personalsacrifices upon entering this Parliament; others who came into this Parliament and gave promise of distinguished public service to the Commonwealth, have had to relinquish their seats because of the financial sacrifices involved in retaining them. Though some may have listened to the observations of the honorable member with a cynical smile on their lips, I venture to say that when those who to-day are giving their whole lives to their political activities are called hence - I hope that it will be a long time before they are - there will be little for the collector of taxation to gather from many of their estates in the way of probate duties. The Attorney-General himself is a standing example. He ha3 made substantial monetary sacrifices hy coming into this House, fired by ambition, no doubt, and the feeling that he can do something for his country according to his view. For this he will certainly receive no thanks from the members of the Opposition, and nothing in the way of a pension should anything unforeseen happen to him. I am not free  at present to refer fo amendments which have been foreshadowed for consideration in committee, but for the present, at all events, I am opposed on principle to the second reading of the bill. It is wrong to apply to one small section of the Public Service, a new principle of reward that is not applied to other members of it. That is quite out of harmony with the policy of this party, which stands for pensions and State aid for those in need. I should bo quite prepared to join in with any scheme of superannuation similar to that applying to the Commonwealth Service, but I am not prepared to revive a system which was condemned many years ago by the Labour party for reasons which still hold, and by men of other schools of thought, and which has ceased to operate in the Commonwealth Public Service. Therefore, I am opposed to the second reading of the bill. </para>

            <para>. - I admit without hesitation that I am not at all enthusiastic in supporting this measure. I am sorry that we are practically forced to support the bill owing to the position in which the Government is placed. It would have been better if the Government had placed the whole position before Parliament, and allowed honorable members to reconstruct the arrangements for the payment and retirement of judges. We know that it is difficult to persuade capable legal men to give up private practice to take a position on the High Court Bench, because they realize that by so doing they have to make considerable financial sacrifices. The judges should be paid a commensurate salary. I am not at all averse from paying a high salary so long as efficient service is rendered for it. The age of retirement should be fixed, as in most other cases, at  65  years. </para>

              <para>- That is the difficulty with which we are faced. When the judges are incapable of rendering effective service to the community they should be retired. I know that the judges of the High Court, if practising in the ordinary way, would be able to obtain enormous fees. They are rendering good service to the community, and the general public would be quite satisfied if commensurate salaries were paid to them. Unless we fix a retiring age, it is possible that the judges of the High Court may continue to occupy the Bench until they become decrepit. The Attorney-General should have introduced a measure giving honorable members an opportunity to make drastic alterations in the present system of appointing High Court judges, and to provide for their retirement at a certain age. </para>

              <para>- That is so. The Government must be faced with considerable difficulty, otherwise it would not have introduced the bill in its present form. A few months ago the -New South Wales Parliament went through the same procedure, and although the majority of its members supported the Government, yet individually they had no liking for the principle of pensions for members of the judiciary. I am loath to support the bill. The High Court has acquitted itself with honour. No one will question the ability of the judges, nor the efficient manner in which they carry out their duties. I am sorry,, indeed, that  Ave  have to support a mea. sure of this kind, particularly as I have not hesitated to express my opinions outside. I do &#34;not wish to be inconsistent, and if honorable members opposite can show me in what way the bill can be improved, I shall have no hesitation in supporting them. </para>

            <para>.- I have listened with interest to the speeches on the bill, and I should be lacking in my duty as a representative of the people of Australia if I did not say definitely that I am opposed to it. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins)</inline> stated that he was loath to support the bill. I feel sure that he is totally opposed to the principle of paying . pensions to highly-paid public servants like the justices rf the High Court. I have no wish to say one word against those gentlemen personally, because we in Australia are fortunate in having a judiciary&#39; that is above reproach. The judges of the High Court are undoubtedly in the front rank in their profession. They are men of high integrity, and, therefore, it is very unpleasant for any honorable member to  discuss .their financial position in this House. But the Government&#39;s proposal to pay huge pensions to  High Court judges, men who are in receipt of incomes of  from  &#163;3,000 to &#163;3,500 a year, shows that Ministers do not view, this matter from a true perspective. The judges of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> High Court have undoubtedly done good work for the country; but, in cricket phraseology, &#34; they have been on a good wicket.&#34; They have trodden the primrose path in life. They have not experienced th&#176;, trials and tribulations of the working man, trying to keep a wife and family on a small wage. It is reasonable to assume that the judges of the High Court, prior to their elevation to that position, practised at the bar as first class barristers. Such men, between the ages of 30 and 70 years, would make an average income of about &#163;3,000 a year, and over the 40-years&#39; period would have earned about &#163;120,000. A man earning &#163;6 a week during the same period would have received only &#163;12,000. There is no talk of a general pension fund for the worker when he retires from his occupation, or for his widow. </para>

              <para>- That is so; and before they get it, they have to prove that they are destitute. The High Court justice is not asked, under this bill. to do that. There is no government proposal about a. widow and  ciphans&#39;  fund, or a motherhood endowment scheme, to assist those who are in dire distress. The members of the  judiciary  have had the opportunity of attending universities to receive the legal training necessary to enable them to become barristers and judges of the High Court. They have had a particularly rosy existence compared with that of the average man, who has to battle for a living without the opportunity of getting the higher education and a profession. I object to the policy of &#34;greasing the fat pig,&#34; and helping those who are comparatively affluent. A man can devote himself to no more noble work than the service of his country; but I do not th  ink  that he is deserving of a large pension just because he has accepted a position on the High Court Bench. No doubt the judges of the High Court consider that they occupy a -high and distinguished posi tion, and they accepted it knowing what it entailed. The Attorney-General informed us that no member of the High Court Bench has suggested that they should receive a pension, yet the Government intends to give huge pensions to the judges who have been fortunate enough to receive large emoluments for a great number of years. A man who devotes himself to the public service of his country performs a noble work, whether he occupies the position of shire councillor, municipal councillor, member of a State or member of the Federal Par?  liament.  He willingly abandons his previous income in most instances, whatever it may have been prior to entering public life. There have been instances of, men sacrificing business and other interests in order to enter Parliament. The Attorney-General himself is an instance. No doubt he could earn considerably more if he were practising his profession outside. I know that a great many men who have been prepared to serve their country in that way have not asked for a pension. They have been prepared to undertake public duties because they recognized that they were receiving one of the highest honours which the people could confer upon them. When the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton was Prime Minister of Australia, the proposal was advanced to pay pensions to High Court judges. What was its fate? <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> at page 1245, Vol. XIII., shows that the proposal was supported by twenty honorable members, and opposed by 29. A division upon the same matter, taken in the Senate on the 6th August, 1903, resulted in its being defeated by fourteen votes to three. I feel sure that if the question were now decided on non-party lines a majority of honorable members would vote against it. Unfortunately, judges in several States of Australia are appointed for life. That is the position of the, judges of the High Court of Australia. Many men retain their mental faculties unimpaired up to a late age, but others are not fit for the onerous duties that they are called upon to perform after they have reached the age of 70 years. A public servant is forced to retire at the ago of 60 years or not later than 65 years. Why, then, should judges of the High Court not be compelled to retire at the age of 70 years at least) I have read with interest some remarks that were made many years ago in this House by a gentleman who has since earned very great distinction; I refer to MajorGeneral McCay. Speaking on the question of pensions, he voiced the followingopinion - </para>

          <quote>
            <para>I tlo not see why a judge, with a salary of &#163;3,000, should get a pension, any more than a post-office messenger, with a salary of .{100 or &#163;200. A judge has a better chance of providing for his old age than the average working man. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I bring those remarks under notice because some honorable members are greatly inclined to study the interests of persons who occupy high places, yet they are loth to consider the needs of those who are more lowly placed. On the 10th September, 1924, 1 moved in this House that the old-age and invalid pensions be increased from 17s. 6d. to &#163;1 a week. That proposal received very short shrift from the Government. The honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. DuncanHughes)</inline> will remember that he hotly opposed the increase, stating that the finances of the country were not in a sufficiently strong position to warrant it. I have no doubt that to-night he will record his vote in favour of giving pensions to judges who are in receipt of salaries from &#163;3,000 to &#163;3,500 per annum, so that when they desire to retire they may receive an annual pension of &#163;1,500 to &#163;1,750. We must treat all classes equitably. &#39; Barristers and judges have less difficulty in earning a competence than had those unfortunate people who, in the evening of their lives, are granted only &#163;1 a week, when they prove they are destitute. The following honorable members voted against the motion that I moved in 1924: - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atkinson, Mr. Bruce, Mr. D.</inline> Cameron, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook, Mr. Corser, Mr. DuncanHughes, Mr. F.</inline> Francis, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Francis, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gardner, Mr. Gregory, Mr. Hurry, Mr. Jackson, Mr. Lister, Mr. Mackay, Mr. Mann, Mr. Manning, Dr. Earle</inline> Page, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Paterson, Mr. Pratten, Mr. Seabrook, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Whitsitt, Mr. Hunter,</inline> and- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marr.</inline> Only the members of the Labour party, who sit on this side of the House, supported my proposal. On the present occasion, I have not the slightest doubt that every honorable member opposite will vote to give pensions to highly paid judges, although at that time they would not agree to increase the old-age and invalid pensions The view of the Government was expressed in the following statement : - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In view of the state of the finances, an increase in the rate of old-age pensions is at the present time not considered justifiable. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was cold sympathy for the aged and infirm people who were anxiously desirous of obtaining an increase. The same Government now admits, through the mouth of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> that judges of the High Court have not asked&#39; for a pension; but that it thinks it a fair thing to give it to them. Major-General McCay spoke correctly when he said that a High Court judge had no more right to expect a pension than a telegraph messenger. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine is a very distinguished member of the legal profession, and a man for whom I have a high regard. Some years ago, when the Labour party urged that a pension should be paid to women on attaining the age of 60 years, and to men on attaining the age of 65 years, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> - then a member of this House - said that the granting of such a pension was calculated to sap the fibre and independence of the people. Yet he accepted the position of Chief Justie of Victoria, which carries pension rights. Evidently, he did not think that his fibre and independence would be sapped. The Chief Justice of the United States of America receives a salary of &#163;3,125 per annum. </para>

              <para>- He does not receive a pension ; nor do the assistant judges in the United States of America, who are in receipt of a salary of &#163;3,020 per annum. The Attorney-General, in his second-reading speech, said that permanent officers of the Commonwealth Public Service, -with the exception of their Honours the justices of the High Court, were entitled to pensions. I remind him that those pensions are payable in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Superannuation Act, under which public servants are compelled to contribute to a superannuation fund. Those contributions, in many cases, impose a . heavy burden upon the officers concerned. I should have no objection to High Court judges receiving the benefits of a superannuation fund ito which they had contributed. The AttorneyGeneral further said - </para>

          <para>I agree that the tenure should be fixed, say, ending at the age of 70 years. I do not think that the Attorney-General will seriously contend that it is necessary to offer pensions to members of the Bar to induce men of integrity to accept positions on the High Court Bench. Those are very coveted positions. Numbers of lawyers in Australia, who for many years have been earning from &#163;4,000 to &#163;5,000 annually, and are deriving a further income from investments, would gladly sacrifice their . incomes as barristers to be elevated to the very distinguished position of judge of the High Court of Australia. The present justices have chosen the primrose, &#39; not the thorny path of life. Their  lot is cast in congenial surroundings compared with that of the great mass of the people. I read interestedly the remarks of the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> upon this matter in 1918, and I should like to know what his present views are. I do not think that he would take up the attitude that has been adopted by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins),</inline> who proposes to vote for the bill, although he is opposed to pensions for judges. In 1918, the honorable member for Fawkner strenuously opposed the granting of a pension to the late Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, the then retiring Chief Justice of the High Court. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has quoted an appropriate extract from the speech of that honorable member, and I could make a number of other quotations from it, but suffice it for me to repeat his remarks on soldier men who ought to get higher pensions!

The Government is deserving of the severest censure of the people for coming forward with this proposal at a time when we are told that the condition of the finances is not good, when the Commonwealth is asking the States to make great financial sacrifices, and when the Government says it can do nothing more to assist the States because of its own Obligations. Such a proposal is the negation of the democratic spirit of Australia. </para>

            <para>.- T did not intend to speak on this subject, because I felt that the speech of the AttorneyGeneral in presenting the bill made quite clear the reasons for it, and I thought the House would be satisfied with his explanation; but the invidious  comparisons  made by honorable members of the Opposition have impelled me to rise. Socialism is very nice until it is applied to oneself. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> stated that a judge with a salary of &#163;3,000 a year would draw &#163;120,000 in 40 years ; and he then spoke of the poor wretch who received only &#163;6 a week, or a total of &#163;12,000 in the same period. He should bear in mind, however, that if he continues a member of this House for 40 years he will receive &#163;40,000, or &#163;28,000 more than the &#34; poor wretch &#34; who is paid &#163;6 a week. Will he divide the extra amount he receives with that man ? It is clear that he was speaking only to the gallery. Twenty- three years ago Parliament assessed the value of the judges at &#163;3,000 a year, and of the Chief Justice at &#163;3,500; but to-day those salaries are not worth more than half what they were worth in 1903. The awards of industrial tribunals, presided over, sometimes, by the judges themselves, have been a factor in decreasing the value of money. But the working man who received &#163;3 a week in 1903 is now receiving &#163;6 a week, because of the increased cost of living. The judges have a lot of back pay due to them, for if their value was properly assessed in 1903, they are under-paid now. Every increase in the cost of living has affected their income as it has the income of other citizens, and an increase of pay is long overdue to them. I agree with the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins)</inline> that . this matter should have been considered, and the salaries of the judges increased, long ago. The speeches delivered when the salaries of the judges were fixed would probably be applicable to-day if those salaries were &#163;6,000 or &#163;7,000 a year. To obtain men of the right age and the requisite qualifications, the country must pay substantial salaries. I do not think the people of this country desire that men of high standing, to whom tribute has been paid by honorable members on both sides of the House, should be compelled to leave the bench in want or remain there when afflicted with old age and infirmities. Honorable members have admitted that the judges give a high standard of service, and we have laid it down as a principle, which we have observed in practice, that outstanding merit should be paid for. That principle  is recognized, even in the Tanks of labour., for the general  president  of a union is paid much more than the man who uses a pick and shovel. We have selected from our midst men to fill these high and honorable positions in which strict impartiality is expected of them, and we cannot be niggardly in our payment of them. It is inappropriate to drag &#34;myself&#34; or &#34;yourself&#34; into the consideration of this matter, much less to make comparisons with the man who works merely with a pick and shovel. This country has provided as well as any country for old age; we have established arbitration courts to . ensure proper remuneration to the workers; we have recently passed a Superannuation Act for the benefit of civil servants; and we have appointed a commission to inquire into national insurance. The judges stand on a plane by themselves, but from the mere stand-point of justice, the House must recognize that the salaries paid to them have depreciated in value during the past 23 years. </para>

            <para>- I do not deny it, but the honorable member denied it by his actions and utterances in a matter that directly concerned&#39; honorable members a few years ago; I refer to the occasion when we sought  to  improve our salaries, and pointed out that the conditions of life had changed materially since the amounts then paid were determined upon. The honorable member bitterly opposed the proposal and voted against it. Although he denounced honorable members for seeking to improve their status and make their salaries commensurate with the circumstances of the time, although he accepted the doubtful honour and glory for the self-righteous refusal to dip his hand into the public treasury, and although he received all the limelight and advantage that accrued to him thereby, vet he accepted the extra payment. On other grounds also I challenge the right of the honorable member honestly to advocate the views that he has ju3t expressed. The honorable member loses no opportunity to display his antagonism to setting up tribunals to consider the wages and conditions of the working classes. </para>

              <para>- Whatever attitude the honorable member may adopt, I am sure that other . honorable members will confess that my statement is substantially true. I do not join  issue  with the honorable member as to the desirableness of reviewing the salaries paid to judges on the High Court bench; hut  consideration  of that matter, which, by the way, is not before us. and also the question of providing pensions for judges, which is the matter before the Chair, should he deferred until after the proDosed constitutional session has been held. It would be much more fitting for us to consider the application of a pension scheme to the indee* after we have determined the  advisableness  or otherwise of fixing a retiring age for them. If this bill is agreed to a most  unwarranted discrimination will  be  shown in favour of the judiciary against many worthy citizens of the Commonwealth who are receiving the old-age pension. Before, a person can obtain the old-age pension he must submit to an inquisition into the most private affairs of his life. He is asked to state, not only his own financial position, but also that of all the members of his family. He must disclose every minute detail of his financial position, including any amount that he may have to his credit in a banking account, and also whether, at any period in his life, he has made gifts to other people. It is proposed in this bill to entitle judges to u pension equal to half their salary, without inquisition, whereas the poorer classes of the community are obliged to submit to a humiliating examination to obtain the pension of a mere &#163;1 a week. The whole situation recalls to my mind the text in the Good Old Book, &#34;Unto every one that hath shall be given, and lie shall have abundance; but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.&#34; No honorable member could justify voting for this bill while the aged and infirm in our community, many of whom have rendered faithful service to the country for many years, are treated in the present niggardly manner. It is an indictment of the Government that it should have introduced the bill under present conditions. Even most estimable and thrifty persons in the community who at great sacrifice over a period of many years have made their homes their own, and in the eventide of their life go to live with a son or daughter, have deducted from their pension an amount equal to the rental value of their home. That is absolutely unfair in my opinion; and in comparison with this proposal for pensions for the judiciary, it is intolerably unjust. We should place our pensioners in a more congenial and comfortable position before giving any consideration to pension schemes for judges. Only after we have righted the wrongs that exist may we justly provide a superannuation scheme of universal application. But, apart altogether from that consideration, our first business in relation to the judiciary is to consider the fixing of the retiring age. Before my election to this Parliament, I was a Government servant, and, as an ordinary workman, I should have been obliged to retire on reaching the age of 65 years, and so would all my fellow workmen. The Government was of opinion that, when we reached that agc, we would cease to give a fair return for our wages. If it is equitable to fix a retiring age for the lower grades in the Public Service, it is equitable to fix one for the judiciary. We should deal equitably with every class in the Commonwealth employment, and give as careful consideration to the humblest as to those the highest in the service. </para>

            <para>.- I should not have participated in this debate but for the remarks made by the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse).</inline> He is in much more favoured circumstances than the great majority of our people, for he has an income larger than the salary received by the Chief Justice of the High Court. Unfortunately, his success seems to have robbed him of whatever humanitarian ideals he may have possessed. I have been trying for many years to get the Government to liberalize the conditions governing our invalid and old-age pensions, and to. make women who have been resident in Australia for 20 years eligible for a pension when they reach the age of 60 years&#62;. and men when they reach the age of 65&#39; years without any restrictions; but the honorable member for Forrest has resisted every effort that I have made in that direction. The last three persons that I opened my door to before leaving Sydney this week urged me to endeavour to obtain some consideration for them from the pensions administration. The first of those three cases was a man who, prior to and during the war, was employed by the New South Wales Railway Department at Darling Harbour; but after the war he, being only a . temporary employee, was dismissed to make room for a returned soldier. He next obtained a position as steward on a boat travelling between Australia and New Zealand, and after several trips developed lung trouble. He applied for an invalid pension, and the medical officer certified that he was eligible, but the Pensions Department declared that his illness had not originated in Australia, and therefore he was not entitled to a pension. Yet I am informed that that man never even went ashore in New </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Zealand; hia home was in Sydney, and there is little doubt that his sickness was due entirely to his earlier employment in Darling Harbour. Another case is that of a returned soldier who to-day is totally incapacitated. I have written repeatedly to the Repatriation Department to explain his circumstances, but he can get no pension because his sickness is said not to be due to war-like operation&#39;s. It is unquestionable that prior to the war he enjoyed perfect health. The Minister for Repatriation has promised to investigate the case personally, but I am afraid that this man has little prospect of receiving a pension. Another claimant with whom I have dealt during the last few days is a man over  70  years of age. He is not living with his wife, but because she had received from her son a sum of  &#163;300,  the pensions of husband and wife have been halved. Instead of worrying Parliament to give pensions to men receiving salaries of  &#163;3,500  a year, the Government should exert itself to remove the injustices suffered by the aged and invalid who are really in need. I esteem the members of the High Court Bench, and I am sure that as men of high principle they will not thank the Government for this gratuitous pension scheme. When the High Court was established less than onethird of the members of this House belonged to the Labour party. At that time Parliament was opposed to the payment of pensions to either judges or public servants, but the party to which I belong has at all times maintained that all persons in the employment of the State should receive payment commensurate with the work they perform. I am sure the judges of the High Court have as much business capacity as I possess, and I am sure that if I had been appointed to the Bench at a younger age I could have taken out an endowment policy which would provide me with sufficient to live upon when I retired. The judges were appointed on a definite contract, and I cannot understand why. the Government should, without having received any request from them, propose to vary it. </para>
          <para class="block">I am not one of those who believe in hurrying men off the Bench merely because they have attained a certain age. If they still enjoy good health, and are in full possession of their mental faculties; their accumulated knowledge and experience must be of immense value to them in the performance of their duties. We have heard amazing statements about the enormous salaries earned by gentlemen in the legal profession. Before I can be satisfied that those salaries are as high as they are represented to be, I shall want an opportunity to peruse the bank books of some leading lawyers. </para>

              <para>- But those returns are probably nearer the truth than the statements which have been made regarding their earnings. Some years ago I saw the bank book of a learned counsel in New South Wales who took an active part in the Labour movement. It showed that for some years his income varied from  &#163;5,300  to  &#163;6,000  per annum, but in the first year after he declared himself favorable to certain proposals by the Labour party, it declined  50  per cent. The Attorney-General has not convinced the House that the unusual course proposed in this bill is justified. The justices accepted their positions .without any expectation of pensions; but, possibly the Attorney-General, in submitting this measure to Parliament, is influenced by the consideration of his own prospects in the legal profession. Having regard to the pitiable oases I have mentioned, I would &#39;be a traitor to the class I represent if I did not oppose the bill. If the Government is sincerely desirous of paying pensions to those who deserve them, it should attempt to remove the unfair limitations associated with the present pension scheme, so that all good citizens who reach the prescribed age, and all invalids, shall &#39;be entitled to the ungrudging assistance of the Commonwealth. I have noticed that many old people have a fear that, unless they retain an amount in the bank for their funeral expenses, they will not be buried, or, at best, will be put into paupers&#39; graves. Yet, because of small balances to their credit in the savings banks, their pensions are substantially reduced. I hope that one effect of this debate will be to- remove from the pensions scheme the ungenerous limita-tions with which it is now hedged. </para>

            <para>.- By interjection, I have been informed that I am an apprentice to politics. Perhaps that is the reason why I am still in doubt  as to whether this debate relates to the judiciary, old-age pensions, or the working conditions of seafaring men. I trust, sir, that if my remarks should wander a little from the bill, you will extend to me the same leniency as has been shown to other honorable members. </para>

              <para>- I had no intention to do so, and if I erred unwittingly, I apologize. Honorable members have discussed old-age, invalid, and war pensions, all of which they seem to regard as relevant to this bill. In 1908, the first oldage pensions bill was introduced by the honorable gentleman who is now <inline font-weight="bold">Speaker (Sir Littleton Groom)</inline> ; but the government of which he was a member went out of office before the scheme was put into operation. During the succeeding six months, a Labour Government controlled the affairs of the Commonwealth, and had an opportunity to inaugurate the pensions scheme ; but did not pay out one shilling. The Deakin Ministry, in which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne was Treasurer, came into office early in 1909, and the first old-age pension was paid on the 1st July following. Labour was returned to office in 1910, and although the conditions of which the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> spoke with such fervour and, I concede, sincerity - a concession he is not prepared to make to his opponents - existed then, the Labour party, quite consistent with its earlier records, did nothing to remedy them. It was once more returned to power in 1914. and held office for five years, but did nothing to increase the pensions until two months before an election. The increase it granted was based on the increased cost of living. In 1919, when a Nationalist Government came into office with the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> as Treasurer, the old-age pension was increased by 2s. 6d. per week, making it 15s. In 1923 the present Government raised it by another 2s. 6d. a week, and in 1925 again raised it by 2s. 6d. a week, bringing the pension to its present rate of &#163;1 a week. The position summed up is that the first pension was paid by an anti-Labour government, and all the increases, with the exception of two, have been given by anti- </para>

          <para class="block">Labour governments. Prom the remarks of honorable members opposite one would imagine that they are the only persons here who have any thought for those in our community who are unfortunately circumstanced. I should raise no objection whatever to the claim of honorable members opposite that they are sympathetic with such persons, if they would only back up their sympathy with works; but when, unlike us, they do not back up their sympathy with works, I think it is time the boot was put on the right foot. In 1909 the amount involved in the payment of invalid and old-age pensions was &#163;2,900,000; in 1919 it was &#163;4,037,000; this year it will probably be &#163;8,000,000. Nearly every increase has been given by &#34; dreadful &#34; National governments, which, we are told, would let men and women who have met with misfortune, starve rather than help them. It is regrettable that such accusations should be made by honorable members opposite, even in ignorance, but the record of honorable members on this side of the House easily disproves them. A good deal has also been said about the manner in which this &#34; dreadful&#34; Government has treated returned soldiers, but that is another accusation which cannot be sustained. The personnel of the Ministry itself disproves it. The Prime Minister is a returned soldier, and there ar&#171; other returned soldiers in the Cabinet, including the Minister for Defence, who has earned the Victoria Cross, and has a long record of distinguished service. I am not at all surprised that honorable members are going out. of their way to curry favour with the soldiers, for undoubtedly the returned soldier votes for us. The history of Australia teaches us that our judiciary has maintained the high traditions of British courts of justice. It is undoubtedly a fact that every man who has taken a seat on the bench has not only made a monetary sacrifice, but has given up many social activities previously enjoyed by him. A judge is, as it were, cut off from the rest of society. He is obliged to abandon many social pastimes in which he indulged with pleasure to himself and with profit to the community. An honorable member opposite has intelligently interjected, &#34; What rot ! &#34; but if he takes the trouble to inquire he will find that every judge on taking a position on the bench has given up some social activities in which he previously took a part. </para>

              <para>- Every judge on our Bench to-day has done so. Some honorable members have said that a salary of &#163;3,500 a year spread over a number of years represents an enormous sum of money; but I can refer them to the remarks of other honorable members opposite who have shown that if we want big judges, men who will be above suspicion, and who will rightly interpret the law, we must pay them salaries commensurate with their ability. We have also to bear in mind the fact that the justices of our High Court are called upon to do a tremendous amount of travelling. They are away from their homes for months at a time. I trust that one of the amendments foreshadowed will find a place in the bill, if it is legally possible. Honorable members opposite have referred to the great sacrifices our Attorney-General has made in devoting his time to the service of the Commonwealth, andI am prepared in regard to a bill like this to accept the assurance which he has given, supported as it has been by several honorable members opposite. </para>

Surely the honorable member will recognize that a judge holds a position of the highest honour in the community. A member of the State judiciary acts for the Governor when he is absent. A judge has privileges that no barrister has. I have yet to learn what he cannot do. One of the most learned judges of Victoria was at one time  president  of the Melbourne Cricket Club. No other profession in the world has the advantages enjoyed by the legal profession and the judges. </para>

              <para>- What doctor has the chance of getting &#163;5 a day as an old-age pension ? When the first Chief Justice of the Commonwealth sought the old-age pension, was it not clearly proved that he had earned something like &#163;100,000 from the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments. Is it not a fact that at that time the oldage pensionerwas asked to live on 12s. 6d. a week? It matters not what party instituted the old-age pension; what we are concerned about is whether the payment is sufficient. Its purchasing power does not equal what Denmark gave her citizens 30 or&#39; 40 years ago.  Her  oldage pensioners were paid an amount equal to 10s. of our* money, and in those days that would buy far more than 20s. will buy in Australia to-day. I have the greatest regard and reverence for the High Court Bench. I have four beloved friends who grace it. One of them is the best son, father, husband and brother that I have ever known in my life, and I can give no greater honour to any man than that. Not one of the High Court judges, with the exception of two, has ever tried to simplify the law. The two exceptions are <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs. They did throwout ideas that might simplify the law, especially regarding the legislation which was recently passed, and which is to be submitted to the people by referendum. I do not wish to say anything harsh of the judges of the High Court. I was familiar with the literary work of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, and I was the only member of this House who knew that he had translated the great Italian poet Dante Alighieri into the English vernacular. That work so impressed me that, if he had lost his money by injudicious investment, I was willing to contribute towards a pension for him a sum equivalent to what I annually paid in income tax, provided that other honorable members did the same. According to the division list that was taken on the measure providing for a pension for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, 25 members voted for it, and onlyfourof them are at present in this House. Eight members voted against the bill, and five of them remain, including the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell).</inline></para>

              <para>- That is, roughly, about &#163;5,000. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> quoted figures in this House showing that tha Chief Justice of the United States of America received &#163;3,125, and the assistant judges &#163;3,020, without pensions. The salary of the Chief Justice of 118,000,000 Englishspeaking people has since been increased to &#163;5,000. That, surely, is an argument against the payment of pensions to the judges of the High Court. Amongst those who voted for the bill, which did not grant pensions, were <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Langdon</inline> Bonython - and the honorable member for Angas may follow his example - <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Carty</inline> Salmon, and a great number of others. Is it the Government or this Parliament that pays the salaries of the judges? No. The people outside pay them by taxation, and yet they have ho voice in this matter. Would any honorable member dare to facethe electors and ask them to endorse this bill ? I dare any honorable member, from the Prime Minister to the honorable member for Angas, to contest the Melbourne constituency on . that issue. We have no right to vote away the people&#39;s money without their sanction. It would entail no more than the printing expense to place this question among those to be submitted to the people by referendum. Honorable members may recall that my request for an old-age pension was turned down. I was also turned down when I volunteered for enlistment during the first week of the war..

I applied for the old-age pension, for two reasons ; one to show every old man and woman in Australia that there was no disgrace attached to it; the second, so that I could criticise more severely the contemptible action of the Government of that day in giving one man &#163;5 a day. What I would suggest to you is this, that if you apply for a pension, they will deduct &#163;1 from every &#163;10 you are receiving, and you can get the remainder. Go, friend, apply for your pension; there is no disgrace in it. </para>

He was totally incapacitated. Yet, unless he is incapacitated for life - and no medical man can certify to that - he cannot get any assistance from, the Commonwealth. Consider the case of a washerwoman whose duty compels her to stand at a tub, or of a poor woman whose work entails the use of a sewing machine. The breaking of a leg in either of those cases would render the unfortunate woman incapable of earning her living, yet she would not be entitled to the invalid pension.

              <para>- I ask the House to accept my statement that there are 89 abominable questions  asked of old-age pensioners, whose only crime is that they belong to the poor. No member of this House, when fighting an election, would dare to support such an inquisition. Ought we to ask these questions of oldage pensioners who claim &#163;1 a week, and not ask them of judges who are to receive &#163;5 a day ? The infamy of it ! The insult to their intelligence as honorable men ! I charge them, as men of honour, with being as bad as the Government that brought in this bill if they accept this pension. I speak strongly, because I feel so. I work among the poor, and I know them. &#34;What is the law of the country? We speak of courts of &#34;justice&#34;; but is it not known that, if you have a long purse, you can buy the most accomplished lawyer to discover technical legal points that will often secure a verdict against those who have a just claim? Is there any simplified court in this country like the Court of the  Prudhommes  in France  and  Belgium? The procedure which we call law and justice in this country is not justice. When I look at some of the results of it I feel angry, and I speak as I feel. Think of that old hero of 85 years of age! Would any honorable member, before his constituents, say that it is fair to give that man 12s. 6d. a week, and the Chief Justice &#163;5 a day ? A plague upon it ! The honorable members who register their vote in favour of this pension will be accused by all who study the division list in <inline font-style="italic">Hansand</inline> of not having done their duty humanely or justly. This proposition should be placed before the people who pay. It is merely a surreptitious way of giving away the people&#39;s money in large sums. When I spoke on this subject before, I referred to some of. the unfortunate  soliders  and the sufferings of their mothers.

              <para>- Every supporter of the Government at that time helped in the reform. Every honorable member on the Government and Opposition side felt that it was an injustice to have that vile word used by our departments. I have discovered only one department that again used it, and that was the Defence Department. I complained of it, and the offence was not repeated. Many members younger than I may live to see what I venture to prophesy, that when the people have the real power of the referendum, initiative and recall - the power to initiate laws and to recall a member of this House if he breaks his word - such a bill as this will be impossible. If the people had that power no government would dare to bring in a bill to provide huge pensions for men who are being paid large salaries, particularly if it was at the same time neglecting to provide for those whose faces are made thin by want, compelling them to live on &#163;1 a week, and allowing combines and profiteers to grab a portion of even their little needs of food and clothing. A bill like this should be placed before the people, and the people&#39;s views of it should be respected. The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> spoke of the amount of salary a member of this House would draw in 40 years. I have sat in this Parliament and in the Victorian State Parliament for 37 years. When I first entered political life I owned 30 houses. I thank God that I do not own one of them now. I made each tenant the owner  of  the house he occupied, and I am proud of it. I have endeavoured, during my life, to set aside a quarter of my income to help those who are not as well off as myself ; and when parliamentary salaries were increased I  set  aside a third of my salary for the  same  purpose. I regret that the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> spoke as he did. He is reputed to be one  of  the wealthiest wheat-growing farmers in Western Australia. I know of only one, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges,</inline> who was at one time a member of this House, who is better off than he is. In these circumstances, it ill became him to speak as he did. I can only conclude that it was through  lack  of thought and consideration that he censured the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> as he did. Rather than die a. vervrich man, I would prefer to die like a mangy dog in a gutter. If God be God. I would rather face him as poor as the Christ who died on the Cross than heaped up with wealth, while there is starvation, misery, and wretchedness in the world. </para>

            <para>. - This bill  is  founded upon general considerations of apublic character. It  is  not supported by the argument that the present members of the High Court have theright to pensions. I agree entirely with honorable membersof theOpposition..who have said that the present members of the High Court accepted their positions subject to well-understood terms, and have no right to claim anything more from the Commonwealth than the terms of their contract give. Accordingly, it is not on any contractual grounds, or on grounds affecting the individual right of members of the High Court, that the bill is supported, but, as I have said,  on  general considerations  of  a public character. Under the Constitution the judges of the High Court must bold office for life. It is important that honorable members should understand that the present judges  did  not, by their own decision, confer upon themselves a tenure for life  as  some persons  in  the com  munity appear to think. They were in fact appointed to their positions without any limitation as to time, and, according to well-known legal principles, were thus appointed for life. The decision of the High Court given in 1918 that High Court justices must be so appointed, only affects future members of the Bench. Accepting, as we must, the position that justices of the High Court under the present Constitution are necessarily appointed for life, Parliament must face the position that the efficiency of the court may require that it should be possible for judges to retire from their positions with dignity and a relative amount of ease; thatthe provision of pensions is desirable from this point of view is so obvious that it hardly requires to be pointed out. I spoke of these matters in introducing this bill, and I do not propose to repeat now what I said then. While I do not suggest that members of the legal profession who accept positions on the Bench are actuated solely by pecuniary considerations - for I know, in fact, that that is not the case - yet it must be recognized that the judicial positions available under the Commonwealth Government, shouldbe at least as attractive as those which are available under the State Governments. Unfortunately, at present that is hardly the case. Where there are alternative opportunities of dignified public service, it is not surprising that men who are willing to serve their country as judges are more ready to accept positions under the State Government than under the Commonwealth Government, for the reason that the State positions carry pensions with them, and Commonwealth positions do not.. This bill has been introduced, not for the purpose of honouring any supposed obligation to the present members of the High Court, but in order to assist Parliament to discharge its duty in providing that the important work of the High Court may be performed as efficiently as possible. </para>
