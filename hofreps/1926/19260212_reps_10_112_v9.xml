                        <para>- I have received, from Messrs Bowser and Company, a letter couched in terms similar to those of the letter mentioned by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> yesterday. It would appear that, in the course of a speech the other day, I quite improperly referred to petrol kerb pumps as Bowser pumps. I was under the impression that that was a generic term applying to all such pumps. I find, however, that it is not. As I have inadvertently done this firm a grievous wrong, I apologize, and shall not -repeat the offence. </para>

                        <para>- I assume that the honorable member refers to the rumour that returned soldiers are to be discharged from the Postal Department because certain juniors who have reached the age of 21 years are to be permanently appointed. This matter has been carefully considered by the Government, and by the Returned Sailors and Soldiers&#39; Imperial League. The Government&#39;s policy in making appointments to the Public Service is to grant preference to returned soldiers. That policy it has endeavoured to carry out. Under the Public Service Act there is power to appoint permanently to the public service returned soldiers with two years&#39; service as temporary officers, as and when vacancies occur. These appointments have interfered with the promotion of juniors who were taken into the Service at the age of sixteen, on the understanding that on reaching the age of 21 years they would be considered eligible for permanent appointment. Unless there is a reasonable prospect of permanent employment for these young men, boys of the right type will have no encouragement to enter the Public Service, with the result that, in the future, the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department will be inadequately staffed. However, a satisfactory arrangement has now been arrived at. It will meet the wishes of the returned soldiers, do justice to the boys, and safeguard the efficiency of the department. It is intended that future permanent appointments shall be made alternately from the returned soldiers and the juniors. The number of returned soldiers concerned is approximately 162, and it is hoped that this arrangement will absorb them all within a reasonable time. </para>

                        <para>- Immediately, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the debate was obtainable, I instituted the inquiries promised by me last week.-  Last night I received a deputation, introduced by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> when additional information was placed before me, and this morning I ordered a further inquiry along the lines suggested by that information. While keeping within the law, I shall, as promised, do all that I can to protect Australian interests in this matter, and so soon as I have obtained the information asked for, I shall &#39; make a statement to the House. I point out, however, that as inquiries have to be instituted in the other States, it will be some time before I can do so. </para>

As this is another instance of misrepresentation such as the High Commissioner <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> recently complained of, will the Prime Minister, in the absence of power to prevent these absurd reports being sent from this country,&#39; make an appeal to the people who sent them to mend their ways, and to refrain from sending abroad news which places Australia in a wrong light ? </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen the cablegram -to which the honorable member refers, but I agree with him that it is lamentable that such exaggerated reports of happenings in Australia are sent, abroad, as they do a great deal of damage. I assure the honorable gentleman that the Government will take every step in its power to prevent this kind of thing ; but our powers in this connexion are limited. He suggests that an appeal might be made to those who send Australian news .abroad. As there is no place where such an appeal could be made more publicly, or with greater authority than in this Parliament, that appeal I now make to the persons concerned. </para>

                        <para>- The Tariff Board has now returned to Melbourne. The honorable member&#39;s attention is, however, invited to item 262 of the proposed tariff schedule, from which it will be seen that increases in duty have been provided for the protection of marble produced in Australia. These increases were made as the result of inquiries by the Tariff Board; there is, therefore, no necessity for further investigation. </para>

                        <para>- The Government&#39;s policy is to encourage Australian industry by means of the tariff, which is designed to protect Australian products from unfair competition. The great volume of materials used in Australian homes is Australian. The builders of the homes who ultimately find the purchase money cannot, however, be deprived of their right to use any article they may so desire. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend to delay the House at any great length unless I receive provocation from honorable members supporting the Government. No speech could have been more provocative than that delivered by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> when introducing the bill. He quoted largely from communist and other literature to try to introduce as much discord into the debate as possible.  His  speech covered many pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and it is remarkable that eleven pages were devoted to quotations and comments relating to communists, bolshevists, and Soviets in all parts of the world. He skimmed over the vital clauses of this bill, devoting only one and a half pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to the Government&#39;s iniquitous proposal to bring our industrial organizations under the Crimes Act. The Attorney-General may not have known that honorable members were almost unanimous in their acceptance of the first portion of the bill relating to unlawful associations; but evidently, for some ulterior motive, almost the whole of his speech was a diatribe against the communist movement and allied associations. The introduction of the bill isa retrograde step. I remember in my youth picking up fleeces in a shearer &#39;s shed and hearing a lot of talk about the treatment that was meted out by the squatters to those who sought to organize the shearers and bush workers of Australia. At that time, the Labour organizers had great difficulties to contend with, and suffered persecution at the hands of the employers. The honorable member forRiverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Killen)</inline> will know something about that matter, because he is well versed in the early history of the Australian Workers Union. No doubt you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> in your home have records of the organization of workers in the rural districts, because your honoured father, when conducting a newspaper in Toowoomba, was prepared, in the early days to act as custodian of moneys collected to aid the formation of an association which finally developed into the Australian Workers Union. This shows that there were employers even in those days who favoured the formation of employees&#39; unions. Unfortunately, some employers to-day still suffer from the microbe which infected the squatters in the latter eightiesand early nineties, and caused them to oppose bitterly the formation and operation of workers&#39; unions. </para>

Spence, a letter which was written by &#34; Locky &#34; McBean, who at one time was a well-known squatter in the southern part of New South Wales. That letter, a certain portion of which applies to some honorable members behind the Government, reads as follows : - </para>

                <para>This your circular is addressed to manager, Woorooma Station. I beg to inform you that I, the writer, is the manager and owner. I have others assisting me for 16 years, 12 years, and down to 6 years. They are content and satisfied all with their positions, and I dp not wish that their minds should be disturbed, poisoned, or corrupted by any union, any bondage society, or any corrupt league, and I give each notice that when they hold any communication with any league or union that purpose evil they will be paid off as soon as I find this out, and I have to request that you do not write or send any of your print to any one here. You have sent parcels of print and writings here, but they were not read by any one, nor will they be heeded, no matter how often they come. I do not want to interfere with your union in any way, but let them leave me alone, keep clear of me and my property, and if they do trespass after a caution they will get the hardest treatment that law can inflict, and as often as they trespass on any part of my land, and to be plain with you, not  a  union man will get a day&#39;s work from me. Last year 60 of the lawless ruffians camped in nine camps opposite my shed for  a  term till the police magistrate gave them notice to break up. I had a watch armed on my shed with guns loaded with sparrow shot, not to kill any one, but to mark their legs so as to be known next morning. For all their bounce, my shearing went as well and peaceable as ever I saw. The men took high wages out of the shed - some <inline font-style="italic">&#163;32</inline> in six weeks three days, after paying for their stores and rations bill, five or six meals a day, as they liked the best of provisions, and the lowest average was &#163;3 a man per week clear. If this is not enough I do not know what to say. If it comes to this, that I cannot get my sheep shorn with free, not union or bond men, I will sell the sheep, put cattle on the run, as I had before. I know the evil of societies&#39; cliques and corruption since 1833 in Kircaldy, when Russet&#39;s foundry was closed with the villainies of loafers, agitators sucking the wages of working men out of their pockets, then setting idle, exciting ignorant labourers on to evil. This caused a panic in Kircaldy at the time. </para>

                <para class="block">That statement bears out to a large extent my previous remark that the introduction of the bill is a retrograde step. So long as it remains on the statute-book it will be a standing affront to the unionists of Australia. Surely the Attorney-General could agree to the reasonable request made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> to delay the bill, which is a penal measure, until we have dealt with the amending Arbitration Bill. We should know the Government&#39;s proposals respecting arbitration to enable us to deal effectively with the bill before us. The least the Government could have don was to introduce the amending Crimea Bill and the amending Arbitration Bill concurrently. The Government, as has been said, has put the cart before, the horse. Honorable members should know the provisions of the Government&#39;s, industrial legislation before they are called upon to deal with a bill like that now before the House. In the circumstances in which we find ourselves, what better action can we take than to try and expunge the obnoxious clauses. We have little hope of success, for all honorable members opposite appear to have made up their minds to support the Government. </para>

                        <para>- We have virtually made up our minds to accept the first portion of the bill, and to endeavour to expunge the second .portion. The faintest respect for our pledges to the electors, would prevent us from supporting the second part of the&#39; bill. The Government has exceeded even the very wide mandate given to it by the people. If the provisions of the bill had been known during the election, the electors I am certain would not have sanctioned it. I understand that at the caucus meeting of the Nationalist party yesterday, exception was taken by some honorable members to some clauses of the bill. . I do not know whether the Prime Minister was able to cajole the party into acquiescence, but I hope to hear the views of the honorable members who raised their voices at that meeting. A few months ago the Prime Minister, who had been infected by the Mussolini microbe, said that Australia could be better governed by a dictator, or half-a-dozen dictators. When we observe the very amiable way in which honorable members opposite accept the proposals of the Prime Minister, it would appear that Australia to-day is under a dictatorship. Honorable members opposite remind me of pieces on a chess board, with the Prime Minister as the master player. He places the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> in his square, the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hurry)</inline> in his square, and the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. D. Cameron)</inline> in his square; every honorable member is allotted his square; but they are all miserable,&#39; inept pawns, subject to the motions of the Prime Minister&#39;s hand. </para>

The vigorous member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster)</inline> said that during the election campaign he had heart to heart talks with many unionists, and that they told him that ho and others like him were the saviours of unionism in Australia. He rebuked honorable members on this side, and tried to make the people of this country believe that, apart from some members of Parliament and a few people outside, no objections were being taken to the bill. In view of that statement it is as well that I should quote the views of some. of the mouthpieces of Australian trade unionism. If any honorable member wished to obtain the concrete opinion of trade unionism, he would naturally go to the officers who preside over the Trades Hall councils of the different States. The  president  of the Trades Hall Council in Melbourne, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> A. Painter, is one of the most intellectual men in the ranks of unionism in this country, and he has a thorough grip of the industrial movement.

                        <para>- I am proud to place it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> because I believe it gives effective expression to the trade union sentiment in Australia. I take full responsibility for saying that I believe that the bringing of trade unionists and industrial organizations within the scope of this bill is a sop thrown by the Government to the tories, and that an attempt to placate the trade unionist will be made when the amending industrial legislation is brought forward. The Government&#39;s method is to throw a sop to this side, and a concession to that. Time will prove whether my statement is correct. Neither the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> nor the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> can deny my right to the claim that I am as good an Australian as any other honorable member. Apart from the trade union movement, and apart from the parliamentary environment, I say that the Government, in bringing industrialists within the scope of this bill, has done great damage to Australia. These peaceable men, many of whom wear the medals of the returned soldier, and are now employed in mine, factory, and workshop, are to be branded as criminals. It is one of the most damnable pieces of legislation ever &#39;submitted to this Parliament, and one of the most injurious to Australia. The Prime Minister, almost with his tongue in his cheek, complained that the Canadian newspapers had published flaring headlines to the effect that Australia had been practically burnt out. He denounced the action of those newspapers, and said that he would like to have an arm long and strong enough to prevent such malign influence  from being exercised against the fair name of Australia. But what is his Government doing? The publication by Canadian newspapers of particulars of bush fires is a trifle compared with this bill. Figures supplied to me by the Commonwealth Statistician show that in one year Great Britain had four times as many strikes as Australia has had in twelve years. </para>

                        <para>- No, about seven times; the honorable member generally exaggerates when it suits his purpose. In Great Britain 85,000,000 days were lost in one year, and in the last twelve years in Australia only 21,000,000 days have been lost. The Government of Great Britain is not getting into a state of panic over that, although some people would like it to do so. A few months ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baldwin,</inline> by contrast with the action of the Prime Minister of Australia, asked the British Parliament to. vote &#163;15,000,000 to purchase industrial peace between the mine-owners and the miners. The scheme then inaugurated will expire in two months, and what will happen afterwards no one Knows. There are men in Great Britain, as there are in Australia, who desire to apply coercion. Is the honorable member aware that a conference of the Conservative party was held in Great Britain four months <inline font-style="italic">ago,</inline> at which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Baldwin)</inline> was considerably heckled? He was asked, &#34; Why do you not adopt Mussolini&#39;s methods in Great Britain ? &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baldwin,</inline> to his credit be it said, retorted, &#34; The British people will never tolerate a dictator over them.&#34; The matter did not end there. It was stated that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baldwin</inline> did not use his big majority in the House of Commons to deprive trade unionists in Great Britain of the right to contribute to. the political funds of their party, a private member would introduce a bill for that purpose. Important movements are being launched in Great Britain, and are drawing to their ranks influential ex-naval men. A plot is being hatched by a section of the. Conservative party to depose <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baldwin</inline> from the leadership of that party, because he will not go to title extreme lengths that are favoured by some of its members. History alone will disclose whether he finally accedes to their requests. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> very adroitly evaded the  point that was raised by the Leader  of  the Opposition by way of interjection luring the speech of the right honorable gentleman. He did not deal with the leader of the Fascists in Victoria, although he disclaimed any connexion with the movement, and denied that he was  sympathetic  towards it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hatcher</inline> is still an employee  of the Commonwealth Government, yet he continues to conduct correspondence relating to the movement. </para>

The Government is prepared io carry out that duty, having already adopted its own plans for that purpose. The Government had not thought it necessary to make public those plans and parade its willingness :md ability to do its duty, nor did it desire to assume what might have been regarded as a provocative attitude by enrolling several hundred thousand men.  However, I informed the  promoters  that there, was no objection to the  nauguration  of the body which doubtless will aid the Government by supplying classified lists of the men willing to place their services at the disposal of the country.&#34;

He knows a good deal about the Fascists, and that is the reason for his being upon the council. That organization has been established for the purpose of undermining trade unionism. There were indications of a similar movement when the British shipping trouble occurred in Australia, and other oversea dominions. A sailor who was on strike in Durban was asked, &#34;Why do you not settle these troubles in England?&#34; Ho said, &#34;What is the good of trying to settle them there ? When the crew goes down one side of the ship its places are filled by substitutes who come up the other side.&#34; Notwithstanding the disclaimers that have been made, this bill is designed for the purpose of damaging trade unionism in Australia. Honorable members will not deny that when trade unionists are treated at all decently they are prepared to listen to reason. If the working men of Australia were always treated decently, there would never be any trouble. Industrial disputes are invariably fomented by employers, but the employees are always blamed. Statements that were made upon his return to Australia by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> Neil, the representative of the Commonwealth Government at the Wembley Exhibition, are indicative of the view of many employers.

I have belonged to the printing trade union for a number of years. During the last 50 years there has been only one strike in that trade in Victoria, and it was of short duration. Round-table conferences have averted trouble. Many unions are working on a; similar basis. In all parts of the world trouble occurs most frequently amongst miners and waterside workers. Those who are acquainted with the conditions under which miners and waterside workers have to perform their duties are aware that they undertake some of the most disagreeable tasks that can be found. Apart from those industries, our industrial troubles are negligible. Dean Hart stated the case very well three months ago, when he wrote - </para>

                <para class="block">Australia has realized some of those ideals to a greater extent than other countries. But we should not cease our efforts to attain better conditions. We should not be content to lag behind other countries. We are in the van to-day, and there we should remain. It should be our aim to set an example to other countries. If our workmen are given conditions the like of which do not exist in any other part of the world, difficulty will not be experienced in inducing our own kith and kin to come to Australia. We largely lack organization. Frequently the employees are blamed for trouble that is caused byothers. I remember having read some time ago of an exhaustive investigation that was made in the United States of America regarding five or six important trade organizations. That investigation was carried out by a number of engineers and others. They submitted a table which showed where the fault lay. The United States of America is, next to Germany, the most organized industrial community in the world, and it was found that 75 per cent, of the blame was; due to the employers and a considerable percentage to failure of transport services. Therefore, it seems to me wrong for honorable members to place so much blame on the workers of Australia. There are other quotations I should like to make did time permit;  but  I wish to say definitely that I think we should have considered the other bil) before dealing with the Crimes Bill, thai this measure defames Australia, and thai while it remains on the statute-book ii will be an affront and an insult to trade  unionism in a country where there is less need than there may be in other parts of the world for drastic legislation of this kind. The people have a right to ask why, despite its big majority and its mandate from the country, the Government has introduced this bill. The proposition put forward by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> is feasible, reasonable and sensible. Nothing would tend to bring about more peace in the industrial world than the adoption of his suggestion that the provisions of the bill relating to industrial disturbance should be deleted. There is no need for them. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> E. Painter, the  president  of the Trades Hall Council in Melbourne, that instead of this bill making the operations of industry more peaceful than in the past, it will be an incentive to strikes, and will tend to create trouble. Prior to the election the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said the same thing of another measure. Although he now seems to have become one of the pawns on the chess board which can be very easily moved, I do not suppose there is any one on the other side of the chamber who understands the industrial conditions of Australia better than he does. In respect of such knowledge the present Ministry is sadly lacking. It is also without proper advice on such matters. I see no necessity for the bill, and I shall have exceptional pleasure in voting for the amendment, and if we reach the committee stage still greater pleasure in voting for the deletion of the clauses relating to industrial disturbances. I hope that sanity will prevail on the Ministerial benches, and that these clauses will be deleted. It is unworthy that a bill should be brought in to brand as criminals the finest body of men in the world, the trade unionists of Australia, who number 800,000. This is one of the most retrograde steps ever taken in this Parliament. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> referring to the proposal to take a ballot before a strike can be declared, put a pertinent question when he asked what could be done if a ballot decided in favour of a strike. The usual practice of trade organizations is to discuss matters exhaustively in open meeting, after which resolutions are passed to decide the issues at stake by ballot. In the union of which I am a member everything is done by ballot. After an educational discussion,&#39; the matter at issue is submitted to a ballot, and every member who is financial is entitled to record a vote. Honorable members opposite are talking about giving to the wives of unionists the right to vote at these ballots. I remember reading of a strike in the Maitland district of New South Wales, where the wives of the coal-miners organised, and as the &#34; blacklegs &#34; went along the path to the mine hurled at them epithets and stones. They told their husbands and sons on no account to resume work under existing conditions. . As a matter of fact, in industrial disputes the women are the greatest stickers when they have made up their minds. During the police strike in Victoria, the mother of a married policeman, having read in the paper that the police were on strike, went down to her son&#39;s house to see if he was out with the other policemen. When she knocked on the door, her daughterinlaw opened it. The mother said, &#34; Is Jack inor out? &#34;. The daughter-in-law, knowing what she meant, said, &#34;He is out.&#34; Whereupon the mother said. &#34; That is all right. Now I will come in.&#34; She would not have entered the house if her son had not gone on strike. That is an illustration of the spirit which actuates the women. I believe that if the wives of unionists are given votes in these ballots they will show themselves even more determined than the men at anytime of trouble. I have not met a member of a trade union who has not endorsed the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Painter,</inline> that this bill will be an incitement to strikes and disturbances, and will not bring about industrial peace in this community. It cannot be said too often, here or elsewhere, that this bill will not tend to bring about industrial peace. </para>

                    <para>. - Having listened very carefully to the debate on this most important measure, I am more than ever convinced that the Government, (in introducing it at the earliest moment, is simply keeping faith with the people.

                <para> General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> Sn moving the second reading of the bill. I thought the Minister gave a most lucid and clear explanation, which was of the greatest assistance to the ordinary mortals, who, like myself, do not belong to that great profession of which he and the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> and the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> are such distinguished members. I congratulate the Attorney-General most heartily on the speech he delivered. Ithas been repeatedly asserted during the debate that the Government did not receive a mandate from the people to introduce this legislation.; but I fail utterly to understand how any one can seriously make such a statement. We have heard much talk about democracy. I claim that we have in Australia the most democratic form of government in the world. We certainly have the broadest franchise, because any adult man or woman who does not happen to be in an asylum or a gaol, and possesses the necessary residential qualifications, is entitled to vote at elections for the Commonwealth Parliament. At the last election all adults not only had the right to vote, but were compelled to do so, and at the greatest poll that has ever been taken in Australia, by an overwhelming majority the. Government was returned to power on the issues on which it went to the country. In his very eloquent speech, the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> said that his party had not received the support of the young people who for the first time were exercising their right to vote. The honorable member seemed to suggest that they looked upon this right as they look upon the right to go to a picture show. I have not the faintest idea how their votes were cast at the last election, but I was particularly struck with the fact that they appeared to be more interested in the political questions then being discussed than they ever appeared to be before. I have not had much experience of elections, the last being only the third occasion on which I have stood for election; but it appeared to me that these young people were keener to grasp the situation, and went to the poll with a fair and adequate comprehension of the issues before them. Every Ministerial candidate made it abundantly clear that the most important issue at the election was the maintenance pf law and order and industrial &#39;peace. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> will agree with me that that was made wonderfully clear in Queensland. That it was the main issue, and I certainly endeavoured to impress that upon the people of the northern capital, though, perhaps, occasionally under somewhat difficult circumstances. We all realized that legislation on progressive lines was absolutely essential for this great Commonwealth, and that any government worthy of the name should do all it could to bring about industrial peace and get rid of, or at least diminish, the causes of industrial unrest. We all, I think, also agreed that the mo3t important question at the moment was the maintenance of constitutional government, and the particular issue immediately in the minds of the electors was the upheaval in the overseas transport services. I think it can be claimed that those who sought the suffrages of the people . as supporters of the Government made that quite clear. Honorable members of the Opposition were in a somewhat awkward position. I do not presume to reflect on them, either individually or as a party. I have never done so. I have not. the slightest doubt that they are just as keen to maintain law and order and constitutional government in this country as is any honorable member on this side, and I believe that a majority of their supporters are equally keen to do so; but I regret that on occasions honorable members opposite have failed at the critical moment to come out into the open and say so. I have no doubt that, had the Leader of the Opposition and those who support him stood behind the Prime Minister in his endeavour to bring about the cessation of trouble just prior to the elections, the personnel of the tenth Parliament of the Commonwealth would have been very different. While I am willing to admit that honorable members opposite are just as keen in their desire to uphold constitutional government as we are, I consider that when they could have greatly helped the cause of their party they  failed. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> and other honorable members on his side, maintain that they have no serious objection to the clauses of the bill dealing with unlawful associations. It is most gratifying to know that. </para>

                        <para>- I was at one time; but as honorable members. opposite have declared their readiness to support those clauses, all doubt is now removed. Towards the clauses relating to serious industrial disturbances, however, they adopt <inline font-style="italic">k</inline> different attitude. Personally, I repudiate the sinister suggestion that the Government has a desire to rob the trade unionists of rights for which they have fought for many years. No matter on which side of the House an honorable member sits, he must recognize that the unions have done a great deal to improve the conditions of the working man, and I hope that  they  &#62;vill continue to do so. We, on this side, cannot claim to have had experience with trade  unions  equal to that of honorable members opposite ; but I have spent much of my life in working, in the open spaces of western Queensland, among men who, for the most part, are members of thos? unions. Nobody can have greater respect for those men than I claim to have, and I would refuse to support any legislation intended to deprive them of any of thai rights. In my opinion, that is the last thing that the Prime Minister, or any honorable member on this side, would for &#163; moment think of doing. No honorable member opposite has pointed out that the drastic provisions of the bill can be applied only in matters of the greatest urgency, and under definitely sp&#39;ecified conditions. In the first place, there must be an industrial disturbance, such as an upheaval&#39; in connexion with our overseas or interstate transport services. Secondly, the Governor-General, by proclamation, must declare that a state of grave industrial unrest exists. No government, I  think,  would use that power lightly. In  the third place, any person to whom those clauses may be applied, must have  been  tried and found guilty before he can be deported. I have listened carefully to all the speeches on this measure, and in my limited experience in the House I regard it as one of the most important with which Parliament has ever been called upon to deal. I claim that the Government received a definite mandate to bring in this legislation. The people, by the vote that they gave on the 14th No vember, showed clearly that they approved of the legislation that the Government of the day passed prior to going to the country, and they approved of the Prime Minister&#39;s assertion that he would, if necessary, seek further power to deal with disturbances of the character referred to in the bill. I hope that the measure will have a speedy passage. Many requests, for its withdrawal have been made to the Prime Minister by honorable members opposite, but I seriously suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he should withdraw his amendment. Neither honorable members opposite, nor members of the great trade unions throughout Australia need be uneasy, because the bill cannot possibly do injustice to any citizen who observes the law. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with great interest to the debate, and particularly to the speeches from the Government side, of the House, and so much has already been said in support of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition that I intend to be somewhat brief in my remarks. A good deal of discussion has been directed to the second part of the bill which gives the Government power to issue a proclamation declaring that a serious industrial disturbance exists. Before referring to ,those provisions I propose to speak about the first part, which relates to unlawful associations. I have heard of nothing that would justify such drastic and reactionary proposals. The evidence adduced by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> in support of the &#171; theory that a real, revolutionary menace exists in Australia was very feeble. He quoted the cases of a few cranks whose main contribution to revolutionary violence has been an odd speech or two. Not one specific instance of revolutionary violence has been given by any honorable member opposite. The Attorney-General merely referred to one or &#39; two isolated and insignificant brawls that have occurred in certain Australian seaports, and the importance of those brawls has undoubtedly been magnified for political purposes by the daily press. The fact that they occurred during the electoral campaign has led many people to believe that they were engineered by agents of the Nationalist party, who sought to exploit the strike by terrorizing the public into believing that revolution -was imminent. The Government&#39;s justification of the bill is based largely on the strike of British seamen. That event resulted in the amending Immigration Act, generally known as the Deportation Act, and the failure of that measure led to the introduction of the present bill. The circumstances of that strike were exceptional, and such as are not likely to recur in Australia. It was a dispute foreign to this country, and one that could not be effectively controlled within it. The importance of that strike has been exaggerated in order to justify this measure. As the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> pointed out, it was trivial compared with great industrial upheavals of the past. I was connected with the Seamen&#39;s Union when the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> presided over strike conferences, and dictated tactics that would be characterized, under this measure, as sabotage. But to-day we find the right honorable gentleman whistling a different tune. Australia&#39;s industrial history, as has been said time after time by honorable members on this side, shows that repression and coercion have never been successful in settling these disputes; it is necessary to exercise sweet reasonableness and toleration. In the British seamen&#39;s strike this Government failed to mediate. The responsibility for what occurred lies largely at the door of the British ship-owners and of this Government for allowing the trouble to develop without taking steps to settle it. The only justification - if any - for the bill would be if Australia was in immediate danger of revolutionary violence and bloodshed, or if a state of war existed. When the Unlawful Associations Act was passed, Australia was at war, and although the Industrial Workers of the World, the organization at which that measure was principally directed, had been in existence for a considerable time, it was ignored by the Government until evidence was adduced that it was resorting to acts of violence. I am convinced, therefore, that this Government&#39; is insincere in introducing the present bill. It is trying to convince the people that there is danger when none exists. It is a bill to save the face of Ministers, and to justify the tactics to which they resorted during the election. Their unscrupulous, propaganda during the election is one of the most disgraceful episodes in Australia&#39;s history. The Government did not win on the issue of law and order versus revolution, but by resorting to misrepresentation and terrorizing the people by means of lying literature, which was broadcast throughout Australia. It was the money power that enabled , the Government to carry out its nefarious designs. It was Edmund Burke, the English statesman, who said - </para>

                <para class="block">This Government deluded the people into thinking that Australia was in peril of a revolution. To suggest that the electors gave the Government a mandate to introduce specific legislation of this character is manifestly absurd, for the bill is in direct conflict with the plausible speeches that the Prime Minister delivered during the election campaign when he posed as the champion of unionists, and said that they should have evenhanded - justice. The measure is based on anything but the principles of evenhanded justice, as the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> so eloquently pointed out; last night. As a matter of fact, it is one of the most drastic measures that has ever been introduced into a British Parliament. When the Government speaks about its mandate, it should remember that nearly half the electors affirmed their belief in the policy of the Labour party. The total number of votes cast for Labour candidates was 1,313,949, while that cast for Nationalists and Country party candidates was 1,593,533. It will be seen, therefore, that the Labour party polled within 279,584 votes of the Ministerial parties. Those .who voted Labour were the virile, industrial unionists, who believe in political and industrial freedom. This measure is more calculated, in my opinion, to increase revolutionary propaganda and industrial disturbance than to diminish them, as it is a direct challenge to those who voted for Labour. As my honoured leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> observed in his speech, the Government has put the cart before the horse. The first duty of the Government was to investigate the causes of cur industrial disputes, and try to devise remedies for them. Had it done that, we should have been able to discuss this matter in its proper order, and in quite a different psychological atmosphere. Had the Government even brought down its amendments to the Arbitration Act instead of this repressive and coercive measure, the position would have been better than it is. But if the proposed amendments of the Arbitration Act are of the same character as the proposals in this bill. God help the trade unionists of Australia and Australians generally. One of the chief factors in the promotion of industrial discord in Australia is the vexatious delays that occur in dealing with matters submitted to the Arbitration Court. Another is the maze of technical and legal detail that has to be traversed. Still another is the limitations imposed upon the court. Eight years of my life were spent in association with the Seamen&#39;s Union, and subsequently -in organizing clerical workers, so that I speak from considerable experience. I have had a good deal to do with Federal and State arbitration courts and wages boards, and also with special tribunals constituted by th&#187; Hughes Government, and I say positively that the atmosphere of the Arbitration Court increases the antagonism of the parties rather than decreases lt. The court does not create that spirit of amity and reasonableness which is necessary before, disputes can be amicably settled. Another unsatisfactory feature of the present arbitration machinery is that judges are appointed to the bench who are not properly qualified to deal with matters submitted to them. Our industrial tribunals should be free from every possible legal technicality, and from the legal rules governing evidence. We should enable the parties to get together in the unfettered way that we wish for parties that have to consider international issues. The most successful industrial tribunal of which I have had any experience was that constituted by the ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to deal with the shipbuilding industry during the war. One of the factors that led to its success, was that its <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Mr. Connington,</inline> was selected because of his wide experience and human understanding, rather than his legal knowledge. He brought to bear on the problems submitted to him a good practical knowledge. The proceedings of that tribunal were stripped of &#169;very vestige of captious technicality, and legal verbiage. Disputes were investigated without ceremony. The proceedings were of an informal nature. The parties were permitted to smoke, and generally to comport themselves in a free and easy way. I have heard the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> on more than one occasion, quote the ship-building tribunal as the most successful body of which he has had any experience, in settling industrial disputes. No strikes of any consequence occurred during its regime, and I believe that its decisions, generally speaking, were satisfactory to the Government and to those connected with the industry. I have not had very much experience of the coal tribunal, but I believe that it too has been successful. </para>

                        <para>- The alleged object of this bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> is to prevent industrial disturbances. My argument is that the Government could achieve that object much more effectively in another way. I believe that the coal tribunal has been successful, for it has enabled disputes to be discussed and dealt  with immediately they arose. The Government would be well advised to postj&#62;one further discussion qf this bill until we have had an opportunity to deal with the proposed amendments of the Arbitration; Act. We should then be in a better position to know the best course to take in regard to such persons as this measure is designed to deal with. The merit of the ship-building tribunal was that any worker could approach  it, no matter how trifling his grievance was. In passing, I point out that many big strikes have been caused by apparent trifles, but trifles which involved some great principle. If the conditions governing arbitration proceedings were liberalized, the Government would find that there would be no need for legislation like this. We have been- asked to offer suggestions as to how, in our opinion, industrial peace may best be conserved. May I respectfully suggest that seeing that the Government proposes to charge the trade unions with the maintenance of industrial peace by imposing certain statutory functions and rigorous penalties upon them, it should also oblige all workers to join the union covering the industry in Which they are engaged. The employment of non-unionists has, in the past, caused many industrial upheavals, and the Government could very easily remove this cause. If the- principle of unionism is sound when applied to the medical or legal profession, it should be equally sound when applied to other callings. </para>

                <para>One of the new duties which the workers have been taught is that they must get a voice in the control of industry. No matter what reactionary legislation the Government, by its majorities, may place on the statute-book, it will not be able to stifle the development of thought nor the progress of ideas. The democratization of the control of industry must ultimately be realized. As the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.- Scullin)</inline> has observed, the &#34; dehumanizing &#34; of industry has been largely responsible for the deeprooted antagonism, and the chasm of misunderstanding, that has accentuated the bitterness of our industrial disputes. If the Government really desires to improve the position I suggest that it should call a conference of all parties interested, to discuss the causes of our industrial troubles and suggest remedies for them. If the Government does not feel it could go so far as to call a general conference, it might appoint a royal commission to inquire into the matter, and recommend remedial measures. There is nothing of greater importance to the Commonwealth or to the welfare of the community generally than the provision of machinery for the equitable settlement of our industrial disputes. | </para>

                        <para>- This bill was drafted in a fit of party hatred and hysteria. . &#34;What is necessary is a dispassionate investigation of the causes of our industrial troubles, and the provision of some method of dealing with them- which will be acceptable to all parties affected. When this measure is placed on the statute-book, as it will be, and probably unamended, how is the Government going to cope with unions that refuse to accept the jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Court and go to the State tribunals instead? One effect of the measure may be to destroy the Federal Arbitration Court, or make it so unworkable that the unions will not tolerate it. Similarly, I believe the provisions for the repression of organizations which the Government deems to be of an unlawful character will not prevent revolutionary propaganda, but will probably drive it underground. The history of the world shows that, in its ultimate results, revolutionary propaganda is infinitely more dangerous when carried on secretly than when carried on openly. The history of &#34;Russia shows that revolution there was the result of the oppressions of czardom and the operations of secret societies. When in London, during the war, I stood in Trafalgar .Square and listened to great meetings being addressed by most violent speakers. They delivered the most violent denunciations of the British Government and the capitalist system, not merely unhindered and untrammelled, but under the protection of the London police. It would appear that the people of  Engand  have very sensibly determined that it is much better to have the safety valve of free speech and free discussion of these matters than to exercise repression and drive propaganda of this character underground. </para>

                <para class="block">Might I ask what is meant by &#34;revolution &#34; ? According to the dictionary definition, a revolution may , consist of a sudden change, not necessarily brought about by violence. A number of people in New South Wales to-day, influenced by party bitterness and hatred, say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> is a revolutionary, because, in their opinion, he is attempting to make a sudden change, which they regard as revolutionary, in the system of government of New South Wales. The failure of the Government to include in this billdefinitions of the terms used, will give power to those charged with the administration of the law which the Attorney-General may or may not intend them to have. I .submit that the terms used iu the bill should be clearly defined. There is surely a difference between the advocacy of immediate, revolutionary violence and the advocacy of ultimate revolutionary changes not necessarily by violence. So, again, as to the use of the word &#34; sabotage.&#34; To discover exactly what it means I have carefully searched Webster&#39;s dictionary and have carefully looked through French dictionaries. I should like to be informed what is the accepted definition of &#34; sabotage.&#39;&#39; I notice that the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell),</inline> is smiling. No doubt the honorable member believes that he knows what it is. </para>

                        <para>- I am not opposing the part of the bill dealing with unlawful associations, and I object to be trapped. I am criticizing it and am entitled to point out what I consider defects. Tho Attorney-General&#39;s interjection is most unfair, and I regret that he should have resorted to such tactics. &#34; Sabotage &#34; may mean quite a number of things. I have sought for its meaning and I find that the original meaning of the term was simply&#39; to go slow. When the system known as &#34; Ca canny &#34; was resorted to in England, the French Confederation of Workers found it difficult to find a French word which would describe it. It was much in favour with its spirit and with the ca canny tactics, and ultimately used the French expression <inline font-style="italic">Travailler</inline><inline font-style="italic">a coups de</inline><inline font-style="italic">sabots,</inline> meaning to work as one wearing wooden shoes, often applied to laggards, or slow-moving people.* &#39;.The  ori-  ginal definition then, of &#34;sabotage&#34; was &#34; go slow &#34;. I find that it is defined in an anti-strike law passed by the French Parliament as &#34; The wilful destruction, deterioration, or rendering useless of any instruments or other objects with a view to stopping or hampering work, industry, or commerce.&#34; I submit that a word of this character should be carefully defined in the bill. In its widest meaning, it might cover a regulation strike, a strict adherence, for instance, to the rules governing safety on railways, and other means of transport. It is altogether too wide a term to incorporate without definition in such drastic provisions of the law. The intention in the use of the term should be clearly stated, and should not be left as a matter to be haggled over by lawyers in receipt of fat fees. What, again, is the meaning of the term &#34; job control &#34; ? It might mean almost anything. I challenge the Attorney-General later in the discussion of the bill to define the term. I do not know what it is, although I have been associated with unionism now for over eighteen years. It might mean quite a number of things. It is used in the definition of &#34;strike&#34; in the proposed section 30j. It might refer to the action of one individual employed on a ship or in any industry. The term is far too indefinite to be incorporated in a bill of this character. Again, in the proposed section 30a any body of persons may be declared to be an unlawful association if by its constitution or propaganda or otherwise it advocates or encourages - </para>

                        <para>- Quite a number of people, as the honorable member suggests, probably consider the Government uncivilized, in its methods and administration, and in the legislation it proposes. Quite a number of honorable members on the other side no doubt consider that the Russian Government and the Chinese Government are uncivilized. I presume that under the bill as drafted, one might form as many associations as he pleased to plot against the organized governments of Russia, China, or any other country, which the Government might consider uncivilized, so long as no attack were made upon existing governments, adhering to what is colloquially termed &#34;capitalism.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- It is an organized government, and the people of Russia are entitled, without hindrance or discrimination, to say what form of government they will adopt. To turn attention briefly to the industrial features of the bill, the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has very effectively pointed out that the proposed section 30j, giving the Go- vernor-General power to proclaim the existence of a serious industrial disturbance, is certainly not in conformity with the principle of equality before the law, and the ordinary principles of justice. It is left a matter for the Government to determine whether a serious industrial disturbance exists. If we are to retain respect for the law, the question whether any serious industrial disturbance exists should be a matter for the determination of a court. It should not be a power placed in the hands of a government which may exercise it tyrannically, and, if we are to be guided by experience, probably will so exercise it. I affirm that it should be for a court to determine also the punishment to be imposed. Why should Ave  have a court vested with the power to inflict imprisonment and at the same time power given to deport by executive act. The right to impose punishment should not be divided as proposed, and the court should be vested with the power to inflict the full punishment prescribed for an offence under this or any law. The bill, as it stands, is not in accordance with the ordinary principle of the equality of all before the law. After all, the impartial administration and justice of a law is the whole foundation of respect for it. If the Government attempts to depart from these principles, in dealing with trade unionists, they cannot expect those provisionsto meet with general acceptance by the organized unions of Australia. This bill is a deliberate challenge to trades unionism, and immediately any government attempts to invoke the powers with which the present Government seeks to vest itself, under proposed section 30j, the resultant industrial trouble will be disastrous to Australia. </para>

The honorable member would have us believe that he is devoted to the interests of organized trade unions in Australia, but I think that I, in common with other honorable members on this side, who have been associated with unionism for years, have a better right to voice the opinions ofunionists than has any honorable member on the oposite side. This section of the bill is discriminatory and unjust. A just law should apply to all alike. This law will apply only to persons engaged in certain industries. I should like to hear, later on, from the Government side some definition of &#34; a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries or among the States.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- Before the luncheon adjournment I was pointing out that the principles upon which the proposed new sub-section 30j is based are in conflict with recognized principles of British justice. Particularly is that the case regarding the duality of punishment provided. A person found guilty of an offence is, under the sub-section, liable to imprisonment, and also to deportation at the will of the Minister. Against that I enter my emphatic protest. I now direct attention to other obnoxious proposals contained in the bill. The proposed new sub-section 8a provides for the arrest of persons without a warrant. I take it that, under the proposed new sub-section 30j, that could be applied to any person who, after a proclamation has been issued, happens to be associated with any strike. The proposed new sub-section 8a reads - </para>

                <para>It is possible that similar provisions already exist in other acts contend, however, that to vest such extraordinary powers in a constable will not be regarded with equanimity by the trade unionists who will be affected by this legislation. The general tenor of the bill is to force upon the unionist the onus of proving his innocence. In that respect it is in conflict with the fundamental principles of British justice. Generally, a person is considered to be innocent until his guilt has been proved; but this legislation provides that the accused person must establish his innocence. Moreover, he may first be imprisoned. If, later, he is proved to be innocent, he has no redress against the Government. I shall not deal with the general question of deportation, as, when the Immigration Bill was before the last Parliament, that subject was dealt with extensively. I wish to say, however, that deportation for civil offences is entirely obnoxious to me. Moreover, it is contrary to the democratic principles that have guided previous governments in this country. To suggest that the existing legislation does not give the Government power to deal with those individuals against whom action is contemplated, is so much piffle. The right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> during the election campaign, said that he would deport persons in certain circumstances. He added that the Government had the necessary residuary power to do so. That statement leads me to the conclusion that this bill is merely so much window-dressing to encourage the delusion that there is a real danger to constitutional government in Australia. The dissemination of that argument during the recent election campaign resulted in the return of the Government. I want to make my position clear in this connexion. I have no time for revolutionary action, nor do I believe in unlawful associations. In my remarks to-day I have pointed out what I consider to be dangerous deficiencies in the bill. Ky criticism has been directed towards securing an explanation from the Minister as to what certain terms and words used in it mean, or are intended to mean. So much depends upon the administration of this legislation that we should be careful to ensure that every clause is clearly expressed. We should know exactly what wo are doing, and what powers are being vested in the Government. The existence of the Labour party in politics is the best guarantee against revolution in Australia. If Labour ever loses faith in politics - and it can only do so as a result of reactionary legislation and class bias on the part of governments - the menace of revolution in Australia will become real. No serious danger exists in Australia to-day. The voting at the last State elections in New South Wales successfully showed that the menace of revolution is a bogy. The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> during the debate on this bill, alluded to the votes cast in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donald</inline> Grant, a candidate for the Senate in the recent election. That 28,000 votes were recorded in his favour has no special significance. In any case, that candidate was pledged to the constitutional methods embodied in the Labour party&#39;s platform; and if he did on one occasion espouse certain extreme doctrines which were in conflict with that platform, he does not espouse them now. It should not be forgotten that the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who now supports the Government; has in the past expressed himself in extremely revolutionary language. The same is true of certain persons iri another place - I refer to Senators Thomas and Pearce. If these men can change their convictions, and adapt themselves to a different political environment in order to enter Parliament, others can do the same. The only real test of the existence in Australia of communists has been when communist candidates have stood as such, and have sought the suffrages of the people. When they have done so, they have been overwhelmingly defeated. Numbers of electors in New South Wales gave their first preference votes to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> and their second preferences to Donald Grant. Others did the reverse. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The proposed new sub-section 30j establishes a new method of dealing with industrial disputes in the federal sphere which will have no corollary in the State sphere of arbitration legislation. Before introducing proposals of this character, the Government should have conferred with the State Governments in an effort to obtain co-ordination and uniformity. But nothing was done in that direction. This bill makes no attempt to deal with various other .influences on the body politic which are infinitely more dangerous in a social sense than are these allegedly unlawful associations, I allude to the market riggers, the profiteers, the land monopolists, and other elements which voted for Nationalist candidates in order to protect their own vested .interests. Instead of introducing  thi3  legislation, the Government should have* taken steps to give effect to its housing policy and to introduce a proper scheme of national insurance. The lack of adequate houses, the presence of slums, the existing unemployment, poverty, and want, comprise the fertile ground in which revolutionary discontent is bred. If the Government would tackle the housing problem with the same alacrity that it attacks trade unionism, or were to eliminate the vicious delays associated with arbitration procedure, it would do more to destroy the elements which it alleges exist and to prevent strikes than by introducing this legislation. I cannot credit the Government with any sincerity regarding this legislation. As the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahony)</inline> said, it is so much political humbug in an attempt to justify the false and dishonest issues upon which the last election was decided. Any government which gains power dishonestly will not endure long. The people were deluded by the vicious methods adopted by the Government in connexion with the recent election, but when another opportunity is afforded to them they will reverse their decision. </para>

                <para class="block">Had the bill gone further it would have been more in accordance with the mandate recently received from the people. A good deal has been said regarding technical questions, party bias, and the finding of the High Court. To me, as a layman, the finding of the High Court does not mitigate the offences which certain men - Walsh,  Johannsen,  and others - have committed against the people of Australia. Sitting, as it were, as a grand jury, the people have endorsed the policy of the composite Government regarding the necessity for deporting those persons who commit certain offences against the community. The High Court did not say that the Commonwealth has no power to deport; the case against Walsh and  Johannsen  failed because of legal technicalities. The Opposition, therefore, has no justification for the boasting in which the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has indulged. The fact remains that a democratic people, in a democratic way, decided that these individuals had committed a grievous offence. I was displeased to hear certain statements by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. .Coleman).</inline> He spoke of the tremendous revolution that might come about owing to the offence given to the trade unions by the passing of this bill. I admit that the trade unions are entitled to the same rights that are enjoyed by other sections of the community, but not to all the rights of the community. Many honorable members opposite, by their remarks, offer great offence to the trade unions, because the bill, if I read it correctly, is aimed, not at trade unions, but at offenders against the law. This country, possibly more than any other, by constitutional methods and at great expense, has set about to adopt means and to introduce legislation to bring about peace, harmony, and goodwill in the community. When the government of a democratic country does its utmost to ensure a fair deal to everybody, there should be punitive legislation passed to keep every section in its proper place. The members of the Opposition have taken it for granted that this bill is aimed at the overthrow of legitimate trade unions, and they say that it is an infringement on the right of free speech; but I Would point out that there is a great difference between the right of free speech and the matters with which this bill deals. Notable leaders of Labour hold this view. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> the Premier of the Labour Government of New South Wales, is able to discern a difference between free speech and the aims of the Industrial Workers of the World. He said- </para>

                <para class="block">We can obtain no finer distinction than that to illustrate the difference between free speech and the aims of those persons with whom this bill seeks to deal - those who are avowedly bent on destroying our political and social institutions. There is no more democratic country in the world than Australia, and no more democratic parliament than this Federal Parliament, both Houses being elected on adult franchise. The people elect this Parliament, and expect it to govern them. The issue that is before the House at this moment was clearly put before the people of Australia by the different political parties. I marvel that the Opposition is not more chastened than it appears to be. We hear much the same kind of talk and threats now as we heard before the elections, and this attitude I cannot understand. Included in the Labour literature that was distributed during the election in my electorate, at any rate, were quotations from Magna Charta ad lib., and also Abraham Lincoln&#39;s historic definition of democratic government - government of the people, by the people, for the people. If the Opposition agrees with that, I am quite satisfied that this side of the House does also. I maintain that if Abraham Lincoln could see the democratic government of Australia as it is to-day, he would rejoice beyond measure, because it practically fulfils his idea of a democracy. The people were asked to decide, and, as it were, sat as a grand jury an the question whether a few wreckers who came here avowedly to upset the principle of democratic government should be permitted to go beyond free speech, and whether Parliament, as set up by the people themselves, &#39; should have power to deal with such miscreants. That is the position. When people representing labour unions say that the bill is an affront to them, their statement is really an affront to the unions, because the bill does not seek to upset labour unions, or to interfere with any of their law-abiding members. It is aimed at those persons who act contrary to the will of the people as expressed at the ballot-box. It has been stated in this House that the bill is a reflection on the labour unions. What about the reflection on other sections of the community? Are labour unions to be a special and privileged class in Australia? They certainly have the right to hold their place in the community, but if the people of Australia say that they want their goods carried by sea or by land, so that they may be fed regularly and their industries continued without interruption, why should the members of any section be able to say to them, although they have committed no offence, &#34; You can starve until we have settled our differences?&#34; This Parliament was elected by the majority of the electors, under a democratic franchise, to protect the people. Are they to occupy a servile position because of the threats which have been voiced by the Opposition? </para>

                        <para>- I submit that my remarks have a lot to do with the charges made in this House. The Opposition, having challenged the Government to go to the country, set up a hue and cry that the people were sane enough to ignore. The electors have sent&#39; back, stronger than ever, a Ministry pledged to govern on democratic lines. It was very difficult to find among the people who work all the year round in Queensland to raise crops that will  show a profit any who would vote for men who were out to subvert our system of government. It was very difficult to advance any argument that would induce them to vote for a system that would allow their produce to rot on the ground. The potato-growers of Western Australia, who had a good crop, and could have obtained ?12 a ton for it, could not be persuaded to vote for a party that prevented them from marketing their produce when that price was obtainable. Shipping was . held up because somebody jambed his finger in a door. Labour claims to represent a certain number of electors, many of whom would have voted for the National party but for their sense of solidarity. The Australian people are peace-loving, and are ready to vote for a full democracy. </para>

If he represents the views of the people of Western Australia, that explains why they have to &#39; obtain revenue from the other States to pay their debts. The Government certainly has a mandate, but obtained it by abuse, by ridicule, and by giving to its political opponents repulsive names. Leading articles in the newspapers have told the Government that it succeeded at the elections by discreditable means.

                    <para>On this issue, in spite of the corruption of the press and the deliberate perversion of facts to delude the people, a big proportion of the people refused to be deluded. Their vote was tremendously significant. In every industrial centre the people were unafraid in the face of one of the most unscrupulous campaigns ever embarked upon. Under the law as it stands to-day no citizen from another land, even from Britain or America, dare express opinions adverse to the existing authority. It is questionable if Mussolini, in Italy, possesses a much greater power over the liberties of the people than may be exercised by the Government in Australia. All legal rights seem to have been abrogated, and the offending indus- trial leader is at the mercy of a puppet board created as occasion demands and manned by officials so highly paid as to savour of bribery. Labour has put up a wonderful performance in the face of heavy handicaps. It has emerged still the challenging party, preaching a progressive policy. It is the most powerful single party in Australia, and its challenge must be met. The fact that the opponents of Labour have been forced to commit unconstitutional acts in violation of every principle of freedom to uphold their cause is an evidence of their weakness. Labour has kept its balance in spite of the temptation, and calmly and deliberately it must oppose itself to the principle of deportation - for every citizen the right of opinion, the right of publication, the right of open advocacy; for every citizen trial by a jury of his peers, for every citizen the punishment only which the law provides. Anything less than this is intolerable and must be resisted fearlessly, not alone by- the Labour party, but by all who profess faith in democracy as the final solvent of the world&#39;s problems. </para>

                <para class="block">That article did not appear in a Labour publication; it was written by a gentleman of literary ability, whose views are a true reflex of those of many people in this country. Does any supporter of the Government think that the Government would be in power to-day if it had not improperly used the maritime strike to influence the electors? Is it not admitted that if the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> had been Prime Minister, there would have been no maritime dispute? Every one is beginning to realize that the Prime Minister did not rise to that occasion, and he was probably prevented from doing so by the influence exerted upon. him. Whether that influence came from the Melbourne Club, or from his coterie of friends in Melbourne, I do not know, but I am satisfied that influence was brought to bear, and that it has placed him in a position of which he is not proud to-day. Speeches by honorable members on this side have emphasized the importance of labour unions, and have shown, that they are the backbone of the country. The trade unions have been the pioneers ofall the liberties we enjoy to-day, and have done their share to bring about the social reforms which spell happiness to the people. When I contrast the conditions of to-day with those of my boyhood, I realize how much the working class movement has achieved. I supported free secular education in London, and when I came to Australia the idea was in embryo here, and I had the pleasure of assisting at its birth. I ask honorable members to bear in mind how the Labour party persevered with technical education, and how, when it got into power, it made free education - from the primary  schools to the universities - the right of all intellectual boys and girls. Members of the legal and medical professions enjoy educational facilities provided for them by the Labour party. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> and other members of the learned professions, had opportunities that were not available in my time. He was able to go to a high school at Grafton, and later to a university. Many of those who profit so much b}&#39; the boon of free education denounce socialization at every opportunity. Many men in the public life of Australia to-day have benefited by the socialization of education, which was made possible by the energy with which I and others agitated for that ideal. As a boy in 1866, in London, I was hit on the head by a police constable for daring, with others, to assist to uphold the right to free speech in the public parks. There were very few unions in those days; possibly not more than fourteen or fifteen. In 1867 a royal commission was appointed in Great Britain to inquire into the organization and rules of trade unions. The members of the commission were <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Erie, the Earl of Lichfield, Lord Elcho, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Walker Head,- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Daniel</inline> Gooch, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herman</inline> Merivale, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Booth, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roebuck, Mr. Thomas</inline> Hughes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frederic</inline> Harrison, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Mathews. They examined witnesses in all classes of society. They wanted to ascertain, if possible, what was the spirit that actuated trade unionists in their stand, and their willingness to bear punishment with great fortitude in defence of what they believed &#39;to be right. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Hughes and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frederic</inline> Harrison were eminent barristers. A quotation from the evidence of one of the witnesses, taken from Somers&#39; <inline font-style="italic">The Trade Unions,</inline> is interesting, because it shows the spirit of trade unionism.

                <para class="block">Mention has been made in this debate of the unfortunate maritime strike. A reference has also been made to the mining industry. My leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> knows that for a number of years I held a prominent position in the Sydney Trades and Labour Council. I have found mine-owners and ship-owners to be the most cruel and unmerciful of employers. On one occasion, with the secretary of the miner&#39;s association, I interviewed a mining proprietor. The men haddecided that the mine was not in a safe condition; they maintained that more ventilation should be provided in the working face. The secretary argued some of the legal points with the proprietor, but did not appear to make any impression upon him. I then interposed, and said, &#34;Do I understand that you give no consideration to the fact that the livelihood of these men is taken from them for the present?&#34; He replied, &#34;We are determined to do nothing. We do not care whether they come back or not. If they remain out for twelve months I shall still have my commodity when they return.&#34; On another occasion the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and I received a similar reply from tie ship-owners. Because Chinese were being employed, we prevented the Australian Steam Navigation Company from carrying on its operations in Sydney. We interviewed the  chairman  of the board of directors, who was a very prominent public man. He said, &#34; I cannot do anything; the board has decided to bring these Chinese here.&#34; Public opinion was so strongly opposed to the practice, however, that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes informed that company that it would have to dispense with the Chinese. The principles underlying this bill are as conservative as those by which governments in Great Britain were guided between the years 1832 and 1842. During that period the government of the day brought down the Conspiracy Bill, which provided that when two or more persons gathered together they could be charged with conspiracy. Honorable members may be surprised to learn the result of that measure. A few years later the unions were legally recognized, and friendly societies were brought into existence. The meetings of those societies were held on Sundays, and they were opened and closed with prayer, in order to defeat the law. Let us come nearer home. The conscription proposals that were rejected by the people of Australia were similar to those that are contained in this bill. The Labour party opposed conscription because it believed that the object was to enable the Government to proclaim a state of martial law in order to injure the tradeunions. There was no necessity for those provisions at that time, because between 16,000 and 18,000 young Australians were then ready to leave Australia for the front, and no ship was available to transport them. The same tory spirit is at work to-day in an endeavour to take away the privileges of those industrial organizations, which have done so much for social and moral reform, and have developed a standard of living in Australia that is a model to the rest of the world. I should like to point out that the bill is likely to affect members of the British Medical Association, who have adopted preference to unionists. </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable member knows that there are two forms of revolution. There is the peaceful form - obtained by constitutional means - which honorable members of the Labour party seek to bring about, and there is the violent revolution, for which we do not stand. There is hardly a progressive body of men in Australia to-day that is not beholden to organization for its present position. The British Medical Association is strong because it would not stand for non-unionism. I remember reading in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> of a case which occurred in Adelaide two years ago. When a medical man, who was not a member of the association, came to the hospital to administer an anaesthetic to his patient, upon whom a dangerous operation had to be performed without the slightest delay, the chief medical man in the hospital said that he would have nothing to do with the case if the other came near it. The Leader of the Opposition has said what was said repeatedly during the last election by members of the Labour party, that undesirable persons should be punished. They can be punished under the law which exists to-day, if the Government will only take the necessary action. Under this proposed law, however, the young fellow who delivers a dodger to a house, or the householder who permits that dodger to remain on his premises, can be brought before a court and at once made a criminal, and afterwards deported. In passing, I note that under the provisions of this bill a person who has been fined for negligently driving a motor car can be declared an habitual criminal. When I first read the measure </para>

                <para class="block">I formed the impression that the Attorney-General was a unificationist, because the bill seeks to assume so many State powers. I shall not fall out with him in that respect. It was only the other day that we had one of his predecessors, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irving, pointing out that the Senate was exceeding its powers under the Constitution. It is not my view of the result of the recent election that the Government has been given a free hand to bring in this kind of legislation. I believe that the people of Australia agree with honorable members on this side of the House that any person in Australia who is a criminal should be punished under the law. No party is a greater upholder of the Constitution than is the Labour party. &#34;No party could have paid greater respect to the law than we did when in power. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> gave us a definition of &#34; sabotage.&#34; The first time I ever heard the word used was in connexion with a strike which took place 40 years ago on the French railways. The general conclusion then formed was that the French unionists had made use of their clogs or sabots on the hind-quarters of the men who had taken their places. The Assistant Librarian tells me that the word was used during the French revolution. I do not like the definition of &#34;revolution&#34; provided in the bill. It is too indefinite. Honorable members of the Labour party are in favour of peaceful revolution. In fact those words appear in the original constitution of the party. There should be no ambiguity about our laws.. It will be an easy matter to bring men under the operation of this law, particularly when non-unionists are brought  to work side by side with unionists. When the  Hon.  Andrew Garran, father of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran, the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, was a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales, he was  chairman  of a royal commission which took a considerable amount of evidence and drew up a voluminous report. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, whose environment wes different in those days, when he was working in a coal-mine at Lithgow, appeared before the commission, and when asked whether unionists and non-unionists would work together, replied that if there was one thing certain on this earth, it was that unionists and non-unionists would not agree to work together - there was no possibility of it. We never know what bother &#39; is likely to grow out of an attempt to compel unionists to work side by side with non-unionists. It is well known that, in some factories or mines, outsiders have been brought in for the purpose -&#34;of creating a disturbance, so that the owners might have some excuse for closing down. Nothing will bring about industrial disturbance more than bringing in non-unionists to work alongside unionists. The unionist who will work alongside a non-unionist is not worth bothering about. He is a mental abortion. When a Labour Government was in power in the Commonwealth, it made provision for granting preference to unionists in the Commonwealth Public Service. The principle was to be applied in connexion with an industrial award, but as soon as a change of government took &#93;)lace, the public servants were, deprived of that preference. The courts are supposed to be impartial, but judges &#39;are only human, and we know &#39; that governments have a remarkable influence even on the judiciary. Under this measure, a state of industrial unrest may at any time be proclaimed, and all who have fought for the principle of preference to unionists can be brought within the scope of the bill. As soon as persons are declared to have committed a crime they may be deported by order of the Minister. Has similar legislation been passed in any other part of the world? The tory governments of Great Britain have never proposed such a measure. England has been for centuries the refuge of rebels from the Continent. When I was in London, I knew where to find M. Thiers, the great Frenchman, who eventually had to be recalled to save France from ruin. Britain has sheltered many great intellects who have been banished from Russia and Germany. It is stupid to be afraid of men because they have advanced views. Take the two persons about whom there has been such a storm. On the only occasion when I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh</inline> address a public meeting, I thought that he showed a fine spirit. He said that the deputation that waited on the Prime Minister with regard to the reduction of the British seamen&#39;s wages was informed that the decrease was due to competition. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh</inline> pointed out that if the seamen had .consented to a reduction of wages because of foreign competition, a further reduction would have been made by the competitors of the British shipowners. This would have been followed by another reduction in&#39; the pay of the British seamen, and he would have been a traitor to them if he had acted other than in the way he did. Many of those who have heaped abuse on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh</inline> are not fit to -tie his boot laces. He showed that he was true to the seamen&#39;s cause. The platform of the Labour party is based on humanitarian ideals, a basis &#39;from which the party has never flinched. Even during the ordeal of the last campaign Labour men remained loyal to those who needed their help. The Government, with its majority, can do as it likes at the present time; but members of the Opposition have high ideals of their responsibility as representatives of the people. The party opposite is prepared to do anything that will enable it to cling to office and stem the tide qf industrial progress. The merchants, land-owners, and shopkeepers could not obtain a living unless the industrial section of the community was able to purchase their goods and occupy their premises. By its opposition to Part II. of the bill, the Labour party is loyal, not only to its own cause, but also to that of the people as a whole. The Attorney-General made a great mistake in introducing the measure. He should have consulted honorable members on the Labour side and obtained their assistance in framing it. Even now it is not. too late to amend the bill. The persons sought to be dealt with are few in number; but, as a result of great labour on the part of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, the Government has brought down a bill that is to serve as an excuse for striking a blow at organized labour. I remind the Government that there is  nothing clever in what it proposes to do. The difference between the total number of electors who supported the Government and the number who favoured Labour candidates is not great. Compulsory voting operated to the detriment of the Opposition, because persons who had refrained from exercising their franchise at previous elections were misled. They realize now that they made a mistake, and when they get an opportunity they will remedy it. I hope that every honorable member on my side will state his reasons for his attitude on the bill. The political Labour movement is to be found in every capitalistic country, and Australia has a golden opportunity, with its comparatively small population, to set an example of advanced democratic ruleto older countries where the population is large and progress very slow. This is the best educated democracy in the world. Revolution, or any disturbance of that kind, need not be feared. After the Napoleonic wars, only one person in every five in Great Britain was able to read and write. When I first joined a friendly society, I had to read an agreement to four of my fellow members, and I had to write their names, because they could make only a cross. But that day is gone. The people of Australia resent the stigma that has been placed upon their good character by the introduction of this measure. I trust that even at this late hour the Attorney-General will see the error of his ways and cause the bill to be withdrawn. I cannot understand how a man of his education and position could have introduced it in the first place, but I put it down to youthful folly. I wish to inform the Government that my constituents - and their quality may be judged by the member that they have selected to represent them - are watching the fate of this bill with keen interest. They will.be indignant if it should be placed upon the statute-book. It is unfortunate that the supporters of the Government are so conservative. The Government represents, very largely, primary and commercial interests, and it is well known that primary producers, the world over, hold tory views, One has only to read a little history to be convinced that land-holders have in the past been the greatest tyrants in the world. Irish and Scottish history is particularly emphatic on that point. I well remember the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid observing, on one occasion, in a conversation at the Athenseum Club, that when once Scotchmen left their homeland for Australia they were certain to reside permanently in this country. It is distressing that the Government should have thought it neces sary to have power like this to deal with industrialists. When I was last in Dorsetshire I went with a friend to see the granite monument that was erected at Ringwood in memory of the stout-hearted workmen who many years ago suffered deportation for seven years because they had the temerity to claim an increase of 1s. a week - from 7s. to 8s. - in their wages. We have industrialists in Australia of the same strong character - excellent citizens. Honorable members probably remember the great strike of the Queensland shearers&#39; to secure better conditions. The men were obliged, at. the lime they struck to sleep on the bare earth at night, and in wet weather they had no. covering whatever. Their fight was successful, although they were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. That they werenot worthless wasters was proved by the fact that one of them later became  Speaker  of the Queensland Parliament. I feel sure that, in his heart, the Attorney-General does not endorse the provisions of this measure, for in the two hours that he occupied in introducing it, he dealt with almost everything under the sun except the bill. If he had a good ease he would have stated it clearly and concisely. He would have done as the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> does when he has a good case in the Criminal Court - dispose of it quickly. I trust that when honorable members who support the Government meet in caucus on Thursday next they will see that the Attorney-General&#39;s attention is directed to my remarks; and I believe that they will come to the conclusion, after calm consideration of the whole position, that there are no such scoundrels in Australia as some of them have suggested. I hope that the Prime Minister will reconsider the position, and that, in consequence, the bill will be withdrawn. </para>

                        <para>.- In consequence of the earnest desire of the general public to have some assurance from the Government that every precaution was taken to ensure the safety of the men who were the victims of the shocking aeroplane fatality at Canberra yesterday, I wish to ask the Government for some information. I should like to know whether the aeroplane that was used was in a proper state of repair, whether it was recently inspected and whether it was an old machine, unfit for service ? Has the Air Board yet submitted a report on the matter? If so, will the Government make it available at once? If no report has been submitted, I trust that one has been requested, and that it will be presented to honorable members immediately the House meets on Wednesday next. It has been substantially reported in Melbourne this afternoon that the plane that the men were using was out of repair, out of date, and altogether unsafe. I trust that the Minister will be able to satisfy us that the report is not according to the facts. </para>

                        <para>. -  I regret that the honorable member should have referred to this matter now. He must know that in the case of a serious accident of this nature from which, unfortunately, two deaths &#39;have resulted, an extremely careful inquiry will certainly be held at a very early date. It is impossible at present to give any more than the bare facte. The machines used were carefully overhauled at the Richmond Aerodrome one or two days before they proceeded on this duty. They arrived perfectly safely at Canberra at about 11 a.m. yesterday morning. One landed successfully. It would appear that the engine of the othermachine stalled, and, as the plane was only 150 feet above the ground, the pilot had not an opportunity to right it. The machine crashed and broke into flames, and, unfortunately, as I say with deep regret, two deaths have occurred as the result. An official inquiry into the accident will be held at an early date, and the result of that inquiry will be published. I shall bring a complete report of the inquiry before the House. I object very strongly to the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> even insinuat  ing, is connexion with a department conducted as the Air Force is, any reflection upon the senior officers that they would allow a defective aeroplane to proceed either with passengers or with members of the Air Force, and thus wilfully or deliberately imperil the lives of men. </para>
