                        <para>- It was generally understood, in this House, that the sale by prospectors of mining leases would be free of income taxation. I am in possession of correspondence in which the Deputy Commissioner for Western Australia insists that sales of mining leases axe subject to taxation under section 16a, dealing with businesses generally. I. ask the Treasurer whether, as a matter of fact, the sale of mining leases by prospectors, or those who assist prospectors, is free of income taxation as indicated by the Government some time ago. </para>

                        <para>Arsenic on apples -Governor-General&#39;s telegram to Secretary of State dated 23rd January. Have seen MacFadden - statement attributed to him distorted. He says that no alterations have been made as to percentage of arsenic which will condemn fruit. Royal Commission arsenic in foodstuffs 1903 recommended that anything above one-hundreth grain per pound should be considered deleterious.This recommendation has become officially recognized - no proposed alteration. Examination of apples has been made on this basis for many years past, but probable that examination more or less perfunctory. Scare cause by finding excessive percentage of arsenic on American apples, and successful prosecution of retailers will lead to examination in the future being very much more stringent, also fruit passed by port medical authorities is not exempt from subsequent examination by local health authorities. Analyses of American fruit have shown large proportion of arsenic deposit occurring stalk and calyx. Trouble being accentuated by press publicity. </para>

The provisions in that part represent an endeavour by the Government to obey a clear and definite mandate of the people, authenticated and emphasized by one of the greatest ministerial majorities in the history of this Parliament. Any suggestion to the contrary is sufficiently answered by a comparison of the number of honorable members sitting in opposition with that on this side of the chamber. The mandate of the people was clear and unmistakable. When the Prime Minister went before t.he electors of Australia he said - </para>

Although under our Constitution there is  a  King&#39;s peace of the Commonwealth which co-exists side by side with the King&#39;s peace within each  of  the States, up to this date in the history of Australia there has been little need for the Commonwealth to take action for its preservation. Generally speaking, the authorities and laws of the States have been adequate to deal with what may be generally regarded as breaches of the King&#39;s peace.  Recent  happenings have clearly demonstrated the existence of actions prejudicial to the peace of the Commonwealth. The time has now arrived when the Commonwealth Parliament Bould exercise its powers and pass effective legislation to deal with offences against the peace of the Commonwealth, including action against those persons who are actively engaged in associations and propaganda work having as their object the overthrow of the Constitution, interference with Commonwealth activities, resistance to its laws, and generally taking part in unlawful action for the purpose of subverting external and internal commerce and intercourse in Australia. </para>

An inquiry into the position that was taken up by honorable members of the Opposition immediately prior to and during  the recent election campaign justifies my claim for their support.

                            <para>- The Leader of the Opposition challenged the Prime Minister to go to the country upon this issue - the enforcement of Commonwealth law. The honorable gentleman&#39;s challenge was issued during . the &#39; discussion, in this House, of the Peace Officers Bill. That bill contained merely proposals for the appointment of agents of the Commonwealth to enforce its laws. The Prime Minister went to the country, and with the result of his appeal we are now well acquainted. </para>

                            <para>- When it went before the people, the Opposition found itself in a somewhat difficult position. It balanced itself, rather precariously, between two different propositions. The first proposition was that there was no necessity for special legislation, or for action of a special character. That is substantially the matter with which I have to deal this afternoon, and I am prepared to accept the onus that is laid upon me. I shall endeavour to convince this House with evidence that there is need for action of the nature provided for in this bill. During the election campaign the contention of the Opposition that there was no need for action was rather discounted by several events, which had unfortunate  effects upon the public, and which proved particularly disastrous to the prospects of Labour candidates : I refer to the happenings at Fremantle, Cairns, and Gladstone. Those events furnished evidence sufficient to satisfy the people that there was need for action in the direction provided for in the&#39; bill. The alternative proposition of the Opposition was that the Government was making, or intended to make, an insidious attack upon trade unionism, and upon the workers of Australia generally. </para>

                            <para>- The weakness of the Opposition. . in this House today is a sufficient answer to that charge, because it indicates the opinion of the workers of Australia. No Government can hold power in this Commonwealth if it is not supported by a tremendous body of workers and a large number of trade unionists. It is absolutely impossible for. a party to be returned to this House if it is to a large extent opposed by the workers of Australia. The suggestion that is sometimes made, that certain honorable members who sit here and are at present in the majority, represent some mythical interests that are occasionally designated by the name &#34;Fat,&#34; is entirely unfounded. There cannot be the slightest justification for making such a charge in a country that enjoys adult suffrage. </para>

                            <para>- Except when it occasionally slips because of nervousness of timidity, the Opposition is a party of law and order. I have never said, nor do I say now, that the Labour party seeks to attain its objects by violence. The platform of the Labour party - about which, by the way, one hears very little at election time - makes it perfectly plain that that party aims at securing its objects by constitutional methods. There cannot be the slightest objection to that. We on this side of the House hold views that are different from those which are held by honorable members opposite, but we are all entitled to uphold our views by fair argument. The Labour  party  rightly says that it is a party of law and order. As every member returned at the recent election represents either the party of law and order that sits on this side of the House or the party of law and order that sits on the other side of the House, I claim a unanimous verdict from honorable members in favour of the maintenance of law and order.- But the maintenance of law and order requires something more than lip service; it requires action when the necessity arises. The reason for there being such a large  majority  of honorable members on this side of the House is that- the electors were satisfied that the Government, rather than the Opposition, was prepared to act when the necessity arose. </para>

                    <para>I propose to refer first to the facts and circumstances which make this legislation necessary an Australia, and T ask honorable members to believe that, although I may begin by discussing some general considerations. I am coming right down to the very facts that exist in the Commonwealth. Then, after mentioning these facts and circumstances, I shall speak of some of the general principles which have been held in view in drawing up the new proposals. After that, I shall deal with the specific remedies proposed in relation, more particularly, to the recent decision of the High Court, which I intend to examine.&#39; </para>
                    <para>In the first place, I desire to say something about the facts and  circumstances rendering this legislation necessary, and in doing so I propose to omit reference to matters which are very relevant and important in this respect, but which, being of quite recent occurrence, are present in the minds of all honorable members. I do not propose to occupy the time of the House with the significant incidents at Fremantle, when the State Ministry had to send down 100 armed police to the wharf, or to the incidents at Cairns and Gladstone, which are well known to all honorable members, or to the interference with the mails of the Commonwealth in Queensland during the railway strike, or to the interference with our quarantine officials on an earlier occasion at Fremantle. I take it that all honorable members are fully acquainted with the facts of those specific cases. Then again, I am not proposing to reiterate the facts, significant as they are, of the British seamen&#39;s strike, although they are very relevant matter. Nor, to mention the last matter that I propose to exclude, shall I refer to the conference of trade unions held in Sydney for the purpose of making arrangements to resist by force the application of a Commonwealth law by means of a general strike, instead of . taking the matter to the courts of the country. Ultimately that conference decided to test the law in the courts, which was a perfectly proper course to adopt. There is a great difference between forming an organization to resist the application of a law by force - by a general strike - and resisting it by litigation. </para>
                    <para>But I do propose to refer to some other facts that are perhaps not as generally and as well known in Australia as they ought to be - facts that are believed to be characteristic only of other countries overseas - and to submit, that these facts establish that a definite systematic organization is at work in Australia to overthrow by violence of any available kind the constitutional and democratic government of this country. Our system of government rests upon the ballot-box. This Parliament represents the will of the majority of the free citizens of the Commonwealth, who are governed by the laws which they themselves make through their representatives. Those laws are made under a constitution which is itself alterable at the will of the people, duly expressed. Accordingly, anything is within the reach of the people of Australia which a majority of them desire. But in these days the majority has to protect itself against determined, unscrupulous, and violent minorities. Our personal liberty, our political and social rights, depend upon the maintenance of a free and democratic government. There is, however, a small but growing body of men in. Australia, who, inspired by foreign ideals, deliberately seek the destruction of Australian democracy. This section, though small, is not a negligible body of men. I have spoken on this subject on other occasions, and I apologize for introducing a personal note at this stage. I have frequently said that there are very few communists in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I said it during the election, and I have said so since, but I have added that, though their number is small, they should not, therefore, be overlooked, because it is far better to deal with some things in the early stages than wait until they have assumed dangerous proportions when it may be impossible to deal effectively with them. I have said numbers of times, and I repeat it here, that I do not either directly or indirectly suggest that, in the ordinary sense, the Labour party is a communistic party, or is allied with communists. I desire to make that perfectly plain. I bring this measure before the House as legislation that ought to be accepted by every honorable member who believes in Australians determining their own destiny. But there are persons here who organize a deliberate propaganda of hate, and who live and batten on class war. I shall give evidence as to who some of these individuals are. There are persons in Australia whose deliberate object it is to promote every species of dissension, unhappiness, and discontent, because only by so doing can they attain their sinister ends. These are the persons who mouth in Australia the catch-words of foreigners, which were invented for the purpose of appealing to the down-trodden proletariat of certain European countries. They talk of the proletariat! What does the word signify? An absolutely poor, suppressed, and helpless mass of men and women with nothing but their labour to sell, with no political power, and with no protection against exploitation. There is no proletariat in Australia. Any doctrines founded upon its supposed existence in this country are doctrines which, in their actual practice, can be intended only to produce a proletariat here, so as to make a discontented class which may render certain designs possible of accomplishment. Take the figures relating to the ownership of homes in the Commonwealth, the banking accounts of the people, insurance, and our arbitration arrangements, and wages boards. Consider the equal political rights that prevail throughout this continent, and then talk of a proletariat, and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Here we have full government of the people, and the fullest and freest democracy the world has ever known. There is no need to bring here ideas that may have been suited for Russian serfs, who can hardly call their lives or souls their own. The doctrine of these men is that no social improvement - which all admit is desirable - can be obtained save by violent revolution and force. They are adherents of the famous manifesto of Karl Marx, with which every one is, or should be, familiar - </para>

                        <para>The communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be obtained only by the forcible over-throw of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic resolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. </para>
                        <para class="block">I read that from the communist manifesto published by the Australian socialist party - of &#34; the communist party of Australia, 115 Goulburn-street, Sydney, New South Wales.&#34;  Who  constitute the ruling classes of Australia, and who its proletariat? There is none such. The communists deliberately ally themselves with any movement which promises social discontent. They use every means of causing loss and suffering, because they think that, in that way, the&#39; revolution may be brought nearer. To use their own words - : I am quoting from what has been published by. them in Australia - &#34;Any crisis will serve.&#34; These people are quite different from those who believe in communism as <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> social and economic system. That is an entirely different thing. Communism in its essence is the socialization of industry, production, distribution, and exchange. That is the objective of the Labour party. But that party seeks to attain it by constitutional methods; it tries to get a majority in this Parliament. While I believe that this ideal of socialization is founded upon a distorted view of history, and upon a partial and false system of economy, I consider that it should be dealt with on the platform. Any one who believes in it is entitled to endeavour to convert any one else to his way of thinking; and any one who opposes it is entitled to do so. The Labour party is in a difficult position, because it has the communistic objective, although I believe that it differs sincerely from the communists as to the means of attaining it. One of the most prominent members of the Labour party in Melbourne, when opposing the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell),</inline> during the recent election campaign, said that, of course, the Labour party and the communists have the same objective, but the Labour party seeks to obtain the objective - the abolition of private property - by constitutional methods and by taxation. The communists, on the other hand, believe in obtaining it by force. &#34; We believe that we can obtain it more effectively by taxation than the communists can by violence.&#34; That is definite. One can readily understand how difficult it is for the Labour party to dissociate itself from the parasitical allies of its own organization. The point I desire to make is that this bill is concerned with the means adopted by certain persons to force their opinions upon the community, whatever those opinions may be. It does not deal with opinions, or interfere with any man&#39;s liberty to express his opinions. It does, however, deal with incitement to violence of various descriptions. The men of whom I have been speaking are hostile to democracy as such. They are the enemies of every political party : according to their publications they are greater enemies of the Labour party than of the Nationalist party. We all know that no quarrels are more violent and bitter than those between members of a family. The communists see. the Labour party, which they regard as an incompetent, dishonest party - I quote from their own publications - proceeding falteringly and tremblingly towards what is claimed to be its magnificent ideal, which they think could be attained in one leap. Is it any wonder that they criticize the Labour party? </para>

                    <para>The headquarters of communism, and of most forms of violence directed against ordered government, is in Russia. The communist movement at head-quarters makes no secret of its specific attack upon the British Empire, and upon the various parts of that Empire. I have a cutting here from the London <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> dated 3rd July, 1924, reporting a speech by Zinovieff, the  chairman  of the Third International, in which he is reported as having spoken of the necessity of concentrating on a special effort in every sphere of British activity. He stated that a special British commission had been formed to handle British problems. </para>

Zinovieif, in his speech, referred to the appointment of representatives from the various parts of the world to a special commission for handling British problems. Those representatives included Zinovieff, Bukharin, and Raskolnikoff, the Japanese, Katayama, the Canadian, Bruce, the Australian, Montefiore, and others. Zinovietf informed the congress that in view of the present influence of Great Britain, &#34; when we have expanded the British Communist party to mass dimensions, we shall already have conquered half Europe.&#34; He then proceeded to speak of the promising field for communist operations presented by the colonies of the British Empire. I refer to that to show that it is the deliberate policy of the communists to attack the British dominions. </para>

In Australia, during recent years - I shall confine my remarks to recent happenings - the I.W.W.was the first manifestation of this form of activity. In the early war years the I.W.W. advocated and practised sabotage - the deliberate destruction of property, and interference with enterprise - and it sought to convert its followers to the adoption of general strike methods. In Sydney, the position became very serious; lives were lost, and many buildings were burnt down, rendering strong action necessary. In 1916, this Parliament passed the Unlawful Associations Act, which remained in operation only during, and for six months after, the war period. That act and the effective administration of the law in New South Wales kept the I.W.W. organization in check, and, for all practical purposes, it went out of existence. It is now . revived and active. Any one who visits the Sydney Domain will see how active it is. </para>

                    <para>Before dealing with the development of the communist party in Australia,I desire to give just one example of the manner in which the agents of the communist party - the Third International - work. The case to which I shall refer is that of a man named Zuzenko, whose career is probably more or less known to some honorable members. Partly because certain of his allies are still within Australia, I do not desire in what I say about him to give information in respect of any of his friends and associates here which might hinder future action. This man, Alexander Michael Zuzenko, has many aliases. He is a Russian, and was in Queensland for some years. He became very active during the war. He was a skilled journalist, and was the cause of three newspapers being suppressed. In January, 1919, the rooms of the Russian Association in Brisbane were raided, and honorable members will remember that there were some rather serious riots. Zuzenkowas deported in 1919. Let me observe here that he was depovted, although he had made his home in Australia, and had become, to use the words of some learned judges of the High Court, &#34; a member of the Australian community.&#34; If that principle were fully applied, it would be impossible to-day to deport Zuzenko under the Immigration Act. One reason why I give the example of Zuzenko is to ask the House whether it thinks such a man ought to be allowed to remain in Australia. Zuzenko returned in 1922. Perhaps I ought to state some of the earlier facts relating to him. In 1919 he was a very violent agitator, and said this, amongst other things - </para>

                    <para class="block">Then he urged the Russians in Australia to stick together and to start a revolution as soon as possible, and emphasized the necessity of them remaining in Australia. He went back to Russia when he was deported. He was then sent out from Russia as an organizing agent on behalf of the Communist International. The information that he was such an agent was obtained from a diary which he happened to keep, and which fell into the hands of the Australian authorities at a later date on his commencing his organizing mission after his return to this country.  His  diary and his accounts show that he left Moscow on a false passport, and went through Norway to England. By paying money to members of seamen&#39;s unions, who are named in his papers, he managed to work his way on to a boat, and went to the United States and Canada. He made records of payments of &#163;20, &#163;15, and &#163;30 &#34; to comrades for loss of time.&#34; </para>

With this name he obtained a passport, and again paid moneys to persons described as members of seamen&#39;s unions allegedly for the purpose of getting assistance to return to Australia. Eventually he arrived in Sydney. Then he visited Auckland, and returned to Sydney and Melbourne. Here he used the name of Nargan and was in very active association with certain other persons here, the names of some of whom are recorded in his papers. Though he had no apparent means of support, he was still able to live. He was discovered and charged with being a prohibited immigrant, and was deported from Australia, carrying with him a warm resolution and a letter of appreciation and thanks from the communist party of Australia for his successful work upon his mission in Australia. On the occasion of his second deportation he left in the <inline font-style="italic">Hobson&#39;s Bay,</inline> a Commonwealth liner, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> S. Garden and some other Australian representatives who were visiting Russia. That is an example of the sort of individual who has been dealt with from time to time under existing legislation. Under the Unlawful Associations Act of 1916, some of the provisions of which are very similar to provisions contained in this bill, a considerable number of persons were deported, including some twelve British subjects. The communist party in Australia was founded in 1920 on the basis of a manifesto prepared by the &#34; Provisional Executive of the Communist party of Australia.&#34; This manifesto is addressed to the workers of Australia, and it invites them to prepare for their part in the coming international communist revolution. It urges that the only way of attaining the object of the party is by forcible revolution. The word &#34; revolution &#34; as used by these men does not mean peaceful persuasion, but forcible revolution and blood. That is perfectly plain. </para>

Reports of the work of trade unions, and the keeping of district groups supplied with current information on trade union affairs are particularly referred to in the constitution of the communist party. What I am now speaking of is a current, present-day matter. So long as its activity is confined to the appointment of committees and like matters, it is not proposed to deal with this organization, but when it endeavours to incite to violence, or to revolution, then the Government will take the necessary action to suppress the organization. </para>

                        <para>I believe it has found the keynote to organization so far as the Anglo-Saxon movement is concerned. The Communist party in Australia has a membership of just close on 1,000, and yet it is able to direct close on 400,000 workers -that is, including 237,000 in the State of New South Wales - all organized workers. It also directs 110,000 organized workers in Brisbane, Queensland. The Communist party in Australia is based on the nuclei system. Every union has its nuclei from twenty down to two, but every union has its nuclei. All nuclei leaders must meet once a week, and these nuclei leaders from the unions discuss the problems of their organizations, the problems of the working class of Australia. In every discussion of problems they formulate their tactics, and then go out to their various unions, factories, and workshops, and mines, and carry out the policy as directed. The Communist party, along with the leaders of the nuclei, formulates that policy. On every burning; question that affects the working class you will find that the nuclei leaders are the first in the field to give direction to the working class how to meet the situation. The Labour Council of New South Wales constitutes 120 unions. Yet the Communist party has full control of the executive. Out of the twelve members of the executive eleven are members of the Communist party, and they direct these 120 unions and the policy of each union. We found, also, that by directing our energy inside we were able to liquidate the Industrial Workers of the World, which was the militant organization of Australia. . . . The Industrial Workers of the World changed their tactics; they came inside with us. and started to co-operate inside the craft unions to break down the craft barriers, and link up all their forces into six great industrial departments throughout Australia .... and we decided to form a Communist party. </para>

I think so too, and that is why I am asking the House to pass a law under which it will be possible to punish them. There is now no Commonwealth law under which they can be punished. The communist party in Australia to-day is a reality. It claims to have a tremendous influence in the community. Its membership is comparatively small, but in view of the serious consequences of its growth we must deal with it early. The organisation runs a. press in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- What is it called? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. LATHAM.-</inline> It is called &#34; <inline font-style="italic">The Communist,</inline> a journal for the theory and practice of Marxism.&#34; One does wonder whence the money comes to make it possible to continue this journalistic activity. It does not come from thin air. The membership of the communist party, of which members on the other side possibly have a fuller knowledge than honorable members on this side, is so small that we wonder where the money does come from. There is a great deal of interesting reading in <inline font-style="italic">The Worker&#39;s Weekly.</inline> In nearly every issue will be found - as I see in one before me, dated 5th June, 1925 - news of the communist activities throughout Australia. It deals with events in South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, the coalfields of New South Wales, Western Australia and Victoria. It sets out lists of the representatives. There are ten groups with the names of the secretaries printed. The journal supports every form of industrial unrest and disturbance irrespective of the merits of the case. It urges the fomenting of every possible source of discontent, because it brings nearer the day when the workers will be so dissatisfied that they will undertake a social revolution. The names of some of the gentlemen associated with this organization are rather interesting. For example, the  chairman  in Melbourne appears to be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shelley.</inline> He was born in Berlin, and his full name is Joseph Weinman Schelly. He was associated with the Industrial Workers of the World activities in Western Australia. Coming to Melbourne he became  chairman  of the communist party, and, under the very English and poetic name of Shelley has, apparently, a permanent job as leader of the unemployed. These journals contain appeals to workers to promote revolution as the only means by which the working class can better its position. <inline font-style="italic">The Workers&#39; Weekly</inline> also made appeals to the American sailors during their visit to Australia which were certainly inconsistent with the performance of their naval duties. On the 14th August, 1925, a special article explained that the promotion of revolutionary propaganda amongst the alien immigrants was flagging, and that additional workers were required in that promising field. When the strike of British seamen occurred, the communists had a magnificent opportunity, and a leading article published on the 28th August was headed, &#34; To arms, workers,&#34; and contained a direct incitement to violent revolution. </para>

                            <para>- No ; the people of Australia have too much sense to tolerate violence of the kind suggested. I admit that the communist activities are mostly talk, but talk which involves incitement to revolution should not be tolerated in Australia, because here, as elsewhere, are some foolish persons who may be misled. Therefore, it is far better to deal with a few communists now than to be required to deal hereafter with, possibly, thousands of their dupes. In order to show how these extremists operate I quote this passage from <inline font-style="italic">The Worker&#39;s Weekly</inline> of the 28th August - </para>

This Parliament has no authority to enact a general criminal law ; it can deal only with matters submitted to it by the Constitution. Therefore the bill applies only to the protection of the Constitution of the established government, interstate and foreign trade and commerce, and the public services of the Commonwealth.

                            <para>- I admit that; but such a law is necessary and does not exist at the present time. The bill is founded upon the Unlawful Associations Act, which was allowed to expire after the war and could not be effectively continued in the same form in time of peace. Proposed new section 30a provides that any person over the age of eighteen years who is a member of an unlawful association and any person of any age who is an officer pf an unlawful association shall be guilty of an offence. </para>

If no one can be proved to fall within them, this legislation will never be applied. I shall be very pleased if that happens to be the case. But if, on the other hand, there are any such persons, proceedings should be instituted against them, and they should be punished. One of the most important provisions in the bill is that contained in the proposed new section 30c, which provides - </para>

                    <para class="block">It will be observed that a conviction must first be obtained against a person not born in Australia. Then it will rest with the executive to determine whether the person so convicted shall be deported. It would be an easy matter to shift this responsibility on to the shoulders of the judiciary, but the view is held that that would not, under the circumstances, be a proper thing to do, and the Government is, therefore, prepared to accept the responsibility of dealing with persons convicted of this offence and of deporting them if such action is thought proper. In that resolution the Government is supported by the people of Australia. There are subsidiary provisions which prohibit, and provide penalties for, the subscription of money or goods to an unlawful association, and the distribution, printing, and publication of literature for an unlawful association. It will be observed that no attempt is being made to deal with literature merely according to its character. There is no proposal in the bill to institute a censorship of newspapers, books, or anything of the kind; the provisions relate merely to literature that is published by, on behalf of, or in the interests of, an unlawful association; because the object of the bill is to put an end to such associations, and to seize and forfeit all their literature. Proposed new section 30j contains an important provision of another type, and is designed to deal with serious emergencies. It will come into operation only if there is a serious industrial disturbance that has been so proclaimed by the Governor-General; that is to say, the government of the day must accept the responsibility of proclaiming the existence of a serious industrial disturbance.

                            <para>- Some industrial disputes are not bona fide industrial disputes; they are the means which are adopted by a minority to impose its will upon the majority of the community. Every country has special legislation dealing with vital services, such as water supply, sewerage, and the like, in which strikes are not permitted. In Australia transport is vital; it is of fundamental importance to the well-being of the Commonwealth. Every interference with transport, however, is not a vital interference. Accordingly this section will come into operation only when the government of the day is prepared to take the responsibility of making the proclamation for which it provides. Proposed new section 30k is another important one. It provides that- </para>

Honorable members should particularly note that every offence is prefaced- by the requirement of violence, threats, intimidation, or boycott, without reasonable cause or excuse. Violence, intimidation, and threats can never be justified in law. At the present time there is no Commonwealth legislation that deals with the matter. The section leaves open every means for adopting genuine peaceful persuasion. </para>

                            <para>- The other proposed new sections contain machinery provisions, but they are not unimportant. Some of them deal with evidence. For example, the proposed new section 30h provides that any person who has been a member of an association, who has attended a meeting of, spoken publicly in advocacy of, or distributed the literature of, an association, shall be deemed to be a member of that association. There is also the provision that the averments in the information or indictment shall be prima facie proof of their truth. That has been taken from the Customs Act, and it is a provision that should be applied not in cases where there is merely difficulty in proving the offence, but in cases where the facts are peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant, and he could, if innocent, easily exculpate himself by going into the witness-box. Then there are the provisions relating to deportation. </para>

                            <para>- I generally am careful. Naturally this House desires to assure itself that there is a reasonable probability of the provisions being upheld as valid before it passes them. A great deal has been said regarding the decision of the High Court <inline font-style="italic">in re</inline> Walsh and <inline font-style="italic">in re</inline> Johnson. It has been suggested by some honorable members that that decision affects the mandate which was given to. the government by the people. That mandate is not in any way affected; it is to-day what it was before the High Court gave its decision. If this country determined legal questions by popular voting, something to the contrary might be said, but the effect of the decision of the High Court, viewed politically, is that as certain legislation is not effective for the purposes for which it was passed, new measures must be passed to cope with the situation. </para>

                    <para>The Government does not propose to go back over the past, or seek to ground any proceeding under this measure upon acts done in the past. It is a safe principle that a man should not be put in jeopardy twice for what is in substance the one act. The Government might have introduced retrospective legislation, but as a general and almost universal rule, I am opposed to such legislation, and I would not be a party to retrospective criminal legislation in such a case as this. It has been said, particularly since I have assumed the office which I have the honour to hold, that in the debates in this Chamber last year </para>
                    <para class="block">I stated that the deportation legislation of last session would be constitutional. I have never laid claim to infallibility in matters of law. Some honorable members opposite are much surer of their legal opinions than I am of mine. When the deportation proposals were under discussion last year, I pointed to the difficulty of interpreting the constitutional law of Australia. There is no more uncertain legal field. As I reminded the House yesterday, I said last year that I was not prepared to guarantee the constitutional validity of the amending Immigration Act until the High Court had passed judgment upon it, but that the objections to it were not, in my opinion, well founded, and I gave my reasons for that statement. My remarks on that subject are to be found on page 1905 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report for the session 1925. There is an idea that the High Court has held that deportation is illegal, or at least, that the Court has decided that the deportation of British  subjects is illegal in the sense that this Parliament cannot provide for it under the Commonwealth Constitution. The High Court has not so decided, nor has it lent support to any such proposition. If it were the opinion of that court that deportation was illegal, and that the deportation of British subjects could never be held to be legal, it would be the end of our White Australia policy, because that depends on the power to deport, not only aliens, but also British subjects. The White Australia policy rests in the last resort upon the reality of that power. The decision of the High Court in what has been referred to as the deportation case would have been exactly the same if deportation had not been provided for in the Immigration Restriction Act. If that legislation, instead of providing that after a recommendation of a board the Minister could exercise the power to deport, had provided that the persons proceeded against should pay a fine or undergo imprisonment, the decision of four judges of the High Court - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins held that the act was invalid - would have been exactly the same. <inline font-style="italic">{Extension of time granted&#93;.</inline></para>
                    <para>As this subject is of interest to all parties in the House, I shall endeavour to explain the legal effect of the decision of the High Court, leaving on one side its political aspect. When the  legislation of last year was framed, the position was that section 8a of the Immigration Restriction Act had been held to be valid. That section provided for the deportation of persons who, in the opinion of a Minister, were engaged in revolutionary activities, and whose deportation had been recommended by a board. It had been decided,  too, in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Potter</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Minahan,</inline> and in the Irish Envoys case, that British subjects, as well as aliens, could be deported under the act. It had been held in the Irish Envoys case, that the appointment of a non- judicial board as a. recommending body, was quite valid, and that the establishment and action of the board did not make the legislation unconstitutional. In the Irish Envoys case, no difficulty had been raised by members of the court, or by counsel at the bar, by reason of the fact, that the operation of a section depended upon the . opinion of a Minister. In fact, in the Welsbach case, in 1915, the objection that the operation of the act depended on the opinion of a Minister, was raised. It was argued in that ease that the fact that the Minister entertained the opinion that somebody was an enemy of the Commonwealth did not make him one. That objection was overruled. Then,, in prior decisions of the court, emphasis had been laid on the fact that a person who had a home in Australia, was not immigrating into Australia when, after an absence, he re-entered the Commonwealth, but was, indeed, merely returning home., It had also been held, too, that a passing visitor, one who did not intend to stay in Australia, was .subject to the immigration power. It is certainly unlikely that anybody would in ordinary speech describe him. as an immigrant. The Irish Envoys case related to persons who admittedly were visaing Australia only to collect money, and were going away as soon as they had obtained as much money as they required for their purposes. -It was held that they came under the immigration power, though obviously they were not immigrants in the ordinary sense, any more than an Australian landing at Colombo, on the way to England, would be an immigrant into Ceylon. All these points had been decided ; but it had not been held by any judge that a person who had migrated into Australia could, by his own act in settling in the Commonwealth, take himself out of the scope of the immigration power. That point had not. arisen, and there was therefore no judicial pronouncement upon it. The precise contrary of that proposition, that a man could take himself out of the scope of the immigration power by making his home here, had been held by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich in the Irish Envoys case, and their expression of opinion had not been dissented from by the three other judges who sat on that case. </para>
                    <para>After that statement of the law as it existed prior to the passing of our legislation of  last year, let us consider what the recent case really did decide. There were five judges on the bench, and the learned judges gave separate reasons for the decision of the Court. They did not concur in all their reasons, and, indeed, upon some points there was a considerable difference of opinion. Four of the judges held that the act, when properly interpreted, is valid ; but one judge - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins - held that it is invalid, on the ground that it applies to persons not born in Australia ; that persons not born in Australia include both persons who, having come into- Australia, have made their home here, and therefore are not, in his view, subject to the immigration  power, and persons who, having come into Australia, have not made their home here.  His  Honour, . construing that act as one dependent for its validity on the power of the Parliament to legislate as to immigration and emigration, holds that the whole act is invalid, because it goes beyond the immigration power by dealing with people who have made their homes in Australia. All the learned judges concur in the opinion that the act did. not apply in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh,</inline> who was in Australia prior to federation, though the reasons which they give for that opinion are not &#39;precisely the same. One principle upon which certain of the learned judges based it is that no person is an immigrant into  Australia who in fact entered Australia before federation. According to some of the others it would apparently be a question of fact whether a man had made his home in Australia before that date, and it might be the case, according to some statements in the reasons&#39; for judgment, that there are persons in </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia to-day who have not yet really settled down here - that although they came here before federation, they may still be legally regarded as immigrants and subject to the immigration power. The question of fact is left for determination in each case. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich, held that the act applies to any person who came here after federation, whether he made his home in Australia or -not. The Chief Justice and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke said that the act applies only to persons who entered Australia after federation, but who have not made their home here. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich expressed the opinion that the act applied in &#39; the case of Johnson, but that there was a defect in procedure in not notifying him of the acts of which the Minister was satisfied, and for that reason the proceedings against him failed. That point was equally open to be taken in the Irish Envoys case, but it was not then raised and it was not suggested in that case that there was any such defect in procedure. The Chief Justice and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke held that section 8aa was not a law as to&#39; trade or commerce, because no controlling rule was laid down as to trade and commerce.&#39; The section did not forbid the doing of any act relating to trade or commerce, but simply provided that if the Minister was satisfied that a person was doing certain things in relation to trade or commerce the Minister could take certain action ; that there was no prohibition of those things. Accordingly it was held that there was no rule as to trade or commerce, and the fact that the Minister was of the opinion that there was, did not in law make a rule. Similar reasoning applies to the other matters such as public services, mentioned in the section. Accordingly,  His  Honour the  Chief Justice and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke, held that the legislation must be justified as immigration legislation, or not at all. They held that it is justified and valid as an immigration act, but that it applies only to persons who are still within the scope of the immigration power, that is to say, persons who have not become part of the people of Australia. That opinion is not shared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, who takes the view that the immigration power does not cease to operate as soon as a person, to use his own words, &#34;leaps over the barrier, and by his own act settles in Australia.&#34; So to hold would, he says, be a national tragedy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs states that the power to legislate on immigration is not so limited that if a man enters Australia to-day, and by to-morrow settles down to make his permanent home here, he can remove himself from the scope of immigration legislation. That is one of the important issues raised by this judgment. </para>

                            <para>- It is a matter for the court. In order to remove any misunderstanding on this matter, let me quote a parallel case. Let us take a Subject upon which Parliament has no direct power to legislate, as, for example, safety appliances in mines. That is a matter which is not within the direct legislative power of this Parliament. Parliament has, however, power to legislate upon matters affecting trade and commerce, both interstate and foreign. Let us suppose that Parliament passes a law dealing with safety appliances in mines, and that the preamble is to the following effect: - &#34;Whereas the provision of safety appliances in mines is a matter .of importance to mining and to the trade and commerce of Australia, with other countries and among the States, now, therefore, we legislate in the following manner.&#34; Such legislation would not stand for one moment, if contested. The same principle applies to our other powers, including the power to legislate in respect of immigration. We can legislate on matters really coming within the scope of immigration, but it is for the High Court to say what those matters are. We can pass legislation to deal with immigration, but when it comes before the High Court for consideration, that court, and that court alone, can say whether it as a matter of law is an act dealing with immigration. </para>

It is not an immigration bill, and has nothing to do with immigration ; but if honorable members hope that there will, therefore, be no litigation in respect of it,&#39; I am afraid that their hopes will not be realized. </para>

                            <para>- In my view this Bill raises no question upon the power to legislate on immigration. The Government accepts the judgment of the High Court as declaring the law. Apart altogether from the necessity of doing so, that is the only proper course to adopt. I -am seeking to explain what the High Court actually decided, and later I purpose showing the relation of this legislation to that decision. Let me say a final word on the power to deport. None of the reasoning of the four judges constituting the majority depends on the subject of deportation, but in giving their reasons they say a good deal about deportation. No such question as this could have arisen in England, New Zealand, South Africa, or iu any other country. In those countries the power to legislate in this manner would be unchallenged and unchallengeable. </para>

According to all the judges, a person is an immigrant when he enters Australia for the first time, whether merely on a visit or in order to settle here ; according to some of the judges, if a man is once an immigrant, he is always an immigrant, and,, therefore, always subject to the immigration power; in the opinion of other judges he passes beyond the scope of the immigration power if he settles in Australia, makes his home here, and becomes a member of the community. Hon.orable members will recognize that it is not easy to deal with a situation of this nature.

                        <para class="block">Australia. . Its permission to dAn to enter may be. either conditional or unconditional. He has no right to enter Australia against the will of its people. He can enter only in pursuance of their will and subject to their constitutional right, to qualify or withdraw that permission at any time or under any circumstances they think proper. No Parliament - for Parliament is only the legislative instrument of the people - can, either by action or inaction, surrender or weaken or forfeit that national power. Immigration, as I have explained in the 0&#39;Flanagan case, is not. obliterated for ever by the mere passage across the frontier, nor by the .momentary leap over a barrier which magically and instantaneously transforms a Hindoo or kanaka, for example, into an Australian. If such were its meaning, the cherished national policy of Australia would indeed bo in peril. And it would only nominally lessen the peril if the Hindoo or the kanaka, by immediately adopting Australia as his &#34; home,&#34; as it is said, could, so to speak, dig himself into this Commonwealth, so as to be irrevocably, so far as tine  Commonwealth  power is concerned, a member of the , people of the  Commonwealth  - a true Australian - and thereby escape the immigration power for ever. He could afterwards, as it is said, irrespective of nationality, of sentiment, of customs, of everything except his resolve to stay in Australia indefinitely as his &#34; home,&#34; remain here or travel back and forwards, leave when he pleased, enter as he chose, and claim all the rights of a native-born Australian who had never abandoned his country. For this court to so hold would, in my opinion, ibc a tragedy. The immigration power would practically be a dead letter, once the frontier was passed, whatever shred of theory remained. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. That is the point to which I was about to refer. So far I have dealt with deportation in its relation to immigration. This bill does not rely upon the power to legislate in that regard; it creates offences as to certain matters within the legislative power of the Commonwealth Parliament, namely the protection of the Constitution, trade and commerce, and public services. In two cases it prescribes deportation as the penalty for an offence, in the same way that an act might prescribe imprisonment for life, or even impose the penalty of death, for. any act the commission of .which it was deemed should carry such a penalty. The bill is framed upon the basis that the Commonwealth is entitled to pass a criminal law within the scope of its legislative power, that it may prescribe such penalties as it thinks proper, and that one of those penalties may be deportation. </para>

                    <para>While I do not claim infallibility, I shall endeavour to show that a bill framed on such lines is, in my opinion, consistent with the judgment of the High Court. I propose to refer to the grounds of the decision to show that this bill does not infringe the reasoning upon which the High Court&#39;s &#34;decision was based. The Chief Justice bases his decision upon the ground that, in section 8aa of the Immigration Act of last year, no acts were made unlawful. In this bill certain acts of persons are made unlawful, those acts being within the scope of the Commonwealth power. The Chief Justice also decided that the Immigration Act was not an act relating to trade and commerce, because it did not lay down any rule for the conduct of any persons with respect to trade and commerce. This bill does lay down rules affecting the conduct of persons with respect to trade and commerce.  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs held that the act was valid, and said this as to the power of the Commonwealth to prescribe deportation as a remedy for the breach of its law: - </para>

                            <para>agree  with the Solicitor-General - and, indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> did not contest this - that deportation, as a means of self-protection  in relation to constitutional functions, is within the competency of the legislative organ of the Australian people. This nation cannot have less power than an ordinary body of persons, whether a State, a  church,  a club, or a political party, who associate themselves voluntarily for .mutual benefit, to -eliminate from their communal society any element considered inimical to its existence or welfare. We have only to imagine, as I suggested during the argument, some individual found plotting with foreign powers against the safety of the country, or even suspected of being a spy or a traitor. It matters not, as I conceive, whether he is an alien or a fellow subject, whether he be born in  Kamptschatka  or in London or in Australia, the national danger is the same. No one stays to ask where a bomb which is on one&#39;s premises was manufactured. The urgent question is: How to get rid of it?  Needless  to say, I speak only of national power. That is the right of the community as a whole to preserve its own existence. </para>

                    <para>In conclusion, let me say that the provisions of the bill dealing with deportation require, first, conviction by a court of law. Only persons who have been convicted of acts which are made crimes by this bill can be deported. The responsibility for deporting any person is a responsibility which has been undertaken and accepted, ever since the institution of the Commonwealth, by the Executive Government, and numbers of persons have been deported from time to time for the protection and safety of the people of Australia. That responsibility the present Government is prepared to continue to undertake, and is undertaking. Only last week, on the application of a Labour government of another State, I assisted in making arrangements for a deportation under the Immigration Act. This legislation will afford means of punishing persons, if they are convicted of crime, who are persistent enemies of our social welfare. The legislation is reasonable and moderate. No person will suffer under it who is not convicted of a crime. It provides the necessary means of self- protection  for  Australia. It carries out the promise  of  the Prime Minister to the electors. It is submitted to this House without apology and without excuse. It is legislation which the people of Australia have demanded. It is a legislative effort to preserve the freedom of all classes in Australia, believers in trade unionism and others, and I venture to think there  are  very  few  persons in Australia who do not believe in trade unionism. This measure is a legislative attempt to prevent the suffering and distress caused, mainly, not to the wealthy classes, who do not suffer, but to the poorer classes, by wanton revolutionary action. The bill is designed to maintain the principles of  free,  constitutional, and democratic government, and as such I commend it to the House. </para>

                    <para>.- A very great principle is involved in the amendment moved by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin).</inline> On that principle the debate on the bill has so far hinged, and will continue to do so until a division is taken on the amendment, unless the Minister in charge of this measure can give honorable members some assurance that that important principle introduced in the early days of federation by the party to which I have the honour to belong is not to be interfered with. It is a matter of surprise to me that the Minister should appear to have, even at certain intervals, two minds on this subject. It might be as well to recall the report of a deputation that waited on the Minister at Hobart on the 17th November, 1924, which was referred to by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Penton)</inline> last night, and to compare it with the statements and attitude of the Minister to-day. Not a great deal of water has flowed under the political bridge in the meantime. In answer to a deputation of business men and others, the Minister said - </para>

                <para class="block">When the Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Yarra made certain suggestions in conformity with the Minister&#39;s own words, he put forward the extraordinary excuse that the bill, if amended, might not receive the royal assent. The Navigation Act discriminates between white and coloured labour, and  between Australian and British shipping companies. The amendment seeks to preserve this discrimination, and it is ridiculous for the Minister at this late hour to put forward the excuse that if clause 3 is amended the royal assent to the bill may not be obtained. The Minister yesterday said that some honorable members on this side contended that the bill if passed would allow vessels manned with black labour to engage in the interstate trade, and he put forward fairly convincing figures to prove the contrary. He said that the White Australia policy would not be adversely affected under the bill, because out of 37 ships booked to visit Tasmania, 30 of them were manned by white labour and only seven of them - Peninsular and Oriental vessels - were manned by black labour. The Minister, unfortunately for himself, has made two statements which do not agree. He has proved to his own satisfaction, and to that df many honorable members supporting him, that the licensing of British vessels manned by black labour is of little or no consequence ; and he absolutely refuses to give effect to the policy of White Australia which he has so often enunciated. He said that the people of Australia had given this Government a mandate. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> when in Tasmania said that that island had to be protected, and would be given a shipping service. He -wound up enthusiastically by declaring that the Government would carry out its mandate from the people. But no mandate was given to . the Government to introduce black labour into interstate trading. T&#39;.ie people of Tasmania do not desire vessels manned by black labour to trade on their coast. If the bill is passed in its present form, any coolie-manned boats will be able to carry passengers between the mainland and Tasmania. The amendment moved by the honorable member for Yarra seeks to prevent the black-labour vessels from operating in that trade. I ask the Minister to stand by the White Australia policy, a principle that he enunciated emphatically and enthusiastically in another place. He should accept the amendment, and not attempt to break down the wages and conditions now enjoyed bv Australian seamen. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government&#39;s refusal to accept the amendment moved by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> will be a clear indication of the insincerity of its advocacy of the White Australia policy. The Minister&#39;s statement that the bill; if amended, might not receive the royal assent was evidently the only excuse that he could think of to justify the Government&#39;s opposition to the proposed amendment. We should use our own judgment respecting those we employ on the Australian coast. Only last week the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Penton)</inline> suggested to the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> that all contracts for the carriage of mails from Great Britain or any part of the British Empire to Australia should be let to shipping companies which employed white labour on their vessels and provide decent conditions. The bill is ostensibly introduced to assist Tasmania, which, it is said, has become financially embarrassed owing to the operation of the Navigation Act. We have no right to assist that State in the way proposed under the bill. In reply to the honorable member for Maribyrnong, the Minister said that further information would be supplied, but up to the present we have had no further information than that placed before us by the Hughes Government. The Minister gave a promise at Hobart. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite possible. The Minister at that time said that no alteration to the act could be made. That statement was equally &#34;as convincing as the letter from the ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> when he had the option of breaking down the act or acceding to the request made to him. To assist Tasmania in a practical way we should develop her industries. What has the Government done respecting the wood pulp industry? In that instance certain interests forced the Government to retard the development of Tasmania. An attempt is now being made to break down the conditions &#39; enjoyed by Australian seamen. Tasmania can be relieved by means other than the passing of this bill. I strongly oppose clause 3. The minutes of evidence taken by the Navigation Commission, which are available to honorable members, reveal the true position of Tasmania as explained by responsible witnesses. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Henry Hughes, Sydney manager of the Union Steamship Company, giving evidence in Hobart, quoted a letter from the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to the  president  of the Hobart Chamber of Commerce, dated 7th June, 1922. I referred briefly to it yesterday, but the following passage is worth quoting in full:- </para>

                    <para>You ask that British ships should be exempted from the provisions of the Navigation Act, so far as passenger traffic with Tasmania is concerned. This is quite impossible,. both from a constitutional point of view and also on a matter of practical politics. The Government can grant &#34; permits &#34; only where it can be shown that the service by licensed ships is in adequate. No discrimination in this matter can bc made between one State and another.  From  a practical point of view, the granting of permits to oversea British ships to engage in coasting trade without compliance with any of the Navigation Act conditions would mean the speedy ruin of local shipping. The position of the local owners in this regard may be put in a nutshell. They are required by the Arbitration Court to pay certain wages and observe certain hours, in accordance with the Australian standard of living. The Navigation Act also requires them to provide accommodation, food, &#38;c., according to the same standard. The wages paid and the accommodation provided on the great majority of oversea ships are much below our standards, and these fillips, if permitted, could, and would, seriously undercut the local owners for the trade along our coasts. Our local shipping industry cannot exist without protection against the cheap labour competition of other mercantile marines. In this respect the shipowner is in exactly the same position as the business man ashore. How long, I ask you, could the importers, manufacturers, and other business people of Hobart exist if competitors from overseas were permitted to establish themselves in that city, and, under exemption from all Arbitration Court awards, to import and employ coloured or other labour at wages and to work their employees the hours prevailing in, say, Japan, India, or even Great Britain? The whole trading community would be in arms at the mere mention of such a proposal. But such is an exact parallel of what you are now asking in requesting that overseas ships should be exempted from the requirements of the Navigation Act in connexion with the coasting trade between the mainland and Tasmania. In both cases the general public might reap temporary advantage by reason of the cut-throat prices and rates that would prevail for a while, but the ultimate result would he disastrous to the local traders and to the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, I would again assure you of the fact that the Commonwealth Government is sincerely anxious to do all that it can to secure for Tasmania an efficient and comfortable shipping service with mainland ports, and all that can properly be done to secure and foster such a service will he done. I trust, however, that you will, realize from the foregoing that it is quite impossible to grant your request for the issue of permits, to British ships to engage in the coasting trade with Tasmania without compliance with the requirements of the. Navigation Act. To do so would, the Government feels assured, be seriously injurious in the ultimate reckoning to the best interests of Tasmania and the Coin.-&#39; mon wealth. </para>

The Leader of the Opposition.. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> was ridiculed for having said that he would favour the establishment of a Commonwealth service, but the right honorable member for North Sydney adopted a similar attitude in 1922. </para>

                        <para>- No. Under the existing law the Government has power to grant an unlimited licence to overseas ships to carry goods and passengers if the inadequacy of the existing service is proved ; but the evidence taken by the Navigation Commission showed that the service provided by Australian shipping companies is more than adequate. Admittedly, there are peak periods during which some inconvenience is experienced by shippers and travellers, but the same disability is suffered by Bunbury, Albany, Brisbane, and other ports, and it can never be overcome. To meet unusual or emergent circumstances, a special exemption can be granted by the Commonwealth. For instance, on one occasion the <inline font-style="italic">Moeraki</inline> was allowed to call at Hobart to pick up Wirth&#39;s circus. But this bill will extend the existing power by enabling the Governor-General to errant licences to the overseas ships to call at Hobart without any consideration as to the adequacy or otherwise of the services maintained by Australian companies. The facts relating to Tasmania&#39;s shipping services are on record in the commission&#39;s report, but are being ignored by the Government. Apparently, that inquiry by the Navigation Commission was futile, for the Government is acting quite contrary to the evidence taken by it and the recommendations based thereon. I quote for the further information of honorable members the following examination of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Henry Hughes: -  11813. You read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Hughes&#39;</inline> letter in order that it should have weight. Do you think that those boats should be permitted to run in the interests of the apple people? - They are coming in any case. 11814. They are coming now because the general freight this year is not sufficient for them? - Is that not my point? We are expected to carry on all the year round, whether the trade is good or bad; and then others want to get the cream. 11815. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey.</inline> - I gather from your returns that in 1913, 23,300 passengers were carried between Melbourne and Launceston, and 7,364 between Melbourne and Burnie, making a total of 30,664. On the Melbourne-Hobart service, from January to October inclusive, 437 passengers were carried, and on the SydneyHobart service, 3,263 were carried, making a total of 34,364. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murdoch</inline> gave evidence that about 610 people came in that year by the oversea boats. Therefore, apparently, 98 per cent. of the passengers coming to Tasmania before thewar preferred to travel by the local boats, lt is seen also that 89 per cent. of the travellers came in via northern ports. In 1923, the number of passengers from Melbourne to Launceston increased to 24,213, and the number from Melbourne to Burnie increased to 10,851. The number of passengers from Sydney last year was 6,639 in the interstate boats, and 106 in the Commonwealth boats, making n total of 6,745. The total increase is from 35,000 to 42,000, in round figures. Those are your figures? - Yes. 11816. <inline font-style="italic">The</inline> Chairman. - I make the increase from Melbourne to Launceston in 1923 to be about 1,000. 11817. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey.</inline> - The number between Melbourne and Hobart, from January to October inclusive, was 874 in and out. That service is now cut out. From Sydney to Hobart in 1913 there were 3,263 passengers in and out, and last year the boats carried 6,639. I think that on examination you will find that there has been a greater increase in Tasmania than there has been in any other State relative to the population. I have not had time to work out the cargo returns. I understand that on the Melbourne-Launceston service you added a larger amount of cargo service? - That is so. </para>

                <para class="block">That is conclusive evidence that the tourist traffic is fully catered for. The commission was told, also, that Tasmania itself cannot accommodate the holiday tourist traffic, and the honorable member for Wentworth mentioned that on one occasion the ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and his family could not obtain board and lodging in the State. The right honorable member for North Sydney was bold enough to say that this Parliament should not be asked to legislate to meet the wishes of a few fastidious tourists, who are not content with the coastal shipping service. </para>

                        <para>- It will. The amending act of 1920 gives the Governor-General newer in certain circumstances to issue permits to oversea vessels to engage in the Tasmanian trade. The proposed new subsection 6 provides that, where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Governor-General that the tourist traffic is being injured or retarded, and he is satisfied that it is desirable that unlicensed ships shall be allowed to engage in the trade, he may grant permission for them to do so. None of the evidence which was taken by the Royal Commission on Navigation showed that the tourist traffic was being injured or retarded. </para>

The Government is playing up either to the fastidious in our community or to some other interests.

                    <para>. - I do not propose to address myself at any length to the question whether there is &#34;discrimination between States or parts of States; I consider that that was adequately dealt with yesterday. Nor do I propose to deal with the points which confine the matter to one particular State, and endeavour to demonstrate that the service to that State is absolutely adequate, and that, therefore, there was no necessity to take any action to effect an improvement. That argument can be dealt with at length by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten).</inline> I desire to say a word or two upon the amendment that has been moved by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin).</inline> That honorable member has asked the committee to so amend the bill that permission to engage in the coastal trade of Australia may be granted only to those unlicensed ships  that are manned by white labour. A good* deal of the argument which has been used in support of the amendment has been very wide of the question. It has been suggested&#39; that unless the clause is amended in the manner suggested we shall in some way infringe the great and sacred principle of a White Australia. The bill has nothing to do with the White Australia policy. That policy - to which I believe every one subscribes - is based upon two great fundamental ideals affecting! our national life; one is that we must&#34; preserve our racial purity, and the other is that we must maintain &#39; our present economic standard. I ask honorable members how either of those principles can be affected by anything which happens on a British ship. Any such happening cannot interfere with our racial purity or economic standards. A good deal of misconception exists in the minds of those who are urging the acceptance of the amendment. I want to make it perfectly clear that the Government stands for the policy of a White Australia, and is prepared to do everything to safeguard it. I remind honorable members opposite, who appear to suggest that the Government does not subscribe to that policy with the  whole-heartedness  that they display, that the evidence is entirely against their contention. I refer them to the actions of the Government in regard to the sugar industry. Although in their hearts they support that action, which above all others was designed to preserve the policy of a White Australia and the purity of our race, they have not been very loud in their commendation of it. </para>

                        <para>- I entirely agree that the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is entitled to every credit for it. I merely instanced that action to show that the Government whole-heartedly supports the policy of a White Australia, and certainly will not introduce any legislation&#39; that could in any way infringe it. I assure the House, further, that the Government does not, under the bill, intend to do anything to infringe that policy. I take the matter a step further, and say that we shall do everything in our power to encourage the employment of white men upon ships, where it is possible to do so without detriment to Australian citizens. We have no power to force upon Great Britain our sentimental desire to see white labour employed on British ships. The occasion may arise in the future when only a vessel manned by black labour can meet the requirements of the coastal trade. Why, then, should we prevent Australian citizens . from taking advantage of this because Great Britain will not subscribe to the view that all her ships should be manned by white labour? We are entitled to take action to prevent anything that might conceivably, interfere with our White Australia policy, but we are not entitled to disadvantage our own people /&#39;by endeavouring to force Great Britain to adopt what to us is a very great principle. I ask honorable members to remember that the amendment has nothing to do with the White Australia policy. </para>

                        <para>- Apparently honorable members opposite are not prepared to consider the matter on. its merits. They are attempting to arouse political prejudices. Adopting their line of argument, I remind them that the Australian Seamen&#39;s Union has blatantly declared that it has no objection to coloured seamen joining it. If there is any doubt as to who stands most firmly for the employment of white labour in Australian industries, I maintain that we oh this side of the House take up a much stronger stand than do honorable members of the Opposition. I am certainly not going to allow honorable members opposite to suggest by the amendment that they are proposing something in support of the White Australia policy. The amendment has nothing whatever to do with that matter. I point out that if honorable members think that that policy is now in jeopardy, they are a little late in the determined action they propose to take. I would remind them that the Navigation Act has been in existence for a long time, and I ask them if they can discover in that measure any reference to black or white labour. Is there a single provision on the statute-book of this country to prevent Australian ships from being manned by black labour ? </para>

                        <para>- I remind the honorable member that there is nothing in that section to prevent black labour from being employed on the vessels that are licensed. I would also remind another honorable member who interjected, that Australian wages are not paid on the licensed ships, and yet they are permitted to trade in Australian waters. Honorable members will remember that the one part of the Australian coast where licences to engage in the coastal trade are granted is the western coast of Western Australia, and the licensed ships are manned by black labour. I urge honorable members to regard this subject as it affects the whole of the people, and not those of one particular set. There is no limitation of the bill to any one State under this clause. It merely provides that, under certain circumstances, where a particular trade is being injured to the detriment of the people of Australia, a licence may be granted. The Government is asking the committee to enact this measure, not because of the circumstances now under consideration, but because in the future different circumstances may arise in which, as on the western coast of Western Australia today, the service desired can only be supplied by the employment of ships manned by black labour. If the amendment were accepted, it would not be possible in these circumstances to furnish the assistance required. </para>

                        <para>- It would be most undesirable to accept the amendment and thus make it impossible, should the. occasion arise in the future, to give necessary shipping services to particular parts of Australia. The other aspect of the matter is one that I do not intend to stress, but it is very serious, in that if we now show discrimination against British ships in the treatment we accord our own vessels - and we shall be doing that if Ave provide that ships carrying black crews are to be treated in a different manner from vessels manned by white crews - we shall be acting contrary to a section of the Merchant Shipping Act of Great Britain, which provides - </para>

                <para class="block">In a judgment of the High Court last year the point was taken that because the Commonwealth Constitution Act was passed subsequent to the Colonial Laws Validity Act, we were freed from the provisions of the British statute; but the High Court held that that was not so. If the proposed amendment were inserted in the Navigation Act, its constitutionality could be challenged, and before the decision of the High Court could be reversed, it would be necessary to appeal to the Privy Council. I do not lay emphasis on the fact that it would be necessary to obtain the royal assent to an amendment such as this, because I am certain that, if the constitutionality of a provision that prevented the people from giving effect to their will and determination under their Constitution were challenged, there would be no difficulty in having it altered. I merely mention these matters to show that serious delay might arise if such, an amendment came into operation. What I principally wish to lay stress upon is the point that I took in my opening remarks, namely, that the amendment has nothing to do with the White Australia policy, but is based on the desire, which I think we all share, to see the shipping of Australia carried on, as far as possible, by vessels manned by white crews. But honorable members must show reasonableness, and remember that we should not, merely for a political advantage, be prepared to place a heavy burden on any section of the community. A great deal of the carrying trade of this country, inwards and outwards, is done by ships manned by coloured crews, and it is not fair and reasonable to say that, in no circumstances will we allow necessary relief, such as is proposed to be given under this bill, to be provided, because we object to black crews, although there is no other way of giving that relief, since the ships manned by white crews are not supplying an equal measure &#39;of relief. I can assure the committee that the Government is desirous that the White Australia policy shall be observed. That policy is not involved in the measure under consideration, and, in giving effect to it, the Government will only grant a licence to a ship manned by a coloured crew where it is impossible otherwise to provide the relief warranted. That, I think, should be acceptable to honorable members on both sides of the chamber, and I, therefore, urge that the amendment be withdrawn. </para>

                    <para>.- I propose to address myself only to the amendment which I moved last night. In moving it, I spoke only a few words urging the Minister to accept it, and I fondly imagined that he would do so. I was strengthened in that belief when I found that some honorable members on the other side were in accord with the intention expressed in the amendment. I was, therefore, disappointed to hear the Minister&#39;s statement that the Government was not prepared to accept it. That disappointment was increased this evening when I listened to the definite statement of the Prime Minister in regard to it. Let us examine the case presented to the House by the Prime Minister. This bill is to suspend partially the operation of the Navigation Act, which took may years to pass through this Parliament; for something like ten years it was under consideration before it. became the law of this country. I agree with the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> and the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> that the Navigation Act is one of the finest pieces of legislation on the statute-book of Australia. As the bill introduced by the Government is an attempt to tamper with that legislation, we on this side voted against the second reading. Having been beaten in the division, we are endeavouring to make this legislation as harmless as possible. The Government would have been well advised to accept the amendment. The Prime Minister says that the bill in no way interferes with the principle of a White Australia. When I moved the amendment I said that the bill did not legislate against the White Australia policy. I now repeat that statement. </para>

                        <para>- I know exactly what I said, and I shall not retract one word. The honorable member is doubting me before I have spoken. I said last night that, strictly speaking, the White Australia policy was not. involved. I went further, and said that that policy concerns residence in Australia, that so far as the racial question is concerned it is not involved by this legislation. But I said also that, from an economic point of view, this legislation does affect that policy. The sentiment supporting the White Australia policy is affected also. It is perfectly true, as the Prime Minister stated, that the White Australia policy is concerned with residence in Australia, and with keeping pure the Australian race. That is not affected by this legislation, because coloured seamen on British ships cannot land and reside here. But from the economic point of view the White Australia policy means that our own white people shall not be asked to compete in Australia with coloured people. Surely that means also -that they shall not be asked to compete in the coastal trade of Australia with coloured crews oh ships. I think that is a fair statement of the position. </para>

                        <para>- I was about to refer to that matter. The argument put forward is that there will be no competition with white labour on our coast, because the act will be put into operation only when there are no boats manned by white labour available. So long as you give permits to boats manned by cheap coloured labour to trade on the Australian coast when the ships existing are insufficient, so long will the ships on that coast remain insufficient, and so long will it be impossible for us to extend our coastal trade by adding vessels manned by white crews paid at Australian rates. While there may be no competition with the existing shipping - and that I question, because it will depend on the administration of this legislation - what will be the state of affairs warranting the issue of a proclamation stating that shipping is not available ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Will it be as sympathetic as it should be? If the Government is influenced by the statements of many honorable members on the other side who want the whole of the Navigation Act scrapped, then I say that the administration of this legislation will bring into competition with our vessels manned by white crews other vessels manned by cheap coloured labour. The Prime Minister asked whether Australia should be handicapped through not being able to take advantage of this legislation at a time when the only boats available would be those manned by coloured labour. He gave an assurance that the Government would not grant permits to boats manned by coloured crews when vessels manned by white crews were available. He said further that the amendment could not -be accepted because it would discriminate between British ships. Yet he gave the House the assurance that the Government would discriminate. Where is the Prime Minister&#39;s consistency? There is none. The Prime Minister&#39;s argument that Australia would suffer because sufficient boats manned by white crews would not always be available was answered last night by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten),</inline> who said that of the 37 overseas boats trading with Tasmania 30 were manned by white crews. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> endeavoured to discount the importance of those figures by saying that sixteen of those vessels were cargo boats. I now ask him how many of those sixteen vessels carry coloured crews ? </para>

                        <para>- That reduces the 37 boats by 16, leaving 21. On the Minister&#39;s own showing, seven of these boats carry coloured crews. That means that fourteen of the 21 vessels carrying passengers have white crews. On the Minister&#39;s own figures it is clear that there would still be sufficient ships to meet the deficiency regarding the trade with Tasmania, which he alleges exists, but which we deny. It is useless for the Prime Minister to say that this legislation does not apply to one State only. The Minister who introduced the bill did not say that, and it was not suggested by him that it applied to any part of Australia excepting Tasmania. Every one. knows that it has been introduced for a specific purpose. As the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> stated, the evidence presented before the Navigation Commission proves that there is no justification for this legislation. The Prime Minister having said that we ought not to discriminate between British ships, hastened to add that he did not wish to stress that point. By not stressing it he showed wisdom. Why should we not discriminate between British ships when some of them carry white and some coloured crews? If any legislation exists which prevents our doing so, that legislation should be attacked in this Parliament. According to the Prime Minister, we must not discriminate between British ships; yet the Minister who introduced this legislation introduced o the last Parliament a measure to discriminate between British manufacturers in connexion with the importation of goods into Australia. By this amendment, we provide that British ships manned by coloured crews shall not get this concession. That, says the Minister, is discrimination. </para>

                <para class="block">Britisher, and yet the Minister says that we must not discriminate in regard to British ships, because to do so would violate the Merchant Shipping Act. Let us examine that argument. In what way would what is proposed be discrimination ? If the bill, even with this amendment, is carried, we shall discriminate in favour of British ships as against Australian ships. .Under the Navigation Act no vessels other than those employing crews paid under Australian trade union conditions or arbitration awards can engage in our coastal trade. Even under the amendment the only ships that could trade on the Australian coast without a licence would be British ships. All the vessels manned under Australian conditions are licensed. They get no concessions. The Prime Minister says that there is nothing &#39;in the Navigation Act to prevent coloured labour from being employed on any ship trading on the Australian coast. That sounds very well, but it is a specious argument. Every one knows that the Peninsular, and Oriental boats employ coloured crews only because they are willing to work for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> or &#163;3 a month. During the war, when, in the interests of the Empire, the best crews possible were necessary, the cheap labour of coloured crews was rejected in favour of white labour. But when the war was over, and the patriotic, courageous, aud loyal men who defended the Empire&#39;s shores were no longer necessary, they were turned adrift and their places taken by cheap coloured crews. The Government now wants to hand over the coastal trade of Australia to vessels employing crews of this nature. We on this side contend that this work should be done by vessels manned by white crews under Australian conditions. That is the question which honorable members must decide; they cannot evade it by any subterfuge. &#39; It is not suggested that we should impose hardships on British ships that are not to be imposed on Australian ships. On the contrary, the Government proposals grant concessions to British ships to trade along the Australian coast and to pay wages which are not more than half of those paid to the crews of Australian vessels engaged on the same coast. Yet that is called discriminating against British in favour of Australian  ships ! </para>

The bill provides that certain vessels may take part in the coasting trade of Australia, paying white seamen half the wages which are paid to seamen in other vessels engaged in the same trade, and my amendment would prevent the owners of those vessels employing coloured crews paid only one-sixth of the Australian rate of wages. It represents a rough-and-ready way of preventing the Navigation Act from being so radically altered as to make it possible to have seamen in the coasting trade of Australia paid at a rate of about &#163;3 per month. Honorable members know that the coloured crews aimed at by the amendment are the cheap sweated crews that are employed on boats like the Peninsular and Oriental Company&#39;s boats. </para>

It is like a fresh breeze blowing through the chamber after listening to the speech we heard from the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> this afternoon. We are now asked to do something which was sanctioned by the Australian Seamen&#39;s Union. This afternoon the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> went even further when he said, &#34; Why, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh</inline> said soandso,&#34; and because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh</inline> said it this Parliament should say it. </para>

                        <para>- It was the effect of it. Now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh</inline> and the Seamen&#39;s Union are held up to us as patterns of all the virtues. I can understand that the Government, and its supporters, are grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Walsh, because he is accountable for the gallant array which we see on the other side. There was a deportation stunt by the Government, but not because it was believed that the deportation of any two individuals would make much difference in the settlement of the big problems confronting the country. One Nationalist, in a moment of confidence, said that it was foolish to suggest that the deportation stunt would effect anything in that direction; but it had a wonderful effect in winning for the Government the election. In the circumstances I can quite understand the Prime Minister and the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poster)</inline> being prepared to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Walsh on a question like this. What does it matter if the Australian Seamen&#39;s Union does admit some coloured men, or that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh</inline> said this, that, or the other? What does matter in this legislation is what the members of this Parliament say and how they vote. I ask honorable members opposite how they intend to vote on an important question like this? The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said that the amendment should cause honorable members to pause and consider whether something may not be done to lessen the importance of the sentiment which is the basis of the White Australia policy, and in which many in this country have grown up. It is in keeping with the sentiment of that policy to demand that the progress of Australian industries shall not be retarded by the competition of the products of cheap coloured labour, and that the progress of Australian trade by ships manned by white men shall not be retarded by the competition of vessels employing coloured crews. I stand by the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with the Government in refusing to accept the amendment. In this matter the White Australia policy is not involved in any shape or form - racial or economic. By the passing of the measure the Government proposes to provide for the excess trade which the licensed ships of the Commonwealth are unable to cope with, and by so doing to help to increase the employment of white labour in Tasmania. The purpose of the bill may thus be said to be the maintenance of the White Australia policy. It is a dog-in-the-manger attitude to starve certain citizens of the Commonwealth who ask that certain British boats shall be permitted to carry on a trade which our own boats are incapable of doing. The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> quoted copiously from the evidence taken by the Navigation Commission. I remind honorable members that the minutes of evidence taken by the commission cover approximately 18,000questions, and, just as anything may be contended on the strength of certain quotations from Holy Writ, so the attempt may be made to prove anything by the quotation of certain evidence taken by the Navigation Commission. The members of the commission received letters patent from the Governor-General to inquire into aud report upon the effect of the operation of the Navigation Act on trade, industry, and development in Australia and its territories, including the Mandated Territories. The honorable member admitted before this House yesterday that he and those who saw with him were there to defend this monument of legislation, the Navigation Act. I submit that the honorable member received the same letters patent as I did to inquire into the effect of this &#34;monument&#34; upon Australian trade, industry, and development. I say that its effect in many directions has been to retard those things. That has been the more manifest in the remoter parts of Australia. Western Australia, Tasmania, and the northern parts of Queensland have suffered from the operation of the act, and on this subject evidence of great value was submitted to the commission. There are men in this city like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hugh</inline> V. McKay, who have show great business ability and built up valuable industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Samuel</inline> McKay, the works manager for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hugh</inline> V.

                <para class="block">He referred, I think, to Queensland silky oak. The firm got the timber it required from Noumea because of the cheaper freight. He explained that if the firm got the timber it required from Queensland, farmers would have to pay more for their machinery, and it was too costly at present. When the members of the commission went to Queensland they found that crockery made in Western Australia was very acceptable, but the freight on a 3&#39;6-ft. ton from Western Australia to Queensland was 90s., whilst the freight from England on a 40-ft. ton was only 70s. We cannot bring our raw materials and factories together because of the excessive freights under the Navigation Act. It is strangling White Australia by permitting the imposition of conditions under which we cannot compete with any other country in the world. With respect to the tourist traffic, the honorable member for Adelaide quoted further evidence, but he admitted that he was on the commission for the purpose of maintaining &#34; this monument,&#34; and not for honestly ascertaining whether the operation of the monument was or was not detrimental to Australian trade. The honorable member will agree that I reported that the steamship owners had, because of the Navigation Act, been given a monopoly which enabled them to form a combine. They met together and agreed that one company should send a boat to a certain port this week, and another some other boat next week. They agreed that there must be no improvement upon a certain fixed service, and that certain freights and no others should be charged. The port of Albany, which used to be served by about eight ships per month, was limited to one ship a month, although the population of that place had increased by 25 per cent. I am aware that the transcontinental railway took many passengers that were previously carried by sea. The permit system was supposed te give relief where licensed ships could not cope with the trade offering. The <inline font-style="italic">Katoomba</inline> was held up by a strike, and people in Western Australia who had business to do in the eastern States wished to go by a White Star liner that was in Fremantle at the time. The  Deputy  Director of Navigation was asked to grant a licence to permit of those people being carried by the White Star liner. He was prepared to do so if the agents of the vessel would apply for it. They refused to do so. I ascertained that they did not apply for a permit because they feared that the union might declare the ship black. This Parliament, by passing the Navigation Act, has placed  the control of our interstate shipping in the hands of the Seamen&#39;s Union and the shipping combine. It is not a fair thing to the people of Australia. It should not have rested with the agents of the White Star liner to apply for a permit. There should be a definite announcement by the Government that if licensed ships are held up by strikes and are not rendering service to the people, the Navigation Act will be suspended at least to permit passengers to travel by other boats in order to attend to their ordinary business. Why should our people be persecuted as they are under the present shipping conditions? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> T. Emmett, ex-Director of the Tourist Bureau, gave evidence before the commission as follows:- 10939. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> - You opened with a statement that, I think, ought to be enlarged upon. You say, &#34; The tourist traffic to Tasmania is restricted because of the fact .that the only really comfortable steamers which ever come from mainland ports to Hobart are not allowed to carry interstate passengers.&#34; In your opinion, there is no comfort on those boats. Is there no comfort on the <inline font-style="italic">Riverina}</inline> - I mean in comparison with the <inline font-style="italic">Osterley</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Ormonde.</inline> 10940. Are those the only boats that you can get comfort on? - The smaller boats fill up to such an extent that they have to use shakedowns. </para>
                <para class="block">There may be a class feeling that these tourists ought to put up with those conditions, but when people have saved money for a holiday they do not want to travel under conditions of semi-privation. The honorable member for Adelaide (Mt. Yates) quoted from other portions of the evidence to show that the tourist traffic of Tasmania has not seriously declined. It is difficult at any time to find &#39;the extent of, and reason for, loss of trade. Sometimes &#34; what the eye does not see the heart does not grieve.&#34; Tasmania established tourist bureaux in Brisbane, Melbourne, and other places to attract people to that State. It spent a considerable sum of money to develop a genuine trade, but the effort was wasted owing to the operation of tha Navigation Act. That trade could have been largely developed if our licensed ships had dealt with it properly. But the shipping companies did not consider it a financial proposition, because their vessels would be in operation for three or four months, and laid up for the remainder of the year. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Emmett&#39; E</inline> evidence continues - 10942. You say, &#34; The berthing accommodation is over applied for, and people are turned away.&#34; Can you give us any further particulars about that. Have you figures with regard to people being turned away?- I have a telegram from my Sydney manager, dated November, 1921, as follows : - &#34; Not even a shakedown either sex saloon now available December twenty-first boat.&#34; </para>
                <para class="block">Honorable members will notice that to secure berths bookings had to be made a long time ahead. People will .not make arrangements for a tourist trip under such adverse conditions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Emmett</inline> was further questioned - 10943. Do you &#34;know if that condition continued over a series of voyages? - The congestion applies particularly to that boat every year. 10944. What was the name of that ship? - I think that it was the <inline font-style="italic">Riverina.</inline> I have a telegram of the same date from my Brisbane manager, saying, &#34; Want of shipping accommodation seriously affecting tourist traffic. Twenty shut out, Sydney, 21st, and Melbourne, 23rd December, will probably cut Tasmania out.&#34; 10945. Would you expect .the companies to hold ships in readiness for that time of the year ? - No. 10946. Did that difficulty recur in 1922?- Yes. I had a wire dated the 14th November, stating, &#34; <inline font-style="italic">Riverina,</inline> 20th December, has only a few shake-downs left. Absolutely nothing for ladies. Have request from Brisbane four passengers. Cannot supply.&#34; </para>
                <para class="block">During certain months of the year there is an abnormal traffic to and from Tas mania, and it is unreasonable to expect the normal shipping service to cater for it. Although these boats may be excellent from certain aspects, yet they are not of a standard that appeals to the tourist. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Sheldon when examined by the commission said - </para>

                    <para>The effect of the act has undoubtedly been to diminish the facilities for communication and distribution between the States, and at the present juncture, at any rate, this ls very detrimental to the interests of the producers. There has been a curtailment of the facilities that existed in the past. </para>
                    <para>Do you think that a regular, efficient, and frequent shipping service around the coast of Australia would tend towards the development of this country ? - Nothing would do more in that direction. It seems extraordinary that one can get goods more cheaply from New York to Western Australia than from Sydney to Western Australia. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The commission&#39;s report in that respect reads as follows: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>With regard to the effect of the Navigation Act on primary and secondary production, your Commissioners, after having weighed the evidence and considered the position as it stands, recognize that in order to keep up Australian standards of living, seamen, as well as workers on the land, are entitled to the Australian standard, and in the same manner the shipping companies whose ships are licensed under the Navigation Act, being obliged to provide this high standard of living, are entitled to charge fares and freights commensurate with the added cost to them, in order that they may run at a profit. This is axiomatical, but when an attempt is made to place the primary and secondary producer  of Australia, especially the primary producer who exports his products, in an equal position, great difficulty is met with as to how he is to be placed under the Australian standard of living. The shipping company, having passed its obligations on in the shape of higher freights, the primary producer, after paying them, is unable to pass them on. The burden, therefore, must rest upon his shoulders while they are able to bear it. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The effect of the Navigation Act has been precisely what- is set out in that statement. There has been an attempt to extend this exclusive policy of White Australia to our shipping, and there are those who would extend it to the shipping of other countries&#39;. Consequently Australia has been placed in a more insular position than would otherwise be the case.. The convenience and economic requirements of Australia are set aside in the interests of the dual combine which has been made possible by the legislation passed in this Parliament. The commission&#39;s report clearly shows that the operation of the Navigation Act has been detrimental to the workers and general development of Australia. This Government wisely removed the Mandated Territories from the operation of the act. One would think that under section 286 of the Navigation Act we had power to issue to British ships in Australian ports permits to carry passengers, if no licensed ships were available, or if the shipping service were inadequate. That section has proved entirely futile. The arguments circled around the question of the adequacy of a service. The shipping companies contended that it was adequate. If cargo were involved, such as Queensland meat when the price was ls. a lb. in Melbourne and 2d. a lb. in Brisbane, the shipowners would wait until the ship was about to leave before saying whether they could take the cargo offering, and if they declined to do so, it was then too late to get other vessels to take it. The same conditions applied to the passenger traffic. The people of Australia are not getting a fair deal. The conclusion on this point of four of the seven commissioners is as follows :  - </para>
                <quote>

                <para class="block">I mentioned the other day that when the original Navigation Bill was introduced, the shipping companies opposed it tooth and nail. When it was passed they combined and made the best of the situation. The Inchcape combine having acquired a controlling interest in Australian shipping does not care to meddle with the Navigation Act, and if the people of any portion of Australia are inconvenienced the combine does not bother to apply for permits under section 286. It is quite content to allow the people in Queensland or Western Australia to wait a week or more for a licensed boat to give them the service they require. The commission reported: - </para>

                        <para>- The exemption which Western Australia already enjoys will be jeopardized if this amendment is agreed to. The present trade between that State and Java and other eastern countries has been developed over 40 years. Western Australia requires to retain those markets for its fruit, potatoes, meat, and dairy produce; but if the concessions at present granted to shipping are removed that trade will be strangled. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> referred to the Western Australian State ships. He should have told the committee that the State service shows a large loss annually, and that unless more money is spent to extend the service and probably increase the losses, the north-west will be crippled entirely. It is singular that in Western Australia a Labour Government should have established a State shipping service and that in Tasmania a Government of the same complexion should have abolished a State service established by a Nationalist Government. </para>

                        <para>- Tasmania&#39;s necessities forced the Labour Government to take a sane action. The taxpayers of Western Australia have paid heavily for the losses sustained by the State ships, and if a Commonwealth line of steamers between the mainland and Tasmania is established it also will prove unprofitable. This bill will enable thousands of persons engaged in the Tasmanian fruit industry, and in catering for the tourist traffic, to earn an honest living. The dog in the manger policy advocated by honorable  members opposite in a futile endeavour to make even the ocean white, would deprive the people of the island of their means of livelihood. </para>

                    <para>. -  I approach the consideration of the amendment with the open mind of a person who does not usually make arbitrary distinctions between the stern and bow of a vessel, and has never pretended to solve those mystifying differences between starboard and larboard and like phrases that convey so much to the initiated and so little to the layman. It is possible that had I enjoyed the advantage of hearing 19,000 questions asked and answered in connexion with the royal commission on navigation, I would by . this time have known as little about the subject as does the honorable member for Forrest. But being hampered by the limitations imposed by my innocence, I am driven to analyze the fundamental principle underlying the amendment. In so doing I venture to consider what objects were sought to. be served, and what mischiefs to be cured by the original act, which has been variously described as a monument and a grave-stone. </para>

                        <para>- I do not attempt to draw a distinction either between a monument and a grave-stone. I leave that also to the subtle minds of those gentlemen who heard19,000 questions asked and answered. But I know that the Labour party, of which I have the honour to be a member, strove hard to place the Navigation Act upon the statute-book for the protection of Australian workers, and the maintenance of Australia&#39;s high ideals and favorable conditions of labour. A significant feature of this debate is that the Government, which pretends to uphold the Navigation Act, is being supported in its opposition to the amendment by the opponents of that statute. The honorable member for Forrest who claimed to be dispassionate was so enthusiastic in his opposition as to almost work himself into a white heat of dispassionateness ! I cannot overlook the fact that he and the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> are the admitted champions in this House of those who would doubtfully benefit Australia by the unlimited and indiscriminate importation of goods manufactured abroad by coloured and sweated labour. The Minister for Trade and </para>

                <para class="block">Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> should ask himself whether he is safe in such company, and with such support : I hardly think he is. The Minister, as usual, introduced the Bill in terms so pleasant and platitudinous that any one listening to him would have supposed that it does not affect any vital principle of existing legislation, but merely gives expression to a benevolent desire to benefit Tasmania, that Cinderella State which has been for so many years returning to its &#34; Ma &#34; with supplications for support and assistance in its troubles. </para>

                        <para>- I have nothing but the kindliest feelings for Tasmania. By an unfortunate accident in some prehistoric cataclysm, it was torn off the coast of Victoria, and therefore I regard it as a relation of the family; but I have always marvelled that navigators should have reached such a high standard of efficiency as to be able to locate it on a dark night. I did visit Tasmania once, and having walked round and had a good look at the island, returned on the following day, thoroughly satisfied with my brief outing. Unquestionably, this vital proposal to whittle away the provisions of the Navigation Act is one of the first fruits of the general election. </para>

                        <para>-- A very important principle may underlie a very unimportant thing - the honorable member, for instance. This bill does contain an important principle; it is one of the first fruits of &#34; the mandate,&#34; and from this day forward the people will begin to realize, if they have not done so already, precisely what they bought at the last election. Of course, the Minister for Trade and Customs carefully refrained from disclosing tha importance of the measure, and suggested that it waa of merely local interest, and designed only to help Tasmania in its difficulty. But the bubble has been pricked. The honorable members for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> moved an amendment which, in the language of certain members of my party, has &#34; put the acid on&#34; the Government and its  supporters. i-&#39;- It requires them to declare whether &#39;tHey- are champions of the &#34;White Australia policy, Australian conditions of &#39; labour, and that racial purity which the Navigation Act was designed to protect, or are believers iti labour, cheap, coloured, and nasty. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> in his generosity, conceded almost too much when he said that the policy of a White Australia was not involved. I think that to a certain extent it is. That policy involves something more than racial purity - which, of course, is the first and the essential part of it; it embraces also economic conditions, including the question of the just reward of labour. The proposal to grant concessions to ships&#39; that employ coloured labour at sweated rates of pay is an impingement upon the policy of a White Australia. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> aroused by the fact that the amendment was receiving support from unexpected quarters, and from persons who are. well acquainted with the matter, said that it would be ungenerous to the Australian people who hoped to benefit by the granting of these concessions. That argument might, have been used just as effectively in an attack upon the whole act, it would have come more fittingly from the honorable member for Forrest (Mr.&#39; Prowse), or the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> who are opposed to the act. If all those honorable members who are &#39; opposed to it backed up their opinions with their votes, the Navagation  Act would not have a very long life. </para>

                        <para>- I would not be so severe upon the Nationalist party as to suggest that the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> is typical of nationalism. I give him credit for being in the vanguard, of the reactionaries, if they can have a vanguard. The Prime Minister further said that the amendment amounted to discrimination, and would probably violate the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act a3 interpreted under the Colonial Laws Validity Act. I was entertained by the manner in which the right honorable gentleman put that objection. He apologized for doing so, and concluded  His  argument by saying that he did not think there was very much in it, because he was certain that no practical- difficulty would arise from a desire by this Parliament to legislate in respect of Australian shipping in a way that might be out of harmony with some of the provisions that relate to British ships abroad. I agree with the right honorable gentleman&#39;s conclusions, which prove that there was nothing in; his argument. Further than that I do not agree with his argument. I should like honorable members opposite to understand the real issue. To use a much-harassed word, the &#34;camouflage&#34; has been removed, the pleasant fiction that we are legislating with respect to the tourist traffic to Tasmania is shattered, and the question to be answered is, &#34;Do you stand for the basic principles of the Navigation Act and the White Australia policy; do you believe in cheap coloured labour or for adequately paid Australian labour upon Australian ships that trade in our waters?&#34; It must be remembered that a British or any other ship that enters an Australian port is in Australia. The discredit of having sweated Iascar crews to do work that ought to be done by Australians at Australian rates of pay will attach to everybody who supports that policy. I ask honorable members opposite to consider the matter on its merits, and not to expect that any special devotion to Tasmania will save them at the final judgment upon this matter, which is vital to Australia and Australians. I did not wish to say anything offensive to the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson).</inline> He is an old friend of mine, of whose capacity I have a very high opinion. I value his friendship greatly, and if I hurt his feelings I am sorry.. I shall support the amendment, and I shall be interested to note the number of honorable members opposite who cross the floor to give effect, by their votes, to what they have so often mouthed in pleasant platitudes upon the hustings, when seeking the votes of the Australian electors. </para>

                    <para>.- I am satisfied that every member of this House desires information which will enable him to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion, so I shall relate some of the experiences that I, unfortunately, have had of the operation of the Navigation Act. I was  chairman  of directors of the Oro Bay Plantation Company Limited. The shareholders in that company were not in very affluent circumstances, but they regarded coco-nuts as &#34;  the  consols of theEast.&#34; The plantation comprised upwards of 1,000 acres under coco-nuts, on the  northern  slopes of the Hydrographer Ranges, near the township of Buna,  on  the north-east coast of Papua. The capital of the company was originally &#163;25,000, but that was found to be inadequate, and a further &#163;25,000 was added to it, again largely by the contributions of persons who were not in very affluent circumstances. After some years we began to produce copra. We then found that we were in a worse position financially than when we were not producing it. Because of the provisions of the Navigation Act, we could not ship it elsewhere than to Sydney, and the cost of shipping was always from  &#163;1  10s.  to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> a  ton greater  than the price which was obtained  for  the copra in Sydney. We made representations to the Commonwealth Government through our agents, Loudoun and Company. We considered that, if we were placed in  a  position in which we could continue our industry, many tons of copra would go to Sydney, thus increasing the wealth of  Australia.  The industries in the Commonwealth would thereby reap an advantage and a greater amount of money would go- into the pockets of the workers. We could not obtain the relief we sought, and we lost, every penny of our capital. </para>

                        <para>- Our disabilities were caused by the operation of the Navigation Act. I am perfectly satisfied that my facts are correct. There was a large number of small shareholders in the company, and the six directors considered  that  the responsibility rested upon them to endeavour to save them from  loss.  They could  not  recommend the subscription of further capital, so they promoted a new company. Circulars were sent to the shareholders telling them frankly what the position was, and stating that the directors proposed to put into the company an additional &#163;500 each and to allow the old shareholders to come in if the venture proved profitable. That &#163;500 also was lost by each director. There were in various stages of development 1,000 acres under coco-nuts. I believe so strongly in the White Australia policy that if I could be sure that the  Navigation  Act was in the best interests of Australia I would gladly suffer the loss of my &#163;5,500. It might be well worth the while of honorable members to consider whether that act confers the benefits that are claimed for it, or whether it is not that class of monument upon which an epitaph should be written. </para>

                        <para>- I grant that, but efforts to settle a country invariably result in loss in the initial stages. Even the Commonwealth Bank showed a loss af the commencement of its operations. Will the honorable member deny that the State-owned steamers to which reference has been made were the only vessels on which the rates and fares were not raised during the war ? The honorable member, as a representative of Western Australia,  should be prepared to pay that compliment to that line. Tasmania  derives  many advantages from its tourist traffic. I have visited that State on many occasions, and have always enjoyed the experience. The Labour party wishes its people the best of fortune, and if it had the power it would see that every part of the Commonwealth was served by Government-owned vessels. Seeing that the mainland is girded by railways, Tasmania is entitled to an efficient and regular steamship service. Unfortunately for itself, however, it has been so badly ruled by Nationalist governments that the people have now handed over the control to the Labour party. I do not desire to be unkind in saying that the idea promulgated some years ago that, on account of Tasmania&#39;s, proximity to Victoria, it should be annexed by that State, might have been acted on with advantage. Despite its small population, its representation in the Senate is equal to that of New South Wales, whose population exceeds its population by 2,000,000. The bill raises the question of the introduction of coloured labour. I have no wish to point the finger of scorn at any person whose skin is black. One of the basic principles of unionism is that if coloured people are here in our midst, and are prepared to work for the same wages, and under the same conditions as white men, they should be treated as comrades. I am proud of the friendship of a man whose skin is as black as the ace of spades. He is a high officer in one of the unions, and he is received as a comrade and friend. The assertion that the Labour party is at enmity with people whose skins are not white, is untrue. &#34; Has any honorable member travelled, as I have, as an officer on a ship on which lascars were employed ? Is it denied that they are frequently kicked, and that their serang often ill-uses them? They are employed by the Peninsular and Oriental Company simply because they furnish cheap labour. If the companies were compelled to pay them the same wages as white men receive, .they would refuse to employ them. A larger complement of lascars than of white seamen is retained, because the wages paid are low.

                    lock Wilson, when he was a real friend of the sailors, one admiral stated that the strength of the British Navy was being undermined by that very company employing lascars, because in time of war we could not depend on coloured crews to fight our battles. He refused to vote with his party, because he thought it was in the wrong. By this bill, however, the Government is seeking to introduce the thin edge of the wedge of coloured labour. The Minister for Trade and Customs
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline>
                    has admitted the difficulties in regard to Papua  and New Guinea, and I hope that before the division is taken, the Government will see its way clear to accept the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Yarra
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin).</inline>
                    If it cannot accept the wording of the amendment, I hope that it will accept a similar amendment embodying the same idea. That, I feel sure, would be gratifying to honorable members on this side. We are desirous of helping Tasmania, but not by the means provided under the bill. The only slaves we have yet had in Australia were the kanakas employed in Queensland. I believe I am the only member of this Chamber who witnessed the end of that period of slavery. I saw how Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company handled those natives when they were returned to their own shores. Although I have said much by way of criticism of that company, I will pay it the compliment of saying that there was not one incident in connexion with the return of the natives to which exception could be taken. Three times we approached their island - their village was only a mile from the place where they had to be landed - -because of the&#39; fear of the natives that they &#39; might have to pass an unfriendly village  and be made kai kai. The right honorable member for North Sydney
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline>
                    is the only present member who was in this House when there was a strong black Australia party sitting on the opposite side. As election followed election those who advocated black labour, and the retention of the kanakas in Queensland, disappeared one by one. The final representative of that section was
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline>
                    Smith, the ex-member for Parkes, who disappeared after about 40 years of parliamentary life. If there is one principle dear to the heart of every true Australian it is the White Australia policy. The division on this amendment will be closely watched, and I ask those honorable members who are younger than I am to note how the numbers in favour of black labour will continue to decrease. To-day this Government is all-powerful. It can do anything it pleases by its combined majorities in this Chamber and in the Senate; but surely it will not take an unfair advantage of the Opposition. If, even in this small matter of seven ships, it will give preference to coloured labour, some members of the party opposite will live to regret it. I am sure that when the proposal is brought before the board of directors of the great Australian Natives Association, as it undoubtedly will be, it will be resented. I have travelled throughout the length and breadth of Tasmania, and -I feel confident that the people of that State would not desire a shipping service at such a price as the abandonment of the White Australia policy. All they  want is a fair chance of building up their tourist traffic, and catering for their ordinary commercial requirements. On arrival in Tasmania on one occasion I applied to the firm of Holyman and Sons to see if I could secure a berth for &#39;my daughter on the return journey. On the voyage from Melbourne I had been content to sit on the deck. I received an answer in the affirmative, and three weeks before the vessel was due to sail I went to book berths. But I found that no berths had been &#39; reserved, and I remonstrated so strongly with the captain that at least a shakedown was found for my daughter. I called a meeting of the passengers, who decided that Holyman and Sons had behaved most contemptible in the matter of the fares charged, and the travelling conditions provided. I did not object to the fare in the case of my daughter, but I took exception to the payment of my own fare. The company asked me why, and I gave my reasons. Then a member of the firm wrote a letter which was a tissue of the most awful lies I had ever read. I pledged my honour to the Minister of the day that if Holyman and Sons would make a sworn declaration that the statements contained in the letter were true, I would prosecute them for perjury. But the member of the firm concerned declined to make such a declaration. That. fare has never been paid, and I believe that two of my fellow passengers on that occasion followed my example. The vessel was good enough, but to the management and the untruthful statements by the firm I took strong exception. That, however is a bygone matter. Tasmania is a land full of opportunities. Its mineral resources in tin . are unequalled in any other part of the world. In that huge lake upon the mountain it has a wonderful source of power, which, owing to the &#39; actions of governments in the past, was not a success, but under the existing administration is proving of benefit to the State. Any measure brought before this Chamber which has for its object the assisting of Tasmania, while not interfering with the White Australia policy or with the Navigation Act, will have my support, and I feel sure that of every member on this side.

                    <para>. - When this measure was before the Chamber last night, I said that I had refrained from speaking on the motion for the second reading, and until the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> moved his amendment, it had not occurred to me to offer any contribution to the debate. Certainly I had no intention of objecting to the measure. But the amendment raised a new issue, on which I stated my views shortly, suggesting that it would be advisable to have the opinion of the Prime Minister upon it. That opinion has since been given to us. The position must, therefore, be again reviewed in the light of the declaration of the Prime Minister on the attitude of the Government on the White Australia policy raised by the amendment. The honorable member for Yarra, always a forcible and, I may add, a most ingenious debater, has replied to the Prime Minister; but his arguments, although forceful, were not convincing. What he said would have come naturally to my own lips, and I, therefore, had no difficulty in following the workings of his mind. We have also heard the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> and have had the advantage of a most interesting and illuminating travel talk from the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney).</inline> Of oratory and argument there has been no lack; but all is not gold that glitters, and I have come somewhat reluctantly to the conclusion that their passionate declarations of unflinching adherence to the White Australia policy are not entirely unconnected with party tactics. One side asserts that this bill imperils the White Australia, policy, the other denies it. Therefore, I ask myself whether the bill before us does imperil the White Australia policy, or substantially impairs that statute to which some honorable members have referred as a monument of legislation, and which the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> spoke of as a gravestone. That which inclines my mind most against the bill is the jeering reference to the Navigation Act made by the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> in his speech, and the interjections of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> When these honorable gentlemen spoke of the Navigation Act as having retarded the advance of Australia, I felt inclined to say exactly what I think of those who held such opinions. But, realizing that this is a new Parliament, I,  with much reluctance, intend to confine my remarks to the amendment.. What is the proposal contained in the Bill ? It is to authorize the Government to grant permits for overseas vessels to trade between certain ports of Australia. The avowed object is to facilitate tourist traffic. Although it is not so stated in the bill, this legislation is designed to assist Tasmania. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> who regards so much of the earth as is not included in the environs of Melbourne as a mere suburb, spoke disrespectfully of Tasmania, much as the honorable member for Swan spoke disrespectfully of the Navigation Act. But why should we not assist Tasmania ? I ask the committee : Is the Navigation . Act so poor and anaemic a thing as to be in danger- from the Minister&#39;s attack? The act, in my opinion, is essential to the life of Australia, and similar legislation is responsible for the greatness of England and of the United States of America. But is the carrying of apples on a Peninsular and Oriental boat, or the conveyance of tourists on an Orient boat, with the fearful alternative that there may come a day when some of them may have to be carried on a Peninsular and Oriental boat, calculated to interfere with the White Australia principle, and to destroy the Navigation Act? The arguments against the bill were summed up by the honorable member for Yarra, who said that it was designed to undermine the trade union movement and to reduce the standard of living, that it is an attempt to do by a stab with a dagger what no man would dare with the stroke of a sword. Such things are easily said : I could have said them myself, but the thing that matters is : Are these the facts ? In itself the measure is unobjectionable; but because of certain possible constitutional difficulties it has been deliberately framed without mention of any particular port or ports in the Commonwealth. It is designed to deal with the conveyance of tourists, but for the rest its intention is expressed in general terms. The bill introduces no new principle. What it proposes to do has, in substance, been done for years, under section 286 of the Navigation Act. It is well to remember that fact, and just what can be now done under the act. There is, for example, nothing in the Navigation Act to prevent a Peninsular and Oriental boat from taking apples or. other cargo from Hobart, or from Sydney; that has. always been permitted, though some honorable members, resembling Monsieur Jourdain,  have only just awakened to something that has been so from the beginning. Apples have always been carried in these vessels, but apparently it was only when we sprinkled them with arsenic that the fact became known. It is objected that the proposed legislation may be used to the injury of the White Australia policy. I admit that to be possible; but the Prime Minister has assured us that it is not the intention of the Government. I have, therefore, to ask myself whether T ought to vote for the amendment, because under the bill as drafted the Government may in the future do . something wrong. I repeat that the bill itself does no harm to the White Australia policy or the Navigation Act. The honorable member for Batman spoke of his predecessors who were responsible for the Navigation Act. I am responsible for that act, and for section 2S6, under which, to-day, fruit and passengers are carried by oversea vessels employing coloured labour under permits granted by the Commonwealth Government between the northern ports of Western Australia. That was permitted, not by any of the hybrid Governments which I brought into existence - it was done by a pure  merino Labour Government. It is not wood-wool, but the wool of the original ram. I see no real difference between carrying passengers on oversea steamers from Perth to Broome or Derby and carrying them between Sydney or Melbourne and Hobart or Launceston. Honorable members generally seem to be unaware that this has been going on in Western Australia for years. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator R.</inline> Guthrie and I investigated the matter on the spot, and although we were both men to whom the touch of coloured labour was, as it were, the taint of leprosy, we agreed that an exemption, on certain Western Australia ports, was essential, and should be made. The bill in proposing to grant permits to carry passengers between Australian ports makes no departure from settled principles that have long been applied. But the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> says that it may be used to injure the White Australia policy. Against that we have to put the assurance of the Prime Minister that it will not. Time will show which of these is right. When I find that anything is done under this bill which is a violation of the White Australia policy, and which does impair the vital principles of the Navigation Act, then I shall be the first to protest. Until then I am content with the assurance of the Prime-Minister. .The honorable member for Batman repeated what has been said by other honorable members, that the racial purity, as well as the economic welfare, of this country, will be affected by the Government proposal. He surely cannot have considered for a moment the circumstances to which this measure can lend itself. It cannot be suggested that our racial purity will be endangered by the carrying of passengers in a Peninsular and Oriental boat from Sydney to Hobart. As for possible injury to the economic welfare of the country, I am content to wait until the Government, under cover of giving to Tasmania that assistance which its geographical circumstances demand, does something which will aim an effective blow at the heart of unionism or the White Australia policy. Then, but not until then, I shall act. </para>

I am sorry for the mother of such twins, and I should imagine that she would feel like disowning twins that were so unlike one another. One statement made by the right honorable gentleman struck me as very interesting. I do not wish to misquote him. He said that he thought there was a danger that the bill would violate the White Australia policy, but the Prime Minister had given his assurance to the House that it would do no such thing. The right honorable gentleman is prepared to accept the assurance of a gentleman who on another occasion said that if the right honorable member for North Sydney went down he was prepared to go down with him. The right honorable member did go down, but the Prime Minister remained floating above the water. The Prime Minister is the gentleman whose word, in the face of this, the right honorable member for North Sydney now says he is prepared to accept. It may appear to some that this is a matter which can be considered in a light-hearted fashion, but the people regard statements made here very seriously. A very definite statement in opposition to the bill, and in support of the amendment moved by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> was also made last night by the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson.

                        <para>- I was answering an interjection. When a division takes place on the amendment, we shall know whether downstairs this morning the same drastic measures were used as those which caused the topsy-turvy attitude of the right honorable member for North Sydney. It cannot be very pleasing to the right honorable gentleman to be placed in such a position. That such a change of attitude should occur as the result of drastic measures taken by the caucus is not creditable to the caucus or to those upon whom such obligations have been imposed. The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> indulged this evening in one of his many swan songs. We are so accustomed to hear his views on these matters that if he had to-night adopted any other attitude than that which he did adopt we should have been as much surprised as we have been by the change in the attitude &#39; of the right honorable member for North Sydney. Some little time before the last election the right honorable member for North Sydney seemed to go out of his way to make himself a little unpleasant to. the Government, but lately he seems to go out of his way to please the powers that be, who may have some gifts to offer. I am not concerned about that aspect of the matter, but I am concerned, as I think the people will be, about such a sudden change in the attitude of the right honorable gentleman towards so important a measure in the course of one night. I wish now to refer to a statement made by the Minister for </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para class="block">Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> and several other honorable members opposite to the effect that this measure is necessary because they wish to obey something that will go down to history as a &#34; mandate &#34; which they claim to have received from the electors at the last election. The word&#34; mandate&#34; is like the blessed word &#34; Mesopotamia,&#34; and I wonder what sins are going to be committed in its name. I venture to think, short as the time is that we have been here, that under the powers which it claims to have received from the people, the Government will be prepared to commit every form of political topsy-turvydom from political pitch and toss to manslaughter. I ask the Minister and honorable members opposite generally if they seriously claim to have received a mandate from the people to do what is proposed to be done under this bill. Do they interpret their mandate as giving them power to man boats trading to Tasmania with lascar labour? Do they seriously contend that they have been given a mandate to place coloured labour on boats carrying tourists to Tasmania? To make such a claim is to cast a slur upon the electors, and to do an injustice to the whole people. What is the use of saying that this proposal will not interfere with the White Australia policy? The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> admitted last night that it did, and so did the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline></para>

                        <para>- It is a remarkable thing that the honorable member should be allying himself with the  president  of the Seamen&#39;s Union, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh.</inline> Not so long ago he was holding him up to ridicule. During the election the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> could not say anything too severe about Walsh. He said that our party was associated with him, and that, therefore, we were seriously in error. Now that we have disclaimed the sentiments that Walsh is said to hold in regard to the employment of black labour, we are still in the wrong. We were wrong when, in the Prime Minister&#39;s opinion, we were associated with Walsh, and we are still wrong now that, in his opinion, we are not associated with him. Honorable members opposite, as a matter of fact, have suddenly become converted to certain views that Walsh holds. The position of the Ministry is peculiar. One of its supporters in this Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell,</inline> who was elected to the Senate to fill the vacancy created by the death of a Labour senator, is an avowed advocate of black labour. The Prime Minister, who attempted to make capital out of our alleged association with the Seamen&#39;s Union, some of the members of which, he said, advocate the employment of coloured crews on vessels, is  himself closely associated with a gentleman who for many years has been an advocate of admitting black labour to Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> was, I suppose, in the caucus this morning when this matter was discussed. He is, in any case, strongly opposed to the White Australia policy. </para>

                        <para>- The plight of the Ministry is even worse. The honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> last year made a violent - attack upon the Government for renewing the sugar embargo, but, notwithstanding his preference for sugar grown by cheap black labour abroad, he is now Minister for Works and Railways. In view of all these facts, I suppose we should not be surprised that the Government is seeking to break down our White Australia policy. A remarkable change has occurred in the ministeral ranks within the last 24 hours. When the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> moved his amendment last evening, several honorable members opposite were most anxious to profess their allegiance to the principles he advocated. Among them were the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson).</inline> Although I do not wish to do the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parsons)</inline> an injustice, I understood that he also, by interjection, intimated his sympathy with the sentiments expressed by the honorable member for Yarra. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks),</inline> in reply to an interjection by the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> said that he would not like to travel to Tasmania on a boat worked by coloured labour. Both by interjection and by speech last night four honorable members opposite expressed their sympathy with the sentiments of the honorable member for Yarra. Notably we had the speech of the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> It is regrettable that there are honorable members in this chamber who completely change their views at the crack of the whip. </para>

                <para>Mr.PARKER MOLONEY. - The whip helped. When a Minister is put in charge of a bill, he ought to be able to paddle his own canoe, and to see it through. Last night the Minister was in an embarrassing position. He had made to a deputation at Hobart a statement largely on the lines of the speech made last night by the honorable member for Yarra. The Minister said, in effect, that he deprecated any interference with the Navigation Act that would violate the White Australia policy. Because he had previously said too much upon this subject, the Prime Minister was called in to make a speech that the Minister in charge of the bill should have been prepared to make himself. Last night he said that there were several reasons why the motion moved by the honorable member for Yarra could not be accepted by the Government, but the only reason he gave was that the bill, if amended, might not receive the royal assent. The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> tore that excuse to shreds, and we have had no other reasons from the Minister. The Prime Minister ran the rule over him, when he practically took the bill out of his hands, and, as the Minister is no doubt feeling the indignity, we shall probably never know the other reasons of which he spoke. </para>

                        <para>- I am fairly straight out in what I say. If I had my way I should repeal the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act so far as they obtain to British shipping. It is disgraceful to borrow money from the Old Country, ask it to assist us, get protection from it, and then when a British boat arrives at Fremantle we are not allowed to travel on it to the east. I should like to know whether the sentiments expressed by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> are supported by honorable members opposite. He assumed the role of an absolute wrecker. He did not care how the operation of the Navigation Act injured Tasmania or tended to destroy their industries or their trade. Honorable members opposite laughed boisterously at his ridicule of that small State, which has undoubtedly suffered severely <inline font-style="italic">horn</inline> the Navigation Act. When a bill is introduced in this Chamber to give only a portion of the relief that should have been given to Tasmania twelve or thirteen years ago, instead of supporting it, honorable members opposite ridicule it. That State is in a serious financial position. For three successive seasons its tourist traffic has been destroyed. </para>

                        <para>- The conditions were quite different on the Burns, Philp boat, which trades between Melbourne, Java and Darwin. On that boat the service was magnificent, but on the other there was insufficient accommodation and an inadequate service. Since this State service has been operating the charges on the Western Australian coast have increased by as much as 250 per cent., and enormous losses have been sustained by the State. The people there would have been far better served if there had been no State interference. Because I believe in the White Australia policy, I want to build up this country and people its vast undeveloped areas; but the only way in which that can be done is by providing the people we settle in these outback and isolated spots with means to. get their produce economically to market. In doing all we can to improve the position of the producers of Tasmania, there is no attempt to do any injury to Australian sentiment. But, on the other hand, we are helping our white settlers to succeed in their industries. There is not one word in the Navigation Act, of which the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is so proud, that deals with the question of coloured labour. This committee will do no injury to the White Australia policy by providing the people in our isolated districts with facilities to ship their produce instead of harassing them with all sorts of wretched restrictions, which will tend to make the Navigation Act, not a monument, but a grave-stone, to the White Australia policy. I trust that the amendment will be defeated. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly, and he compares the service provided on a White Australian State-owned boat with that which obtained on a Burns Philp boat. At Darwin we linked up with the Nationalist ideal of cheap coloured labour, which is said to be so necessary for the development of a White Australia. By what mental gymnastics can people lead themselves to believe that for the development of a White Australia it is necessary to employ black or coloured labour on our coast? It is specious reasoning, to say the least of it. I could apply a stronger term, but probably <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman</inline> would not allow it. We left Darwin on the <inline font-style="italic">Montoro,</inline> owned by Burns, Philp and Company. On that vessel Chinese are employed in the cabins and as waiters, Malays are employed as deckhands, and Indian coolies are at work in the stokehold Just as I made it my business to investigate the White Australia conditions on the State instrumentality, so did I make it my business to investigate the conditions operating on a licensed boat trading on our coast. I found them to be such as should not be tolerated by Australians. The Chinese were being paid about a fourth of what Australian stewards would get, and it takes about two Chinamen to do what one average Australian steward could do. I consider that one Australian deck hand could do about three times the amount of work one Malayan does. These great developers of the Empire, Burns, Philp and Company, who, with other similar corporations, are subsidized by the National party, and held up as a great model to be copied by Australians, employ three different nationalities on their boats, because they know that the three different races cannot get together and hold meetings, and, incidentally, raise their wages or cause strikes. When the <inline font-style="italic">Montoro</inline> went ashore on a reef, and there was occasion to discharge a good deal of the cargo, I heard the motley crew in the hold slinging cargo. As one who has worked on wharfs, I know how cargo should be slung and handled; but, having seen a dozen coloured men doing the work of three white men, and gabbling in three languages, I was confirmed in my belief that the Navigation Act, which was sponsored by the Labour party, is in the interest of white labour. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> spoke of developing Australia and making the country self-supporting and self-reliant. Apparently he would do that by the introduction of black labour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> and others have said that the only way in which the north of Australia can be developed is by the use of coloured labour, and one Minister of the present Cabinet said that, whilst he was opposed to the introduction of coloured workers, yet if they were necessary he would allow them to enter the Commonwealth after having been sterilized. I know only one method of sterilization that could be effectively applied to them. I feel strongly in regard to this mattery because I believe that the influence which caused the previous Government to relieve the Inchcape combine of taxation amounting to  &#163;100,000  a year made available at least portion of the vast amount of money that was used to misrepresent the Labour party during the last election campaign, and is behind this endeavour to break down the White Australia policy. Racially, economically, and socially that vital principle is being undermined. The man who says that Australia will not be affected economically by the employment of cheap coloured labour on boats trading between Australian ports, does not understand economics. Any one who says that such coloured labour will not affect us racially ignores conditions in our ports which are common knowledge to men of the world. The coloured crews come ashore and mix with our people, and we know what happens. </para>

                        <para>- They do, and if they are allowed to come in greater numbers the menace to our racial purity will correspondingly increase. For what results from this policy the advocates of black labour must take the responsibility. No matter what specious arguments may be used, or how sensational the mental somersaults turned by honorable members opposite, the fact remains that this bill, which was introduced ostensibly in the interests of Tasmania, is really in the interests of the overseas shipping combine and black labour. </para>

His change of attitude reveals that a very powerful influence is at work. In that letter he said that constitutionally and as a matter of practical politics it was impossible for the Commonwealth Government to grant- permits to overseas ships to engage in the coastal trade. Nothing has happened since to alter the principles he then laid down. No argument has been adduced to prove that the Navigation Act is detrimental to the Tasmanian passenger service. </para>

                        <para>- My purpose was to see that the principles upon which the act is founded were not undermined. If evidence that the act was detrimental to the Commonwealth was available I could not have prevented the presentation of it. But no such testimony was forthcoming. The attitude of the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> is indicated by one question that he put to a witness. The honorable member said that all they were asking for was that a permit be granted to overseas boats so that they could carry passengers to Tasmania. That is an example of the attitude adopted by a member of the commission who was actually telling a witness what he, as a member of the commission, desired. Where is the fairmindedness of the honorable member ? The statement I have quoted is typical of many made to witnesses who were questioned concerning the operation of the Navigation Act. In fact, if the evidence is carefully analyzed, it will be found that witnesses were not only questioned concerning the operation of the Navigation Act, but were also asked if the arbitration laws of this country had a deterrent effect upon its development. I challenge the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> to deny the accuracy of that statement. On several occasions the same question was asked by other members of the commission belonging to the same party as the honorable member. </para>

                        <para>- No, I am honest enough, at least, to support a principle which I have always advocated, and until it has been proved to be wrong, I do not intend to adopt a different attitude. I am unlike honorable members opposite, who follow so meekly their Leader, who, last night, after entering the chamber, and ascertaining the turn which the debate had taken, directed the Minister in charge of the bill to report progress. The Prime Minister appeared alarmed because two members of his party realized the fairness of the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Yarra. A caucus meeting was held this morning, and we now have the spectacle of the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> holding a .totally different opinion from that which he expressed last night, when he said that he could not go back on the principles which he had held for a lifetime. The right honorable gentleman, however, would turn himself inside out if two High Commissionerships were available instead of one. He would accept such a position quite easily. It is only a question of price. It has been stated during the course of the debate that persons who have paid first or second class fares have been accommodated with &#34;shake-downs&#34; on vessels, and I informed honorable members last night that the facts elicited by the Navigation Commission, in regard to passenger traffic, show that only during peak periods, has congestion occurred, as it does in other businesses. The honorable member for Forrest quoted the questions and answers immediately preceding question No. 10946, but he did not quote a statement which relates to the steamship <inline font-style="italic">Riverina</inline> - &#34;Have only few &#39;shake-downs.&#39; Absolutely nothing for ladies. Have request from Brisbane four passengers. Cannot supply.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> asked if it was not a fact that exactly the same difficulty was experienced at the Christmas period in pre-war days, and was informed by the witness that he was not then in&#39; charge. He was then asked if there was any difficulty in getting accommodation on the boat immediately following, and he replied that he could not recall any complaint in regard to prior or subsequent boats. The answer of the witness shows that there was congestion on one particular boat at one period, which was on the 20th December, when all passengers were anxious to get to Hobart or to Sydney, or, perhaps, round to Adelaide. The same complaint is made during the Christmas season concerning the accommodation on the vessels which trade between Port Adelaide and Eyre&#39;s Peninsula. Similar conditions exist in other transport services at the busy periods. With a full knowledge of the facts as adduced by the commission in taking evidence throughout Australia, I say, unhesitatingly, that there is not one scintilla of evidence to justify the introduction of this bill. It is merely being introduced for the purpose of breaking down principles embodied in the Navigation Act. I do not wish to quote the evidence in regard to the cost per ton of copra, or to refer at length to what the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. G. Francis)</inline> has said in regard to going out of the business. As soon as I raised the question concerning the result complained of, I was informed that it had nothing to do with the Navigation Act, but was brought about by the war. The honorable member said in his opening remarks that the freight was higher than the price obtained for the copra, - not the net price. They got &#163;25 9s. 9d. for. copra in 1923, but at this juncture I cannot place my finger upon the evidence that would show that the Navigation Act has had very little to do with retarding the development of Papua or New Guinea. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> a member of the com- mission, asked a gentleman named Loudoun what his occupation was. He replied, &#34; Managing director of P. A. Loudoun and Company.&#34; I believe that gentleman is a representative of other companies or firms in Papua, and be is, I believe, an authoritative witness on the production of copra. At question 18265 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> asked, &#34; Did I. understand you to say that on a shipment of copra to England a net profit of &#163;6 12s.1d. a ton was received by the planter here?&#34; The answer was in the affirmative. He was then asked, &#34;When was that?&#34; He replied, &#34; For the year 1923.&#34; That is not long after the honorable member said he got out of the business. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Loudoun&#39;s</inline> evidence is contrary to the statement of the honorable member for Kennedy. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> this evening made a very diplomatic speech, but  he  spoke with his tongue in his cheek when he said that the White Australia policy was not menaced by this legislation. He was not given a mandate to bring down this bill. During the election he said that the issue was the maintenance  of  law and order, and it was upon that issue that he was returned to power. I admit that the election propaganda of honorable members opposite was sufficiently terrifying to induce some of the followers of the Labour party to vote for Government candidates. The Government, however, was not given a mandate to attack the White Australia policy in this way, and  it  has no right to undermine the principles that are laid down in the Navigation Act. When the bill has been passed, the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> will not wait a day before he approaches the Prime Minister with the request that a similar concession be granted to Western Australia. That State will get it much more quickly than Tasmania, because  it  can exercise a greater influence upon the Government, When the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> and the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> last night spoke what was in their minds, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> moved &#34;That progress be reported,&#34; in order to stop any further defections from the ranks of Government supporters. Every honorable member knows that  if  this is taken by the people without demur it will not be long before similar legislation is introduced. The Prime Minister said that there is not in the Navigation Act one word regarding the exclusion of coloured labour. He knows that  it  would be superfluous to put that provision into an act that governs the&#39; trading concerns of the Commonwealth. Shipowners would not pay a dozen niggers to do the work of one white man. They would certainly not provide blacks with cots to sleep in, bathrooms to wash in, and a doctor to look after them. The Prime Minister attempted to mislead the House when he suggested that this amending bill  did  not involve the question of black labour. It is an unwritten law that black labour is excluded from consideration in every award of the Arbitration Court. I am certain that honorable members opposite would not care to read the history of the struggle to clean Australia from black labour.

                <para>I should like to take this opportunity to add a few words to the reply which I gave this afternoon to the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> with reference to the complaints  from Great Britain about arsenic spray on apples. Very careful inquiries have been made into the complaint, and it has been established that there is no possibility of danger to the public health from apples coming from Australia, because the Australian practice is to use a liquid spray. Other  countries  which also export apples to Great Britain employ a dry preparation, and there is reason to believe that, if proper care is not exercised, there may be danger to public health. It may be of interest to honorable members to know that I have received the following cablegram from the High Commissioner in London <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> om the subject: - </para>
                <para>No alterations have been made as to percentage of arsenic which will condemn fruit. Royal Commission arsenic in foodstuffs 1903 recommended that anything above one-hundredth grain per lb. should be considered deleterious. This recommendation has become officially recognized - no proposed alteration. Examination of apples has been made on this basis for many years past, but probable that examination more or less perfunctory. Scare caused by finding excessive percentage of arsenic on American apples and successful prosecution of retailers will lead to examination in the future being very much more stringent, also fruit passed by port medical authorities is not exempt from subsequent examination by local health authorities. Analyses of American fruit have shown large proportion of arsenic deposit occurring stalk and calyx. Trouble being accentuated by press publicity. </para>
                <para class="block">The only other word  I  desire to say is that a great deal of harm has been done to the Australian export trade in apples by unfounded reports and by the publicity given to the complaints.  I  trust, however, that the public will be reassured by this publication of the true position, and that the market for Australian apples will be steadied. </para>
                <para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para>
                <para>House adjourned at 11.9 p.m. </para>
