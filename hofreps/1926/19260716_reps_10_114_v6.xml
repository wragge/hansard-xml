                        <para>- Has the Prime Minister been notified of the decision of the graziers of Australia to permit the Meat Council to pass out of existence at the end of July because of the refusal of some of the States to pass legislation which would enable the council to function ? As the Meat Council is the only medium by which the opinion of the meat interests can be expressed in a national way, and as it has negotiated important contracts with the Imperial Government, will the right honorable gentleman take steps, before effect is given to the decision of the graziers, to continue, if possible, the operations of this great organization? </para>

                        <para>- Full information with regard to the present position of the Australian Meat Council has reached me, but the facts are not as stated by the honorable member. The decision to disband the council is not due to the failure of some of the States to pass enabling legislation. Such legislation was passed in Queensland and New South Wales and the Victorian Government was ready to submit it to Parliament. Moneys had actually been raised by levy ; but by a recent poll the graziers of New South Wales pronounced overwhelmingly against the continuance of the council, and, as there were indications of a similar opinion in Queensland, the council came to the conclusion that it had no alternative but to wind up its affairs. Representatives of the meat industry have interviewed me on several occasions, and sections of them have represented that the Government should take some action to organize the industry, I told them, as I have told all sections of producers, that the Government will not take steps to organize them, but will give every assistance if they will organize themselves. I agree with the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> that it is very desirable that an effort should be made to form an organization to take the place of that which will shortly go out of existence. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to make a personal explanation. Yesterday I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs a question, without notice regarding the vital matter of compelling deep-sea ships to be equipped with wireless in order that the lives of the crew might be saved in the event of disaster overtaking a vessel. When I asked that question I had no idea that the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. D. Cameron)</inline> had made a similar interrogation about a fortnight ago, when I was absent from the House on account of illness. I have no desire to trespass upon any subject that is in the capable hands of the honorable member, so I shall not pursue the matter further. I hope, however, that the Minister for Trade and Customs will make a statement regarding it at his earliest convenience. </para>

Upon receipt of the committee&#39;s report, the matter will be. considered by the Public Service Board. </para>

                        <para>- Yesterday the honorable member for Dalley asked me whether I would make available the report of the Public Accounts Committee regarding the contract let by the Sydney City Council to the Commonwealth Shipping Board for the construction at Cockatoo Island Dockyard of some electric turbo-alternating plant. As the committee is still engaged upon its inquiry into the affairs of the Commonwealth Shipping Board it is not considered desirable that a report on a particular phase of the matter should be made available at the present time. </para>

                            <para>. -  In my experience of Parliament, extending over many years, I do not remember more candid criticism having been directed against the budget than has been directed against the proposals of the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> by Government supporters. The criticism offered by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> was telling and destructive, but the criticism by Ministerialists was equally so. If we can find any honorable member, other than a member of the Ministry, who has a good word to say for this budget, we ought to have his photograph taken and pasted on the walls of this chamber as a curiosity. The Treasurer&#39;s statement reminds me of one of those emaciated and friendless poodles that one sometimes sees looking for a home. The remarkable feature about it is that it comes from a Treasurer who, in his days as a private member, belonged to a group which described themselves as watch-dogs, who were credited with doing the rather peculiar- thing of &#34; switching on the light.&#34; Most honorable members were surprised to hear the criticism that came from the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> last evening. That honorable member, as a rule, is a loyal follower of the Government. He referred to its financial proposals as showing signs of the &#34; Page blight.&#34;- What I shall say about them will not be more severe than that. The people of Australia have become very familiar with what is known as the &#34; Kidman blight,&#34; and the present Treasurer has done more than any previous Treasurer to extend it. He has been in such close association with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman that he has naturally contracted the malady. </para>

It is not surprising, therefore, that we had the outburst heard last night from the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> who waved his arms about in an unusual manner, and worked himself into a fury regarding the charges that the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> made concerning the failure to collect taxation on Crown leaseholds. </para>

The actual speech of the honorable member for Yarra clearly was not before the judge, and no finding was made upon it. The Attorney-General was badly briefed last night ; and if he instructs any of his colleagues to reply to the remarks that I am making, I hope he will make quite certain that he is <inline font-style="italic">au fait</inline> with the subject. If I am spending a considerable time on this matter, it is because I consider it to be extremely important. We have not yet finished with it. The extracts that I have given from the minutes of the proceedings before the judge are a complete answer to the statements of the Attorney-General. I suppose the honorable gentleman will not deny that three-quarters of the outstanding taxation referred to by the honorable member for Yarra was owed by large lease-holders such as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman. </para>

                        then said, &#34; I know that, but I thought yesterday the point was within the scope of your inquiry.&#34; If the Attorney-General supports that kind of thing I cannot excuse him. He was in a hurry when he spoke last evening, but if, after reflection, he adheres to his statement, he will disappoint many persons who know him. He has not done such a thing before, and he will only do it now because he feels impelled to adopt a wrong attitude in association with the Government. I hope that he will have the courage to admit that he has made a mistake. I have never known a graver charge to be levelled against a Government. Most of the charge related to the failure of wealthy land-owners to furnish returns and pay taxation. During the election campaign it was stated all over the country that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin&#39;s</inline>
                        charges had been &#34;levelled to the ground.&#34; The Government made capital out of that statement on the hustings, because the issue was clouded by the British seamen&#39;s strike, the causes of which had nothing to do with the people of this country. The charge was not resurrected for the first time in this chamber yesterday, as the honorable member for Swan
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline>
                        has said. As soon as the terms of the commission were made known, and it was disclosed that the speech of the honorable member for Yarra would be placed before the judge in a mutilated form, the Acting Leader of the Opposition moved the adjournment of the House, and many bitter complaints were made.

He is usually a mild gentleman, who will &#34; roar you as gently as any sucking dove ;&#34; but this morning he is wrathful because he has been led into a blind alley. He should avenge himself not on me, but on the Treasurer, who led him into the difficulty. It does not matter if a thousand other things were said by the judge; I have quoted his conclusion. If the Attorney-General was placed in the dock to-morrow, what the judge said in beating about the bush would not mat&#163;er; it would be the sentence that would count. After all the &#39; beating about the bush, the judge said, &#34; I feel dear that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sidney</inline> Kidman should have been prosecuted for failing to send in returns.&#34; </para>

The question submitted to the Commission was, &#34; Was the Commissioner of Taxation guilty?&#34; not &#34; Was the Government guilty?&#34; The Attorney-General should find little consolation- in that fact. He accepted a definite challenge last night, and every word&#39; he then said has been disproved this morning. He will have to hand his brief to some one else, because he cannot afford, if he has any regard for his reputation, to retain it longer.

                            <para>- If the sole responsibility rested on the States, the Treasurer, in 1922, would not have kept repeating the charge that he made against the Federal Government. The honorable member for Gwydir quoted figures to show the decline amongst the land-holders. He showed that in New South Wales the number of land-holders in 1915-16 was 93,983, and in 1921-22, 72,059; in Victoria the number of land-holders in 1912 was 66,811, and in 1919, 72,679. In 1915-16 there were 213,081 land-holders in Australia, and at the end of 1922 only 200,655. Those figures show a decline from year to year. The honorable member gave other figures relating to the decline in the holders of the Crown leases. Those figures were taken from the official <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book,</inline> and, therefore, must be accurate. They stand to-day in worse form as an indictment of this Government, in the same way as the Treasurer&#39;s speech of 1922 was an indictment of the Government of the day.

                                Green is a very able critic, and seldom speaks without knowing the facts When a private member, the Treasurer condemned the then Government  for the increases of expenditure, heavy taxation, and high Customs revenue. If those were faults then, they are faults to-day; the need for criticism is none the less because the Treasurer has shifted from the Country party corner to the Ministerial bench, and there should be members of the Ministerial party conscientious enough to candidly tell the Treasurer that the evils of which he complained- in 1922 are being continued in an aggravated form under his stewardship.

                    <para>There is something very sinister about the proposal of the Government to abolish the <inline font-style="italic">&#34;per capita</inline> payments to the States, and to hand over to them, entirely, the field of land taxation. The Treasurer has always shown a remarkable and unwarranted sympathy with the great land monopolists. I have never represented any but a country constituency, and I know that the opinion is general amongst the sons of farmers, that the opportunities for obtaining land were greatly increased when the Federal land tax was imposed by a Labour Government in 1910. I am reminded of a statement made by the Treasurer during the recent election campaign. When he was accused of undue sympathy with the squatters, he said that no previous government had collected land taxation from them in respect of Crown leases. The honorable gentleman must have known that he was making a misstatement, and that in the first three years of the operation of the tax, it returned to the Treasury &#163;690,000. </para>

                            <para>- I know what the Treasurer said, because I had occasion to refute his statements in my electorate. He definitely said that the Labour Government had never collected any taxation&#39; upon Crown leaseholds, whereas, in the years between 1914 and 1917, &#163;690,000 was collected. When the Labour party went out of office there was a remarkable falling off in the receipts from that impost. This Government is discredited by its record in regard to the administration of this tax, and now it is proposing to surrender to the States the whole field of land taxation, knowing very well that it is giving away something that will not be worth twopence in those States where the Legislative Councils can prevent the imposition of any tax that will penalize the big landed interests. </para>

                            <para>- No, and the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> declared last night that for many years successive governments have tried, without success, to get an effective land tax passed by the Legislative Council of Victoria. This Government knows that it is discredited, but as a precaution against the time when it will inevitably be put out of office, it proposes to give sanctuary to its wealthy friends, the wealthy landholders behind the ramparts of the Legislative Councils. When the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> was drawing attention to the increase in Commonwealth expenditure, the Treasurer said that it was due to increased payments for old-age and invalid pensions. The inference was that the pensions were wholly responsible for the increase, and therefore it will be well to set out the facts. The pension payments increased from &#163;5,424,000 in 1922-23, to &#163;8,252,000 in 1925-26. The total increase of &#163;2,800,000 included many new pensions. As against that increase, the total expenditure by this Government has increased by &#163;6,600,000, namely, from &#163;45,758,000 in 1922-23, to &#163;52,384,000 last year. Even if the amount of &#163;2,800,000 had been an increase wholly due to the increase of the rate of pension, there would still remain a further increase of nearly &#163;4,000,000 in other expenditure generally. </para>

On the 19th February of this year the conference of the Victorian Farmers Union was held at Ballarat. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> refers to that organization as the &#34; V.F.U., or Very Funny Union,&#34; and he has established a rival organization of the large number of farmers who are dissatisfied with the policy of the Commonwealth Government, and the composite Government in Victoria. The Federal Ministry is accused of incapacity and of responsibility for the continued exodus from the land, and to prove that that charge does not emanate only from the Labour Opposition, I shall quote a few extracts from the minority report of the delegates to the Farmers Conference - </para>

                            <para>- It is one of the complaints of the Treasurer&#39;s own organization. If the statement is incorrect, he should take the matter up with a large section of his own party. As a representative of a farming constituency, I do not know that I could point to one working farmer who has derived any benefit from this so-called rural credits branch. Of what use can it be unless it enables farmers to obtain money at reasonable rates ? In my electorate, where we are comparatively fortunate in having two branches of the Commonwealth Bank, scores of representations have been made for an extension of the rural credits branch to country districts. The honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> has complained that one of the factors responsible for driving men off the land is their inability to secure financial accommodation at reasonable rates. The present Government has a golden opportunity to remove that difficulty through the medium of the Commonwealth Bank. Before a farmer can obtain money at a reasonable rate from the rural credits branch he must enlist the services Qf the private banks. When the Treasurer visited my electorate he told the people that the Government had arranged to provide cheap money for the farmers; but I pointed out that, so far as I was aware, the cheap money had been obtained by the private banks. The Treasurer remarked that the reason why &#163;15,000,000 of notes had been made available to those banks was the unsatisfactory position overseas &#34;in regard to wheat and wool. In his budget statement, however, he admitted that the money was provided for the private banks at Bank of England rates. I repeat that I know of no farmer who has obtained money at such a favorable rate as that at which those notes were made available to the private banks. The Treasurer did not deny that they had been made available ; he evaded that point, and stated that only &#163;2,800,000 of the notes had been taken. But that made the position worse. If the private banks had lifted the whole &#163;15,000,000 of notes, they would have had to pay 4-J per cent, on them - a rate of interest at which no producer was able to obtain money; but merely on their right to the notes, if they needed them, the private banks were able to issue credits and rake off high rates of interest. They issued credits against that right, although they were paying no interest - a common form of banking practice. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer now admits much more than he did previously; but he tried to camouflage the position by saying that the banks did not lift the whole of the notes; but I did not say they did. I adhere to my accusation that, while the primary producers could not obtain money at the low rate at which it was offered to the private banks, the latter, according to their own records, could issue credits against their right to lift the notes to such an extent that they could have given credits to the amount of &#163;60,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- But the Commonwealth Bank should have reaped the exclusive benefit of the transaction. The credit that belonged to the people, through the Commonwealth Bank, was made available to the private financial institutions. The Treasurer was guilty of the offence that he accused his predecessor, the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> of committing. The Commonwealth Bank should have been used as a great instrument to prevent one of the many things that the Treasurer used to deplore - the drift from the country to the cities. Evidently the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, judging by their complacent smiles, are satisfied with their political marriage, and are prepared to share one another&#39;s joys and sorrows. They have taken one another &#34; for better or for worse&#34;; but, while the present alliance is better for them., it is worse for the great bulk of the people. The things that are done under this composite government pass my comprehension. The six charges that the present Treasurer laid against the Treasurer of 1922 <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> have since been laid against him. I cannot remember a budget being so scathingly criticized by a supporter of the Government responsible for it, as this budget was criticized by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> He said that he would not hesitate to break away from the Government if it persisted with- some of its financial proposals. The right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> and the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> were also severe critics of it; and I doubt very much whether one member on the Ministerial side of the chamber will sincerely say a good word for it. </para>

                            <para>. -  I had no intention of participating in the debate again at this early stage, until the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> made his concluding remarks last night, and the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> spoke this morning. It was observed by the right honorable member for Balaclava last &#39; night that the proposals in this budget for the separation of Commonwealth and State finances are  probably the most important that have been before honorable members since the consummation of federation, and for that reason I desired honorable members to debate them fully and submit any constructive criticism before I replied. The herring that the honorable member for Yarra and the honorable member for Hume have dragged across the trail was dead and decently buried, in the opinion of most honorable members, and I regret that an attempt has been made to resurrect it; but I shall conduct a post mortem that will resolve all doubt on the matter, and lay its ghost for the future. For my purpose, I shall rely on conclusive impartial statements from the reports of the royal commissions which have investigated the matter. The honorable member for Yarra was granted every assistance that the Crown could give him to substantiate the charges he made in 1924, in respect to the taxation administration, but, as the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> pointed out last evening, he completely failed to justify them. It will be remembered that two royal commissions considered this problem in 1924, one of which dealt exclusively with the honorable member&#39;s charges, and the other with the subject of valuation. I shall be able, by quoting extracts from the reports that they made, and also from the recent High Court decision on the matter, to justify every act of the Government. The Government&#39;s proposal to repeal taxation on Crown leaseholds was introduced in 1923, on two grounds; the first, that the tax conflicted with State land settlement policies, and, secondly, that it was practically impossible to collect it. The House accepted the proposal that the tax should be repealed from 1923, but decided that an attempt should be made to collect the arrears owing prior to that year. The honorable member for Yarra has claimed that, in bringing this matter before the public he rendered a public service, and stimulated the Taxation Department to greater efforts in collecting the arrears. He certainly rendered a service, but it was to the Government more than to the public, for it gave the Government an opportunity, to clarify the situation. The two royal commissions that have investigated this matter, and the High Court decision that was delivered three or four weeks ago, have placed the position beyond dispute, and unravelled the very tangled skein. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">The difficulties in regard to the matter began as soon as the Labour Government of 1914 imposed this tax without providing any practical and equitable means for collecting it. Since that time, three royal commissions have endeavoured to fix an equitable basis for it, and each has suggested something different. Two cases &#39; have been argued before the High Court, one in South Australia and one recently in Queensland, and the learned judges have also differed in their suggestions; and the Taxation Department has employed every conceivable means to overcome the difficulties, but the complexities of the position have so far defied solution. In all the circumstances, one would have, thought that honorable members generally would agree that the Government acted wisely in suggesting the repeal of the tax. The reason given by the honorable member for Yarra for reverting, at this late day,&#39; to the findings of the commission that investigated his charges in 1924, is that this is the first opportunity that he has had to do so; but I point out that,- in the 1925 session, after the report of the commission was published, the matter could have been debated on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, the motion for supply, or on the budget itself, though I admit that the discussion of the budget was not concluded that year. If the honorable member thought that any good purpose could be served by re-introducing the matter, he could have done it early this year on the Address-in-Reply motion, or during the debate we had on last year&#39;s budget, or on one of the supply motions, but he has neglected to do it until now.  His  excuse for introducing it now is that the Government proposes to repeal the land tax. Prior to the debate on the 1924 budget, honorable members opposite had levelled a number of general charges of corruption and maladministration against the department, but on the 7th of August of that year the honorable member for Yarra made the mistake of making a specific charge, and the Government, immediately seized the opportunity so afforded it of having an impartial investigation made into the whole matter. When its decision to appoint a royal commission of inquiry was announced, the chagrin and anger that honorable members opposite displayed was astonishing, notwithstanding that they had got exactly what they demanded. The honorable member for </para>
                        <para class="block">Yarra, and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey),</inline> in particular, complained that the scope of the reference was not broad enough, so the Government obligingly widened it to the broadest possible limit; but even that did not satisfy the Opposition, for the honorable member for Yarra and his  deputy  leader, made further charges, and attempted to discredit the commission before it began its work. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, as a matter of fact, said that the Labour party would absolutely ignore the reference of the matter to the judge, but the honorable member for Yarra did not pursue that course. Since the findings have been published, however, no opportunity has been lost to try to misrepresent them. This morning, the honorable member for Hume read portions of the extracts from the reference that was made to the commission, but, so that there shall not be any misunderstanding on the matter, I propose to read the complete reference. </para>

He smoothed it over and smothered it. It is one of the first things that he ought to have explained in the budget speech. The excuse cannot be that the collecting of taxes on Crown leaseholds is intricate and difficult, because they are not included in the last year&#39;s assessment. Who owes this money? There is plenty of evidence that the Government relentlessly pursues the small man when he owes anything. </para>

Their charges have been disproved, and they now want to go through the country and say, &#34; After all, we were right.&#34; They will do that, although there was not a scintilla of truth in their allegations.

                            <para>It is not correct to say that the present Government relentlessly pursues persons who owe small amounts of land tax and is less  strict  in collecting land tax from those who are assessed for large sums. The big pastoralists have no advantage in this regard as compared with the struggling farmer and the small landholder. </para>
                            <para>Seeing that the only persons&#39; liable to pay land tax are those who hold land of an unimproved value of &#163;5,000, I feel some difficulty in drawing a line between the big pastoralist on the one hand and the struggling farmer and small land-holder on the other hand. A per son who holds land of an unimproved value of &#163;5,000 has, I should think, considerably more land than the average land-holder-; there are about 17,000 taxpayers, and although I do not know the number of .land-holders in Australia, I should imagine that the payers of land tax are in a very considerable minority. However this may be, there is no warrant for any suggestion that any discrimination is made by the Government between large and small taxpayers. The Government has on no occasion interfered in any way in respect to the enforcement or otherwise of land tax in the case of any particular person. Some comment was made before me upon the fact that certain small taxpayers were prosecuted for not sending in returns, while others who owed larger amounts were not similarly treated. During the regime of the present Government, between the dates 9th February, 1923, and 30th June, 1924, the total number of persons prosecuted for not sending in returns was very small, there being not more than thirteen or fourteen such prosecutions in the whole of Australia. In three or four of such cases the land-owner was found, upon perusal of his return, not to be taxable; in the other cases the amount of tax payable under default assessment varied from a few pounds up to nearly &#163;500. During the same period various persons were sued for non-payment of the tax imposed upon them. The total number of such actions in Australia was about 130, the amounts due varying from a few shillings to some thousands of pounds, and in some cases being the accumulation of several years. </para>
                            <para>I can see nothing in these figures, or in any facts put before me, to warrant any suggestion that discrimination was made between large and small taxpayers, and I emphasize the fact that the Government in no way interfered with the Commissioner of Taxation in respect of any of these matters. </para>

The Government gave no instructions or directions of any kind in reference to the matter. </para>
                            <para>Another matter which was commented upon in this connexion was the fact that in. many cases the Commissioner of Taxation and his deputies granted extensions of time to taxpayers to send in returns and to make payments of tax.

Crown leaseholds is, to my mind, a matter of politics, as to which it is beyond my functions to offer any criticism&#39;. For the same reason I offer no criticism on the question whether the Government was right or wrong in further delaying the collection of this tax <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> appointing a royal commission to inquire into the .proper basis of assessment thereof. </para>

                        <para class="block">That suspension was the cause of all the trouble about unpaid taxes. If the then Treasurer had obtained parliamentary sanction for his suspension of collections, no difficulty would have, been experienced subsequently in justifying it. That is the only recorded occasion in which the Treasurer interfered in any way with the collection of the tax, and the honorable member for Yarra condoned that action. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Edwards stated, in half a dozen places in his report, that this Government has not interfered with the collection of the tax, and that instructions were given to the Commissioner of Taxation for the garnering of arrears as soon as the repeal act of 1923 was passed. The only respect in which there had been the slightest illegality was the failure of the Government in 1918 to obtain parliamentary sanction of the suspension of collections, and that illegality was quite accidental, because the budget of the following year showed that the Government proposed to act in accordance with the recommendation of the royal commission. But any irregularity in the action of the then Treasurer was condoned by the honorable member for Yarra. </para>

In those years a Labour Government had complete control of the collection, but it found, as subsequent Governments have found, that it is impossible to arrive at a definite basis upon which this impost can be applied. </para>

                                <para>- Partly on departmental valuations and partly on owners&#39; valuations; and some will have to be adjusted. What is the explanation of the. difficulty in collecting this tax? It is furnished by a study of the conditions in Western Australia and Queensland. In Western Australia 267,000,000 acres were held on Crown lease, and in Queensland 317,000,000 acres; and the valuations in Western Australia were &#163;1,800, and in Queensland &#163;77,000. The reason why there was no difficulty in collecting the tax in Western Australia was that in most cases the local valuers recognized, as the people in South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland averred, that there was no freehold value in the leasehold land. It is worth while to examine the valuation of Crown leaseholds, in order better to understand the difficulties associated therewith, and the justification for the statement of this Government in 1923 that Parliament, in asking the department to collect this tax, had given it an almost impossible task. The royal commission&#39;s report sets out, at page 15, the four bases of valuation employed up to that time - </para>

                        <para class="block">That shows conclusively that, following the passage of the act in August, 1923, the Government took definite action to collect arrears of taxation. Up to this time four different bases of valuation had been employed, and the royal commission, comprising men who could not be said to have any bias in favour of the Government or the pastoralists, after taking a lot of evidence, and carefully considering the matter, laid down a certain basis for the valuation of the freehold equities in leasehold lands. The Government adopted that basis for future valuation, but as soon as it was applied the department found that the enormous sums of money supposed to be owing to the Government, according to departmental valuations, began to disappear. For instance, one valuation of &#163;85,000 was reduced to &#163;17,000, and another of &#163;150,000 was whittled down to &#163;40,000. The effect of the application of a system of valuation suggested by a quite disinterested body was to cut the departmental assessments to pieces, and when it was tested before the High Court in Queensland recently the court declared even that unsatisfactory and excessive. According to a basis which the court laid down as just and equitable, there was practically no. freehold value in certain leasehold lands, whose tax had been originally assessed at &#163;40,000, and subsequently reduced to &#163;9,000. The Labour party in this Parliament has tried to make this land tax a stalking horse for abuse of the Government. It has suggested corruption  by saying that we are giving away something to our wealthy friends. The fact is that, at the time when this tax was repealed the Labour Government of Queensland, acting with a thorough knowledge of the cattle industry, decided to re-assess all the cattle lands, which comprised the greater part of the Crown leases in that State, retrospectively to 1921, when the slump in the meat trade began. That Government regarded the leasehold rents it was receiving as excessive, and a burden on the meat industry, which would help to force it deeper into the bog of despair. If the Queensland Government thought that the rents it was receiving from the Crown lessees were in excess of the real value of the land, and reduced the rents in some cases by 50 per cent., there could be no freehold equity remaining for purposes of Commonwealth taxation when the higher rents were being paid. Indeed, when the suspension of the collection of this tax was first discussed in this House, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> declared that if there was any excess of value in Crown leaseholds above the rent paid to the State Government, it belonged to the State, and the lessee should pay a higher rent. The intrusion of the Commonwealth Government into this sphere was, he said, an interference with State policy. And that has been the effect of the Commonwealth taxation of Crown leaseholds. The honorable member for Yarra takes exception to the Government&#39;s proposal to repeal the Federal land tax, and he and the honorable member for Hume declare that the State Parliament may not desire to re-impose the tax. </para>

Surely that is a function for the State Parliaments themselves. The people of the States elect their own Parliaments, which should determine the taxes that are to be paid. If those Parliaments do not suit them, they should change their personnel. </para>

What this Parliament should ask itself, is whether the land tax is of such great value to the Commonwealth that it should not be handed over to the States. It is not for us to consider whether, if we hand it over, the State Governments will have difficulty in inducing their respective Parliaments to re-impose it. Land settlement must always be a function of the States, which provide railways and other facilities that the settlers need. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Yarra, referring to certain figures that appeared in the memorandum issued in connexion with the speech on the States Grants Bill, objected to the average over three years being put down at &#163;2,111,000, and pointed out that in 1922-23 and 1923-24, the amount collected was less than that. He did not quote the assessment figures of 1922-23, which, after the reduction of 20 per cent. in the rates had been made, was &#163;2,143,000. Although the tax may be assessed at a certain figure, the Government cannot always collect it in one year. In 1924-25, and in 1925-26, the total collection reached well over &#163;2,500,000, which, it is true, includes some Crown leasehold collections, but the increases, compared with 1923-24, were not wholly due to such collections. It will be found that the estimates made by the Government are absolutely correct. I shall deal with the other matters referred to by the honorable member at the conclusion of the budget debate. </para>

                            <para>. - I am sure that the criticism by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> and the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> have been completely answered by the Treasurer. Those honorable members went to the trouble of resurrecting a body from the grave, and they have brought it into this chamber for a post mortem. I think that the Treasurer has proved that it is a corpse, which should be decently bullied and allowed to remain undisturbed. I hope, however, that party politics have not sunk so low that I am unable to give credit where it is due. The speech  of the honorable member for Yarra i3 one of the best I have ever listened to, either in this chamber or in any other parliament. Whenever he takes part in the debates, his remarks are worth hearing, although one may not subscribe to all his views. I venture to predict that at no very distant date, it will be necessary for him to join the supporters of the present Government. Since he is a deep thinker, he will eventually find that course inevitable. He will be in the same position as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden,</inline> who declared that &#34; as soon as a man began to think for himself, he found that there was <inline font-style="italic">ria</inline> scope for him in the Labour party.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- It is a question for that body to decide. I mean my remarks to be most complimentary, because I have never listened to a member of Parliament who has given closer attention to every subject on which he speaks. I shall look forward with pleasure to giving the honorable member a welcome to the Nationalist party. I also compliment the Treasurer upon the budget speech. The complaint has often been heard that the Treasurer&#39;s statements are brought down too late in the year. To-day, however, the criticism is offered that the budget has been introduced too soon, and that some of the particulars usually furnished have not been supplied. It is impossible to include all the facts and figures if the budget is to be presented at the beginning of July; but it is far better to have an early budget with a few figures omitted than a late one that would . cause inconvenience to all concerned. I notice that the absence of certain figures has not curtailed discussion to any serious extent, and that there is no danger of the country suffering through lack of criticism of the budget. </para>

                        <para>I regret the remarks of the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney),</inline> who alluded to the exodus from rural life in New South Wales. He referred to figures quoted by the honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> ; but surely he does not intend to place all the blame on the shoulders of the Federal Government for the fact that people are leaving the land in New South Wales. There, the people are blessed with a Labour Government, that recently passed a Rural Accommodation Act. That measure could have no other tendency than to drive men off the land. That Labour Government- has also passed a Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act. At least 500 persons in my electorate alone have been forced as the result of it to leave the land and go to cities like Melbourne and Sydney to find employment. If the progress in country districts is not as great as we should like it to be, we should realize that in five of the States Labour Governments are in power. The drift to the cities cannot be attributed to the Federal Government. The tendency in New South Wales, where a 44-hour week has been introduced, is in the direction of high wages and short hours of labour. Short hours, of course, mean less work, apart from a &#34;go-slow&#34; policy. Conditions of life are far more attractive in the cities than they are in the country, and, if shorter hours of labour are observed in secondary than in rural industries, the temptation to leave the land will remain. I wish to be fair; but it must be admitted that whether a Nationalist or a Labour Government is in power, the attractions of the cities, including the better educational facilities they offer, naturally tempt country people to leave the rural districts. A number of folk live in the cities, and at the same time carry on occupations in the country, because railways and motor cars have &#39;revolutionized transport and provided conveniences of which our forefathers never dreamt. The problem of de-centralization has to be met throughout the civilized world. People prefer to live in large communities, and so long as they are well clothed and fed I cannot altogether agree with the Country  party that any great disaster can overtake the country on that account. The day must come, however, when the cities will be overcrowded. Then the tendency will be for the people to drift back to the land. I was induced to make these remarks because I believe that the drift to the cities should not be attributed to the present Government. </para>
                        <para>One of the burning questions of to-day is the proposed withdrawal of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments to the States. The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> said that if any honorable member was prepared to speak favorably of the budget his photograph should be taken and hung in this chamber as a curiosity. I am prepared to take that risk, because I feel that the budget is one of which the Treasurer and the .Government may well be proud. I do not think that the States will lose by the withdrawal of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments; in fact, I believe that the proposal will prove a blessing in disguise. In New South &#34;Wales, for instance, at least &#163;150,000 per annum will be put into the pockets of the taxpayers. 1 am here to speak for the people of that State, and not for the New South Wales Parliament. No doubt the State Parliaments find it convenient to have large sums of money handed over to them as the States&#39; share of the Customs revenue - money that they have not had the responsibility of collecting. It is so much &#34; easy money&#34; to which they can look every year; and consequently the electors do not feel aggrieved with the State Governments, since the money has not been collected from them by means of direct taxation. But with so much of this &#34;easy money&#34; to spend, the temptation is for the State Governments to become extravagant - a failing that more or less has beset every&#39; Government. If the State Governments have to impose direct taxation, the people will want to know the reason for it. But if they receive a share of the Customs revenue careless financing will be encouraged. The honorable member for Balaclava traced the history of federation, spoke of the &#34;Braddon blot,&#34; touched on the referendum of 1910, and outlined the conditions obtaining to-day; but he did not put forward any practical suggestion as to what should be done in future. I can understand the opposition from the State Parliaments to the withdrawal of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments ; but if we consider the ! matter in the interests of the individual elector we shall be prepared to support the Treasurer in his proposal.&#39; 1 compliment the Treasurer upon having agreed to postpone definite action in this matter for twelve months&#39;. It would have been hard on the States had he said in the middle of June that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment would be totally abolished&#39; from the 1st July. The State Governments are all&#39; busy preparing their budgets at present, and they would have been placed in a serious difficulty by such a summary pronouncement. But I assure the Treasurer that I shall solidly support terminating the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments at&#39; the beginning of the next financial year. I regret that it is not possible for the&#39; Government to entirely vacate the field of income taxation, but it has made a good step in that direction, and I trust that the present Treasurer will still be in office when such taxation will be .entirely discontinued by the Commonwealth. I listened with a good deal qf interest to the freetrade members from Western Australia discussing the tariff some weeks ago and I was also interested in their remarks last night on the budget. I wonder what would be the&#39; position of Western Australia if pre-federation conditions were reverted to? En my opinion the Government is treating the States magnificently in respect of its new financial proposals in lieu of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments.- I except Western&#39; Australia and Tasmania from that general remark; but special provision is being made to assist them. . &#39; </para>
                        <para>The remarks that honorable members; opposite, have made so far in this debate have contained very little . criticism of the budget. They have confined their attention to ancient history in regard to&#39; the collection of land tax. I submit that there are very few items of expenditure in the financial statement now before the committee that they would1 think of reducing if they were in office.; I do not think that they would suggest a decrease in the war pensions. On that point I congratulate the Minister for Defence on his successful administration. A few years ago, when I was a member of the New South Wales Parliament. I was frequently interviewed by persons who claimed an increase in their war pensions, and I always advised them to interview the Federal representative for their division; but I am glad to say that since the present Minister has been in charge complaints of that nature have, to a large extent, disappeared. The Minister has given the most liberal interpretation that could possibly be given to the act, and I think all honorable members will admit that, in consequence, their correspondence in relation to war pensions has decreased considerably. </para>
                        <para>Nor do I not think honorable members opposite would suggest a reduction in the old-age and invalid pensions. The expenditure under that head last year showed an increase of &#163;472,000 on the expenditure of the previous year. Do honorable members opposite suggest that the Government acted wrongly in increasing the pension? </para>

                                <para>- I am a little too old to be gulled by that story. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Austin</inline> Chapman, who previously represented Eden-Monaro, always displayed a keen interest in the old-age and invalid pensions, and had a good deal to do with their introduction in Australia; and I have yet to learn that he was ever a member of the Labour Government. It was largely due to his efforts that the pension was increased from 10s. to 12s. 6d. a week. I believe the Labour party was responsible for increasing the amount from 12s. 6d. to 15s., an action by the way that was taken on the eve of an election ; but every other increase has been granted by a national government. The Labour party unsuccessfully tried to gain some kudos for endeavouring to obtain a 5s. increase on one occasion when the Government proposed an increase of 2s. 6d., and honorable members opposite made pensions a side issue at the last election; but their actions in that connexion did not in any way mislead the public or injure the Government. </para>

                        <para>The sum of &#163;217,000 was granted last year in bounties to the wine industry, with excellent results. I suggest that honorable members opposite would not think of discontinuing such payments, which are beneficial to the whole community. This particular bounty illustrates the value of a properly-managed subsidy to an industry. </para>
                        <para>I have been requested by certain banking interests to bring under the notice of the Treasurer the desirableness of printing our Australian notes on stronger paper. The paper on which the notes are at present printed is altogether too flimsy for the purpose, and comparatively new notes are often paid into various banks in such a dilapidated and mutilated condition that they cannot again be issued. In the old days when each bank issued its own notes the paper was much stronger and in every way more suitable. I do not suggest that there is any serious remissness in this matter, but I hope that the Treasurer will inquire into it in the interests of all concerned, and see that stronger and better paper is used. </para>
                        <para>Two or three matters affecting the administration of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department merit mention. The present Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> is, in my opinion, an able and earnest Minister who thoroughly understands his work; but I am afraid he is a little too sensitive, for he resents even the mildest criticism of his administration. It is the undoubted duty of honorable members to bring under his notice complaints which are made to them from time to time. I regret that more suitable buildings are not provided for post offices in country towns. It is possible for the merest stranger to guess which is the post office in almost any country town in my State, for he has only to walk up to the most dilapidated looking building in the place. Even new post offices may invariably be recognized by their poor, makeshift furnishings, which are anything but creditable to the Commonwealth. One can walk into almost any new post office and see in use improvised furniture - furniture made out of boxes - bearing such inscriptions as &#34; Dawson&#39;s whisky,&#34; &#34; Star starch,&#34; and so on. It is a disgrace to the Commonwealth that such furniture may be found even in the new post office buildings, such as that which has recently been erected at Yass, where the old fittings have been reinstated. I referred recently to the necessity for improving the position of allowance postmistresses and postmasters. Many of these officers are miserably paid. In some cases where telephones are attached to the establishment almost constant attendance is necessary, but the officers receive a &#34;mere pittance for their trouble. A few years ago the regular employees in the post offices were poorly paid. Happily our Arbitration Courts and departmental boards have to a considerable degree altered that unsatisfactory state of affairs, but it is high time that similar relief was granted to the allowance post officers who render invaluable service in many of our country places.- Unless something is done speedily to rectify the present position we shall be faced with serious difficulties. Two allowance post offices in my own constituency have had to be closed recently, because it was impossible to find persons to take charge of them. I wish to refer for a minute or two to the unsatisfactory condition of the automatic telephones on the general platform of the Sydney railway station. A few days ago I was one of ten or eleven persons who spent quite a long time trying to raise central on one of them, but none of us was successful. It is a humbug and a nuisance for people to be delayed in this way. I do not know if the same condition of affairs existed before the installation of the automatic system, but the remarks of the people who were trying to use the cabinets were anything but complimentary. </para>
                        <para>Another matter controlled by the Postmaster-General is wireless. We have been patiently awaiting a statement from him in regard to the request for the appointment of a commission to deal with many matters, particularly the question of copyright. I understand that a company has recently been formed, and has secured the copyrights of a great many songs, some of which are  100  years old. Every little hall at which any of these songs are sung has to register with this company, and pay it a licence fee. The big broadcasting companies are similarly affected. If they happen to broadcast  a  song, the copyright of which is held by this company, they get a ring on the telephone informing them that they must pay a royalty on it. They tell me that this is the biggest difficulty they encounter. A royal commission could .probably solve it, but there are other matters which ought to be inquired into, partilarly those relating to wave lengths, the allotment of broadcasting fees, and the amount of the fees themselves. I understand that quite a lot of unsuitable material has been sold&#39; to persons anxious to install wireless receiving sets, with the result that the purchasers have condemned wireless. Steps ought to be taken to protect the public in this direction. I know that there is a feeling that the licence fee should be reduced, but I am sure the public would be better pleased to have an adequate service. </para>
                        <para>Having lived in the neighbourhood of Canberra all my life, it is amusing to me to hear what is said in Melbourne about the climate of the Federal Capital. For instance, people frequently say that- sometimes the temperature there is down to freezing-point. I have spent many winters near Canberra, but I have found it just as cold in Melbourne. Although at times the thermometer may be very low, on the whole there is more sunshine at Canberra than I have seen in Melbourne during the few months I have been here. A public servant who had been transferred to Canberra told me that when he was given notice of his transfer he felt inclined to leave the Service. I met him a few days ago, when he was about to take his fortnight&#39;s leave of absence. I remarked that, he would probably be very pleased to get back to Melbourne. He said that he would be pleased to go to Melbourne for a fortnight, but he would be better pleased to get back to Canberra, and that he would leave the Service rather than be transferred back to Melbourne. It is regrettable that there has been so much delay in transferring the Seat of Government. Too much time has been lost, and now that there is a tremendous haste there is a building boom, which, unfortunately, in my opinion, is the cause of the high cost of houses at Canberra. I question very much whether the houses are shoddily built, but, undoubtedly, they are  altogether too expensive. I saw a  plan  of a house this morning which I estimate could be built for &#163;450 in the town in which I live - 60 miles from Canberra - but will cost &#163;1,000 at Canberra. Our friends opposite are quite right in bringing under the attention of Parliament the high cost of buildings there; but it is nothing against the place, and probably nothing against the present Government. It is due to the inaction of previous Governments. </para>

                                <para>- One factor which contributes to the high, cost of those houses is the fact that there is only a single line of railway between Goulburn and Canberra. Trade is increasing enormously, aud there are considerable delays in the transit of materials required for building. The contractor has to take this into account when he submits a price for any work. I do not think that there is any justification for the cost of living being high at Canberra, because one can live at Queanbeyan, a few miles away, just as cheaply as one can live anywhere else in New. South Wales. Queanbeyan was said to be a dead-and-alive place fourteen years ago. Its development was very slow at the start. In twelve years its population increased from about 1,400 to about 1,800, but during the last two years the population has increased to about 5,000. Practically all the new buildings in the town have been erected within that period. There is just as big a building boom in progress at Queanbeyan as there is at Canberra; and as all the building material required has to be carried over the single line of rails from Goulburn, which also supplies Canberra, building costs at Queanbeyan are also high. </para>

                                <para>- The types of houses are different. Most of the dwellings at Queanbeyan are built of wood. Although excellent bricks are made at Canberra, all attempts to make similar bricks at Queanbeyan have been unsuccessful. No matter what has brought it about, the high cost of building construction at Canberra will be a burden on some one, and it will be very unfortunate indeed if the civil servants who are transferred there have to bear it. Quite recently I saw a house in course of erection at Manly.. It was of an infinitely better type than anything at Canberra, and was to cost &#163;1,450. A building of the same type at Canberra would cost &#163;3,000 or more. I speak on this question now because the budget alludes to the fact that 500 cottages are to be erected at Canberra. So far, 300 have been built. I hope that better arrangements will be made for building the balance of 200 houses. </para>

                                <para>- The results in the past under the system pf day labour have not been better. The cause of the high cost is the haste in providing accommodation for civil servants. There should not have been such haste. The transfer of the Capital ought not to be delayed, for after 25 years it is time that the change was made; but it ought not to have been necessary to crowd everything into the last twelve or eighteen months. The preparations for the transfer of the Capital have revolutionized local affairs in that part of New South Wales. It is estimated that the population of the Capital Territory will be 5,000 on the 31st December this year, and as there arp another 5,000 persons living in Queanbeyan, there will be a total population of 10,000 in a district the population of which, a few years ago, did not exceed 2,000. When the city commences to boom, one may expect that it will contain from 10,000 to 14,000 persons. A population as large as that will look for outlets. It will need good roads, not only inside, but also outside the Territory. It is time that the Government got busy and arranged for roads to be made outside the Territory. Parts of the road between Goulburn and Sydney are in a bad state, but the New South Wales Government; which realizes that Canberra will become an important place, is laying out money to make this road. It is time, too, that the road from Goulburn to Canberra was made. A large motor bus runs regularly over that road, but when the city is established, one motor bus and one train a day will not meet the needs of the population. The cost of constructing that road would not be very great. A large part of it is within the Capital area. A road is also needed between Canberra and the coast. There is a road to the coast now, but it needs to be shortened and improved, and when that is done, Canberra will be within a day&#39;s easy journey of the sea. As the Government proposes to increase the petrol tax to provide for the cost of road construction, now is an appropriate time&#39; to bring these matters under notice. I realize that some of my requests may concern the State Government more than the Commonwealth Government. I suggest that the State and Commonwealth Governments should confer regarding road construction. </para>

                        <para>A matter which concerns only the Commonwealth Government is the construction of a railway line from Yass to Canberra. That proposal concerns honorable members from Victoria more than those from New South Wales. Those who visit the Capital from the southern States now have to make a circuitous journey via Goulburn. I understand that conditions have been laid down under which the State Government will, if called upon by the Federal Government, construct the line at the Federal Government&#39;s expense. Such a line is necessary, notwithstanding the adverse report of the Works Committee. Even if it had not been decided to place the Federal Capital there, the development of the district would still warrant the construction of a line from Queanbeyan through Canberra to Yass. During the past two or three years wool which has realized the highest price in New South Wales has been grown near Canberra. That fact will convey to honorable members what the capacity of the country is. I was surprised when the proposal to construct the line was rejected by the Public Works Committee. I am satisfied that when Parliament meets at Canberra honorable members from the southern States will find that for their personal convenience the construction of the line is necessary ; and if they advocate it I, certainly, and I. believe other New South Wales representatives also, will support them. In the meantime, the road between Yass and Canberra certainly needs attention, and I trust that it will be reconstructed. Those honorable members who have visited Canberra must have been impressed with the difference between the Queanbeyan and Yass roads. The Yass road will become one of the chief tourist roads in New South Wales, because almost every one who visits that State is anxious to see the Federal Capital. Within easy reach of Canberra there are many beauty spots, including the Yarrangobilly Caves and Kosciusko.- There are many natural features that should attract distinguished visitors to the locality, but the road from Yass to Canberra is a barrier against tourist traffic. I hope that the matters I have mentioned will receive the sympathetic consideration of the Federal Capital Commission and the Government. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Killen)</inline> should be congratulated on the way in which he reported on his visit to the Northern Territory. He went there at his own expense, spent a lot of time there, and, although he travelled over only a single trail, he observed conditions closely, and conscientiously reported on them to the House. For his report we are indebted to him ; but, notwithstanding what he said, this Parliament  is committed to the construction of the north-south line by its own vote, by the decision of the Public Works Committee, and by the agreement made with the South Australian Government when the Northern Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth. When the honorable member was speaking, it occurred to me that a man travelling in a bee-line from the north to &#39; the south of Australia might obtain quite a wrong impression of the nature of the country. What kind of report, for instance, would be presented by a person who travelled in a straight line from Tenterfield to Bombala ? He would report that the country in New South Wales was exceedingly mountainous, that it had a heavy rainfall, and that much of it was incapable of carrying a sheep to the square mile. He would say that, in places, it was so far above sea level as to be useless.  His  statement of facts, as he observed them, would be correct, but it would not be wise of this House to accept him as a guide. On the other hand, if a man travelled from Bourke through Deniliquin to the Victorian border, he would report that the State of New South Wales was flat, and that the rainfall was light. I am prepared to give the Government&#39;s scheme for developing the </para>
                        <para class="block">Northern Territory a trial. I shall support the construction of the line, and I hope that it will not prove the financial sink that some people expect it to be. </para>
                        <para>Honorable, members opposite will agree that the Government&#39;s defence policy, so far as this bill is concerned, is not extravagant. One might have expected greater expenditure in that- direction. </para>
                        <para>The Government is to be congratulated on having provided for a sinking fund. Although the provision has been ridiculed by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> the principle is a good one. That &#163;28,000,000 is to bc expended in other directions does not alter the fact that the war debt has been reduced by &#163;28,000,000. War expenditure is not reproductive, whereas the money expended in other directions will be expended largely on reproductive works. The various State Governments, which have done little, if anything, towards the establishment of sinking funds would do well to follow the example set by the Commonwealth in that connexion. I listened attentively to the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> but even he admitted that the States were likely to receive a good return from the expenditure which they will incur. The position of the Commonwealth is different from that of the States. It is to be hoped that the east-west railway and the north-south railway, when constructed, will not. always mean a financial loss to the Commonwealth. But until the revenue derived from them, at least, equals the expenditure incurred, the provision of a sinking fund is wise. </para>
                        <para>There are some who regret that New South Wales has not come into line with the other States and agreed to one central borrowing authority.&#39; I do not altogether hold that view, because I am not at all confident that the scheme will be a success. As I understand that the Treasurer desires to report progress, I shall continue my remarks at a later date. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret to take up the time of the House at this hour, but I have received a letter from the secretary of the Hobart branch of the Waterside Workers Union which I desire to bring before the House, in order to refute the statement made by the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> when speaking on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. On that occasion the honorable member made a number of charges against the waterside workers of Hobart, included among which was one that they were the laziest body of men in Australia; that some of them did not do one-quarter of a day&#39;s work in a day. At the time 1 interjected that that was a scandalous statement, quite unworthy of any honorable member of this House. I suggest to the honorable member that, when he has beard this letter read, he should  do the honorable thing to those hardworking men at Hobart, and withdraw the slanderous statement that he has made. The letter from the Hobart branch of the Waterside Workers Union reads - </para>

                <para>I am writing to you on behalf of the members of the above branch to bring before the House this letter in reply to the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seabrook</inline> in regard to the waterside workers. </para>
                <para>He says in one part of his speech that strikes have taken place on ships at Hobart which called to take away fruit. I might state that a little trouble did occur over the agents here refusing to employ our members to take ships&#39; lines, which we have always claimed as our work, and the agents were given ample notice that if they did not do so our members would not work overtime at such vessels. They ignored the notification and two vessels that came in became involved. Overtime was not done on the day of their arrival. After that they (the agents) agreed to employ our members for such work, and there has been no frictionsince. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seabrook</inline>
                    also stated in the House that the waterside workers are a closed union. That is right up to a certain extent, because the Hobart branch is overdone now with membership. We may be a little short handed now and again in the busy season on account of the glut of shipping, but that being so, there are plenty of outside unemployed labour that obtain that which we cannot do, and we do not object to them working.
                </para>
                <para>Again, it was stated that members are brought from the mainland to assist in loading ships. I might say that members come from the mainland at their own expense, and are not sent for. Not more than 30 members came from the mainland this season. (That is from the Federation.) The rest, numbering about 50, came from the branches in Tasmania. They have a perfect right under our constitution to transfer from or to any branch of the Waterside Workers Federation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seabrook</inline> says that men in Hobart who are willing to work are prevented from doing so by being excluded from the unions. As I stated before, the union is overcrowded now, and there is not enough work for the members who are in it at present. </para>
                <para>As for working 48 hours at a stretch, that is far-fetched, of course. The majority have to work long hours when the work is there to make up for the lean time throughout the remainder of the year. </para>
                <para>I suppose it is news to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seabrook</inline> that our wages are based on a 30-hour week by the late  president  of the Arbitration Court, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, and I can say this with authority, there are very few members of this branch, with all the long hours worked in the busy time, who earn over the basic wage, but there are a great many of them who do not earn over &#163;3 per week all the year round. </para>
                <para>There has not been a vessel delayed here this year through &#34;go-slow&#34; policy, as they call it, on the part of the members. </para>
                <para>I am enclosing a letter from the manager of a shipping company here which will give the lie direct to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seabrook.</inline> This letter is not the only one I have received congratulating the members on the good work they have done, and still do. </para>

There was certainly no sign of a go-slow policy in the good work these men put in. Of course, we were fortunate this trip in having all union men, which has not been the case on the last two or three trips previously, owing, of course, to the fact that there were so many Home boats in loading fruit, which absorbed the union labour. </para>

                <para class="block">Those two letters speak for themselves. I said at the time that the remarks of the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)</inline> were a slander on those workers. The waterside workers of Hobart asked me to bring the matter before the House, because they feel that their honour is at stake. They are amongst those who do the hard work of the community. It may soil their hands and their clothing, but their honour is as bright and untarnished as that of men who perform less arduous tasks. I suggest to the honorable member that he would do well to withdraw the slander on this hard-working body of men in Hobart. </para>

                        <para>.- On several occasions I have referred to the desirability of extending the period of the wine bounty beyond the 31st of August of next year. The position of the industry is acute. The growers of Doradilla grapes, who include many returned soldiers, send their grapes to the distilleries, and do not get their final returns until the spirit is bought by the wine-makers. Because of the uncertainty as to the Government&#39;s intention, the sale of the spirit is held up. The price to bc paid for the grapes of the next vintage will be governed by the continuance or cessation of the wine bounty. In fact, the sale of a large part, if not the whole, of the crop is at stake. The growers are concerned as to their future, and are looking for an indication of the policy of the Government, as they should now be preparing their plans for the next crop. The wine-makers, too, are in an indefinite position. If the bounty is to be extended beyond the 31st of August, 1927, I am assured that every pound of grapes produced will be purchased at prices satisfactory to the growers. The industry is in a parlous condition. Money has to be expended now and plans made for the future, but the wine to be made from the grapes of the next vintage will not be exportable until after the present period of the bounty has expired. Having regard to the fact that the industry has yielded to the Commonwealth over &#163;2,000,000 in the form of excise duty on fortifying spirits, I hope that the extension of the bounty will receive the early and sympathetic consideration of the Government. </para>

                        <para>.- I abide by the statements I made in this House regarding the waterside workers in Hobart, and I shall endeavour to prove that what I said was correct. I said that the union is a close corporation. That is true. I also said that great numbers of men were brought from other parts of Tasmania and the mainland, because Hobart men, who were outside the union, were not allowed to earn money on the wharfs. That is a fact. I have figures from the secretary of the Stevedore&#39;s Union in Hobart, which show that 78 men were brought to Hobart from different parts of Australia, including 39 from the mainland. The latter were the riff-raff of Victoria, and they introduced go-slow tactics to Tasmania. They were extremists of a rather bad type, and were responsible for the strikes and other disputes that occurred while oversea ships were being loaded with fruit. The shipping agents had trouble with the union in regard to the taking of the lines from the overseas ships, and, as a result, some vessels had to depart without fruit that was waiting for them on the wharfs. </para>

The union wrote to us, and other shipping agents, as follows :  - </para>
                        <para class="block">I wish to draw your attention to the employment of other than members of this branch for stacking fruit in sheds on the wharfs of Hobart. I have been instructed by the executive of the federation that all work on wharfs belongs to members of the waterside workers of Australia, and, to save trouble, I would suggest that members of this branch be employed in the future for work of this character. </para>
                        <para class="block">Following the experience we had had with ships lines, this letter could only be interpreted as a threat, but, as it happened, tins demand on the port of the union was not persisted in. The men who are engaged for the receiving and stacking of fruit are men who can be relied upon to keep record, and, in most instances, they have had semi-clerical experience. Chaos would result if wharf labourers had to be employed, especially if the union had the power of selecting the men for the job. </para>

                <question>These steamers were loading at Hobart on 11th, 12th, and 13th March. As you know, mail steamers invariably load right through, in order to maintain their time-table. However, at this time, the shipping agents in Hobart had not given way to the union on the question of ships&#39; lines. By way of retaliation the union declined to work any overtime on the Thursday night, but the agents were able to persuade them to work on the Friday night. </question>
                <answer>In consequence of this action on the part of the union, the <inline font-style="italic">Naldera</inline> short-shipped 1,749 cases of apples, while, in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Esperance Bay,</inline> the short shipment was more serious, being 6,300 cases. <para class="block">I have been informed that eighteen men working on each hold load only 700 cases an hour. The thing is monstrous. And yet the honorable member for Yarra talks about these &#34; hard-working &#34; men ! Twice the required number of men are engaged loading the ships. Whilst a vessel is taking in one lift. of fruit, there are two more trucks waiting, with the mcn sitting or smoking on the handles. I have seen them doing this. I was born near the wharfs. I am not afraid to state my views on this subject. The position is better in the northern end of the island, where the influence of the Waterside Workers Union is not so apparent. At Beaconsfield the men load twice as much fruit per hour as the &#34; hard-working &#34; unionists do in Hobart. The men are paid to work from S a.m. till 5 p.m. At 12 o&#39;clock they knock off for dinner, and they are supposed to start again at 1 o&#39;clock. Actually they go on board at 8 o&#39;clock, but it &#39;is half-past 8 before the first sling of fruit, is lifted, and they knock ofl at ten minutes to 12 for dinner. I can understand why the honorable member for Yarra should read the letter which he has received from the Waterside &#34;Workers Union. He wished to put their side of the case before the House; but I stand by what I have said. Now as to the wages. The men are paid 2s. lid. an hour from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Do honorable members realize that this class of unskilled labour is more highly paid than skilled labour is in many parts of Australia? Any man can wheel a truck and put cases of fruit into a sling. On week days, from 7 p.m. to midnight, the rate of pay is 3b. 9d. an hour; from midnight to 7 a.m. it is 4s. 6d.; on ordinary holidays it is 5s. an hour; and on extraordinary holidays, such as Eight Hours&#39; Day and Christmas Day, it is 6s. 6d. an hour. The new log coming before the Arbitration Court asks up to 8s. 10&#163;d. an hour. It is impossible to provide cheap freights while this sort of thing goes on. I  Bay  deliberately that some of these men are not earning 5s.  a  day, and yet they want to be paid up to 8s. lOd. an hour. Some of them do not do a quarter of a day&#39;s work. I retract nothing of what I have said. </para><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>4317</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JSC</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BRENNAN, Frank</name><name role="display">Mr BRENNAN</name></talker><para>-  Would the honorable member advocate 5s. as the standard rate of wage for unskilled labour? </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>4317</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KQW</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SEABROOK, Alfred</name><name role="display">Mr SEABROOK</name></talker><para>- No, but I- say emphatically that the great bulk of these men are not earning it.
