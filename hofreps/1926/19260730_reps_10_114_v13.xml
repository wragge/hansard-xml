                        <para>- I understand that Parliament is expected to rise on the 13th August, and that many important matters have yet to be considered, including the agenda paper for the Assembly of the League of Nations, and that for the Imperial Conference, the States Grants Bill, the duties on petrol, chassis, and tires, and the estimates. I understand also that there is a considerable  amount of uncertainty about the ratification by the States of the Main Roads Agreement. New South Wales has already decided not to ratify it, the South Australian Parliament has carried a resolution in opposition to it, and there is also strenuous opposition to it in thu Victorian Parliament, as indicated in the debate which took place yesterday in the Legislative Assembly. In these circumstances I should like to know if the Prime Minister considers it advisable to occupy the time of the House with the  Federal  Aid Roads Bill before the decision of the States regarding it has been made known. Otherwise, the completion of the business already on the business-paper will probably involve all-night sittings and the passing of legislation without proper consideration? </para>

                        <para>- At an early date, I intend to make an announcement in regard to the business the Government proposes to submit for consideration this session. The honorable gentleman's question is really directed towards the Federal Aid Roads Bill. It is true that reports have appeared in the. press regarding the attitude of certain States towards the agreement covered by that bill, but the Commonwealth Government has received no official communication except from New South Wales, notifying their disapproval of tha agreement. Yesterday the Premier of victoria stated that he had verbally agreed to the proposals made by the Commonwealth, but, as a matter of fact, he has done more than that; he has actually written to the Commonwealth Government expressing the approval of his government. I agree with the honorable member that it is necessary that the attitude of all the States should be ascertained, because the arrangement proposed by the Commonwealth is dependent upon an agreement with the States, to which all but New South Wales have already indicated their willingness to assent. The Commonwealth Government intends to ascertain definitely the present attitude of the States towards its proposals. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the Administrator of Norfolk Island has actually arrived in Australia, but his return to the Commonwealth was determined upon before the report of the royal commissioner had been received by the Government. There is no connexion between the Administrator's presence in Australia - he is here on leave - and the commissioner's report. The report itself was received a week ago by the Government, and is now under consideration. It will be made available at the earliest possible date. </para>

By exercising super vision over sales, improving the marketing organization, bringing about co-ordination amongst wholesale distributors, and in regulating supplies during the periods of glut in the United Kingdom, and thus stabilizing prices, the board succeeded in obtaining substantial advantages, but the actual monetary gain cannot be estimated.</para>

                        <para>- I rise to a point of order. The motion of the Prime Minister was that consideration of Order of the Day No. 1 be postponed until after consideration of Orders of the Day Nos. 2 and 3. Therefore, I expected that Order of the Day No. 2 would be called on. Because, in the resolution just carried, Order of the Day No. 2 is mentioned after Order of the Day No. 3, you are not necessarily obliged, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> to call on Order of the Day No. 3 before Order of the Day No. 2. I am pining to hear the speech of the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks)</inline> on the League of Nations. The honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline> who had leave to continue his speech on the second reading of the Canned Fruits Bill, is not present. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, the motion was correctly worded, and there is no need to regularize the procedure. The motion brings forward the first three items on the business paper in reversed order, No. -3 being now the first to be considered. I regret that the honorable member for Wannon is not present, because the House granted him the privilege of continuing his remarks when the debate should be resumed; but I have no doubt that honorable members will be prepared to allow him to exercise that privilege when he enters the chamber. </para>

                        <para>- I protest against this altering of the business-paper, which leads to no end of confusion. The Prime Minister, if possible, should give the House, notice of his intentions. It may be that the honorable member for Wannon, glancing at the notice-paper, saw that the Canned Fruits Export Control Bill was listed as Order of the Day No. 3, and considered that he had plenty of time to keep some urgent appointment in the city before he would be called on to continue his remarks. I suggest, in a friendly spirit, that, if possible, adequate notice should, be given respecting the Government's intention to re-arrange the business-paper. Any one of us may otherwise find himself at some time in the position of the honorable member for Wannon this morning. </para>

The Prime Minister sh. uki tell honorable members whether the car lias run off the road or has met with only a temporary mishap. The debates on the -League of Nations agenda-paper and the Canned Fruits Export Control Bill were pushed aside for the Federal Aid Roads Bill, and we have assembled this morning to hear the further debate on that bill.

                        <para>- I am carefully avoiding any irregularity of that kind. I am merely saying that it is highly desirable that we should have the final and considered opinion of the Attorney-General regarding the bill. I grant that canned fruit3 are an important subject, and I appreciate the fact that the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks)</inline> is straining at the leash to give us a speech on the League of Nations; 'but it must be conceded that we cannot proceed to a satisfactory conclusion on any of these subjects unless the road along which we must travel has been made for us. Therefore, we should discuss main roads. Surely the Prime Minister realizes that there are still a few representative bodies in Australia who have not yet condemned his proposal to tax petrol to provide revenue for constructing main roads, and that if he postpones the question he will, instead of making his own position easier, achieve a disastrous result; for, although these few public bodies and individuals in remote places agree with him, there will be none on his side if the subject does not come up for reconsideration until next week. Let us discuss the matter while he still has a friend or two here and there. We have now satisfactorily secured the rights of the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline> and allayed the fears of the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart),</inline> who stood in imminent danger of having to make a speech, without preparation, on a subject in which he was deeply interested. I appreciate the fact that the honorable member for Wimmera is improving the shining hour, while I am discussing main roads, by making some notes on canned fruits. </para>

                        <para>-  I can only reiterate my protest; indeed, I would reiterate it further, but that I am familiar with the standing order relating to tedious repetition. Therefore, I shall not reiterate, but merely emphasize my opposition to the postponement of the discussion of main roads. The public mind has been greatly stirred by this question. At this time in our history, when we are proposing to open the Parliament at Canberra, and when, in the discharge of our high functions, we shall be busy entertaining distinguished visitors, we need all our main roads. I do not wish io indulge in any carping criticism as to who should take the high road and who should take the low road. All roads are of more or less importance to the National Parliament. Before the public indignation against the Government's policy has further developed, the wisdom of this Parliament should be let loose; we should declare ourselves at once, definitely and finally. The practice, which is no doubt traditional with all governments, of holding an ear to the ground to ascertain the nature of public opinion, is to be deprecated. We, in our wisdom - and I think most honorable members will grant our superior wisdom - should direct and control public opinion, not seek to follow it. Therefore, let us, with courage and fortitude, here and now, face this question of main roads. I am not permitted to dis: cuss the merits of the question further than to say that I am opposed to the Government's policy. I have been a road-user since I started to go to school in the bush, where I was born, and I have been interested in the development of roads; and the sources of revenue which are tapped for their maintenance, ever since. I am yearning to debate this question. For the moment, the main roads of Australia are a more pressing matter than the League of Nations or canned fruits - two allied questions which are doutbless important in themselves, but are of less immediate importance than main roads. I regret that the terms in which the motion is couched preclude me from discussing main roads. That being so, I merely register my opposition, and, having regard to the pressure of time and other urgent business, J leave the subject with some regret, in the hope that what 1 have said will induce the Government to withdraw the motion. I apprehend that the notice-paper represented the considered judgment of the Government up to midnight last night. What has happened since? </para>

                    <para>.- I realize that it is sometimes necessary for the Government to make an alteration of the notice-paper, but, in fairness to honorable members, the order of business, as set out on the notice-paper, should be adhered to as far as possible. I intend to speak on the Canned Fruits Export Control Bill, but I am not prepared to do so now. I assumed that the order of business as set out on the business-paper would be observed, and I consequently made no attempt to prepare a speech. On the other hand, I have prepared a speech on the Roads Bill. I knew that the honorable member for Wannon had the floor on the Canned Fruits Export Control Bill. I submit that it is not fair to honorable members to alter the business-paper when important matters are being keenly contested. I expected to hear this morning a vigorous speech on the Federal Aid Roads Bill by the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster),</inline> and I am disappointed that I shall not hear him; but I am sure that his speech, when it is delivered, will not lack anything in vigour because it has to be bottled up for the present. </para>

                    <para>.- As somewhat of a sailor, I have always been opposed to proceeding to sea on a Friday, because as every one knows voyages commencing on that day are supposed to be attended with misfortune. And, in fact, I am somewhat at a disadvantage this morning, as I did not expect the debate on this motion to be called on, and I have not the notes which I had prepared with me. I am, therefore, indebted to the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> for making an excellent speech on a point of order in relation to the Federal Aid Roads Bill, and thus giving me the opportunity to gather together the few observations I have to make on this important subject. When this motion was before the House last week, I remained in the chamber for practically seven hours on end, because I was so interested in the speeches delivered by honorable members. I cordially endorse the remark of the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> that the speech of the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> met with his hearty commendation, though like him I do not agree with everything the honorable member for Reid said.  His  speech seemed to come as a surprise to some honorable members, but it was not a surprise to me, because from many conversations with him I know that he has given a good deal of attention to foreign affairs. With one or two of his points 1 shall deal later. </para>

                <para>I have not attended an Assembly of the League of Nations, though during the sittings of the last Assembly, I was within a few miles of Geneva, and in close touch with many of those at the Assembly. In the course of my ten trips round the world, however, I have been in conversation with the leading diplomats of many countries, and am personally acquainted with many persons who have attended the meetings of the League, and have, therefore, been able to obtain their opinion on international matters. It is easy to say that we believe in the League of Nations, but it is important to consider what it actually is, and where it assembles? Its meetings are held practically in the heart of Europe, and it functions in an atmosphere not exactly of war, but of continual preparation for war. If honorable members would study the conditions of the armies and navies of the world to-day, as revealed in publications obtainable in our Library and elsewhere, they would receive a frightful shock. Although the League of Nations is endeavouring to ensure the peace of the world by discussions around the council table, the armed forces of Europe are greater to-day than they were in 1914. From the following figures concerning a branch of defence in which I am especially interested - the Navy - honorable members will gain some idea of the strength of the navies of the world. The number of ships built and in course of construction are - </para>
                <para>In addition to those mentioned above there are ' also aeroplane carriers and other types. It will, therefore, be seen that it is very difficult for the League of Nations to function effectively in the atmosphere by which it is surrounded. We must also remember that the great powers of Germany, Russia, and the United States are not members of the League. Of course, we all advocate the admission of Germany, and it is almost certain that she will become a member of the League; but America, constituted as she is - -honorable members must get this into their minds - will never join the League. I have had friendly discussions with a number of the leading men of America, and from them have gained the definite . impression that, although Americans will possibly favour the representation of their country in a Court of International Justice, she will' not join the League. America has a population of 116,000,000 people, and is far removed from the turmoil of Europe. She did, however, endeavour to bring the nations together for peaceful purposes hy convening the Washington Disarmament Conference, and much good work was done at the conference, although it has since been undone, to some extent, because so many war vessels, other than capital ships, are now being constructed. However, I shall leave that aspect of the question for a moment, and deal with the economic question, which is causing a good deal of concern. When I was abroad eighteen months ago, I found that the dangerous subject was, as pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition, the question of supply of the world's raw material. We, in Australia, have no real idea of the importance of this question. If there is anything that is likely to cause talk of war, or actual war, it is the supply of raw materials.

                <para class="block">According to the agenda paper of the League of Nations which has been tabled, the report of the preparatory committee for a world's conference which has considered the economic conditions of the various nations may be discussed, and this discussion would cover the supplies of raw materials and the subject of migration. Although I entirely agree with the sentiment underlying the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I cannot support the amendment, for certain reasons. The issue, however, cannot be sidetracked ; it must be faced. We must remember that any question likely to bring about war can. be considered by the League, and if there are any subjects which are likely to have that result they are the world's supplies of raw material and migration. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that Australia's delegates to the League should make it perfectly clear where we stand on these matters and on the White Australia policy. The subject cannot be raised by the Australian delegates at the Assembly of the League; but I think the right honorable member for Balaclava was right when he said that our delegates can voice our opinions before the other delegates of the British Empire who will be at the Assembly. That has a bearing upon the point raised by the honorable member for Reid, that we were not consulted by the British authorities about the Locarno pact. Of course we were not. The right honorable member for Balaclava rightly said that we must never forget that we are part of the British Empire. When supporting the candidature of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Perkins)</inline> at the recent byelection, I found, on arriving at Yass, that the Leader of the Opposition had the previous evening made a lengthy speech to the effect that Australia must not place her finger in the international pie. That remark was applauded; but it gave me the opportunity on the following night to explain that it did not matter a rap whether Australia has its finger in the international pie or not, because, if war were declared from Downing-street, we should be involved equally with all other parts of the Empire five minutes afterwards. When Great Britain is at war, the whole Empire is at war. I do not think the honorable member is foolish enough to believe that Australia would be better out of the Empire than in it. Australia's security has depended and always Twill depend upon the might of Great Britain and her Navy; but, whatever move may be made on the international chessboard at Downing-street, we are bound by it. That has an important bearing on Australia's representation in London. I have always been of the opinion that our representative in London .should have the status of an ambassador, and the opportunity of consulting and conferring freely with the British authorities. A great compliment was paid me by the Empire Parliamentary Committee . of the House of Commons, of which Lord Burnham is the  chairman,  when I was asked, during my stay in London, to attend its meetings when the representation of the dominions in London was being considered. Members of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald's Government were on that committee, before which I "had an opportunity of expressing my views. The members of the committee were practically unanimous that the dominions should have better representation. Australia's representative in London should be able to visit the Foreign Office every morning, peruse its files, and make extracts from them of anything concerning Australia. He could then keep our Prime Minister in close touch of what was going on, and could convey to the Foreign Office in Loudon the views of the Australian Government on matters of international importance affecting the Commonwealth. That would remove a lot of the trouble referred to by the honorable member for Reid. I trust that the Attorney-General will take a broad hint from the views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition, and will express to the loaders of the British delegation at Geneva Australia's views on economic questions, on ouv White Australia policy, and concerning migration and the tariff. As I said just now, those questions cannot be side-stepped, as any subject that might lead to war can be considered by -the League. Undoubtedly the subject of migration and the supplies of raw materials, which have occupied the attention of diplomatists during recent years, can be so considered. I had the rather extraordinary experience of discussing the migration question with the Japanese Cabinet in 1923. The Japanese people respect the White Australia policy more than they do the exclusion policy of the United States of America. They recognize that we have always kept a clear line of demarcation, whereas the policy of the United States of America was changed after large numbers of Japanese had migrated to California. But, although Japan respects the White Australia policy, it is clear to any one who has visited that country that that policy is not popular there. Questions affecting migration will necessarily be considered from time to time by the League of Nations, and the sooner we make up our minds regarding them the better it will be for all concerned. </para>

                        <para>- The world outlook is not particularly hopeful. Conditions cannot continue as they are at present. I find myself in a somewhat difficult position in speaking on this subject this morning, because of the adverse criticism that was given by the press to a speech which I delivered in 1920 or 1921, when I made a forecast regarding the next war. The indications are, however, that I was right rather than wrong. We must do everything possible to break down the tendency towards increased armaments; but how should we start? On my last visit to America banquets were tendered to me at San Francisco and Vancouver, and I had the opportunity to speak to about 500 or 600 persons. During the course of my ' speeches I suggested that the nations should be taken seriatim and a schedule prepared showing the area of land under their control, their population and its distribution, their trade routes and the value thereof, and that a decision should be arrived at as to the defensive forces necessary to safeguard their respective interests. To do even so much would result in billions of pounds being saved in warlike expenditure,' because it would reduce materially the existing forces of certain great powers. The question may well be asked why Japan to-day has one of the finest navies the world has ever seen. I have been on some of her war vessels, and know what they are like. Why has Japan two great battle fleets, which are maintained in a state of high efficiency? The reason is that that nation is afraid of Russia and China; and it is no secret that she has no very great affection for the United States of America, because of the exclusion law which has been in operation in that country. Japan's massive navy could be reduced considerably by an agreement along the lines that I suggest.' I do not think that the League of Nations can deal with this matter so long as Germany, the United .States of America, and Russia, arc not members of the League. The time is ripe for another disarmament conference. The . United States of America is only too willing to call another disarmament conference if the nations will attend it. I speak as one possessing knowledge, because I have been behind the scenes. A conference would have been called by the United States of America had it not been for the Locarno Conference. The people of the United States of America resented greatly what took place at Locarno, because the  President  of that great republic had previously laid all his cards on the table and shown his willingness to call another disarmament conference. Locarno, however, upset his plans. Another conference similar to that held at Washington should be held. It would result in great savings to Britain, and in even greater savings on the part of Japan. If some understanding could be arrived a.t, Japan's armaments could be- reduced, and that would help the whole Avorld. Throughout Australia there is considerable anxiety as to the aspirations and intentions of Japan. That anxiety is unfounded; there is no cause to fear Japan. The Japanese people have a deep regard for the British Empire and for Australia, a regard which they showed during the Great War, when Japanese vessels escorted the Australian troopships and guarded the whole of the Australian coast. I urge the Prime Minister, while in Great Britain, to do what he can to arrange for another disarmament conference. When I was in Tokio, word arrived that the Australian Prime Minister had suggested that a Pacific Conference on this question should be held. That suggestion was applauded throughout Japan. I, personally, applauded it in a speech which I delivered at the Pan-Pacific Conference at Tokio. I hope that before long another disarmament conference will be held. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> referred to the necessity fcr the Dominion Governments being consulted by the British Government in matters of foreign policy. It does not matter whether they are consulted or not in these matters, because, if England is at war, the Dominions are automatically at war also. In this connexion I desire to read from the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 29th July, the report of a speech which was delivered in the House of Lords by Earl Balfour - </para>

                        <para>The  President  of the Council (the Earl of Balfour) said that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Baldwin)</inline> would make a statement upon the conference in the immediate future, and he need not anticipate it. There was little doubt that the date would have to be deferred after 5th October, for the convenience of the dominions. ''Regarding Lord Parm'oor's Question, he said that the problem would certainly come up at the conference if the dominions desired to discuss it. " My personal view," Lord Balfour said, " is that our relations in this conglomeration of free States are necessarily those of equality. None of us can be above the other. One may have more responsibility than another, one may be closer to the centre of international complications, but all are on an equality. That is the essence of the British Empire. (Cheers.) Little can be gained by discussing the defining degree of responsibility each has to the other. I should say that this country is bound to go to war to defend any part of " the Empire. Personally, I think that the duties of other parts of the Empire to us are not less than our duties to them, but regarding !the particular conditions under which that great duty should be exercised, nothing can be gained by inventing hard cases beforehand. Our plain duty is to defend the Empire of which we are so important a part. </para>
                        <para>That duty we shall always carry out, as well as our duty to bring the dominions, into our counsels as far as possible. "There are mechanical difficulties in consultation - difficulties of time and -space which no scientific discoveries -will enable us to eliminate - but we desire to give the dominions full information regarding the motives animating our policy. We desire that the unbreakable 'bond which unites us shall carry that mutual confidence and constant exchange of ideas and harmony of aims which is the basis and strength of the Empire. How these general maxims will he dealt with 'by the various elements of the Empire when they come together at the end of October I cannot say; but I am confident that the common political instincts will carry the Empire through all difficulties, and moreover, when the occasion arises, will carry the Empire through its perils and perplexities." </para>

                    <para class="block">That very fine speech, which will live in our memories for a long time, answers the statements that have been made by the honorable member for Reid (Ma-. Coleman) regarding the desirability of the dominion governments being consulted on matters of foreign policy. The British Government is just as anxious to place before us all that it knows as we are to learn what is going on. I agree heartily with the proposal that we should have in London an Australian ambassador, with the right to examine documents in the Foreign Office, and so to keep Australia well informed on matters of foreign policy. When in England, I came to the conclusion that an Australian ambassador in London was most desirable, and I -informed the Prime Minister to that effect. The League of Nations must continue to function. Already it has accomplished a great deal, especially in the direction of rehabilitating the financial position of some of the Central European powers. It has received one or two serious setbacks; as, for instance, that given to it by the ambassadors who, without consulting the League, prevented war between two countries; it has been side-stepped on occasions; but, nevertheless, it is doing an enormous amount of good. But it will never achieve world peace until the United States of America is a member of the League; and as that country will not join, the League, we must help the League by outside influence. Another disarmament conference should be held at Washington in an atmosphere that is not filled with rumours of war and preparations for war. Only in a neutral, calm atmosphere can these matters be discussed with any hope of success. The present tendency is "for armaments to increase. Europe is not in a healthy state. The collapse of the franc, Germany starving for' raw materials, Russia but little better, Italy flourishing under a dictator, Japan worried by many things, are matters of great moment, which may have disastrous results. Only to-day, there appeared in the press a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davis</inline> relating to a new association that has been formed to bring about better relations in the Pacific. That is an excellent idea. </para>

                            <para>- The strained relations between Japan and the United States of America are pregnant with grave possibilities. It is of no use our attempting to disguise that fact. Any person who, in the United States of America, makes a speech against Japan, is regarded as a hero, because he is supporting the policy of exclusion of Japanese. Similarly, any one who in Tokio gives a hard knock to the United States of America, is also regarded as a hero. Unless this state of affairs is altered, there will be trouble. Japan, and the United States of America are wonderful nations. The League of Nations cannot prevent trouble arising between 'them, because the United States of America is not a member of the League. The only hope that I can see is for either of those two nations to call a conference, with a view to the reduction of armaments. In conclusion, on the question of our representation at Geneva, I want tol say that, while doubtless the League of Nations is the talking-shop of the world, General Smuts, in his book on the League, encouraged the idea, as did Walter Haynes Page in his letters, that getting together is half the battle in overcoming difficulties. The personal touch is what is required. It is rightly complained that in many cases the representatives of the powers are not the best that could be chosen, inasmuch as they are not the heads of their respective nations, having all responsibility upon their shoulders. In that respect it is regrettable that the Prime Minister is not going to Geneva as the head of our nation. As it is impossible for the right honorable gentleman to be there, I think we are  sending our next best man in the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham).</inline> He has been a great believer in the League of Nations from the beginning. When I visited the Versailles Peace Conference, I saw the honorable gentleman there, and I know that he did wonderfully good work in assisting the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> The Attorney-General knows the atmosphere of Geneva. He is acquainted with a great number of the men he will see at the Assembly of the League, and he certainly knows the outlook of Australia and of this Parliament. He is one of the heads of the bar in Victoria and in Australia, and possesses great legal knowledge, which is so essential at a gathering such as that at which he is to represent this country. In view of all his special qualifications for the position, I say that we are sending the right man to Geneva. I congratulate the honorable gentleman upon his selection, and I wish him the best of luck. </para>

                            <para>. - I do not propose to make a considered and detailed speech on the very important and far-reaching question of the League of Nations. I have been moved by some observations of the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks)</inline> to refer to one or two aspects of the matter which have emerged in clear view in the course of this interesting and important discussion. Before I proceed further, I join with the honorable member in the expression of good will which he uttered, at the close of his address, to the honorable the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> regarding his mission to the next meeting of the League. Having an intimate knowledge of the honorable gentleman, his attainments, and his history, and setting aside for the moment purely political considerations, may I say that there is no man whom I would prefer to see proceed upon this mission before the honorable gentleman to whom the task has been entrusted. He will bring to bear upon the. performance of his mission ripe knowledge, partly born of his previous experience abroad, but more firmly based upon his sympathy with the objects of the League of Nations. I join wholeheartedly with those who wish him god-speed upon his mission. I join, also, with those who, rightly, have been pleased to congratulate the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> upon his excellent address. Apparently, the honorable member's speech was rather in the nature of a surprise to those who do not know him as well as I do. I should have regarded the encomiums passed upon him as somewhat patronizing were it not for the fact that, compared with many members of the House, the honorable member has youth to his credit. We are, therefore, perhaps, justified in presuming to congratulate him upon an excellent effort, in which he displayed a broad outlook and sharp intelligence on the vexed subject of foreign affairs. I need make ho apology for venturing to say a few words on a subject which is inextricably bound up with the ideal of world peace, because when peace was an unpopular topic, and when it was barely safe to mention it, even within the comparatively secure walls of this chamber, I ventured, with other members of my party, to make an attempt to keep alive the fires of international goodwill at a time when it appeared that they were doomed to .be extinguished for ever. Without flattering myself at all, I venture to say that until we have developed the courage to talk peace in time of war as well as in time of peace, we shall never have made up our minds definitely to proceed on the right road to the goal of international peace. I remember, some years ago, reading with great pleasure some words of an eminent English divine, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Salter,</inline> of the Congregational Church in Britain. I do not pretend to quote him exactly, but he said that the greatest sacrifice that any nation can render to the world and humanity still remains to be made, and that sacrifice is for a nation prepared for war to throw aside its armaments, and, in the interests of humanity, to immolate itself for the sake of peace - for the sake of peace to make a sacrifice at least in faint imitation of the great sacrifice upon which the Christian structure rests. We have heard something of the question whether we can have security before disarmament, or must have disarmament before security. Following on the lines of thought which I have been pursuing, I say that the greatest gesture of peace that could be made would be for a nation such as Britain to throw off its arms in the sight of the world, and invite the world to follow its example. There  would be courage and statesmanship. There would be a gesture which even the most belligerent nations of the world would not have the moral courage - to refuse to emulate. I am led more particularly into this discussion by some observations that have been made on the subject of the price of Empire. The honorable member for Reid pointed out, and it is granted on all sides, that when Britain is at war we are at war, and that, says the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> is the price of Empire. The right honorable gentleman said, and the honorable member for Wentworth apparently agrees with liim, that there is no price which is too high to pay for our association, as a component part, with the British Empire. If the contrary means that we should forfeit the regard which, as kindred of one family, the people of this country naturally have for their forbears and the country from which they have come, I would </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>Bay that that is a sentiment too deeply cherished and too vital to the better side of human nature to be set aside in any circumstances. When any people cease to have regard for the claims and ties of kinship, they have thrown aside the better part of their nature. Therefore, I do not advocate that. But I point out to these honorable gentlemen that in all material matters but one Australia is an independent nation. We have insisted upon that. We have insisted upon the recognition of Australia- before the League of Nations as an independent dominion, and one of the family of British nations. There is no one in Australia to-day who would tolerate for a single moment the slightest interference with the right of this country to govern itself according to its own ideals. The purpose of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> is to declare before the world that on all questions of purely domestic concern the right of Australia to govern herself is, and must remain, inviolate. The honorable member for Wentworth, although for certain technical reasons he is not supporting the amendment, admits that he is entirely in accord with the sentiment it expresses. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member should not misunderstand me. I am in favour of the amendment, but I believe that the Australian delegates should voice their protest in the Council of the British Empire, and not at the League of Nations. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. We see  from these facts how deeply cherished is the principle of practical independence. On all practical bread-and-butter questions we insist upon our absolute right to govern ourselves. There is no school of thought in Great Britain which challenges that right, nor is there any which insists upon the view that if war is declared by the Home Office, Australia is necessarily bound to send troops to take part in that war. The British authorities do not insist upon that as an obligation arising out of our imperial connexion. That is a matter, as the honorable member for Fawkner points out, entirely within our own discretion. But there is a legal result which flows from our imperial connexion which is not in our discretion at all, and is the result pointed to by the honorable member for Reid, namely, that Great Britain being at war, we are, within the view of international law, at war also. To every country with whom Great Britain is at war Australia is at war; we are a belligerent community; our territory is an enemy territory; and our citizens are enemy citizens. It becomes more than a question of law. It becomes a question of fact, having very practical and grave consequences. That is where the real difference arises between honorable members on this side and those who sit opposite. I now make this public declaration - associated as it is with my respect for the imperial sentiment, so far as it rests upon kinship and goodwill - that it is a vital inroad upon Australia's independence that in time of war she may be cast into the cauldron without her consent and without even the consultation of her people. Against that international condition I strongly protest. The right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> speaking the other day of the Imperial connexion and the price of emnire, declared himself to be an imperialist, and also said that every patriotic citizen of Australia should be an imperialist. Nobody knows better than the right honorable gentleman that a few years ago men of capacity and .undoubted patriotism publicly . supported the view that a condition of absolute independence would be safer and better for Australia. That school of thought is not entirely extinct. There are still on this side honorable members who are sufficiently high spirited and public spirited to express their views fearlessly on all aspects of this question. Real patriotism does not call popular catch cries to its aid. The right honorable gentleman is apparently assessing the virtue of patriotism in its relation to Empire rather than in its relation to Australia, which is our special responsibility and care. I am not arguing for the disbandment of the British Empire. Australia enjoys absolute independence except in one respect. You cannot violate those ties of kinship and regard which ought to, and do, bind together people of the same race. But I declare that Australia should not be dragged at the tail of Great Britain or of any other nation into a war in which she has not expressed a willingness to join. </para>

                        <para>I shall now. deal with the White Australia aspect of the question. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks),</inline> re-echoing what had previously been said by half a dozen speakers opposite, stated that Australia was absolutely dependent for her existence upon the might of Great Britain. I decline to accept that as a fact. ' Such an assertion is unworthy of any honorable member of this Parliament. Not one of us may affirm, and retain his self-respect, that the very existence . of the nation which he claims to be independent and entitled to take its place as a sovereign entity in the League of Nations, is dependent for its existence upon the Mother Country. My repudiation of that statement has its basis in reason and history alike. From what source is an attack upon Australia even thinkable? In the present state of international affairs the only cause that any honorable member opposite can suggest or hint at is an ideal of racial purity known as the policy of a White Australia. </para>

                                <para>- Very well. Then we should not talk about non-interference with our domestic affairs. Other nations are entitled to interfere if we cannot manage those affairs. What right have we to talk about a White Australia if we are not prepared to back up our claim by our own strength? That brings me to the point that, if we cannot defend our policy of a White Australia, upon what ground can we expect Great Britain to support that policy for us ? </para>

                                <para>- I suggest that by no right - moral, international or legal- - can we call upon Great Britain to unsheathed the sword in defence of the policy of a White Australia, without making her appear utterly ridiculous' - and worse still, odious - in the eyes of the nations of the world. Does the honorable member recognize what are the constituent parts of the British Empire? Does ho know that hundreds of million? of coloured people go to the making up of that Empire? The white people in our Empire are comparatively insignificant in number compared with the coloured races. According to the arguments of honorable members opposite there is a possibility of our being attacked by  a nation whose population is overcrowded, because we are selfishly holding for a handful of people a vast, unused territory of potential wealth. If we are attacked upon that ground we shall be called upon to defend an immoral position, and Great Britain's support of such a position would be ten times more immoral and untenable. </para>

                                <para>- I would. I am showing the utter futility of expecting Great Britain to support by force of arms a policy which clashes with Imperial solidarity. If she attempted to send a fleet to Australia to support such a policy, she would incur the odium and contempt of every nation which is a member of the League of Nations. They very naturally would say, " How can you send your Navy across the seas to defend a policy which leads to the exclusion of coloured people from the vast unused spaces of that island continent, when four-fifths of the population of your own Empire consists of the members of coloured races"? I advance this argument merely to show the utterly absurd and untenable position which honorable members opposite take up when they say that we are unable to defend ourselves, but that, on the contrary, we are entirely dependent upon the British Navy. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member is doubtless right. But the question I would put to him is, where does his argument lead him? What position would Great Britain occupy in the eyes of the. nations that comprise the League of Nations if, as he says, she was prepared to defend Australia whatever the reason might be. If it were the maintenance of a White Australia; and if, as honorable members opposite say, Australia was not fully occupied, and was being inadequately developed whilst other nations were congested and jostling for space; the Mother Country would wage the most unpopular war in history if she attempted to unsheathed the sword in our defence. </para>

                                <para>- Such an expenditure is utterly impossible for Australia, and could not for a single moment be supported. Therefore, I come to two conclusions - that if the policy of a White Australia is challenged by force of arms we shall be absolutely thrown upon our own resources, and .that, from the military point of view, it would be impracticable for us to attempt to defend ourselves. But, holding sacred, as we do, this ideal of a White Australia, and believing that our racial purity is vital to our national well-being, not only in our own interests, but in the interests of the coloured peoples alien to ourselves! - with whom we are none the less friendly - the greatest measure of security we can adopt is the one indicated, but not outlined, by the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks)</inline> - personal contact and conciliation, out of which grow understandings between nations to which we might add the same developmental defence policy of the Labour party. On our defence estimates - it is not for me to mention them except by way of allusion - nothing is provided for the preparation for peace between us and the nations of the Pacific, or for the establishment of a school of thought which will bring about an understanding with China, Japan, and  the other peoples of the world as to the underlying principles of our policy. We hear advocated doctrines of force and militarism, impossible though they are proved to be by the Minister for Defence himself ; we hear it declared that we cannot defend ourselves, and are entirely de-  pendent on Great Britain - that is said by men who close their ears to the undoubted logic of fact that we cannot look to Britain to defend a White Australia - but we hear nothing at all about the merits of our real and best basis of security, which consists in establishing an understanding among the nations. Despite the futility of war, men who have the military spirit, and have been born and trained in that atmosphere, still cling to it with a hope that overrides experience, believing that in some inscrutable way out of bloodshed, loss, and devastation can come security. </para>

                                <para>- How can the Minister accuse me of untruth when I read it in the policies of governments ? I do not accuse the honorable gentleman of bloodthirstiness, or of glorying in the destruction and miseries occasioned by war, but I accuse those here who uphold the military tradition of following a policy of futility in imitation of countries whose people followed it in the past, and have bled and suffered for it in their millions. The whole world is groaning under a debt which the curse of war has brought on it. Untold millions yet unborn must bear this dreadful debt which our folly has brought on us and on them. Yet we still pursue the. same policy of " tactics and strategy." What has become of the strategy of the German Empire, the greatest military nation in the world? She has thrown it all adrift. Germany is said to have lost the war.  In God's name, in what way has she lost the war any more than Great Britain or France has lost it? Certain it is that we have all lost by the war, and even the light of international jealousy fails to show what country was more particularly to blame than another for the curse that came upon us. </para>

We know that France, who is assumed to have won the Avar, groaning under her load of debt, can scarcely get one of her citizens to accept the responsibility of governing the country, so embarrassed and so harassed are her people by the dreadful condition which a victorious war has won for them. We know that, never in her history has the condition of Great Britain been worse than it is to-day. We read about the coal strike in England; but it is only a sign of the times - only an incident of the general <inline font-style="italic">dSbdcle</inline> in the Mother Country as the result of this cursed war. </para>

I had hoped that in this year, 1926, people would view history in its correct perspective, and see what is really wanted in the world. What is really wanted in  the world is not that persons and nations should enter into a League secretly armed and arming, and with the spirit of fight still in them- but that men should seek peace, believing in .peace; not, like the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie),</inline> thinking that one should go to a peace conference with a dagger behind one's back. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly; that is the kind of policy which brings about war; when men say, " Yes, let us talk peace; but we shall keep our powder dry and a loaded gun behind the back for use in case the peace conference is not a success." It will be when men will go into a peace conference with their hands open and bare, saying, " We have come here honestly and frankly, not only with a desire for peace, but also with the belief that peace is a practical policy, and we are ready to take . some risk for so great a prize," that peace will be realized in the world. But when one attempts to show the futility and the curse of war, and to make an appeal based on the events of the last ten or twelve years, which have brought about nothing but death and devastation in the world, honorable members like the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> interject sneeringly, and suggest that peace is but the dream of the unpractical. </para>

                        <para>I would fain pay a tribute, though it be a humble one, to the late  President  of the United States of America <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Woodrow Wilson),</inline> who first envisaged the possibility of a League of Nations. In many of the incidents of his life he disappointed me; but those are forgotten in the major fact that he was a man of broad and courageous outlook, who saw the possibility of achieving peace upon lines of peace rather than upon lines of war. It is to his eternal credit that, during the war, he set out the bases upon which international peace might be achieved : and, when confronted with the views of the then Leader of the Australian Government (the Right  Hon.  William Morris Hughes), and others who spoke and thought with that gentleman, he brushed them contemptuously aside, declaring that he stood for the peace of the world rather than for the special interests of any nation which was a party to the conflict. </para>
                        <para>I hope that some real good may come from the mission of the Attorney-General. I believe that he will discharge his duties upon the lines of peace with honesty and ability; and, as I said at the beginning, I say in conclusion, I wish him well. My last work is that peace will only be attained by men who realize the futility of war, and by men who go into a conference with peace in their hearts and the belief that it is worth while to make some real sacrifice in order to rid the world of the canker curse of war. </para>

                                <para>- I wish to make a personal explanation. During my speech before the dinner adjournment I made reference to the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie).</inline> I used the phrase, as fax as I remember, that he represented the school of thought that would go into a conference with a dagger behind its back. I should like it to be clearly understood that I did not intend that phrase to be taken as representative of the honorable member's personal character, or to imply that he would be either treacherous or cowardly, because my opinion is quite the contrary. I was endeavouring to apply those words fairly to that school of thought that took the view that we should first have security by establishing armaments before we considered disarmament or a conference to bring it about.  As the honorable member for Warringah took exception to my words at the time, and as I did not fully realize what, perhaps, they implied to him, I take this opportunity of saying that it was not my intention to make a reflection upon either his courage or his conduct. </para>

                            <para>. -  I had not intended to speak on the subject of the League of Nations until the Estimates were under discussion, but this morning, when the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks),</inline> and also the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> referred particularly to Japan, I thought that this was a suitable time for me to express my views  on that nation, since it is one of the leading members of the League of Nations. The League is running a grave risk of having brought before it for consideration matters that are of domestic concern to us, such as immigration and the White Australia policy. People in Australia ar« prone to give lip service to the inviolability of the White Australia policy, but whether they are prepared to act in the field of physical endeavour is another matter. This morning the honorable member for Batman, in reply to an interjection by me, said that he would be prepared to support the White Australia policy. At the time he was talking about war, and its consequences. He implied by his answer that he would support the White Australia policy, not only verbally, but also physically. In view of his subsequent remarks, I have grave doubt indeed respecting his bona fides in that "direction. During his speech I was . persistently reminded of the reference made last Parliament by the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> to certain honorable members who, he said, if an enemy landed in Australia, would immediately mount a soap-box to persuade them to leave these shores. I am afraid that the honorable member for Batman distinctly comes within that category. He represents the school of thought which preaches pacificism run mad. I suggest that when it comes to the point of supporting the White Australia policy by physical force, he will take up the position that he adopted during the recent conflict. </para>

                            <para>- I am trying to be both honest and accurate-. I am sure that no honorable member misunderstands me. The honorable member, this afternoon, gave the impression that he would support the White Australia policy by physical force if need be, but I venture to suggest that in view of his past conduct, if an enemy threatened that policy, he would be one of the first to mount the soap-box to ask it to please retire. It is possible that  Ave  should help to bring about peace in the world by forgoing our self-respect, and repudiating, to some extent, our White Australia policy. If we say that that policy must be kept inviolate, then we must be prepared to back our opinion with force. During the last Parliament I had occasion to refer to the strong pacifist views of the honorable member for Batman, and although that matter concerns only himself, yet it is rather incongruous and paradoxical that he should make a most bellicose speech in this House when, if it came to the point of supporting his opinions by physical force, he would be found wanting. Throughout the ages the final test of manhood has been the capacity of a person expressing belligerent views to back them with force. At the recent International Labour Conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt,</inline> a member of the New South Wales Parliament, was instrumental in getting the delegates from other nations to see eye to eye with him in respect of keeping the White Australia policy inviolate. We must realize that that policy is in the forefront of international politics, and that many nations are urging a modification of it. I am convinced that Australia must at some time be prepared to give physical support to it. I speak in no sense as a "Jingoist." The subject is likely to be discussed at the next meeting of the League of Nations, as is evidenced by the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> He foresees that Australia's delegation to Geneva will have to be on its guard io prevent any insidious interference with the White Australia policy, as was attempted by Japan last year. It is doubtful whether we can rely absolutely on the League of Nations as a sufficient deterrent to prevent other nations from attempting to assail the White Australia policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Evan Hughes, when Secretary of States for the United States in the Harding Administration, speaking on the 16th May, 1923, said, "The League of Nations is a failure as an agency between the nations of the world to enforce peace." That statement should give us grave concern. If our safety cannot be assured by the League of Nations, we shall have to consider our relations with the nations which constitute the League, particularly on matters of such vital importance to Australia. Our White Australia policy is likely to be assailed only by Japan, as that is the only nation likely to be antagonistic to it. The aim of Japan has been plainly stated by the Japanese themselves, who claim that they will have absolute control in the  Pacific. Even in the schoolbooks issued to the senior children there appear over and over again these words, "Japan must be made the mightiest nation in the world." That is sufficient to show that other nations in the Pacific must prepare for the day when there will inevitably be a trial of strength. Great Britain has_ taken certain steps to safeguard Empire interests by constructing the Singapore Base. If that work is not being proceeded with for that purpose, what object has the British Government in view? </para>

                            <para>Japan has resorted to this theory on several occasions - as in 1894, when the Government forced hostilities on China; in 1904, with Russia; in 1910, by the annexation of Korea; in 1916, by the demands on China; and, in 1917, by the Siberian expedition. Take, for example, the first instance, the case of Ito in 1894. He had found it practically impossible to hold his own, or e'ven to keep the Constitution together, and, though a stern follower of the peace-loving Kido and Okubo, he found himself forced to re-awaken the chauvinistic spirit of the nation by provoking the war with China. This move was, for the time being, eminently successful. The Diet had been a mob of raging fanatics, but, on the opening of hostilities, became instantly submissive. The turbulent populace went wild with national enthusiasm, and Ito became the most popular man in the empire. Budgets that had previously been the centre of conflict wore passed without a murmur, and, in consequence, the Ito Ministry remained in power for over four years - an unusually long period in Japan. </para>

The children of unions of different European races are not regarded as half-castes, but the position is different in the case of the children of a union of the white and coloured races.

Before the war, Japan's merchant shipping placed her sixth among the nations; now she has risen to the third position- That Japan's intentions are not solely in the direction of defence, is shown by the number of highly coloured pictures and stories which have been published in Japan during recent years. The text-books for her schools contain accounts of mimic battles, in each case the potential enemy being the United States of America ! Many of the stories set before the Japanese children depict the United States of America being invaded by Japan, or vice versa. The decision of Great Britain to build a naval base at Singapore was a clear indication that all was not well in the Pacific.

                            <para>How is our Aryan  race  and its civilization to guard against the danger of being passively invaded and exterminated by the alarming fecundity of other human races? One must be blind not to recognize this danger. To estimate it at its proper value, it is not enough to put all " savages " and " barbarians " into one basket and all " civilized " into the other. The question is far more complicated than this. . . . The Chinese, and some other Mongolian races, constitute an imminent danger for the very existence of the white races. These people eat much less than ourselves, are contented with much smaller dwellings, and, in spite of this, produce twice as many children and do twice as much work. .  . Possibly, we might make a compact with the Mongols, and the Chinese in particular, which would allow both races to live on the earth without annihilating each other. I am  quite  convinced that we have more to fear rom their blood and their work than their arms. Some time ago experts in Far-Eastern questions predicted that the world would end by becoming Chinese. </para>
                        </quote><para class="block">One of the questions raised by the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> is whether we in Australia are to have the power to pass laws that we consider necessary for the preservation of the white races heres If that is to become a subject-matter for discussion by the League of Nations, we are in grave danger of losing our birthright. I commend the amendment to the House, because I believe that we -should make it clear to the League of Nations that Australia will not allow any interference by the League in matters which we regard as being of domestic concern, namely, our migration policy and the White Australia policy. Those two policies are inseparable. Australia being an outpost of the white race, we, living us it were under the shadow of the coloured races, should jeopardize our very existence if we failed to take whatever action we considered necessary to keep Australia white. It may be said that my speech is antagonistic to Japan. If to advocate that we should look after our own interests .and maintain this country for ourselves is regarded by any other nation as an affront, I can only conclude that that nation has designs upon us. I have not visited Japan since the Great War, although  I  paid a couple of visits to that country prior to the outbreak o.f hostilities. I should be pleased to know that there was no. longer justification for the conclusions which were forced upon me during those visits. I point but that the opinions I have quoted this afternoon are those of experts. I should welcome an opportunity to visit Japan, and to see, not only what would be shown to me, but also what I myself desired to see. I state definitely my opinion that, at the present time, Japan has designs on this country. Australia is one of the obstacles to the realization of her dream of supremacy of the Pacific. I believe that the imminence of trouble in the1 Pacific can be established, and that the menace  3f  Japan is very real. I shall be pleased to acknowledge my mistake if- I am. shown to be wrong, but all the evidence I have been able to obtain, and some of which  I  have given' the House this afternoon, confirms my view that Japan does not look upon Australia with a very friendly eye.  I  sincerely hope that the Attorney-General, as leader of the Australian delegation to the . League of Nations, will not permit this question to fade into the background.  I  hope that he will be particularly alert to notice a movement of any description whatever that is calculated to interfere with our domestic concerns, and particularly those of such a national character as our policy of a White Australia. </para></speech>

                            <para>.- 1  regret very much some of the references which the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green)</inline> has made to Japan. No instance can be quoted in which Japan has broken a treaty. We 'cannot point to a* single' instance in which she has behaved dishonorably, in connexion with a treaty with another nation. Did not Japan, as a loyal ally, do her level best to assist us in the last terrible war? Were not our soldiers, when being transported across the' Indian Ocean, given heart of grace when, in the darkness of night, the big grey fighting ships of Japan showed up, and they knew that they could rely upon their protection?  I  visited Japan during the Russo-Japanese war, and on two occasions Japanese war vessels came within a stone's throw of the ship on which  I  travelled, and, finding that ours was a friendly vessel, gave the signal to pass on. From that experience, I can well imagine what our Australian soldiers must have felt when they sighted Japanese war vessels . on their journey across the Indian- Ocean. Japan is the only country that has ever so honoured our race as to ask one of the greatest of our philosophers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> Spencer, what its laws and procedure should be to enable it to avoid trouble with foreign nations, and particularly with America and England.  I  should "have liked to quote the letters written by Herbert Spencer to the Japanese who asked for his advice. They are, in my opinion, the most important letters ever written by a human hand. They can be found, at page  321  of the <inline font-style="italic">Letters of Herbert Spencer,</inline> by David Duncan, which can be obtained in the Library, and honorable members would do well to read thom. The advice given by Herbert Spencer to the Japanese nation was that they should sell no land to a foreigner; should permit no foreigner to own shares in their banks, tramway companies, or shipping companies engaged in the Japanese coastal trade; and should keep themselves apart from other nations as far as possible. Spencer knew the ' history of foreign missions, and he was aware that missionaries and traders were believed in their own countries when they made reports pf the foreign countries they visited. - He did not trust the good-will of the </para>

                        <para class="block">British nation, and, desiring that his last days should end in peace, he requested the high Japanese authorities to whom he wrote to keen his letters of advice, secret until he had passed away. The Japanese people honorably fulfilled his request,, and it was not .until he had passed away that Herbert Spencer's Jotters were given the publicity they deserved. To show how sound Spencer's judgment was, there appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> after his death one of the bitterest articles ever written accusing him of possessing the narrow-minded personality of a Chinese mandarin of the most conservative type. He has passed away, and the greatness of his name remains in spite of the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> or any other- newspaper. I have more than once suggested in (this House that instead of hurling insults ' at a nation that is great in every sense of the word, we should approach its people with the word which is regarded as most sacred -throughout the East, and that is the word " reciprocity." We should ask the Japanese in the sacred name of reciprocity to listen to us. We should tell them that if they desire to settle' in Australia we are willing, provided they tell as how many Australians are settled in Japan. No Australian owns a square inch of land in Japan. We should tell the Japanese that as the population of Japan is thirteen times greater than the population of Australia, they are welcome to thirteen times the quantity of land in Australia that Australians own in Japan. This is the one continent in the world throughout which the same language is talked, spoken and read, and we hold it as a sacred trust for the millions to come after . us. Wo should tell the Japanese that for every Australian settled in Japan we are prepared to welcome the settlement of thirteen' Japanese in Australia. In my two visits to Japan I met only some ten Australians who were settled there, and three of . them have since left that country. Using the sacred word " reciprocity," .we should tell the Japanese that as they have adopted certain measures on the .advice of Herbert Spencer, to safeguard the integrity of their country,, they cannot blame us if we follow, .their splendid, ex- </para>

                                who will represent this great white Australia at the Assembly of the League of Nations, will make it plain that Aus traia will in no circumstances permit the White Australia policy, to be ' tampered with. I should prefer to see .every man, woman and child in Australia dead rather than lower that flag of ours. It is said that travel is the best form of instruction, and I think it is. . My travels have removed a great fear I had of China and Japan. At one time I entertained almost a dislike of the Chinese, but, as a result of my first contact with the teeming millions of China, I changed my view, and my change of view was confirmed by my. visit to Japan. When I returned I told a gathering of my electors that whereas they had honoured me,, by electing me as a republican, I would from that time forward 'never advocate that form of government so long as England's association with Australia was conducted on just and equitable lines. When I went -through the narrow slums of the city  of Canton, I wondered, as a medical man, how people could live under' such conditions as I saw there without the diseases which I  expected  to find. I came to the conclusion that, if some 400,000,000 of Asiatics could lead fairly healthy lives 'under such conditions, it needed only an organizer as great as Confucius was as a philosopher, and the whole wor}.1! would lie at the feet of China. I am always ready to accord my thanks to a great senator who has passed away. I refer to the late
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline>
                                to whom much of my knowledge of the history of China  is due. Like the United States of America, China has never invaded other countries. America has never seized territory. She has never occupied the territory of another nation except by obtaining it' by purchase. If she is delaying a little while in the Philippines, we must remember that it was at the request of England, Prance, and Holland -that she occupied those islands. I -make that statement definitely, upon the authority, of a work published  by Governor Harrison, who ruled over the Philippines ' for seven years. He holds that they should be given their freedom in the same way that the residents of the Havanas have been given theirs. Luckily for us, China is not an invading nation. It has been civilized for centuries. It used bank notes before they were used by our forbears in England. Therefore, I look to the future with great hope, and with the knowledge that science has made war so terrible that every "nation will weigh the consequences well before embarking upon it. In spite of national hatreds, which must appear to the philosophers a strange faculty in human kind, the knowledge that within 24 hours as large a city as Paris or London could be made almost lifeless and desolate, would make a nation ponder before engaging in war. We in Australia could make a.. great gesture to .the .rest of the world. We led the way iri legislation by our Transfer of Land Act. We were the first of the English-speaking people, including' those of Idle United States of America, which constitute the largest number, to adopt the secret ballot. Why cannot we show to the world that it is not our intention to spend a penny piece on weapons of offence, or on the maintenance of an army and navy that could be used for the invasion of any other country
                                <inline font-style="italic">1</inline>
                                The most destructive means of waging war in the future will be by aircraft. That is the most mobile of all the forces, and it is recognized in military tactics . that mobility is the most important factor. An aeroplane 'has a range that is unequalled by the most powerful cannon which has been invented. The biggest piece of ordnance of which we have any definite knowledge is the Big Bertha' which was used to propel shells into Paris from a distance of  T5  miles. All aeroplane can operate offensively with greater accuracy than any other weapon of war, and its range is limited only by the distance it. is able to travel. If a fleet approached our shore with the object of attacking us the Admiral would  view with trepidation even 100 aeroplanes hovering above him. ' A gesture by Australia, such as. I have suggested, must bear' fruit. If we 'devoted the .whole oi/.our defence expenditure to the building and manning of aeroplanes, it .would :be &gt;an; indication' that we had no desire to .invade another country. I welcome the. existence of the League : of Nations, because I  believe that it will lay the foundation of a civilization that' I hope I . shall live to see. But there seems to be creeping into it a desire to give special prominence to the four great nations - Italy, France, Great Britain and Germany. Why should net any nation who wants peace be brought within that comity of nations? No nation should he allowed to join unless it gives proof of its. desire to assist in the maintenance of' peace. I do not ' blame Brazil .or Sweden' for their opposition to the recognition of the claim by Germany to a superior seat - . on the Council, of the .League than , they . are allowed. - If any one should think that I am harsh hi my view, I ask him: to cast, his memory - back. to. the .formation of the Holy AIM,ance in Europe. That was a .movement the- abject of which was' to crush anything in the nature of a republic. Even America was threatened. The ' Americans to-day are grateful for the act that was. later taken by the Russian nation, with sealed . instructions that it would, declare, war  on' any nation which took the step against the . United States of America. That led to the breaking up . of another alliance, which most .people will ' agree with  me was more unholy than holy. ' I .want - the nations that now. - comprise the League to open their .arms in welcome to ' any nation which desires, and will pray and work for peace. No nation should, be told " You' are . not large enough in population, armaments, or wealth to come in as our equal." Peace will not be brought about in that way. The religions that are the strongest and most far-reaching, and are securing the greatest number of proselytes, are those whose doors are open to every one. I have not entered a Mohammedan mosque- that had a pew. In the religion in which I was reared I did not see a rented pew in any church on the Continent ; they were all open and  free.   Therefore, let us open - this League. -of Nations, and make the abiding rule, " Come all ye into thiscomity:of -nations/' .so that we may ensure .peace for humanity,  and -destroy '-the horrors  and miseries «f war. -.

                                <para>- The communication which was sent dealt only with the immediate question of Germany's admission. Subject to correction by the Prime Minister, who is present, I think I can say, on behalf of the Government, that, if the United States of America were willing to enter the League, this Government would do everything possible to facilitate that entry. Similarly, if the- great country of Russia were to comply with the conditions that are required preparatory to admission, no opposition would be raised to a recognition of her position among the Powers of the world. Those matters had not arisen at  the time the- cablegram was sent, "and do not yet arise. </para>

                        <para>The' Prime Minister has referred to disarmament. On that subject also it would be unwise of me to discuss details. All sections of the He-use are agreed upon the desirability of bringing about disarmament; but the majority of honorable members recognize the grave practical difficulties that exist. . A general agreement upon the worthiness  of  the object does not in itself amount to a conclusion -upon the means that should be adopted' to bring it .about.' The questionnaire, portion of which was read by the Prime Minister, shows that this important subject is 'being approached in a practical manner, having regard to the considerations that influence the policies of nations. It is one that cannot be dealt' with in an abstract manner ; regard must be 'paid to the minds and- the wills of the nations .who 'would: be affected. </para>
                        <para class="block"> There has been a considerable amount of discussion concerning the intervention of the League in what are conceived to be domestic questions. It is, I think, sufficient for me to -say, as I have said in public on many, occasions - I believe I have spoken on the subject of the League of. Nations as often as any one else in Australia - that it would be a profound error for the League to concern itself with purely domestic .questions, not only from the point of view of the League itself, but also from the point of view of the well-being of the world. At the some time, honorable members must have recognized that the difficulty lies in the application of the' principle. There need be no doubt as. to my personal adherence- to the principle underlying the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> that it is unwise, as a matter of principle, for the League of Nations to interfere in purely domestic questions. </para>

I have no desire for personal publicity or anything of the kind associated with the enterprise upon which I am being sent abroad, and I think ii would be advisable to confine what I say now to a statement of the general principle that it is desirable that the League should not interfere with questions which are of a purely domestic character, and that my efforts will be directed to the attainment of that object, through what appear to offer themselves as the most suitable channels. </para>

                            <para>. - After the very interesting and instructive debate we have had on the agenda-paper for the forthcoming Assembly of the League of Nations, I think honorable members will agree that the representatives of Australia will have clearly in their minds the views of this Parliament upon the very important and grave matters that will come up for consideration. The three outstanding questions to be considered I dealt with in moving that the paper be printed. On the first of these, the admission of Germany into the League, and the further question as to the composition of the Council,  the views expressed by the Commonwealth Government are, I think, generally acceptable to the House and to honorable members individually. There is only one point that I need touch upon now. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman),</inline> who made, if I may be permitted to say so, a very interesting and instructive speech, appeared to think that the report of the committee dealt with permanent and non-permanent seats on the Council. So far that committee has merely dealt with the non-permanent seats. </para>

                                <para>- It is possible that the committee may now be considering a recommendation in regard to permanent seats, but my references to it were directed towards its report on the nonpermanent seats and the filling of them. As to the permanent seats on the Council, I do not think there need be the slightest apprehension on the part of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> in regard to the position of the United States of America. The covenant of the League refers to the allied and associated powers. The United States of America was one of those powers, so that in the event of that country being prepared to come into the League I do not think there will be the slightest question as to its securing immediately a permanent seat on the Council. I say nothing as to the possibility of America not coming in if it does not obtain a permanent seat on the Council. </para>

                        <para>During this debate there has been the fullest expression of the Australian view on the subject of disarmament, and the speech of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> has shown that he has the fullest understanding of the attitude we wish him to adopt in representing Australia at Geneva. With regard to the proposed Economic Conference and the general functioning of the League, it has been made perfectly clear that despite our sympathy with the objects of the League and our desire to see it progress and fulfil an ever-increasing useful purpose in the world, we believe that it would commit a fundamental and grave error if it attempted * to interfere in any way in matters that are of purely domestic concern to its members. We can, however, trust the Attorney-General to use whatever means he may think most advisable to induce the League to adopt a policy of non-interference in domestic questions. </para>
                        <para>I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that as the object of his amendment has been attained, the amendment might be withdrawn. It has served a useful purpose in leading to the clearest expression of opinion by this Parliament upon the matters to which it refers, and now that the House knows that the Attorney-General fully understands and sympathizes with its wishes, it should, I suggest, leave it to his discretion to decide how best to exercise the powers we are entrusting to him. We should send him away unfettered by any resolution. </para>

One matter that has been introduced, that of the status of the Dominions, can be dealt with more usefully, I think, when we are considering the agenda-paper for the forthcoming Imperial Conference. Consequently, I do not propose to touch upon it now. </para>

I have no doubt, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that this exhibition is being held with your approval; jut, with all due respect, I suggest that it is not desirable to encourage such exhibitions. It may be a good thing for this Parliament to do all it can to encourage Australian industries, but I do not think it desirable to allow the Queen's Hall to be used as an exhibition room for commercial purposes, or as a means of advertising individual firms or- interests. Apart altogether .from the question of infringing the privacy of honorable members - objection to this has been raised on previous occasions, especially during tariff debates - it may lead to a very undesirable precedent, because if one is allowed this privilege, it will be difficult to refuse it to others. I have brought the matter up" so that if, later, any similar requests come before you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> you will be able to give consideration to the views of honorable members. </para>

I agree that the Queen's Hall should not be used for commercial enterprises, or to enable persons to advertise their businesses, but I think that, in the exercise of your judgment, in this case, you discriminated wisely. If there is one thing that has been neglected in this country, it is an appreciation of our Australian timbers. There has been a prejudice against them, although I regard them as the finest in the world. I am not an expert, but an enthusiast, and I have enthused about Australian timbers for as many years as I have been able to reason. I have always regretted that, in Australia, especially in our public departments, we pass over our beautifully marked timbers, and give preference to imported timbers. I take this opportunity to congratulate you, sir, on your wisdom in permitting the Queen's Hall to be used for an exhibition of Australian timbers. The industry has been neglected, and the exhibition will give honorable members of this House an opportunity to appreciate our marvellously beautiful timbers. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to compliment you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> upon giving honorable members the privilege of viewing the very fine exhibition of Australian timber in the Queen's Hall. I cannot understand why an advanced thinker like the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann)</inline> has taken up such a conservative attitude. In fact, there are some words in the letters of Herbert Spencer, to which I referred a few minutes ago, which might very well apply to him. There are in the vaults of Parliament House, some  5,000  works of art, many of them very fine gifts, and no artist would ever expect his gifts to be hid in a cellar. The honorable member, I suppose, would take the same line of argument in regard to their display. Why should we hide the beauties of our Australian timber? I am delighted to have seen the splendid samples that are displayed in the Queen's Hall, and, in my opinion, they should be sent to the United States of America to show that country that, at all events, our dark timbers, especially the figured blackwood, rival its beautiful light-coloured timber known as the bird's eye maple. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> in sanctioning the exhibition you have rendered a service, not only to members of Parliament, but also to every one who sees it, and I congratulate you on having acted wisely in the interests of an Australian industry. </para>

One has only to look at the plan of Canberra to see that the artificial lakes form one of the most attractive portions of the work. </para>

At the opening of Parliament House, people will attend Canberra from all parts of Australia  and  abroad, and they will form their impression of the capital from that fleeting visit. Although £70,000 is involved in this work, it seems to me that the House should have an opportunity to discuss the subject before the report is finally adopted. The other day, the Prime Minister was good enough to advise me to take the usual procedure to bring this matter before the House. I have made inquiries from different sources, and I do not seem to get any further. I appeal to the Prime Minister to allow a debate and vote on this important subject. </para>

T myself have asked several questions in this House regarding the artificial lakes at Canberra. The Public Works Committee has presented its report. It has been ordered to be printed, and that will be the end of the matter unless the Minister decides to authorize the work. The House should have an opportunity to decide whether this work should be delayed. An essential feature of the plan of the Federal city is the artificial lakes, and yet this work is to be delayed although thousands of pounds are being spent  on other works there. I have no complaint against the Government, because it has been pushing on with the work of building the Capital. It desires that Canberra shall be an ideal city. I hope that Canberra will not be spoilt by the straggling river known as the Molonglo being allowed to remain as it is when it could easily be formed into a beautiful lake. Therefore, I urge the Prime Minister to give honorable members an opportunity to decide whether the work sh.all be proceeded with. </para>

                        <para>- That aspect of the matter should also be considered. As has been said, everything should be done to make Canberra an ideal, if not a real, city. I hope that my view, as a Victorian one, will not be disregarded when further works in the Territory are being considered. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to inform the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann),</inline> that, in conjunction with the  President,  I accept responsibility for the granting of permission for an exhibition of Australian timbers in the Queen's Hall. The gentleman to whom this privilege was given is well known to members of the Federal Parliament. He has strenuously advocated the use of our beautiful and decorative Australian timbers in our public buildings, and his efforts have also been directed to the general fostering and encouraging of afforestation in Australia. The exhibition is not being made for personal gain or to influence votes on any matter to be discussed in either House. Objections have been made to the use of the Queen's. Hall with a view to influencing the votes of honorable members, and permission has, on that account, been refused at times by. those iu authority.; but the practice is to permit exhibitions for the encouraging of the use of our natural products. In this instance we have followed precedent. I ask honorable members to inspect the exhibition, and to form their own opinions respecting the wisdom of my action. </para>

                    brought the subject of the artificial lakes at Canberra under my notice about a week ago. I then recommended him to follow the ordinary procedure for obtaining the discussion of matters of importance, and I now repeat that advice.  His  proper course is to give notice of a motion. If he does so, it will become necessary to consider whether an opportunity can be afforded for its discussion.
