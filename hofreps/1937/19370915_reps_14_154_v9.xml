                        <para>- Cabinet has not yet considered this report, but I personally have read it. It is most voluminous. Further information is required from the Tariff Board for the elucidation of various points in the report, and a memorandum has been sent to the board asking that it be supplied. When received, Cabinet will consider the report at its earliest convenience. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot give the exact details as to the basis that is observed but it is in accordance with the law. Revaluations for rating purposes are made each year, but they do not involve rentals. I assure the honorable gentleman that, on the whole, the reductions have exceeded the increases, particularly in districts in which the people are less able to pay - for example in an area such as Ainslie. </para>

In fact, in Adelaide at the moment there is a considerable scarcity of both Australian and imported timber. From several firms in Adelaide, I have received to-day telegrams on the subject passed on to me by honorable members representing constituencies in South Australia. Prior to the entry of the honorable member intothis House, the Government raised the duties on Oregon logs. This proved most effective in the direction of increasing the volume of work in Australian mills. The files in the Department of Trade and Customs contain correspondence from the Hardwood Millers&#39; Association of Victoria, expressing approval of that action of the Government, and stating that it had accelerated work in all the Australian mills. If the honorable member can prove to me that there is one mill that is slack, I shall be very greatly surprised. </para>

                            <para>- The public, of course, including the wheat-growers; that is, through merchants, British iron imported into Australia to-day is dearer than Australian galvanized iron; consequently, although it may be imported free of duty, merchants are not purchasing it, and therefore the shortage of supplies persists. The local manufacturing establishments have, however, been considerably extended, . and it is hoped that the requirements of the public will quickly be overhauled. The demand, of course, has been very considerably accelerated by reason of the extensive building operations that have been conducted during the last five years. </para>

                        <para>The Commonwealth architect, who has been in consultation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bearup</inline> of the commission&#39;s staff, and officers of the Postmaster-General&#39;s technical staff, is preparing sketch plans of the proposed new Sydney building. </para>
                        <para>These plans, with estimates, will be submitted to the commission at its meeting in the first week of October. Naturally, some months will elapse between the commission&#39;s inspection of the sketch plans and the actual commencement of building operations, and it may well be two years or more from now before the building is completed. It is proposed to start on the plans for the Melbourne building as soon as the construction of the Sydney building has begun, so that building operations will proceed simultaneously in both cities, though the Melbourne building may not be completed until some months after Sydney. </para>
                        <para>Regarding the other States, the commission has not yet decided whether it will proceed with the building in Hobart before Adelaide, Brisbane or Perth. In any case, it is not likely that the building in one or other of these capital cities will be started until the Melbourne and Sydney buildings are at least nearing completion. In view of this, there is no urgent need for the commission to decide immediately what the order of construction will he. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - The question of maintaining British liner shipping on the route between Canada, New Zealand and Australia was discussed during the Imperial Conference by representatives of the governments concerned - the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - and these discussions have since been continued. As a result, the Commonwealth Government has decided that, subject to a satisfactory agreement being reached with the shipping company concerned as to terms and extent of assistance, the Government is prepared to recommend to Parliament that it join with the other governments in a scheme for co-operation in financial measures to enable two new liners to be built for the service. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>As at present contemplated, these measures would take the form of a government guarantee of a loan to be raised by the shipping company for the purpose of constructing the vessels. The terms of the proposed financial assistance have been incorporated in a draft agreement with which the Commonwealth Government is in accord. This has been fully discussed with the company, but there are still points outstanding and, consequently, it is not possible to introduce legislation this session. </para>

                        <para>- The position in regard to this matter has been explained already in this House both by the Prime Minister and by myself. The Government is in favour of the decentralization of munition works, and is prepared in connexion with any new works to endeavour to give effect to that policy; but it is not prepared to construct new works where an annex or an addition to existing works can be economically carried out to effect what is required. Consequently, there is no provision at the moment for any works in the other States regarding munitions generally, although the position is being explored to see if some work connected with the department can be done in States other than those in which munitions work is already being carried on. </para>

                    <para>- No; but I discussed the subject with the Director-General of Health last week, and he gave me some interesting information. He has himself made an investigation into the effect on the lungs of the workers of dust arising as the result of the bulk-handling of wheat, and has formed the opinion that it is not dissimilar to that of silicosis. The matter has been referred to the Research Council. It will not be overlooked&#39;, for I am personally interested in it. </para>

                            <para>- A full statement on the subject is being furnished to the Premier of Tasmania, in which it is being pointed out that special stamps are issued only in connexion with big national events. The departure from this rule at the time the telephone cable was laid between the mainland and Tasmania, when a special stamp was issued, was for the purpose of informing the world that Tasmania was now connected with the mainland by telephone cable. That was a very special case. The Postmaster-General&#39;s Department feels that it would not be advisable to issue a special stamp in connexion with the Royal Hobart Centenary Regatta. The proposal that an advertisement of the event should be authorized on envelopes is being considered. </para>

                    <para>The object of this bill is to overcome the hardship suffered by certain officers of the Commonwealth Public Service by reason of their service with the Development and Migration Commission. The Development and Migration Act 1926, made provision for the preservation of the existing and. accruing rights of Commonwealth and State public servants appointed to the staff of the commission, but did not specify what those rights were. In 1928, the Officers&#39; Rights Declaration Act was passed specifying the rights preserved to Commonwealth officers appointed to the staff of the commission, but no action was taken to specify the rights of State officers appointed to it. This bill indicates the rights which it. was intended to preserve to State officers under the Development and Migration Act. </para>
                    <para>Under the Commonwealth Public Service Act, an officer of the State Public Service who transfers to the Commonwealth Public Service is entitled to have the period of his employment by the State counted for the purposes of computing sick leave and furlough, provided,  of course, that his service with the State and the Commonwealth is continuous. </para>
                    <para>In the case of certain officers whose service with a State, with the Development and Migration Commission, and subsequently with the Commonwealth Public Service has been continuous, the period during which they were on the staff of the commission represents, under the law as it now stands, a break in such continuity. This means that for purposes of sick leave and furlough, the service of these officers is regarded as having commenced only from the date of their appointment to the Commonwealth Public Service after the abolition of the Development and Migration Commission. </para>

Consequently, it has been found necessary to amend the Wine Grapes Charges Act 1929, by substituting the words &#34; Australian Wine Board &#34; for the words &#34; Wine Overseas Marketing Board &#34; wherever they occur.

                    <para>The purpose of this bill is to give control over the importation and exportation of that group of medical remedies which are designated in the bill as therapeutic substances. They are to be distinguished from drugs in that they are biological products. Perhaps the two most familiar examples of these substances are diphtheria anti-toxin, which is an example of a substance prepared by bacterial action, and insulin, which is an example of a substance prepared from animal glands. The object of the bill is to ensure that these substances shall be of the right strength and purity, because it is recognized that they are very potent, and would be capable of working great havoc in the community if they were defective in quality. The bill, therefore, proposes to ensure that they shall comply with the following basic requirements :  - </para>

                    <para>The standard adopted is that fixed by  the League of Nations. It is international in its acceptation, and is recognized everywhere the League of Nations is recognized. The bill applies only to importations and exportations ; it does not apply to serum anti-toxin and vaccines manufactured at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, which are covered by laws and regulations designed to ensure their absolute purity, and compliance with standard&#39; requirements. </para>
                    <para>The bill provides simple machinery giving the Minister power to licence importers so as to give official supervision over the channels of importation, and to supervise the preparation of these substances for export. Every container of these substances must state clearly what it contains, the biological formula for its manufacture, and the standard dose, together with a statement that the contents are free from contamination, and comply with thestandard laid down and recognized. The subject could be amplified at great length, but it is sufficient to say that, in effect, this is a bill which extends that kind of protection which is afforded by the Pure Foods Act to foods, and the Pure Drugs Act to drugs, to those biological preparations which are so extensively used to-day, and upon the purity of which the health and lives of our citizens depend. </para>

                    <para>As honorable members will have seen from the report of the committee, the proposed new Standing Orders relating to the election of a Speaker and Chairman are designed to prevent the occurrence of a stalemate by the introduction of a method of voting by ballot in the event of a contest.  I  remember, as also, no doubt, does the honorable member for Bourke, the rather farcical situation that arose in the Parliament of Victoria when it became practically impossible to elect a  Speaker  under the old rule. The difficulty had to be overcome on that occasion by members agreeing to withdraw from the chamber, and to hold a meeting of all parties in order to determine by secret ballot what candidate they would support. The new rules suggested by the committee seem to be admirably fashioned to prevent the occurrence of difficulties of that kind. While they provide for nominations on the floor of the House, and for the election of a  Speaker  and  Chairman  in that way if there is only one candidate for each office, they also provide for the election by ballot in the event of a contest. This allows an immediate result to be achieved, and is more in keeping with the dignity of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to repeat what I have already said to the effect that, in regard to the business of this Parliament, it is customary, if it is not at least a matter of  ordinary courtesy, for the Opposition to be advised of the business the Government proposes to call on. Last week we complained about the long list of bills that was being continually tabled, and were anxious to know just what business the Government proposed to finalize. Subsequently, the Leader of our party informed my colleagues and myself in the party room of what the Government&#39;s intentions were, and we proceeded then to adjust our arrangements to meet the business that he indicated. This particular business was not included among the list he gave. </para>

I took that step with the object of safeguarding my position, because I realized that when the committee&#39;s report was submitted to Parliament I would find in it many suggested alterations of which I did not approve. As the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> is now present in the chamber I wish to know if he approves of this business being brought on at this hour. The  Deputy  Leader of the Op position <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> was notified of this measure only this afternoon, and he has not had time to inform any honorable members on this side of the intentions of the Government. I suggest that it is unfair to ask the House to decide this matter now. In order that I shall have an opportunity to inform myself and my colleagues of the recommendations contained in this report, I shall be obliged to read it over now. I take it that the motion before the House deals with Chapter III., which is headed &#34; Election of  Speaker  and  Chairman  &#34;. That chapter reads - </para>

                            <para>- Ever since this Parliament was established certain provisions have governed discussions on the occasion of the election of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> Those provisions gave honorable members an opportunity to offer criticism to men who hold high positions in this country and who, we believe, had, in the period since the election of the previous  Speaker,  taken advantage of their positions to apply decisions and cause injustice to many sections of the community, whereas in the ordinary course of. Parliamentary affairs we were unable to bring such matter*) under notice. Therefore, I shall never cast a vote to allow that privilege to be taken away from honorable members. Irrespective of whether the Standing Orders Committee recommendsit or not I do not agree with proposed paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of Standing Order No. 11 because I remember the occasion on which this matter was first brought up before the committee.I was not present at subsequent meetings of the committee when it reached its final decision on this matter. When it was first raised before the committee, however, I noted it carefully and intended, when the opportunity arose for its discussion in this Parliament, to do all in my power to see that the committee&#39;s recommendation was not adopted. 1&#34; ask my colleagues to take notice of the real change which is being effected by this recommendation. The full import of that change was not suggested, or referred to, by the Attorney-General when he moved that the alteration be made. He just went on to referto something that had happened in the Victorian Parliament - something of which honorable members know nothing, and which has no particular reference to this matter at all.

                            <para>- I am not regarding the honorable member&#39;s statement in that light. At the same time, the public would regard the proceedings as strange if the sitting were suspended to enable a determination to be reached in connexion with the most important position that this House has to fill. I want to know what reasons are advanced for the suspension of the sitting for 30 minutes. The proposed Standing Order provides that when the House re-assembles the votes shall be taken again, unless this is rendered unnecessary by a withdrawal. That does not place the position in a very favorable light. I am certain that if a candidate for election as  Speaker  returned to the chamber after the sitting had been suspended for 30 minutes, and withdrew his nomination, a certain degree of suspicion would attach to his withdrawal.

                        <para>Whenever at any stage a withdrawal leaves only one candidate remaining, he shall without further voting, be declared elected as  Speaker,  and shall then be conducted to the Chair. </para>

                    <para>I should have thought that the next paragraph would have provided, in the case of continued equality of votes, for a further suspension of the sitting for 30 minutes, but there is no such provision. Therefore, it could happen, as the result of the adoption of this suggested new procedure, that equality of votes would continue. After all the procedure contained in this recommendation, with &#39;the suspension of the sitting thrown in, it is quite possible and competent for honorable members to be just as equally divided in their votes after the resumption of the sitting as they were before it. What would happen then? Apparently there is no answer to that question. </para>

                        <para>.- The whole of the draft Standing Orders was the work of a committee which represented all parties in this House and included three party leaders, two former Speakers, the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin),</inline> and our late lamented friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom, the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> who was a leader, and myself. I think I was appointed because of some experience I have had in the matter of Standing Orders. The Standing Orders were considered very elaborately at a great number of meetings and the one now before the House gave the committee considerable trouble. In my opinion, as proposed, it is a very good standing order, and one that the House should adopt. So strongly did I feel on this point that I went, as I believe others did, to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> and asked that he should bring the matter before the House before it rose. This will be the last meeting of this Parliament and, if the Standing Order is to be of any value in the election of the new  Speaker  in the next Parliament, it is necessary that it should be passed now. I am not able to speak for the honorable member for Hindmarsh or for the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> who are absent, but I believe that I was not the only member of the Standing Orders Committee from this side of the House who approached the Prime Minister upon this matter. The House realizes of course, that we have had no complete revision of the Standing Orders since first we provisionally adopted Standing Orders in 1903. All attempts at a complete revision have been fruitless. It is realized - I realize at any rate - that the whole of the proposed new Standing Orders are not likely to be speedily passed by this Parliament, but I do think, from my own experience in this House and elsewhere, that it would be excellent to adopt this Standing Order, which provides for the election of the  Speaker.  I regret that it has come to us late, but I understand the matter was mentioned last week. I was told this morning by a member of my own party that this business would come on to-day. </para>

                            <para>- The position at present is that the  Speaker  is elected by a House of  74  members. He is elected with the  Clerk  in the chair who is not a member of the House and has no casting vote. It is perfectly possible for a tie to result. In the opinion of the committee, the best possible means of settling that issue&#39; is that now proposed. Only the </para>

                        has a casting vote under our Constitution. The situation foreseen by the honorable member for West Sydney
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline>
                        might arise in an open election in. the House.
                    </para>
                    <para>When this subject was under the consideration of the committee two defects in the present system were . apparent - a major and a minor defect. The major defect is that the  Speaker  is a government nominee. The choice of the Government becomes the choice of the House, and the  Speaker  is chosen on a party division. If a secret ballot were necessary, the  Speaker  would become, in a very real sense, the choice of the House.  The minor difficulty is that the officer in charge of the proceedings at the election of the  Speaker,  being an officer of the House, is not a member of the Parliament, and is not, in the nature of things, entitled to demand from honorable members the same respect as would be required by a presiding officer who is the choice of the House. In this Parliament, and also in another Parliament, I have seen the  Clerk  of the House put in a most unfortunate position in connexion with the election of  Speaker.  The former  Clerk  of this House was put in the unhappy position of having to accept a motion that an honorable member be no longer heard. </para>
                    <para>The proposal now submitted by the Standing Orders Committee would obviate both &#39; difficulties. A secret ballot would ensure that the choice of the presiding officer would really be the choice of the House. The  Clerk  of the House could not, of course, be given a casting vote. No provision is made in the Constitution for _ such a situation ; nor is there any pro.vision for  lot3  to be drawn. The Standing Orders Committee was of the opinion that, in the event of a position of equality persisting after the second ballot honorable members should be given an opportunity to think about the subject before a further ballot was taken, and in a different atmosphere. It was for that reason that the suspension of the sitting was recommended. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for West Sydney should realize that both the honorable member for Hindmarsh, a member of his own party, and an ex-Speaker of the House, and the  late honorable, member for Darling Downs, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom, also an exSpeaker, approved of this proposal. I believe that all honorable gentlemen would approve of it if they would approach it dispassionately and on its merits. Unless &#39;this proposal i3 adopted now wc shall probably find ourselves at the inception of the sitting of the next. Parliament in a similar position to that which faced us at the inception of the sitting of this Parliament. I suggest, with respect, as a comparative tyro in the House, that such a situation does not become the dignity of the House; nor does * it tend to increase the esteem in which Parliament is held by the people. It is not calculated, either, to cause the public, or even honorable members, to believe that the  Speaker  is actually selected for his personal capacity, and not merely because he is a government nominee. I arn sure that any  Speaker  would be happy to feel that he had been really selected by the members of the House, and was not beholden in any way for his position to the party in power, in which case, a weak man might show a tendency to lean, towards the Government party. We have had ample evidence, of course, that you, sir, have discharged the duties of your high office with absolute impartiality and very high ability indeed. I have felt pleased and proud to sit under your chairmanship in this House. A weaker man might <inline font-style="italic">have</inline> felt obligations to the Government, and might have been disposed to defer to the wishes of the Government, with the result that government supporters might have enjoyed privileges not accorded to honorable members of the Opposition. We should avoid any situation of that description. </para>
                    <para>The object of the Standing Orders Committee was to provide, within the limits of the Constitution, for such a&#39;persistent e.ase of equality as might easily arise with this Parliament constituted as it, is at present, for 37 honorable members might vote on either side. &#39;In such a case, the only possible means of reaching a decision would be by the common sense of honorable members. I, myself, favour a. secret ballot for the election of Speaker for the same reason that I favour a secret ballot for the election of candidates for  Parlia-  ment, so that a man may, without fear, favour, or affection, feel free to cast his vote for the best man available. The merit of the. proposal now before the House is that it achieves that end. </para>
                    <para>This is an urgent matter. If .this proposal is adopted now it will- enable the new procedure to be applied at the opening of the new parliament. I am sorry that suggestions of bad faith have been made in this matter. </para>

                            <para>- The bills referred to by the Minister were introduced and, with the assistance of the Opposition, were speedily passed. 1 am not a member of the Standing Orders Committee and I confess that I have not read the rather voluminous report which I understand was distributed to honorable members some time ago. 1 should like to know how many honorable members find time to read all the reports put into their boxes. Sometimes half-a-dozen reports are submitted in one day. As the Standing Orders Committee was not unanimous on this point I urge that honorable members be given an opportunity to debate the question. It would not be wise for the Prime Minister to rush this business through in the dying hours of the Parliament. Had this business been put on the notice-paper for a particular time, honorable members would have had an opportunity to consider it and might have been prepared to diffusa it. At any rate they would have had a. chance to peruse the report. Further, the report could have been considered at special meetings of the parties. Honorable members might suggest that this is not a subject for party consideration, but surely the provisions of the Standing Orders are of vital consequence not only to members of the Labour party but also to the members of other parties in the House. I urge the Prime Minister to agree to the postponement of the consideration of this report which, I find, contains 41 printed pages. I doubt whether it has been read by more than three or four members of the House, and it should not he expected that the House would accept it without comment&#39; in the dying hours of the Parliament. I am as industrious as any other member of the House, and I have not had time to read the report. There is just cause for asking the Prime Minister to agree to a postponement, of the consideration of the report until such time as honorable members have had adequate opportunity to consider it. </para>

Now that the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> has spoken, I am free to refer to this matter. He approached me because lie realized how stupid Parliament might be made to appear iu the eyes of the people of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- No. but he must have realized it as the result of what occurred on the last occasion when a  Speaker  was elected. In order, therefore, that such an occurrence might be avoided in the future, and being desirous of maintaining the dignity of Parliament he, as a former  Speaker  of the Parliament of Victoria, recommended that some better system be introduced. This had nothing whatever to do with the party. He suggested that if the House could not pass all the recommendations of the committee, it might at least make provision for the election of a  Speaker  for the next Parliament on proper and &#39;dignified lines. I accepted that suggestion, I discussed it with my colleagues, and mentioned it to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> who is now absent. I want to be fair. to him: he did not commit himself to any particular line of action. </para>

                <para>The negotiations regarding the British air mail service and Qantas agreements have been proceeded with but, as is usual where negotiations have to be conducted by telegram, there have been delays. For these delays the Commonwealth has not been responsible. Both agreements are nearing the final stage, outstanding matters having been reduced to comparatively minor details. They will be submitted to Parliament at the first opportunity after their completion. </para>
                <para>We have now reached the end of the proceedings of the present Parliament. I take this opportunity to offer to you first, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> my deep thanks for and my appreciation of the manner in which you have presided over our deliberations during the last three years. To-day a very high compliment was paid to you by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn),</inline> who in another sphere occupied the position that you occupy in this sphere, when he said that it was an honour and a privilege to him to sit and serve under you. You have brought to the discharge of your duties not only ability but also impartiality. The recent disagreement between you and me emphasized the impartiality of your decisions. You have not recognized party, but have done your utmost to uphold the dignity of this Parliament. Therefore, I am confident that I speak on behalf of all honorable members when I thank you very sincerely for all that you have done. Whatever limitations may be imposed upon my later remarks, both personal and political, I am in a position to wish you, at any rate, well. </para>
                <para>The. sentiments that I have expressed in regard to you, I extend also to the  Chairman  of Committees <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse).</inline></para>
                <para>We all owe a deep debt of gratitude to the officers of Parliament for the assistance that they have rendered to us. The </para>
                <para class="block">Clerk of the House was recently promoted to that position. On behalf of members generally, I express appreciation of  his  ability and impartiality, and thank him for his assistance. I have been associated with the present Clerk of the House throughout my political&#39; career whether in the State or in the Commonwealth Parliament. I was associated with him back in the days when he was Clerk Assistant in the smaller Tasmanian Parliament, and during all these years his work has been marked by efficiency and impartiality. I take this opportunity to congratulate him on his recent appointment and to wish him long years of success. To those associated with him and to all other members of the staff of this House, whether their spheres of duty are inside or outside the chamber, I offer my thanks and appreciation. Politicians are very much indebted to them for the assistance that they give. Furthermore, I may be permitted to say at this juncture, because as we approach the general elections the close of these proceedings is different from the normal conclusion of sittings, that I extend my thanks to the whole of the Public Service of the Commonwealth of Australia. </para>
                <para>When the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> was leaving this Parliament a week ago to embark upon the election campaign, I expressed my sentiments towards him. We all have the greatest respect for the Leader of the Opposition. Although he is a political opponent, we regard him as being a personal friend, and wish him well personally, although not politically. </para>
                <para>This has been a strenuous Parliament. We have had to face difficult problems and, at times, party political feeling has run fairly high, but at the close of it we are in a position to say that whatever views we have of the politics of, our opponents, we have a high personal regard for them. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> at the close of this Parliament, I want to thank all, you <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the  Chairman  of Committees, officials, members of the Opposition and, particularly, the officers of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> who, with great efficiency, embellish and polish our speeches so that they look worth while for us to present in our constituencies. I pay that particular tribute to the <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> staff because they have been of very great help to honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- The Whips have been wonderful, each to his own particular party. As far as I know there has been nothing more efficient than the mathematical performances of the Whips, because, in divisions, they have been able to count and add up correctly. Therefore, to the Whips 1 offer thanks on behalf of the Government and honorable members on this side. I have no more to say except to express the hope that just as the electors are represented in this Parliament at this moment, they will again be represented after the elections. </para>

                    <para>.- In the unavoidable absence of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> I wish to express the appreciation of the Opposition at the very fair and impartial manner in which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have carried out your duties to this House. The success of parliamentary institutions depends on the conduct of the business in Parliament, and that in turn depends to a great extent on the personal attributes of the presiding officers. We realize, as an Opposition, that your position is onerous and that your duties at times are irksome. When feeling runs high in debate it is often extremely difficult to maintain order, but we believe, as an Opposition, that you have always endeavoured, to the very best of your ability, to act impartially. You have done credit to yourself and to the exalted position which you occupy. </para>

                <para>Although the  Chairman  of Committees and I disagree violently on tariff questions, I am glad to say he has done his work as  chairman  ably and well, and has endeavoured to sec members of the Opposition- as frequently as members on the Government side of the House. </para>
                <para>It would be extremely difficult for you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and for the  Chairman  of Committees, to discharge your duties in Parliament without the able services of the  Clerk  of the Parliament, the Assistant Clerks, the Serjeant-at-Arms, and other members of the staff. In paying tribute to the ability of the present  Clerk  I extend to him our very hearty congratulations upon the attainment of his high position. I also wish to offer a meed of praise to his predecessor in office, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkes,</inline> who, having reached the retiring age during the life of this Parliament, has laid down his duties. We were all deeply indebted to him for his assistance in our work. The smooth-running of the machinery of Parliament depends to a. great extent on the courtesy, ability and efficiency of the Clerks. </para>

It is really remarkable that in all the confusion that sometimes occurs in Parliament, with cross-firing and interjections, they are able to compile such intelligent reports of our speeches for us to read the next day. We are particularly fortunate in this Parliament, also, in having such a courteous and capable staff of attendants. Frequently four or five signals must appear at a time in the attendants&#39; alcove, and I have been amazed at the speed, accuracy and unfailing courtesy of the attendants in replying to the calls made upon them. They seem to be able to produce, with the utmost promptness, anything that honorable members may desire, except suitable missiles to cast at an opponent. </para>

The Labour party faces the elections with a feeling of confidence. We hope that when. Parliament re-assembles we shall be sitting on the other side of the House and honorable gentlemen opposite will be on this side of it, in which event we trust they will be able to extend the co-operation that is expected  of a reasonable opposition in order to assist an enlightened government to put its proposed legislation on the statute book. </para>

                    <para>. -  I promised the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> some time ago that I would obtain for him information regarding the recent conference of millet-growers. A meeting representative of broom millet growers in New South Wales, Victoria and &#39;Queensland, the broom manufacturers in New South Wales, the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Commerce, was held at the office of the Department of Commerce &#34;in Sydney, to-day. Questions affecting the disposal of existing stocks, and proposals for dealing with future el&#39;ops, were discussed. Arising out of the discussion it was resolved that an Australian Broom Millet Advisory Committee, consisting of not more chan two growers, and not more than two manufacturers from each State, should be formed, with an independent  chairman  nominated by the Department of Commerce. The purpose of the committee will be immediately to gather all available information regarding present stocks and crop prospects for the coming season. It will then meet again with the object of determining reasonable prices for millet, having regard to the estimated quantity available, manufacturers&#39; requirements and market prospects. Some concern was expressed by delegates regarding the possibility of a surplus of broom millet being carried over into 193S. It was therefore decided that ali available information about the present position and future prospects .should be circulated by the Department of Commerce to growers&#39; organizations as soon as possible for the guidance of growers in planning their sowing programme for the coming season. </para>

                    <para>. - Yesterday the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> asked for particulars regarding the operation of the act in which &#163;100,000 was voted for interest and sinking f-nd in connexion with funds made available to local bodies for public works. Honorable members will recall that the Commonwealth Government was anxious to assist in making provision for the unemployed in the States. There were two methods, and only two, by which this could be done. One was a grant to the States from revenue, and the other was to allocate loan moneys to the States. It soon became apparent that both methods were becoming increasingly difficult, because the Commonwealth Government did not have any appreciable amount of surplus revenue from which to make grants, and the making of loan moneys available was a dubious advantage, because all loan moneys come out of the same pool, and the more loan moneys made available by the Commonwealth, the less is available for the States. A scheme was therefore devised under which the Commonwealth Government set aside from revenue &#163;100.000 a year for ten years, for use by local bodies in the States on condition that the States set aside a similar amount. This scheme, under which &#163;200,000 a year was made available, came into operation a year ago, and has proved, in practice, very satisfactory. The value of the works thus assisted amounts to &#163;9,250,000. The money was distributed strictly on a population basis, and the States, almost without exception, have acted up to the spirit and letter of the Commonwealth Government&#39;s intention. As a complete list of the works approved, most of which have already been set in motion by the various States, would be too long to insert in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I have arranged to place fifty or sixty copies of the list on the table of the library, where they may be perused by honorable members. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> a complaint by members of the Coachmakers Federation that motor bodies which were formerly made in Australia are now being imported in the form of panels which have only to be assembled. It is claimed by the union that this practice has deprived some of its members of employment and threatens the employment of a great many others. I have been asked to bring this state of affairs to the notice of the Minister, and I now ask him to investigate it. </para>

I am advised&#39; that the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department has been dealing with this matter, but difficulty is being experienced in getting into line other interests concerned. Every endeavour is being made to bring the matter to finality. </para>

                    <para>. - About three quarters of an hour ago I received a file which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> promised would be made available to me. It deals with the search for oil in New Guinea, and the reports obtained from the Administrator of the Mandated Territory. The file is a bulky one, and as it will be impossible for me to complete my examination of it before the train departs to-night, I should be glad if the Prime Minister would agree to my taking a portion of it away with me, so that I might finish my investigation. The facts which I have already gleaned are most informative and important, and will be of great interest to the public. </para>

                    <para>. -  I noticed in the press a statement by one of the trade unions that motor bodies had been admitted in a knocked down condition, ready for assembly, but I have had no official complaint. The records show that strong pressure is being exercised to allow panels from which steel bodies are built to be admitted under by-law, but this request has been resisted up to the present time, although the agents for some of the smaller motor cars claim that the poundage basis on which panels are admitted makes them too expensive if assembled in Australia. If the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn)</inline> has information which shows that Australian workmen are being deprived of employment, I shall have the matter investigated, and I shall inform him of the position later by letter, but I doubt whether there has been any loss of employment because the number of employees now engaged in the industry is over 12,000 and is increasing. </para>

I desire to add an expression of my appreciation of the services rendered by the members of the press gallery. These gentlemen have become, through the years, the personal friends of all of us. They render a great service to the community by the faithful reports which they supply of the proceedings of this Parliament. I am sure that members of the Opposition join in this expression of appreciation. </para>

                <para>To-day I offered to allow the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> access to the file relating to the search for oil in Dutch New Guinea and in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. I am afraid, however, that I cannot accede to his request that I should allow the whole or any portion of the file to leave Canberra, because, so far as I know, no precedent exists for such a course. The -honorable member may take advantage of any opportunity available to him to peruse the file in Canberra; but I think that he, having had ministerial experience, will agree that it would be improper for me to do as he suggests. The general practice is to table such documents either in. the House or in the Parliamentary Library, where they are available to honorable members and also the press. But this file was made available only to the honorable member. </para>

                    for their expressions of appreciation of my services in the chair ; I hope that I deserve all that they have said of me. The  Chairman  of Committees and the Temporary Chairmen of Committees will, I know, allow me to acknowledge, on their behalf, the praise that has been bestowed on their work. I am grateful for the courtesy that has been extended to me by Ministers and by honorable members generally, and the assistance they have rendered me in carrying out my duties. Without their co-operation I could not have discharged those duties satisfactorily. I have done my best, but I would not be human had I always been right, and honorable members would not be human had they thought that I was always right. If I have given satisfaction to Ministers and to honorable members, I, too, am satisfied. The officers of the House and the members of the various staffs have carried out their duties with exceptional ability, and I thank them for their uniform courtesy and helpfulness. While in the chair I have known no politics; but within the next&#34; few weeks my interest in party politics will be revived. All of us may not be here when the House reassembles, but whether we are or not, I wish well to all honorable members. I shall always feel proud of having had the privilege of presiding over the deliberations of this chamber.

The Premier states that his Government is opposed to the measure.

                        <para>s. - On the 10th September, the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blain)</inline> asked the Minister for the Interior a question, <inline font-style="italic">without notice,</inline> in regard to the work which is being carried out by the aerial, geological and geophysical survey of Northern Australia at Tennant Creek. I am now in a position to inform the honorable member that full information regarding the work of the survey is contained in its reports, which are. furnished at half-yearly intervals and are tabled in Parliament. Reports for the periods ended the 30th June and 31st December, 1935, and the 30th June and 31st December, 1936, have already been tabled. The attention of the honorable member is particularly invited to the last-named report, which was tabled on the 29th June, 1937. Altogether 30 geophysical anomalies have been located by the survey at Tennant Creek and six test bores have been put down on these anomalies. The result.3 of assays received to date show values ranging from traces to 17 dwt. 21 grains of gold. The depths of the bores range from 170 feet to 452 feet. The question of sinking shafts further to test these anomalies will receive consideration when the final results of the survey are available. Copies of the reports of the survey may be had on application to the Director of Mines, Darwin, or the secretary of the survey, c/o Prime Minister&#39;s Department, Canberra. </para>
