                        <para>- As honorable members know, certain negotiations took place some months ago. It was then decided that the interests concerned in the area should meet to consider whether a trust or a corporate body of that nature should establish an airport at Fishermen&#39;s Bend. I have not learned what took place during my absence from Australia, but I gather that the matter has not been very far advanced within recent months. I shall, however, make further inquiries, and advise the honorable member. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to say, in the first place, that the airmen of the Commonwealth are drawn from all classes of society. This matter was given consideration, and the view held so far is that it is advisable that the training of airmen should be done through the air force, as is the case in Great Britain, as that practice, because of the excellent training they receive, gives short commissioned pilots an opportunity later to obtain employment in the civil aviation services. It is for that reason that, up to the present, no encouragement has been given to the proposition that  the  Government should subsidize private colleges for the training of pilots. The matter is, however, receiving further consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Is the Minister representing the Postmaster-General aware that postal inspectors have gone through the Newcastle area and prosecuted many unemployed who are using wireless receiving sets without having a licence to do so ? Does the honorable gentleman know that these inspectors are now proceeding through the distressed areas of the coalfields with the object of prosecuting those who had receiving sets installed prior to becoming unemployed, but are now unable to pay the licence-fee? Will the honorable gentleman -withdraw any pending prosecutions, and give sympathetic consideration to the reduction of the licence-fee in the case of those who are unemployed ? </para>

                        <para>Naturally, I am unaware of the circumstances which the honorable member says exist. I would only say that in the ordinary conduct of the business of the Postal Department, supervision is exercised to ascertain who pays the licence-fee and who does not. I assure ibo House that no discrimination whatever is shown in the making of these inquiries. I can say quite emphatically that these inspectors have not been asked to go through the coal-fields, or specially to prosecute unemployed persons. I shall, however, bring the matter to the notice of the Postmaster-General.

                        <para>. - It affords the Government a great deal of satisfaction that, in this year in which it has to render its account to the people of the Commonwealth, it can call attention to a. higher level of material prosperity than has been experienced since the onset of the depression. Indeed it can be said that the present level of prosperity is higher than it has ever been in the previous history of this country. This is a statement of which there is no lack of proof of a convincing character. No matter where we look we find a continuous record of achievement and improvement in the economic sphere. Production has reached peak after peak, prices have improved, unemployment has diminished, real wages are higher, savings bank deposits have reached record levels, and the overseas trade position has shown a remarkable improvement. Conditions in the sphere of private finance are equally satisfactory. Monetary conditions are easy, and the Government&#39;s policy has assisted in restraining any unhealthy tendency towards increasing interest rates. The position of the banks is sound, and ample credit facilities are available for creditworthy borrowers. </para>

                    <para>Internal Recovery : Employment</para>
                <para>From the social point of view the most important measure of improvement is the unemployment situation. The bestsingle index available over the whole period is the unemployment percentages reported by the trade unions to the Commonwealth Statistician. These figures reached their peak of 30 per cent. in the second quarter of 1932, shortly after the Government took office. </para>
                <para>As honorable members are aware, unemployment has consistently and regularly declined, quarter by quarter, since that time, until to-day the percentage is 9.7. Indeed, there is good reason to believe that the improvement has been even greater than these figures indicate. A more complete measure available for New South Wales shows that only 6.5 per cent. of all dependent on and available for employment were unemployed in June, 1937, compared with 26.5 per cent. in </para>
                <para class="block">June, 1933. If the full-time equivalent of part-time relief work is included a3  employment  the present percentage is still further reduced to 5.3 per cent. A similar figure for men wage-earners in Queensland, based partly on statistics available from the unemployment insurance scheme, is 5.7 per cent. </para>
                <para>Confirmation of the accuracy of .this analysis is afforded by the statistics of employment in factories. In 1928-29 there were 450,000 employed. The number fell to. 337,000 in 1931-32. It then increased steadily year by year until in 1936-37 there were approximately 518,000 persons employed full-time in Australian factories, a much larger number than has ever been recorded before in the history of the Commonwealth. Moreover, this is an average for the year and it is estimated that the number employed in June, 1937, was approximately 535,000. This represents a volume of factory employment of 19 per cent, above that of 1928-29. The increase since 1931-32 means that on the average no less than 36,000 persons have gone into full-time factory employment in. each of the intervening years. This is for factory employment alone. If employment throughout Australia be taken into account more than 500,000 persons have obtained full-time employment since 1931-32 - an average of nearly 95,000 per year. </para>
                    <para>Internal Recovery: Production</para>
                <para>Increased production has marched hand in hand with diminished unemployment. The value of our recorded material production rose from &#163;305,000,000 in 1931-32 to about &#163;432,000,000 in 1936-37. Allowing for lower price levels, the physical volume of production in the year just closed was far in excess of that of anypredepression peak year. </para>
                <para>Building and construction, which is not included in the above-mentioned production figures, has increased since the depths of the depression at an even more remarkable rate. Comparable records are available only for the six capital cities and their suburbs and certain country districts, but the allAustralia figures, which have been estimated by the Commonwealth Statistician, show an increase from slightly over &#163;8,000,000 in 1931-32 to the very high figure of &#163;43,000,000 in 1936-37. </para>
                <para>In the case of iron and steel output, the Australian production at the end of the last financial year was about double that of 1928-29. </para>
                    <para>External Recovery: Export Prices</para>
                <para>The relation of our internal prosperity to export prices and the volume of export production is too well-known to need emphasis. </para>
                <para>Dominating the situation in the year  just  ended was the high price of wool. Wool prices reached rock-bottom in 1931-32, the clip bringing only &#163;35,000,000. There have since been wide variations of the price of wool. In 1936-37, the average price was 16.48d. per lb., and the clip realized &#163;66,900,000 - not far from double the value of that of 1931-32. Present quotations are somewhat above this price. </para>
                <para>The wheat market also improved remarkably, largely on account of unfavorable crop conditions in oversea countries, which reduced world stocks to very low levels. Those concerned with wheat production will need no reminder of the disastrous consequences of the reduction of the price of wheat from about 4s. 8d. a bushel in 1928-29 to as low as 2s. 8d. in 1930-31. and its continued low level until well into 1935. The value of our wheat crop was &#163;38,300,000 in 1928-29. It fell to &#163;25,000,000 in 1930-31&#34; and to &#163;21,000,000 in 1934-35. In the year recently closed it brought &#163;39,200,000. </para>
                <para>Substantially increased prices have also been recorded in other important export commodities, notably in butter, meat and metals. </para>
                <para>There was an all-round increase of 20 per cent, in export prices in 1936-37 as compared even with the satisfactory level of 1935-36. It is sufficient to say in this connexion that a few months ago the average Australian currency price of all our exports touched the same level as the average for 1928. </para>
                    <para>External Recovery: Oversea Trade</para>
                <para>The total value of. our exports - including gold and silver - in 1936-37 was &#163;126,200,000 sterling. The value of our imports was &#163;90,500,000 sterling. Of the favorable balance of &#163;35,700,000 sterling a little over &#163;22,000,000 sterling was required for Government and local body interest, in addition to several millions of pounds for sinking fund remittances. </para>
                <para>After allowing for the net effect of other inward and outward payments, it is estimated that our total credits were sufficient to settle ail our oversea liabilities and add the substantial sum of something like &#163;20,000,000 sterling to our reserves of London funds. A corresponding improvement took place in the liquid reserves of the banking system. </para>
                <para>This result has been achieved in a year which opened with much criticism of the Government&#39;s financial and economic policy. If the critics had had their way, the Government would have undertaken unnecessary experiments in monetary policy which might have had serious consequences. </para>
                <para>While imports in the year recently ended were rather higher than in 1935-36, there has been little increase of imports of goods competitive with Australian production. Of the &#163;7,000,000 increase &#163;5,000,000 was in non-competitive lines, mainly raw materials, machinery and petrol. The increased employment in Australian factories, to which&#39; 1 have already referred, is sufficient evidence that Australian industry was in no way prejudiced. An analysis of our imports shows, indeed, that about 50 per cent, of our total imports are raw materials of industry, 14^ per cent, capital equipment for industry, and about 12 per cent, motor vehicles and parts and petrol. Only about 23-J per cent, consist of finished consumers&#39; goods, and a substantial proportion of these is of a kind not competitive with Australian industry. </para>
                <para>I can, therefore, conclude this brief review of the present economic position on an optimistic note. Employment and production expanded during last year - as indeed they have throughout the Government&#39;s term of office - at a satisfactory rate. The price disparities between primary and secondary products which were so marked in the depression years have been almost entirely removed, and export prices in particular are very favorable. London reserves have been greatly strengthened, and the banking system is comfortably liquid. </para>

                <para>Since the Lyons Government assumed office in December, 1931, the public debt of the Commonwealth, as distinct from that of the States, has been reduced by &#163;11.019,000. Particulars of the debt are as follow : - </para>

                    <para>London Conversions</para>
                <para>Between October, 1932, and June, 1936, all maturing and optional redeemable loans domiciled in London were converted at progressively improving rates of interest. These loans totalled &#163;198,000,000 and the annual amount of the savings in interest and exchange was approximately &#163;4,000,000. </para>
                <para>A further conversion of &#163;12,360,000 was arranged in June, 1937, resulting in an additional saving in respect of interest and exchange of &#163;46,000 per annum. The yield to the investor on the new loan issued in London in June last was &#163;3 16s. 2d. per cent. </para>

                    <para>Internal Loans</para>
                <para>During 1936-37, two loans of &#163;7,500,000 each were issued in the Australian market under the auspices of the Loan Council. The first issue in November, 1936, gave a yield to the investor of &#163;3 19s. 4d. per cent, per annum, whilst the yield from the second loan, issued in April, 1937, was &#163;3 19s. Id. per cent, per annum. </para>
                <para>Of the November, 1936, loan, &#163;2,000,000 was left in the hands of the underwriters. For some months afterwards interest yields from Commonwealth securities showed a rising tendency. This was slightly checked before the issue of the April loan, and in later months yields from our securities continued to fall. At the present time, the loan issued in April, 1937, at &#163;3 19s. Id. shows a return on the market of a little less than &#163;3 16s. </para>
                <para>The Loan Council has decided to limit its raisings for State and Commonwealth loan purposes for 1937-38 to &#163;16,000,000. The Commonwealth share of this amount will be &#163;2,500,000 all of which is to be used for grants to the States for farmers&#39; debt adjustment. </para>
                <para>On the 15th December, 1938, internal Australian consolidated stock and bonds totalling approximately &#163;72,700,000 will mature. The bulk of this loan now carries interest at 4 per cent., and the balance bears interest at 3 per cent. The conversion of this loan will be a task of considerable magnitude, and it is highly important that everything possible should he done to keep market conditions favorable for a successful conversion, on satisfactory terms. </para>

                <para>The accumulated deficit totalled &#163;17,216,000 on the 1st July, 1935, but reductions of &#163;213,000 and &#163;1,068,000 were effected in 1935-36 and 1936-37 respectively. The reduction now proposed will bring the total down to &#163;15,658,000. </para>

                    <para>Taxation</para>
                <para>The Government has given serious consideration to the subject of taxation in connexion with its financial proposals for 1 937-38. </para>
                <para>I wish to pass in review before honorable members the taxation record of this Government since it assumed office in December, 193.1. It is a record in which the Government takes some pride, not only for the extent and value of the reductions effected, but also for the manner in which the relief has been distributed among all members of the community. </para>
                <para>The reductions began in 1932-33, in w hich year a flat exemption of &#163;250 per annum of income from property was substituted for the sliding scale previously in operation under the special property tax. Land tax was reduced by331/3per cent. Sundry exemptions were granted from sales tax and from customs primage duties largely in relation to primary production. </para>
                <para>In 1933-34, very extensive reductions of taxation were made in the income tax field. The rate of the company tax was reduced from about1s. 5d. to1s. Taxation of life assurance companies was adjusted so that taxation was only charged on the excess income after allowing a deduction of 4 per cent. on the valuation of liabilities. The personal exertion rate was reduced by 15 per cent. The special tax on property was reduced from 10 per cent. to 6 per cent. The previous year&#39;s reduction of the land tax rate was increased from331/3 per cent. to 50 per cent. Entertainments tax was. abolished altogether. </para>
                <para class="block">The sales tax rate was reduced from 6 per cent. to 5 per cent. and sundry extensive exemptions were granted to primary industry, medicines, food, building material, &#38;c. Customs (British preferential) and excise duties were greatly eased both in general and, in particular, on the following: Primage duties were reduced from 10 per cent. to 5 per cent. and in some cases to 4 per cent., beer duties were reduced by 3d. per gallon; and the duties on tea were reduced by1d. per lb., and by the removal of the 10 per cent. primage. Customs and excise duties were substantially reduced on spirits and on benzol. </para>
                <para>In 1934-35, further exemptions were granted from the incidence of sales tax, again chiefly in respect of primary products, building material, and foodstuffs. Extensive reductions of and exemptions from primage duties were also granted. </para>
                <para>In1935-38, the special tax on property was reduced from 6 per cent. to 5 per cent., and further exemptions were made from sales tax and primage. Excise duties on Australian-grown tobacco were lowered. </para>
                <para>The budget for the year 1936-37 provided very extensive taxation reductions. In income taxation, the special tax on property was abolished, the personal exertion and property rates were lowered by 10 per cent., a &#163;50 deduction from income was granted in respect of a dependent wife or female relative. The rate of sales tax was reduced from 5 per cent. to 4 per cent., and a widespread range of further exemptions of necessaries of life was granted. Substantial primage exemptions were granted on certain articles of British manufacture. </para>
                <para>The taxation reductions of which I have spoken have been of great benefit to all sections of the community, and are positive evidence of the desire of the Government to keepthe taxation burden to a minimum. </para>
                <para>I think I can best convey to honorable members the effect of this series of reductions in the rates of taxation by saying that, if the sales tax had remained to-day at the same rate and on the same field as in 1.931-32, we should be collecting no less than &#163;18.000,000 from sales tax instead of the &#163;7,700,000 that we expect to collect this year. Similarly, in the  case of income tax, we should be collecting &#163;15,500,000 on the 1931-32 basis instead of &#163;9,000,000 as estimated this year, whilst land tax would be yielding &#163;3,000,000 instead of &#163;1,500,000. These three taxes combined would have been yielding &#163;36,500,000 at the 1931-32 rates, instead of the &#163;18,200,000 included in the budget for the current year. </para>
                <para>In other words, taking these three major fields of federal taxation into account, the Government has, in effect, halved the burden on the Australian people. </para>
                <para>In view of its formidable and inescapable increased obligations for the immediate future, the Government regrets that it is unable still further to reduce taxation in this financial year. </para>

This increase is accounted for in three ways : by the normal growth in the numbers of pensioners, by the cost of the additional shilling - an annual cost of about &#163;800,000 - and by the fact that, in this financial year, there happen to be 27 instead of the normal 26 fortnightly pension pay-days. </para>

                </para>
                <para>Honorable members will readily appreciate the great difficulty that faced the Government in setting out to make financial provision for defence expenditure of the high order of &#163;11,500,000, an amount greater by nearly &#163;3,500,000 than that expended last financial year. This problem was made more difficult by the necessity to make provision for substantially  increased expenditure over and above that of last year in several other directions, notably &#163;2,000,000 for invalid and old age pensions, &#163;700,000 for increased payments to the States for federal aid roads, &#163;830,000 for post office works, &#163;1,000,000 for rural debt adjustment, and &#163;200,000 for youth employment. </para>
                <para>It may be asked why the Government does not attempt to spread this largelyincreased provision for defence over a longer period of time than one financial year. The reason is that all the Government&#39;s proposals for increased defence expenditure are essential, and time is the essence of the contract. All the proposals have to be put in hand at the earliest possible moment. Defence expenditure is not translated into actual armaments overnight. Of necessity a considerable period of time must elapse between the voting of the money and the resultant increased strength of our fighting services. The Government is, therefore, convinced that the whole of its present programme should be undertaken now in the interests of the security of Australia. </para>
                <para>So far as defence expenditure is concerned, there are four sources of finance available - the budget, the defence equipment trust account, the civil aviation trust account, and the loan fund. </para>
                <para>As honorable members are aware, the Government has adopted the practice in past years of paying into the defence equipment trust account as much as possible of the excess of receipts over expenditure at the close of each financial year, and of drawing on this fund, which lias, of course, been created from budget revenue of past years, to assist the budget in respect of defence expenditure in subsequent years. The transactions in this connexion have been explained in detail in the last three budget speeches. The year 1936-37 closed with approximately &#163;3,000,000 to the credit of the defence trust accounts. We propose to expend or commit the whole of this sum in the current financial years towards making financial provision for defence. </para>
                <para>I have used the words &#34; expend or commit&#34; advisedly, as it is improbable that the whole of the Government&#39;s orders for defence equipment will fall due for payment in 1937-38, but, as the whole amount will be committed, I believe it is only right so to inform the Parliament and to make provision for its possible expenditure. </para>
                <para>We propose, in addition, to appropriate from the budget for this same purpose - a sum of &#163;6,000,000, which is the maximum amount that it is possible to carry on general revenue without increasing the existing rates of taxation, and having regard to the heavy additional charges that the budget has to carry in other directions. </para>
                <para>The sources of revenue that I have mentioned account for &#163;9,000,000 towards the &#163;11,500,000 for which financial provision has to be made. </para>
                <para>The Government proposes to find  the  remain ing &#163;2,500,000 for defence from loan. Bearing in mind the circumstances of the times, together with the fact that we are obliged to carry on the budget a considerable volume of what would normally be loan expenditure, the. Government believes that it is fully justified in making provision for &#163;2,500,000 of defence expenditure from loan. </para>
                <para>The circumstances that lead up to this decision are as follows : - </para>
                <para>As. honorable members will be aware, the loan council is endeavouring to limit its demands on the Australian money market to a total of &#163;16,000,000 for all governments in 1937-3S. The necessity for this largely arises out of the imminence of the loan conversion operation of &#163;72,700,000 that will fall due towards the end of 1938. Of this &#163;16,000,000, the Commonwealth Government will have only &#163;2,500,000, all of which it is necessary to allocate to rural debt relief. The Government is therefore obliged to carry on the budget a considerably greater volume of works and other items that would normally be expected to fall on the loan fund - indeed to an extent very considerably in excess of &#163;2,500,000. I shall give an analysis of these items at a later stage. </para>
                <para>In these circumstances, the Government feels that the carrying of &#163;2,500,000 of defence expenditure on loan instead of on the budget is justified. </para>
                <para>For the reasons that I have given, it is considered inadvisable at the present time to take this loan money from the Australian market. It is proposed, in the first place, to raise &#163;2,000,000 sterling, the equivalent of &#163;2,500,000 in Australian currency, on Commonwealth treasury-bills from the Commonwealth Bank in London, and at an appropriate time to fund these short-term securities from the proceeds of a public loan. </para>
                <para>Procedure on these lines has an added advantage in the fact that the Government will be faced with the necessity to meet financial commitments in Britain on account of the purchase of defence equipment that cannot be manufactured in Australia, to the approximate amount of &#163;2,000,000 sterling in the current financial year. These commitments will thus be met without necessity for encroaching on our existing body of London funds which we are in course of mounting up as rapidly as possible. </para>
                <para>The arrangements to enable this method of finance to be carried out will present no difficulties. </para>
                <para>The&#39; following, therefore, is a summary of the means that the Government proposes to adopt for financing its defence proposals for 1937-38 : - </para>

                <para>The Government has been in office for nearly six years. During that period the Australian scene has very radically changed. From the valley of despair we have emerged into the sunlight. From the economic and financial point of view, the condition and the outlook of every section of the Australian people are entirely different to-day compared with the grim days of 1931. This has not come about by chance. We have been fortunate in the upward trend of world prices. But this alone could not have produced the favorable situation that exists in Australia to-day. Apart from its&#62; activities in manifold other directions, the Government has assured to the people of Australia conditions of stability and confidence in economic and financial matters ;  and through these conditions has encouraged the enterprise of the private citizen on which, in the final analysis, our system is based. Continued progress depends on the maintenance and stability and confidence, which this Government is convinced that it can ensure to the people of Australia in the future. </para>
                <para>I believe that this latest of the series of budgets which I have been privileged to present to Parliament will help towards the attainment of these objectives, and that it will contribute towards the well-being and security of the Australian people. </para>

                        <para>. -  In my budget speech, I indicated that the proposed expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for public works in the current year would  be  &#163;7,721,500. Appropriation of the whole of this amount will not be necessary at present, since the following special appropriations have already been granted  by  Parliament :  - </para>

                    <para>The amount now required to be appropriated is, therefore, &#163;3,721,000. Details of this amount will be found on pages 276-287 of the Estimates, and also in the schedule to the bill now before honorable members. The distribution of this amount and the corresponding actual expenditure for last financial year are as follows: - </para>

                    <para>The decrease of &#163;1,111,048 in departments and services other than business undertakings and territories is entirely due to the fact that provision for defence works from revenue is limited to &#163;8,000 in this financial year compared with an expenditure of &#163;1,132,036 in 1936-37.  A  comparison of the means of financing defence new works this year and last year is shown in the following table: - </para>

I propose to submit a special bill to appropriate this sum of &#163;1,000,000. The total provision of &#163;3,250.000 is necessary to meet the ever increasing demands for these works, particularly telephone services. As honorable members know, this class of expenditure is of a distinctly reproductive character. </para>

                    <para>The practice in past years has been to consider the new works proposals of the Government as soon as possible after the budget has been delivered, and it is just as desirable this year, as in previous years, to make provision for the works to bo carried on without intermission. Works in progress at the 30th June as usual have been carried on up to the present time by drawing upon the Treas urer&#39;s Advance, that being one of the principal purposes for which this elastic grant is provided. It is not usual to authorize the construction of new works out of the Treasurer&#39;s Advance, except in special cases, such as urgent defence works. Generally speaking, this advance is used only to carry on works already in progress. The Government has submitted this measure as early as possible so that there may be no delay in the prosecution of these works. </para>

I have not been game to ring up lately, as I generally get two or three wrong calls before beingconnected properly. They tell me that if you ring the exchange they will rectify it, but when I get my bill it does not look like it. The telephone runts are about five times what they ought to be. </para>

                <para class="block">Government has promised to assist the pearl shell industry by providing patrol boats to check the operations of poachers from overseas in territorial waters. Along the shores of the Northern Territory an effort has been made to keep poachers beyond the three-mile limit. Only recently we were advised that the patrol boats will not do duty on the north-west coast of Western Australia or in Torres Strait. I recently telegraphed to the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> informing him that a sampan had been seen near Broome searching for water. There were 27 Japanese on board, also several Japanese women and children. This matter cannot be treated lightly. If such vessels were seen off the coast of New South Wales, Victoria or Queenshind, I am sure that the press would raise a hue and cry immediately, and the Government would be compelled to take prompt action. One half of the pearl shell industry in Australian waters is now in the hands of the Japanese. Pour years ago only one sampan came vo our shores, but to-day the number is large. These vessels are now approachng the north-western coast of Australia. When I telegraphed to the Minister about a poacher having been seen at Broome he replied in the following characteristic way in which he allows matters to slide: -  &#91;n reply to your telegram the Commonwealth has no power to prevent use of territorial waters of any State, that power being specifically retained by the States. Commonwealth .jurisdiction is confined to Northern Territory where we have the powers and  funcions  ions of a State.  1 1 was stated a month ago that the Commonwealth had no responsibility in this matter. The regrettable fact is that vessels belonging to the Defence Department ;ire available for the patrol of 1,000 miles of our northern coast line, but 9,000 miles of it is left defenceless. I trust that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Archdale Parkhill)</inline> and the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White),</inline> who, unlike the Minister for the Interior, are men of action, will endeavour to see that strong measures are taken without delay. Australia has a menace at its back door, and the Government has promised for three years to deal with it. </para>

                    <para>. - I  should like the Minister representing the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Archdale Parkhill)</inline> to give serious consideration to the position of the unemployed, many of whom, by voluntary effort and with the aid of local subscriptions, have erected recreation rooms in various towns. The principal object is to keep young men profitably occupied, and an effort is made to give them vocational training. In some instances business people have donated wireless sets to these clubs of unemployed youths and it seems to me that it would not bc unreasonable to ask that the licence-fee be waived. Being unemployed, these young men have no money with which to pay the licence-fee. I understand that inspectors are about to prosecute unemployed persons in the coal-fields districts whose wireless licences have not been paid. I suggest that such treatment would be unnecessarily harsh. </para>

                    <para>. -  A decision was reached by the Federal Cabinet in Brisbane in 1936 with respect to the re-admittance of returned soldiers to the public service. When an announcement to this effect was made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> the following headlines appeared in the daily press in bold type - &#34;Dismissed Returned Men to bc re-admitted to Federal Public Service - Cabinet Decision To-day.&#34;1 Naturally, that information was very pleasing to the returned soldiers temporarily employed in the Public Service, particularly in the Postal Department. In making the announcement, the Prime Minister said that the amendment  of  the Public Service Act would deal chiefly with men who were temporarily employed. Quite a number of men who had served the requisite period in a temporary capacity in the clerical division  of  the Public Service, thereupon made application for permanent employment, but found that provision was made for the permanent appointment only of those who had been employed in the general division. Returned soldiers generally regard this discrimination as very unfair. I- ask the Minister to go into the matter and ascertain if it is not possible to mete out equal treatment to returned soldiers, whether they have been employed in the general or in the clerical divisions of the Public Service. </para>

                    <para>.- When the Works Estimates were being discussed last year, I asked the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Archdale Parkhill)</inline> if money could be made available out of the provision for the Civil Aviation Department for the construction of a landing ground in the Katoomba district. It is unnecessary for me to refer to the danger to life in flying over the mountains. The Minister for Defence, in reply, said that provision was being made for that purpose and that the work would be carried out. I understand, however, that since then nothing has been done. A considerable amount of money is likely to be made available this year for defence purposes aimed at the destruction of life ; a portion of that money could well be used for the preservation of life. In the past, only too often, it has been the practice of the department to wait until a serious accident has occurred before taking preventive measures. This matter should be given very serious consideration. I now ask the Minister if the promised landing ground will be constructed in the near future.&#39; </para>

                    <para>. -  I have no doubt that the Minister representing the Postmaster-General is aware of the dissatisfaction that has existed for some time in Tasmania in connexion with shipping and mail services to that State. It is hoped that a considerable improvement of mail services will take place in the near future when mails from the mainland to Tasmania are carried by air and more rapidly distributed over the various portions of the State. Great dissatisfaction, however, exists in connexion with the shipping service to the north-west coast and to Launceston via the Tamar. Further difficulty was created by the recent breakdown of the <inline font-style="italic">Taroona,</inline> which followed the withdrawal of the <inline font-style="italic">Nairana</inline> for overhaul. <inline font-style="italic">&#39;A</inline> substitute vessel, the <inline font-style="italic">Wollongbar,</inline> was chartered to operate the service during the period when the other vessels were laid up, but could not do so satisfactorily. It was provided in the charter agreement that the <inline font-style="italic">Taroona</inline> should maintain the service, calling at certain north-west coast ports and pro ceeding on to Launceston. When the <inline font-style="italic">Wollongbar</inline> was placed in service the shipping company was approached to divert the Launceston vessel to the northwest coast ports. I communicated with the Postmaster-General in regard to this matter, setting out the entirely unsatisfactory position that has arisen as the result of the altered arrangements, and the inconvenience caused to the main body of passengers travelling between the mainland and Tasmania. In reply the Postmaster-General stated - </para>

                <para class="block">We are fully aware of that, and while I agree that the additional vessel has provided greater convenience to the people of Tasmania, I am at a loss to understand why the passengers who want to travel via the Tamar, which is the recognized direct shipping route, should be diverted to the north-west coast, and that passengers, averaging about 150 during the winter season, should be put to this inconvenience to meet the convenience of those who travel via Burnie who average only about 50. It has been represented to me in Launceston that this savours of more than the average amount of party politics. </para>

                <para>I desire to know if any recent survey has been made of the extent of the iron ore deposits in Tasmania. If not, I ask nhat such a survey should be undertaken by the development branch of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. There are three lodes known to exist, the chief among them being the Bio Tinto lodes on the west coast, which were first reported upon in 1903 by the Tasmanian Government Geologist. A company to operate the Rio Tinto lodes was originally formed in 1895, and continued operations for about two years, carrying out certain developmental work, after which, most of its capital having been expended, it was decided to close the mine pending the introduction of fresh capital. Since then no further work has been done. I understand, however, that investigations made in earlier years show that there is a considerable body of ore in Tasmania and, as Australia is short of steel, a survey should be made to ascertain the extent of the deposits. The lodes should be worked to provide a supply of ir.on ore for Australian requirements, and to give additional employment to Tasmanian workers. </para>

                    <para>.- Great injustice is being done to a very large section of the community by reason of the fact that drivers of hire cars have to pay wireless licence-fees for receiving sets installed in their cars in addition to the. licence-fees for the sets installed in their own homes. I quite understand that the licence-fee is properly collected from companies owning a number of hire cars. My grievance is, briefly, that whereas a man who has a motor car which he drives for pleasure can have a wireless in it without paying an extra wireless fee, a man with a motor vehicle which he uses for business purposes can-&#39; not have a wireless in it without doing so. </para>

The fact, of course, is that my own division of Wilmot includes part of Launceston so that some of my constituents are affected. All that has been done has had behind it the desire to assist not only particular parts of Tasmania, but also the State as a whole. </para>

                        <para>- That is the fact whether the honorable member cares to admit it or not. He has endeavoured to show that because a request was made that a better steamer be put on the northwest coast run once in and once out each week the shipping company was being asked to provide an inferior service to Launceston. Surely things have come to a pretty standard when an honorable member argues that a request for a better vessel once a week to the northwest coast is inspired by party political considerations. In all the negotiations for years past for improved shipping services for Tasmania the- most modern vessels have been secured for Launceston. What actually happened in the present instance is that, owing to unforeseen circumstances, the most modern steamer, the <inline font-style="italic">Taroona,</inline> on  the  Launceston run has  had to be taken off for a time owing to trouble with her turbines. The next best steamer, the <inline font-style="italic">Nairana,</inline> was then put on the Launceston service, and the <inline font-style="italic">Wollongbar,</inline> which is not so good, has been placed on the north-west coast during the period the <inline font-style="italic">Taroona</inline> is being repaired and the <inline font-style="italic">Nairana</inline> overhauled. In those circumstances an appeal was made for the better vessel to be permitted to call at the north-west ports once in and once out each week on the way to and from Launceston. This would not really affect the Launceston service except to the extent that it would add . to the running time of the vessel. I emphasize that even under this arrangement Launceston, and so Tasmania at large, would continue to have the better service. It would not be fair to confine the service to north-western ports of the inferior vessel. The improved service could be given to them in the way requested without inflicting any injury whatever on Launceston. </para>

                <para>Moreover, arrangements have been made for additional overseas steamers to call at Hobart during the coming tourist season. While I was in London I interviewed the shipping authorities &#34;which control the services to Australia, and requested that the number of vessels calling at Hobart during the tourist season should be increased. My request was acceded to with the result that during the coming season at least 44 overseas steamers will call at Tasmania. Launceston will reap an advantage on that account. It should have a substantially increased tourist trade on account of the calling of these additional vessels. Furthermore, the city will benefit by the distribution of the mails that come by air. Launceston will also benefit by the running of the <inline font-style="italic">Taroona</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Nairana</inline> even though one of them may call once a week at the north-west ports. What has been done will benefit Launceston and the whole of the State. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth Government was requested by tie Government of Queensland to take some action in this regard, but, although we had no responsibility in connexion with illegal fishing in territorial waters, I, nevertheless, recommended that a fast patrol boat should be built to patrol the coast to deal with smuggling and also, perhaps, to exercise some indirect effect in regard to fishing, though such fishing might be in waters controlled by the State. </para>

                        <para>- The vessel will be launched about October. She will be a fast craft, carrying fast speed boats, and she will be armed. Under the Customs Act, we can deal only with the protection of the revenue and the importation and exportation of goods. We cannot use the boat to deal with illegal fishing in territorial waters.&#39; We can watch a ship in territorial waters and, in certain suspicious circumstances, can give it twelve hours&#39; notice to depart, or order a ship within the territorial limits to heave-to for boarding. If the honorable member would read the Customs Act, he would ascertain how limited our authority is. </para>

                        <para>- And it is definitely doing so. The honorable member cannot name a single instance in which we have not been vigilant in that regard. The pearling industry of Australia, as he is well aware, has definitely passed out of white hands. Very few white men indeed sail nowadays with the fleets from Broome, Darwin or Thursday Island to engage in pearling. </para>

                        <para>- What the honorable member has been talking about is, to a large extent, the responsibility of the States. The Commonwealth ha3 jurisdiction over territorial waters of the Northern Territory because the Northern Territory is Commonwealth territory. That jurisdiction is exercised by the Minister for the Interior and the <inline font-style="italic">Larrakia</inline> has been working those waters. The honorable member should know something about the ordinance that  was  passed to deal with this subject, but,  as  he has chosen to launch an attack  on  the Government, I am entitled to reply to it and point out that he is attempting to saddle the Commonwealth Government with criticism that should be directed  at  his West Australian Labour friends. The patrol boat which is to be put into commission will, undoubtedly, have  an  indirect effect upon the conditions referred to by him. </para>

                    <para>. - I have made some investigations into references made to-day by the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden)</inline> to a certain publication which had printed  on  its title page the words &#34; Printed by permission of the Defence Department,&#34; and to certain contents to which he took exception.I knew very well that I had not authorized any such publication and also that people have been frequently refused permission to use the name  of  the Defence Department. Upon communicating with the Secretary for Defence, I was informed that he knew of no authority that had been given in respect of the publication mentioned  by  the honorable member. Yesterday, before the honorable member had drawn attention to this particular case, the proprietors of the journal were requested to take from the cover the words &#34; Printed  by  permission of the Defence Department&#34; and also to remove from it the coat  of  arms. No official permission has been given, but it may be that as a result  of  some conversation with a junior officer, they thought that they had obtained it. </para>

                <para>I have received from a supporter  of  mine a similar letter to that referred to by the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> in relation to the installation of devices to check the  numbers of calls made by telephone subscribers. I shall explain the position to him. </para>
                <para>I shall bring before the Postmaster-General the request of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> for the waiving of the wireless licence-fee in the case of the unemployed. </para>
                <para>I remember the decision made in regard to the employment of returned soldiers in the Public Service to which the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. George Lawson)</inline> referred, but I am not sure about the details. I shall have inquiries made. </para>
                <para>Discussions have taken place regarding the establishment of an aerodrome at Katoomba. I believe that the advisableness of establishing an aerodrome there was admitted. I shall, however, make further inquiries and let the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clark)</inline> know the result. The policy of the department is to prevent accidents rather than to wait for accidents to occur before taking action. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline> can rest assured that the iron ore deposits in Tasmania will not be overlooked in the survey which is to take place. </para>
                <para>I admit that the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mahoney)</inline> would not bring before the House any complaint which he did not think was a genuine one, but I cannot conceive of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department requiring a man to take out a second licence merely because he takes a wireless receiving set out of his house and places it in his motor car. A person who has one instrument in his house and another in a car which he uses for pleasure is charged only one licence fee. </para>

                        <para>Assisted British migrants from the United Kingdom are required, before embarkation, to undergo a strict medical examination. In addition, children for Fairbridge farm schools are examinedas to suitability for life in Australia. Unassisted white British migrants are not subject to special selection, and arc permitted to enter Australia provided they are in sound health, of good character, and in possession of valid British passports, and are not likely to become a charge upon the public. White aliens are required to obtain landing permits before being admitted into Australia. In cases where application is made by relatives or friends in Australia who furnish maintenance guarantees, carefulinquiries are made in each case as to the character and financial standing of the guarantor. Intending alien migrants who have no guarantors in Australia arc required to complete a special form of application, and to furnish certificates of health and official certificates of character. In all cases where nominees do not belong to the dependentrelative categories, and where they intend to take up employment in Australia, care is exercised to see that permits are issued only to those who can be absorbed in trades or occupations without detriment to Australian workers. </para>
