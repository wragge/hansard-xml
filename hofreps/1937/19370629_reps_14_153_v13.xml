            <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to authorize the execution, by or on behalf of the Commonwealth, of agreements between the Commonwealth and the States in the form which honorable members will find in the schedule of the bill. The agreements will be executed between the Commonwealth and each of the States, and the respects in which the provisions will vary as between one State and another are set out in a footnote on page 3 of the bill. The only variation has to do with the actual percentage of the total amount to be paid to the particular State. The immediate object is to continue the federal aid roads agreement for a term often years, to increase the amount payable to the States during that period, and to make certain special provisions in relation to the extra amount. Perhaps 1 can best make the position clear if I go back briefly over the history of ' this scheme. It began on the 1st July, 1926. The original agreement bore that date, and was designed to cover a period of ten years. It provided for the distribution of £2,000,000 a year among the States on the basis of approximately three-fifths on population and two-fifths on area, with a special concession to Tasmania, which received a flat 5 per cent., the remaining 95 per cent. being allocated among the other States in the proportions mentioned. The States also, in the original scheme, were required to contribute between them £1,500,000, or 15s. for every £1 contributed by the Commonwealth. The pur pose of the grant was the construction or reconstruction of main trunk and arterial roads, and no provision was made for maintenance, an omission which was to be a source of trouble to some of the States before long. A further provision was that the States, on any loan moneys they used for their contributions, should pay into a sinking fund at the rate of 3 per cent. I refer to that sinking fund now, because in this agreement it is proposed to reduce payments from 3 per cent. to 2½ per cent. In 1931 the agreement, which had been designed to run for ten years in its original form, was altered, and its term was extended for six months from 30th June, 1936, to the 31st December, 1936. The provisions of the agreement were altered so that, instead of £2,000,000 a year being paid to the States by the Commonwealth, a payment was made at the rate of 2½d. a gallon of customs duty, and 1½d. a gallon of excise duty on certain petroleum products. At the same time, the contributions of the States of 15s. in the £1 were abolished and it was specified that the grant should be usable not only for the construction and reconstruction of roads, but also for their repair and maintenance, while the classification of roads was widened to cover any road. In 1936, it was agreed to extend the agreement for a further period of six months, pending negotiation and settlement of the measure now before us.Consequently, as at the 30th June next, which is to-morrow, the agreements will have been in operation for eleven years. The payments made to all the States in that period may perhaps prove interesting to honorable members. In 1926-27, the total amount was £2,000,000, and that continued up to and including the year 1930-31. In 1931-32, the payment on the new basis was £1,812,000. In 1932-33 it was £1,922,000 ; in 1933-34 it was £2,208,000; in 1934-35, it was £2,466,00.0; and in 1935-36 it was £2,779,000. The estimated amount for the year 1936-37 is £3,000,000. Therefore, the total for the term of eleven years, assuming the estimate for the current year to be correct, is £24,187,000. As honorable members may wish to have on record the amounts paid to the various </para>

The honorable member may, however, assume, from the basis of distribution, that States like Victoria and New South Wales are States within whose territorial limits more is collected from the petrol duties than is disbursed; and naturally, in the case of the States which are less densely populated, the position is reversed. </para>

I agree that it is and, if I may say so, I feel some little embarrassment at having to produce it at what I admit is more or less the last moment. The position is, however, that the agreement has had to be negotiated between all the governments and their legal representatives. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members will appreciate that when legal representatives negotiate concerning the form of a contract it is always safe to assume that the commencement of the negotiations is some months before their completion. Unhappily, until the last few days, I have not been in the position to bring the bill down to the House, and then it was impossible to interrupt the consideration of the Supply Bill in order to introduce it. </para>

                <para>I need not go through the agreement in detail, because to some extent it follows the stock form. The provisions of it which require comment are few in number. In the first place, the period of the agreement is ten years from the 1st July, 1937 ; and in the second place, the grants to the States from the petrol duties - I refer to the continuing amount of 2½d., and l½d. - may be expended as was the case under the old agreement. </para>

                        <para>- Not up to this point. There is an increase, but that is dealt with specifically and separately. The continuing amount - if I may so describe it - of 2½d. and1½d., may be expended, as was the case under the old agreement, on the construction, re-construction, maintenance or repair of roads. Therefore, there is no alteration of the position in regard to the continuing amount, except that, by way of relief to the States, the sinking fund contribution which they are bound to provide on loan moneys used by them for their contributions between 1926 and 1931, is reduced from 3 per cent. to2½ per cent. As honorable members will have discerned from my narrative of events, the contribution by the States was abolished in 1931; consequently, we are concerned only with the first period of five years. </para>

                        <para>- No , the customs duty and the excise remain the same, but the Commonwealth makes to the States a larger contribution from the proceeds for the purpose of federal aid roads and other matters to which I shall later refer. This bill concerns itself, not with the tax or the revenue,but solely with the allocation of a certain proportion of the revenue,  calculated in terms of 2½d. and ½d. the2½d.being the old amount which we continue to pay and the½d. being the extra proportion of the existing tax which we propose to pay. </para>

                <para>I have said that the new agreement will provide in that way for a total payment of 3d. a gallon customs duty and 2d. a gallon excise. That is subject to the one qualification that the excise in respect of benzol is l½d. That, of course, remains untouched, and consequently there cannot be a contribution of 2d. a gallon out of it; but that is only a small qualification on the generality of the statement that I have made. The position that will result from the increased payment of the proceeds of½d. a gallon will be, that in this financial year, the Commonwealth will pay an extra £600,000. I speak in terms of estimate, but that, I think, will be found to be substantially correct. During the currency of the agreement the amount payable to the States, not only in respect of the 2½d., which was already showing a growing yield, but also in respect of the½d., will continue to rise if, as we anticipate, business conditions continue to develop, and the use of motor transport develops in the same way. </para>

                <para>The application of the funds is a matter which honorable members will find is dealt with in sub-clause 2 of clause 4 of the agreement. I hope that I have made it clear that the 2½d. - the original amount which we shall continue to pay to the States - still remains attached to the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of roads, and that the change which is brought about is applicable only to the extra sum of½d. The agreement provides that the moneys yielded by that shall be expended upon the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of roads, or other works connected with transport, as the State may think fit. The expression " other works connected with transport " has been used for a certain reason. It has been suggested in several quarters, not only among the States themselves but also in this House, that some flexibility ought to be provided for, because all persons who pay the petrol tax are not necessarily road motor users. For example, the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> has made particular reference to fishing havens and shelters, and other facilities in connexion with fishing. </para>

                        <para>- I shall refer to the particular phrase in a moment. Other honorable members have referred to aerodromes and landing grounds, and have  pointed out that persons who use aeroplanes pay the petrol tax and are thus entitled to some consideration. As honorable members know, it has not proved practicable to work out a system for the tracing of the ultimate use of petrol, so as to make a differentiation. But it is possible in relation to this extra amount to give to the States such flexibility as will enable them to spend money on works which are connected with transport, and the phrase that I have read is adequate to cover all the matters referred to by the honorable member for Moreton. </para>

Wo do not seek to attach any arbitrary limit, except that it must be associated with transport, because that recognizes the proposition that the tax is in a general sense a transport tax.

                <para class="block">It is the view and the intention of the Commonwealth that the phrase " works connected with transport " should be regarded as covering all these cases and eases which are analogous, because in the one case a boat is being used for transport purposes, in another case an aeroplane is being used for similar purposes, and in still another case some petroldriven vehicle on a railway may be used for transport purposes. Whatever they are, they are all associated with transport, and any works allied to them will come, as we understand and intend in this agreement, within the scope of the phrase to which I have referred. </para>
                <para>The Commonwealth has felt for some time that there ought to be some provision requiring some portion of the money it pays over for what I may describe generally as road purposes to be used on Commonwealth roads, particularly roads used for the purpose of approach to Commonwealth works such, for example, as the road approaching the works at Maribyrnong in Victoria. There are a number of roads that fall within that description. One of the new provisions of this agreement is that "onetwelfth of the increase of the grant to the States may, at the request of the Commonwealth, be used for the maintenance and repair - not construction or reconstruction - of roads of approach to, or adjoining, Commonwealth properties. Assuming that £000,000 be the extra amount for this year, that would equal £50,000 if required by the Commonwealth, and, of course, that £50,000 would have a tendency to grow year by year thereafter. As honorable members will sec, it is not an excessive demand, and all States have willingly agreed to it, because it provides a maximum of £50,000 out of the total which we may estimate for the forthcoming financial year to be of the order of £3,700,000. </para>

                <para class="block">This is a short measure for the purpose of appropriating out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, for the purposes of the relevant trust account known as the Invalid and Oldage Pensions Fund, a sum of £15,000,000 for invalid and old-age pensions. I think perhaps I should say, before making the very brief remarks I shall have to make on the bill, that it does not concern itself with anything except the appropriation of a sufficient sum of money, so to speak, to see us through. It does not deal with the question of the rate of pension, or with any of those matters that might more appropriately be discussed in connexion with the budget. It has been the custom in the past to ask Parliament to provide, from the Consolidated Revenue fund, the amount of approximately one year's expenditure to enable the fortnightly payments of these pensions to proceed without interruption. The last provision for this purpose was made in October of last year, when a sum of £12,000,000 was appropriated. The annual rate of expenditure on invalid and old-age pensions has been progressively increasing, and in the financial year 1936-37, which concludes tomorrow, it will be within a relatively few pounds of £14,000,000, and in 1937-38 a larger sum will be required partly through the purely fortuitous circumstances that there are 27 pension pay days in that year - that only happens every eleven years - and partly on account of the natural increase  of the  number  of  pensions exhibited by statistics over recent years, a matter which, of course, is very largely attributable to the fact that while we do not increase our numbers enormously  in  Australia, we grow older and  older,  and more and more people  are  reaching pensionable age although the total population is not increasing  proportionately.  The total amount appropriated by Parliament for invalid and old age pensions up to the present time  is  £195,250,000, and the actual expenditure to the 31st May of this year has been £190,910,000, leaving as at that date a balance of £4,340,000 to meet future expenditure. Honorable members will therefore see that, by the appropriation made in this bill, we are providing an ample provision  so that we will  avoid  all  possibility of any interruption of the regular payment, fortnight by fortnight, of the invalid and old-age pensions whatever they may be at any given moment. </para>

                        <para>- The trust fund, as a fund, will be large enough to pay what Parliament decides ought  to  be paid. I urge that we do not anticipate discussion of these matters. We are not here concerned with discussing rates ;  we  are concerned solely with making adequate provision for the payment of these grants out of a particular fund. The amount  in  hand, as I have already indicated, would be sufficient to carry the payments on until August; but it is necessary, if we are to provide for a reasonably lengthy period of time ahead, to ask Parliament to make a further appropriation. That appropriation is £15,000,000, which, in view of the increase to which I have referred, and having regard to the 27 pension pay days, is rather less than sufficient for twelve months' payments in the circumstances now existing. The provisions of the measure, as I have said, are not connected with rates of pension or the conditions under which pensions are payable, but  are  concerned solely  with the.  total amount. </para>

I think I may take this opportunity, however, to say that the creation of a trust fund as a method of providing for regular payments of invalid and old-age pensions was suggested at the time of its inception by the then Leader of the Australian Labour Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher. The very fact that he had to make that suggestion, and to show how it would be practicable for the Commonwealth to provide for invalid and old-age pensions during the period in which the Constitution prescribed that the surplus revenues of the Commonwealth should be distributed to the States is, I think, a complete and convincing answer to those who say that the Labour party had little to do with the initiation of invalid and old age pensions in Australia. </para>

The first relates to Part III. of the Transport Workers Act 1929, which has relation to waterside workers, and sets out the details of a licensing system which I know has been the subject of much controversy. I do not propose to enter into a discussion at this moment on that aspect of the subject. I seem to remember applying the system of this act to seamen some time ago when trouble occurred at certain Australian ports, but this particular act deals in statutory form with the licensing system established in relation to waterside workers, and not to seamen.

                        <para>.- I am quite prepared to proceed at once with the consideration of this bill, to test whether, after discussion, the Government will review the proposed amendment of section  4  of the principal act. The law at present provides that a proclamation may issue covering all the transport " workers at a particular port. In fact, such proclamations have been issued in relation to the ports named in Clause  2.  It is now proposed to give statutory effect to those proclamations. I fear, that if this action is taken, it may be unlawful for a proclamation to be issued withdrawing the application of the act to those ports. The present procedure cuts both ways. A situation may arise which the Minister feels makes it desirable to apply the Transport Workers Act to a particular port, but when, in the course of time, the circumstances change, and the application of the act is no longer thought to be necessary at that particular port, it may be withdrawn by notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> That course has been taken in connexion with Fremantle. The Transport Workers Act was applied to Fremantle in  1928,  but was subsequently withdrawn. But if clause  2  is passed statutory effect will be given to proclamations that have been issued in respect of the ports named, and the discretion of the Minister to discontinue the application of the act at those ports will have been withdrawn. </para>

                            <para>- Precisely. But it must be remembered that one House of this Parliament will retain its present political complexion for at- least another three years. That is the nigger in the wood pile Even if the electors at the end of this year return to power, an overwhelming majority of honorable members of this House who are opposed to the continuance of the Transport Workers Act, it would still be doubtful whether they could give expression to thewill of the people on the subject, because of what might be done in the Senate. </para>

                    <para>The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> cannot point to any difficulty he has experienced in the operation of the act which has made it necessary for a change of policy to beapproved by the Parliament. He invites the Parliament to give the measure permanent application at the ports specified;  in the bill, but he has furnished no evidence of any difficulty experienced in the last six months, or even the last four or five years, which has made it desirable that, as regards the ports to which this law has been applied since 1928, we should be asked to make it impossible for the Minister to free them from its application. It is all the more important that this Parliament should reject the proposed amendment of the law because of the known proclivities of the present Government to keep the Parliament in recess. When this Parliament is not in session, it will be impossible for the Minister to withdraw the application of the act to the specified ports. I can understand, while not approving, the Attorney-General saying that the act is conducive to industrial peace and should be applied to all waterside workers throughout Australia, but my objection to the principle of this measure is that it is partial in its application, discriminating, as it does, between workers in different ports of the Commonwealth. It exposes the workers in some ports to the penalties of not only the Arbitration Act, hut also the Transport Workers Act. Although all waterside workers have a common award, those not brought under this act have only to comply with the award of the Arbitration Court, and can only be mulct in the penalties provided under the Arbitration Act if they commit a breach of its provisions. The Transport Workers Act was passed to reinforce the Arbitration Court. It was regarded by the Ministry of the day, not as a permanent instrument, but as a measure necessary to deal with an isolated set of  circumstances. The general idea was that its operation would terminate after a given period, but that it should remain a statute law, so that it could be put into operation at particular ports if considered necessary. </para>
                    <para>It is monstrous that thousands of waterside workers of Sydney are free from the odium and burden of this law, whilst thousands of similar workers in Melbourne and Adelaide are subjected to it. Upon what principle can this Parliament discriminate regarding the penalties it imposes on citizens following the same calling at different ports under an identical award of the Arbitration Court? I use this argument against the principle of the act as an additional reason why I consider that the discrimination which the Minister has hitherto exercised should be retained. The minimum disqualification  of a transport worker for an offence under the act is six  months,  and under the bill the minimum period is to be reduced to one month, but this penalty is additional to those imposed by the Court. </para>
                    <para>If the Attorney-General desires this legislation to be made permanent, the right time to do it is when he is fresh from the country, and not the eve of his appearance before his masters. Let the people judge regarding this matter at the general election. If the present Government is returned with a majority, it can pass this proposed law. It is conceivable that if this bill is not rejected now, it will not be competent for a new government that may come into power after the election to alter the act. It would remain on the statute-book with all the new difficulties attendant upon its alteration. The Attorney-General asks us to pay too high a price for the consideration which he is now disposed to give towards those convicted of breaches of the act. </para>
                    <para>I cannot support the proposed change, because the bill seeks to remove the discretion of the Minister in an important industrial matter. We have had a sufficiently long experience of industrial disputes to know that a certain amount of give and take is required, and that conciliation is more useful in maintaining industrial peace than iron adherence to a rigid statute. This measure might even make industrial disputes more prolonged and bitter than they would otherwise be. I could understand the Parliament being asked to give the Minister a general power to apply the act to a particular port when the circumstances warranted it, but, when they no longer warrant its application, it should be withdrawn. The Attorney-General now contemplates that this Parliament should apply the act to particular ports, and that, regardless of any change in the industrial conditions at those ports, it should still continue to operate. This gives emphasis to the injustice inherent in the principle of the act, and makes more definite the discrimination between water- side workers at different ports. The bill seems to violate the underlying principle that a law passed by this. Parliament should apply to all the categories of persons engaged^ in the occupation to which it relates. </para>

                        <para>. - I object more to the general principle of this legislation than to the fact that it applies to some sections of transport workers and not to others. When this act was passed it was violently opposed by not only the waterside workers, but also all other workers throughout Australia. I fear that the passage of this bill would revive the hostility that undoubtedly exists towards it. The people have decided to wipe it off the Statute-Book by constitutional means if they ever have an opportunity to do so. The act and its regulations apply to the Port' of Melbourne, which has suffered more under them than has any other port in Australia. There is now much more peace on the waterfront in Victoria than there lias been for many years, although the workers there still hope to be freed from the operation of this legislation. It is proposed in this bill to reduce the minimum disqualification for an offence under the act from six months to one month, which I welcome, but the attractiveness of that proposal is destroyed by the Minister imposing the objectionable principle of the act more firmly than ever upon the Waterside Workers Federation. It is rather indecent of him to do this on the eve of an election. The bill not only makes it possible to impose the act on another State, but it also changes the nature of its operation in the States to which it now  applies,  and it will be very difficult for any new government that may be returned to power to alter the act. Legislation in both Houses must be passed to undo it. It is wrong for the Government to attempt to alter the law on the eve of an election. Surely this proposal exposes the present Government to a charge of class bias. Two or three months ago the Attorney-General received a representative deputation upon this matter, and, after a long discussion, he agreed to try to make it easier than it now is for the Waterside Workers Federation to work in con junction with the Arbitration Court and avoid ' future trouble. The federation's representatives asked the Minister to lift some of the regulations so that the court would have full opportunity to deal with the conditions on the waterfront which it does not now have. I am glad to know that the Minister is doing that in the way suggested by the federation, but it would be quite unfair to amend the law in such a way as to make it most difficult for another government to remove the harassing regulations. Immediately the workers appreciate what is being done, the present harmony on the waterfront will be seriously disturbed. I urge the Minister to postpone the consideration of the bill until he has received from the Waterside Workers Federation an intimation as to its views. So far as the life of this Government is concerned, there is nothing to be gained by the passing of this bill, because it will not alter the present situation one iota. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> change of the existing conditions on the wharfs whatever will be effected, and I ask every broad-minded member whether it is fair that this bill should be agreed to, in view of the fact that it does not amend the working of the act, but only provides some extra difficult method to hamper any future government which may desire to alter it. Surely it is denying to the people at election time the right to decide. I intend to oppose the bill. I hoped originally that I should have been able to accord my support to the measure, because of the amendment which it makes to the penalty clause; but I now find that it takes some unanticipated step. I have always been opposed to the Transport Workers Act. but I have worked in conjunction with Ministers year after year in an endeavour to make it work less harshly to the workers. If the Attorney-General had not interfered with the act, and allowed the factor of time to work it out, the position would have been, far- more satisfactory. The best stevedoring companies on the wharfs are urging the different committees, and are appealing to representatives of the Government as well as those of the unions, to endeavour to devise some formula in order to give them free selection of labour without being tied down to a committee that allocates the numbers of various groups which the companies are compelled against their will to employ. I am gratified to be able to say that the situation is gradually working out harmoniously. The few objectionable characters that were once upon the waterfront have now left it, and the prospect of restoring complete amity on the wharfs has never been brighter than it is at the present time. I now feel, however, that this bill, if it becomes law, will re-open the old trouble. The worst feature of it is that it cannot in any circumstances, make any difference whatever to waterside labour so long as this Government is in power, and I contend that the Government has no right to anticipate something which may happen when it is not in office. </para>

I am fairly well acquainted with the general principles which underlie this bill, because I have a good memory of trouble which has occurred on the waterfront in various Australian ports from time to time. As <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> representative of the primary producers, I can only say that we, as a body, who depend upon the export of perishable commodities for our living, have been pretty sore on many occasions at the way in which overseas transport has been held up time after time by the actions of certain gentlemen who seem to obtain control of unions which handle our produce. </para>

                <para>This is an extremely dry and technical measure to amend the Judiciary Act 1903-1934. The bill relateswholly to rules of the High Court, and makes no amendment whatever of the law excepting as regards the manner of tabling- those rules in the Houses of the Parliament and the disallowance of any rule by either House. Even in these respects, the amendments are merely designed to bring the numerous provisions relating to the tabling and disallowance of rules of the High Court into a common form. </para>
                <para>When the High Court Procedure Act 1903 waspassed, it contained a lengthy schedule of rules of court, but power was conferred on the justices of the High Court to amend, add to, or repeal those rules. The whole of those rules were, in fact, repealed by rules of court in 1928. The Judiciary Act 1903 also conferred on the justices a rule-making power. It is under the provisions of these two acts that the great majority of the rules of the High Court have been made. Both acts required, and still require, all rules made thereunder to be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament within 40 days of the making thereof, if Parliament is thensitting, or, if not, then within 40 days of the next meeting of the Parliament. Many honorable members will recall this provision as being that which was once used for the tabling of regulations. Its defects are obvious. Presuming that rules or regulations are made on the last day of sitting prior to an adjournment, Parliament is "then sitting", but it would not again be sitting within the prescribed 40 days. Unless, therefore, the tabling were effected on the day of making, the provisions of the act could not be complied with. Further difficulties are encountered when one House only is sitting.  </para>
                <para>So far as regulations are concerned, it has long been provided by the Acts Interpretation Act 1904-1934 that they must be tabled within fifteen sitting days of each House. However, the provisions of the Judiciary Act and the High Court Procedure Act relating to tabling have remained unaltered since 1903. Since that date, numerous other acts conferring a special jurisdiction on the High Court have been passed. For example, the several taxing acts make provisions for appeals to the High Court. The majority of these acts merely confer a jurisdiction and do not mention the matter of making rules of court relating to that jurisdiction ;but some of these acts, which honorable members will find enumerated in the schedule to the bill, do empower the High Court to make rules of court, and in some instances also contain provisions for the tabling and disallowance of these rules. </para>
                <para>The first point that emerges is. that either all these acts, which confer jurisdiction on the High Court, should confer a rule-making power, or none of them should do so. The second and more vital point is that acts relating to the tabling and disallowance of rules should be consistent. Rules issued under the early acts are required to be tabled, within 40 days if Parliament is sitting, or, if not, within 40 days of the next day of sitting. Any rule may then be annulled by the Governor-General on the receipt of an address from either House praying for such annulment. Rules made under the more recent acts are tabled under provisions similar to those of the Acts Interpretation Act applying to regulations; that is, they must be tabled within fifteen sitting days, and may then be disallowed by a resolution of either House. As a consequence, instead of making one set of rules relating to all its jurisdiction, it is technically necessary that the justices should issue one set of rules under this act, another under that act, and another under some other act, and so on. </para>
                <para>The bill is designed to meet this position by 'a very simple remedy. First, it enables rules of court relating to the whole of the jurisdiction of the High Court to be made under the Judiciary Act. That is the meaning of clause 2 of the bill. Having done this, the provisions of all otheracts relating to the making of High Court rules may be repealed, and clause 4 and the schedule are designed to effect this repeal. </para>
                <para>Honorable members will see that so far no amendment is made in the law; the power now exercised under eight acts is merely placed within the scope of one act only. Having placed the rule making power under one act, the question then arises as to whether the old and rather clumsy provisions of that act relating to tabling and disallowance should continue or whether they should be replaced by the more convenient provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act. Clause 3 adopts the latter method. </para>
                <para>Clause 5 merely retains existing rules in force and obviates the necessity for their having to be remade under the Judiciary Act. From what I have said, I am sure honorable members will appreciate that the bill is one that relates solely to procedure and will give it a speedy passage through this House. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill is, so to speak, an old friend because it has been through this House before and went to another place and was there the subject of an amendment  which was unacceptable to this Government. It is desired to pass the bill once more through this House and' to send it again to another place. Honorable members will probably not recollect without some reminder, the provisions of this bill. It was designed principally to amalgamate the provisions of two Acts Interpretation Acts which then existed, and which have been amended side by side in the Commonwealth statute-book for a long time. The primary purpose of the bill was, therefore, one of consolidation; but in addition to consolidation, the opportunity was taken to make some other amendments of the law.For example, in this particular bill, apart from incorporating in one enactment the provisions of the two sets of laws to which I have referred, it is provided that all Acts Interpretation Acts shall apply to all Acts of Parliament unless some express provision to the contrary appears in them. That has been provoked because, in a case before the High Court, it was strongly suggested by one judge at least that amendments of the 1901 act did not apply to acts passed before the amending act itself ; that is, every amendment must be applied purely prospectively to amendments of the law. In order to get over that, a special provision has been inserted to the effect that all acts interpretation acts are to apply to all acts of Parliament. </para>
                    <para>There is also a special provision fixing the date upon which acts are to operate. It is proposed that acts which receive the assent of the Governor-General after the first of January, 1938, shall not commence to operate until a date28 days later. At the present time, acts usually come into force, unless it is otherwise stated, from the date upon which they receive the Royal assent, but that has the effect sometimes of causing people inWestern Australia, and other distant parts, to go on breaking the new law for a fortnight or more, because they have not had an opportunity to see it, or know anything about it. The new provision gives a reasonable opportunity for the circulation of acts to distant parts before they actually come into force. </para>
                    <para>There are also provisions dealing with the retrospective operation of regulations. </para>
                    <para class="block">They may be made retrospective in circumstances in which, to repeat the phrase employed by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn),</inline> there is retrospective benignancy. Where it is intended to ameliorate some provision by retrospective action there can be no objection, but honorable members will agree that it is not desirable that the rights of persons' should be adversely affected retrospectively. </para>
                    <para>Then there are special provisions in relation to the voidance of regulations. The honorable member for Bourke, when the bill was last before the House, moved an amendment which I accepted. This amendment has, with his approval, been re-drafted, and has now been incorporated in the bill. Except for the inclusion of that amendment, the bill is the same measure which formerly passed this House, and I now commend it to honorable members for their favorable consideration. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is a bill to amend section 5 of the Primary Producers Relief Act 1935- 1936, which relates to the closing date  for the receipt of applications for the subsidy of 15s. a ton payable to primary producers in respect of artificial manure used during the year ended the 30th June, 1936, in the production of primary produce other than wheat. </para>
                    <para>The act provides for the payment of the subsidy through the States, subject to the condition that the primary producer has obtained, upon application lodged by him with the Secretary of the Department of Commerce of the Commonwealth, on or before the 31st day of December, 1936, a certificate in writing from the Secretary of that department, stating that the primary producer has furnished satisfactory evidence that he has used the quantity of artificial manure stated in the certificate. Many applications for certificates, which were declared and signed by the primary producers within the date specified in the act, were received after the 31st December, 1936, the applicants apparently being of the opinion that, so long as the applications were posted by that date, they would be eligible for consideration. Some wore under the impression that three days of grace would be allowed for the receipt of the applications. In view of the provisions of the act, however, and acting on the advice of the Solicitor-General, all such applications had to be refused as not having complied with the provisions of the act. The position has been fully considered by the Government, and it has been decided to accept applications, the declarations on which were completed on or before the 31st December, 1936, but which were actually received by the department after that date. </para>
                    <para>In a few instances primary producers have inquired regarding the subsidy on claims stated to have been lodged with the department within the date prescribed in the act, but of which there is no record in the department. In the cases referred to the primary producers have been in a position to furnish evidence that the claims were completed and forwarded to the department, but had apparently been lost in transit. Provision has, therefore, been made in the bill to accept claims in substitution for those which have been lost, subject to the applicant producing evidence to the satisfaction of the Minister that a claim was completed by him on or prior to the 31st December, 1936. In all, about 420 claims will be affected by this bill to amend the act, and the amount of subsidy involved is approximately £1,350. It is not proposed in this bill to do anything more than was intended under the original legislation. A legal question has arisen as to whether applications, the declarations on which were signed on or before the 31st December, 1936, but which did not reach the department until after that date, can be accepted for the purpose of paying the subsidy. If we do not amend the act, about 430 users of fertilizers who, to all intents and purposes, had met the requirements of the act, would bo prevented from benefiting under its provisions. The bill does not bring in a new class of claimants. It is merely applying the same principle to users of fertilizers as is applied to taxpayers. The Commissioner of Taxation regards returns as having been received if they are posted upon the last day permissible under the act. </para>

                    <para>. -  The honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blackburn),</inline> in the course of debate in the last day or two, referred to the publication of Commonwealth arbitration reports and, in conformity with my own  feelings,  pointed out that it would be very unfortunate if the regular publication of these reports were discontinued. I have made  an  investigation into the position and find that, largely on account of the very great volume of work falling on the shoulders of the Principal Industrial Registrar, new arrangements were made in March of last year and the compilation of the reports is now undertaken by an officer of the Attorney-General's Department in Canberra instead of by the Principal Industrial Registrar. The various volumes are in hand. Perhaps I can summarize the matter best by saying that Volume 33, to the end of 1934,  and  Volume 34, to the end of July 1935,  are  now being finally printed for publication, while Volume 35, to the end of March of last year, is set up and should be published before the end of this year. </para>

                    <para>. - I take this opportunity to deal with a matter that concerns the Department of the Interior, and is of some consequence to a large number of workers who  are  now residing in the Federal Capital Territory. </para>

                <para>Since the Parliament reassembled, many matters have been discussed and the debates have largely revolved around what Government supporters claim the remarkable improvement that has taken place in Australia, particularly in regard to unemployment. In view of  the  claim that the percentage of unemployment is now lower than it was even  in  1928, a recital of the circumstances of certain workers in this capital city must prove extremely interesting. </para>
                <para>Last night a deputation waited on the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> to ascertain the nature of the position of these workers in the immediate future. Che prospects of continuity of employment seem rather remote; consequently these men, many of .whom have wives and families to maintain, are naturally apprehensive in regard to the future. I met a number of them to-night and discussed with them the facts of their case. I learned that, prior to eight months ago, married men in the Territory had had a long period of unemployment, during which they naturally contracted many debts, including accumulated arrears of rent and payments for electricity supplied to them. I have been advised that in some cases garnishee orders were issued and awaited a favorable opportunity for their application. The Government then provided continuous employment for these men. The number of married men involved is 200, and their period of continuous employment ends this month. Because of the discharge of portion of their accumulated indebtedness, the wages they received during the period of their continuous employment worked out at very little more than half the basic wage; in other words, they drew not much more than £2 a week. </para>

                        <para>- Then will it be sufficient if I am generous enough to say that no man drew the full basic wage for the period during which he was continuously employed? Last night, the best that the Minister could offer was to extend for a further month the period of employment. I am not certain that anything definite was determined in that regard; but even if the Minister has definitely offered employment for another month, that hardly coincides with the utterances of ministerial supporters as to the degree of prosperity which Australia is supposed to have reached. Surely it cannot be said that prosperity exists if in this capital city married men with families cannot obtain the basic wage, and  have to assemble in proximity to this House to make a protest. </para>

                        <para>- There are only 200 married men in this capital city, whereas in the other cities of the Commonwealth there are thousands. The best that can be done by this Government, with all the powers that it possesses, and all the resources at its disposal for the collection of taxes, is to provide for 200 married men continuous employment for a period of eight months. I deny that these men received the full basic wage for that eight months. The Minister cannot prove that any man did so. For twelve months prior to the period of continuous employment they had to live, and in the process they naturally contracted many debts. The Minister knows as well as any one that arrears in regard to rent and electric light payments are deducted from their wages every week. </para>

I repeat that last night we were told that the best that the Minister could do was to promise employment for another month. I ask him, what is to happen when that month has expired? Probably this Parliament will not then be in session, and the Minister himself may not be in Canberra, with the result that these men will revert to the conditions which prevailed prior to the provision of continuous employment. </para>

                        <para>- Three months ago the conditions of these single men were improved; they were provided with one week on to one off alternately. Then for six weeks there was a still further improvement to full time. But the other day they were advised that this work is to cease altogether, because no provision is known to have been made for further continuous employment for them. The best I understand they can expect - and that would be the very best - will be that they revert to one week in three. Married men are likewise affected. They have had to suffer reductions of their pay because of arrears of rent which have accumulated while they have been in camps over the period of their unemployment, and, of course, during the period when they were only employed for one week in five, six or seven weeks. </para>

                        <para>- I have no information as to the amounts. The position of unmarried men occupying cottages, who are also in arrears, is determined by the total income received into the home. The amount these men receive into their own hands to dispose of in their own way is likewise reduced below the basic wage level. The problem that concerns them is to know what are the Government's intentions immediately following the promises made, and whether its promises will be honoured. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister said that he would give them another month's work; we ought to be told what is to happen after that month is up. Is that too much to ask to-night, that married men with families, particularly during the winter months, should be told exactly where they stand? Considering all the talk regarding employment - call it propaganda if you will - that the members of the Government have indulged in since this Parliament met, is it too much to ask that the Government should make a definite pronouncement in regard to this matter ? I think ample evidence has been produced to-night to show that this Government is unable or unwilling to provide these 450 men in its own capital city with continuous employment, and to guarantee them the basic wage. I take the opportunity to-night - it may be too late to-morrow night - to ask that the Minister should make some definite statement in this House in regard to this matter, not to a deputation outside, so that when we return in the not distant future, we shall be in a position to force him to face up to it. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General the question of the reemployment of telegraphists formerly employed by the Postal Department who left the service to better themselves or for other reasons, and who are now out of employment. Many of these men have experienced bad times through the depression, and have- tried to secure employment in a temporary capacity in the Postmaster-General's Department, but have been informed that, because they are over 50 years of age, they cannot be employed. An officer who has served for a long period as a telegraphist or in other technical employment is usually unfitted to take up other occupations and as I understand that there is a shortage of qualified telegraphists, I see no valid reason why these men should not be employed in the department in a temporary capacity. I could understand objection being raised if there were a sufficient number of young men qualified to fill vacant positions, and that a man who had misbehaved himself whilst employed in the service could not hope to secure re-employment; but I am at a loss to understand why the age limit is imposed in respect of the re-employment of former telegraphists when permanent employees in the Public Service are retained in their positions until they reach the age of 60 years. I cannot conceive that the department could lose anything by giving employment to its former officers. I ask the Minister to give sym-  pathetic consideration to their claims. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> worked himself up into a fine state of indignation when discussing the deputation which was introduced to me last night. There was no justification whatever for the honorable member's assumed annoyance. The four men who met me in that deputation thanked me for what the department had done for relief workers this year in Canberra, and admitted that the married men were much better off than they had been for many years. They told me that they appreciated what had been done for them especially in the last twelve months. A comparison of the amount of work provided for unskilled men in Canberra with what is done for them anywhere else in Australia, shows that the men here are unquestionably far better off than unskilled workers elsewhere. That is not an exaggerated statement. What is the position in New South Wales at present? Under the relief work arrangements, married men are provided with one week's work in two and single men with one week's work in four. When I first became Minister for the Interior, married men were being provided with one week's work in three most of the time, and single men with one week's work in five. That was altered subsequently to one week in two for married men and one week in four for single men. During the financial year which will conclude to-morrow, married men have had approximately ten months' work. In the first four months of the year they. had one week's work in two, and in the last eight months they have had full time. In no other part of Australia have such generous relief work conditions prevailed. We have not been able to do quite so much for the single men. They have been on a part-time basis. I gave an undertaking to the deputation last night that the Government would continue to provide full-time work for married men until the end of July, and I said that I hoped it would be possible to continue it until the end of August. Single men would be provided with one week's work in three. The whole position is to be reviewed at the end of July. </para>

                <para>The honorable member made some remarks about deductions for arrears of rent. Deductions have not been made unless the men concerned have been working full time. In such cases a very moderate deduction is made. It should be borne in mind that the basic wage in Canberra is £4 5s. 6d. This is arrived at in accordance with index figures that take into account the rentals charged to the whole of the public servants in Canberra, including large houses occupied by senior officers, but excluding consideration of the rentals charged for the wooden houses at the Causeway and Molonglo. The calculation gives an average rental for index-figure purposes of from£1 to 25s. a week. Most of the married relief workers pay only 5s. 6d. a week rental, and those at Causeway11s.6d. They are, therefore, in the fortunate position of having their wage fixed on the basis of rentals from 10s. to 17s. higher a week than they actually pay. In these circumstances it can hardly be argued that they are suffering any undue hardship if a small deduction is made from their wages for rental arrears when they are in full-time work. Where there are large families the Government refrains from making deductions for arrears. </para>
                <para>I cannot accept the contention of the honorable member that it is the responsibility of either this or any other Government to provide full-time work for all the unskilled workers who choose to live in our midst. </para>

                        <para>- The responsibility of any government is to do its best for humane reasons to assist the people who are, unfortunately, unemployed. No government could conceivably accept the responsibility to provide full-time employment for all the citizens who care to sit down in their midst. We are trying in Canberra to do our best to improve the position for the future. We have started vocational training classes for the youth of the city and an apprenticeship system has also been adopted. The young men of Canberra who so desire are being trained to be bricklayers, plumbers, carpenters, motor mechanics or skilled tradesmen in other callings. There is no difficulty in finding employment for skilled men. A lot of building construction work will be done in Canberra for some years to come and if we can train the young men to be skilled tradesmen, we shall be making, some effective contribution towards the alleviation of this problemin future days. The immediate difficulty is in relation to the 450 men who are unskilled. The Government's record during the last twelve months must be regarded as generous to a degree for it has provided unskilled married men with ten months' work on full time. No record comparable with that could be found in respect of any other part of Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Corangamite <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> addressed several questions to me regarding the trade diversion policy. The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett)</inline> has a comprehensive question on this subject on the notice paper and the information which he seeks is being obtained. I am able, however to give the honorable member for Corangamite some particulars in reply to his questions. I do not propose at the moment to discuss exhaustively the reasons which led to the adoption of the Government's trade diversion policy but I point out that continuous attempts have been made by the Government since 1934 to arrange a trade treaty with the United States of America in view of the fact that our adverse trade balance with that country for the ten years prior to the 30th June, 1935, was £180,000,000 sterling. Further, in the ten years period mentioned, we exported to the United States of America bullion and specie to the value of £19,000,000 sterling, and paid £22,000,000 sterling in interest to that country. Moreover, that country is one of the very few which has an import duty on wool, the rate being equivalent in Australian currency to from1s. 51/2d. to1s. 101/2d. per lb. In the twelve months before the adoption of the trade diversion policy, our exports to the United States of America were valued at £A.5,813,000 . and our imports from that country were valued at £A.16,805,000, leaving a balance in favour of the United States of America of £A.l 0,991,000. The amount of trade, apart from motor car chassis, which is now being diverted annually, is estimated at £2,200,000. This amount is distributed among the principal countries benefiting as follows: - </para>

The Prime Minister informed the Premier that the statement that there was opposition to the establishment in South Australia of the aircraft factory because of Defence Department policy actuated, in the main, by the reason that departmental officers did not desire the removal of their homes from Melbourne was without the slightest justification.No official had any authority to express any opinion as to the suitability or otherwise of any of the sites under consideration by the company. The only indication that the </para>
                    <para class="block">Defence Department had given the company was the general one that from the defence point of view it was desirable that the industry when established should be located in as safe a position as was possible consistent with economic and industrial factors. The subsequent decision of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation to establish its factory at Fishermen's Bend, Port Melbourne, was in no way influenced by officers of the Defence Department and was entirely a matter for the company itself. </para>
