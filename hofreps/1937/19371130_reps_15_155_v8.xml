Personally I am very glad indeed that one who lias been so closely&#39; associated with me has received that honour from this House, more particularly as, viewing the matter from perhaps an insular viewpoint, you, sir, are a fellow Tasmanian. I promise that you shall have the fullest cooperation of honorable members on this side of the House in the discharge of your duties. You have truly said that, however highly Qualified a  Speaker  may be, he cannot achieve real success nor - in your own words - satisfactorily perform his duties, unless he has the co-operation of all honorable members. You will have that cooperation. I sincerely trust that your experience during the life of this Parliament will give you cause for the greatest satisfaction, and that your health, which previously was not all that could be desired, will be- the best that God has in  His  gift. </para>

                <para>Born at Michelago, which is within a comparatively short distance of the Federal Capital, on the 1st July, 1865, he first entered Parliament in 1906 as member for Queanbeyan in the Legislative Assembly of New South &#34;Wales. His service in the Commonwealth Parliament extended over a period of sixteen years, first as member for North Sydney from 1911 to 1919, and later &#34;as member for Warringah from 1919 to 1927. As a young man he served in the South African War, in which he waa severely wounded. In recognition of his service, he was awarded the Queen&#39;s medal with four clasps. </para>

                    Ryrie&#39;s record of public service, which I have briefly reviewed, is an inspiring one. He was a very sincere man, possessing an intense love for his native country.  His  interests were many, but he was specially devoted to the pastoral industry with which he had been closely associated from boyhood.

I should like to feci assured that this appointment is not a consolation trophy bestowed on the honorable member. There are rumours that he was intended for a much more important office - one on the Executive. I do not know what happened ; all I know is that to-day Jus has been appointed  Chairman  of Committees. 1 assure the honorable member that honorable gentlemen on this side of the House will do their very utmost, consistent with their duty, to observe the dignity of the chamber, and to observe also the Standing Orders. I assure him also, that, whatever may have happened on a previous occasion, we shall not in any way recollect it, but I offer  -  I hope without impertinence - the suggestion that he himself certainly should not forget it. </para>
