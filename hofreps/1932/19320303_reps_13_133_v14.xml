Subsequently, upon the reassessment of the estate, £3,902 was repaid to the executor in cash, involving a loss to the Treasury of £400, and a corresponding gain to the estate. Having regard to the injustices and anomalies which are possible under the existing system, will the Prime Minister investigate the practice of accepting bonds at their face value, particularly bonds purchased by executors after the decease of the testator, with a view to protecting the public revenues? </para>

                        <para>- In view of the fact that the Prime Minister, in his reply to my question of the 26th February, indicated that of the £69,600 allocated in November, 1931, to the Commonwealth Works Department, only £48,277 has been expended in New South Wales, thus leaving an unexpended balance of £21,323, and that the allocation to the Postmaster-General's Department in that State shows an unexpended balance of £2,000, will the Prime Minister expedite relief work to ensure that the unemployed get some work pending the proposed Premiers Conference? Does the Prime Minister not think that it would stimulate much more active co-operation from the States at the proposed conference if the Commonwealth Government were to display a little more activity in the expenditure of money in order to assist the States in alleviating the distress consequent upon unemployment generally in Australia? </para>

In regard to the Post Office, the Commonwealth and the State are both committed to the full amount, and the works involved are proceeding. There can be no actual unexpended balance. </para>

Many men settled themselves here in what were regarded as rest camps for travelling unemployed. They were not disturbed in their more or less permanent occupancy of those camps, and they received rations over and above those provided for by the regulations. It is not, however, proposed to continue supplying rations to these men while they occupy the camps to the exclusion of bona fide travelling unemployed who desire to use the buildings as a rest camp. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth Government is being kept fully informed, and is receiving daily communications about the situation in the Far East. Events there are moving so rapidly, however, that a statement made to-day would not cover the situation that may exist to-morrow. The reports which have appeared in the press have been substantially correct. The most recent information is more hopeful; it is that the Japanese Government has agreed to a suggestion for a conference with a view to an armistice and a final settlement of the dispute. It is not right to assert that the Government is not keeping honorable members fully informed. Repeated statements have been made regarding the events as they have taken place, and the only additional statement which could be given to members would be a detailed explanation of the cause of the present trouble, its progress to date, and the prospects of its settlement. Such information, however, has been available from day to day in the press. </para>

Is the Minister aware  that  an area of 250,000 square miles, which is now free of the tick, is threatened by it because the Federal Government will not spend a few thousand pounds on control measures? If he is aware of this, what does he propose to do about it? </para>

                        <para>- The Government is fully aware of the importance of the cattle tick problem. The eradication of this pest is naturally a matter for the consideration of the Commonwealth Government, in co-operation with the State Governments, and combined action is being taken. The occurrence of the pest in the Northern Territory has not come under my notice since I have taken over the control of the Department of Health ; but the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr. Parkhill), who administers the Northern Territory, is doubtless giving serious consideration to the eradication of cattle tick there. </para>

What was done in the matter during the regime of the last Government, I cannot say. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not. intend to delay the House by speaking at length on this bill. I intimated to honorable members, in discussing the Financial Agreement Enforcement Bill, that the Government would accept the suggestion of the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> that that portion of the Financial Agreement Enforcement Bill which dealt with the Commonwealth Government's acceptance of liability for the payment of interest due on behalf of the States to the bondholders should be embodied in a separate measure. That bill is now before the House, and the reason for it is simply, as has already been stated, that doubt has arisen as to the liability of the Commonwealth Government to the bondholders. In November last, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell issued his book on the Financial Agreement, and in it he pointed out that such a doubt existed. Although some legal opinions suggest that there is no doubt, others clearly indicate that there is a doubt. In these circumstances, the Government felt that the matter should be put beyond question, because there is a moral obligation resting on the Commonwealth to accept responsibility to the .bondholders of the States. The Leader of the Opposition himself, I think, pointed out that in this bill we are aiming, so far as we can, at putting the matter on a permanent basis, and to that extent we are justified in separating this measure from the provisions of the other bill, which may not be permanent, and concerning the validity of which some doubt, which may have to be fought out in the courts, may arise. Since the principle embodied in the present bill has the support of the whole of the people of Australia, whatever their political views may be, it is almost inconceivable that a future Parliament would remove the measure from the statute-book. In submitting the bill, therefore, I feel that the whole of the Parliaments and the people of Australia are behind us. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not intend to take advantage of the fact that this is a new bill to discuss, at length, the matters with which the measure deals. I shall say only what I would probably have said on these provisions had I discussed them in committee as part of the Financial Agreement Enforcement Bill. It is necessary, however, that the position should be made clear. This bill was formerly clause 4 of the Financial Agreement Enforcement Bill. Its purpose is to add to the Commonwealth's liability to bondholders. If it is agreed to, the Commonwealth will be directly liable to all bondholders. I am glad that the Government has introduced this  provision as a separate measure, because die re is no doubt in my mind that other provisions of the. Financial Agreement Enforcement Bill will be challenged on the ground of invalidity. This bill does not create a new liability for the Commonwealth ; it merely says that in respect of an existing liability the bondholders may, in the event of default, sue the Commonwealth directly - an action which they may not have been able to take under existing legislation. If this bill is likely to do anything to improve our credit on the other side of the world we should pass it without question. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>So far as I know, doubts have never been raised by any legal authority - and I have read many legal opinions on the subject - as to the liability of the Commonwealth to pay interest due by a defaulting State. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> and the Assistant. Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> have repeated, on a number of occasions, the statement that according to some legal opinions there is no doubt, and, according to others, there is doubt on that point. I invite the Government to quote the legal opinions to the effect that there is any doubt as to the Commonwealth's liability to pay the interest due by a defaulting State. There is admittedly difference of opinion between lawyers as to whether the Commonwealth is directly liable to bondholders, but there is no doubt in the mind of any legal gentleman, so far as I have been able to ascertain, that ultimately the Commonwealth is liable to pay any interest due on account of a State default. </para>

                            <para>- It adds to the responsibility of the. Commonwealth in that it gives to the bondholders power to sue the Commonwealth, which they may not possess under existing legislation. I make no complaint about the giving of that power. It is most unfortunate that a doubt should have been thrown upon our ultimate liability to pay, if there is no real doubt on the point. </para>

                            <para>- It is certainly no protection to the bondholders. If there is not such a liability on our part, the only thing that stands between State defaults and absolute loss by the bondholders on the other side of the world is the moral obligation on the Commonwealth to pay. It is therefore desirable that the point should be cleared up, and the legislation which clears it up  should  be retained on the statute-book. But something more than that is necessary if the bondholders are to be assured. There has already been one default - the first in the history of the Commonwealth. I believe that if the Commonwealth Government is to allay the fear which it has aroused - because nothing could raise more fear than an actual default - it must do more than it seeks to do by this bill. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth declared that it was not liable to pay, but was a trustee, and would pay after collection. That statement has raised the question in the minds of bondholders: what will become of them if the Commonwealth fails to collect. I believe that the passage of this bill will do something to allay the fears which have been aroused, but the Government should go further, and endeavour to amend the Financial Agreement. If the Agreement were amended to remove any doubt  which  the Government thinks has arisen, the bondholders would have greater protection. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but guarantors are always liable to pay if the original debtor fails to do so. The position is that, in the event of default by a State, the Commonwealth, as the guarantor of the State, is liable to pay. I do not think that anybody, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell included, has challenged that view. It is true that he does say that the Commonwealth is not directly liable, but he does not dispute indirect liability. I can find in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell's statement not only no suggestion of doubt of Commonwealth liability, but an affirmation that the Commonwealth is liable, though the liability cannot be enforced directly. In discussing several other questions, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell, ou page 36 of his book, deals with the default by the New South Wales Government last year.

He says that bondholders cannot sue the Commonwealth Government directly under the Agreement, and, no doubt, he used the word " directly " with a full understanding of its significance. The Government which I had the honour to lead obtained a joint opinion on this matter in Sydney, and another in Melbourne, and those' opinions are on the file of the Attorney-General's Department. One declares that " the Commonwealth is under a legal duty to the States, except possibly the defaulting State," to pay the interest. Another opinion states that " the Commonwealth is under a legal obligation to the States, parties to the agreement, to pay the interest ", and, also that " the Commonwealth is under a legal obligation to the bondholders to pay interest on the State debts, taken over when the State defaults in payment to the Commonwealth ". </para>

                            <para>- We should be careful to let the bondholder know that he is protected apart from this legislation. I do not mind giving this extra protection to the bondholders, and assuming the additional liability that will tend to restore confidence, but I deprecate the Commonwealth Government suggesting that it has no liability to the bondholders if this bill does not become law. I am aware that this legislation may be repealed by any Commonwealth Government that desires to default; that must make the position of the bondholders shaky. </para>

I am trying to answer the declaration that was made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> that there is doubt as to the liability of the Commonwealth Government to pay this money. The Government raised that doubt by declaring that it was in the position of trustee, and that it would pay the money when collected from the State concerned. It is true that the Commonwealth Government afterwards departed from that attitude, and paid the amount; but as a responsible member of this Parliament, I refuse to countenance the statement that the Commonwealth has no liability to pay this money, except that imposed by. this bill. </para>

                    <para>My party is not against this proposal. As a matter of fact it merely places over-: seas bondholders in a position similar to that of persons in the Commonwealth who hold Australian stock. This Government is directly liable to holders of that consolidated stock, and it is also liable to the holders of all securities overseas that have been issued or converted since the Financial Agreement was entered into. The bill gives all bondholders the same protection, and it imposes on the Commonwealth the same liability. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that it will do any harm. I support the measure because it is intended to right a wrong. Unfortunately there is nothing permanent about this bill. Having set our hands to it we should go the whole way, and so make assurance doubly sure. Let the Government permanently remove the existing doubt by amending the Financial Agreement. I am aware that that will need the unanimous consent of the parties thereto, but I do not anticipate any difficulty in that regard. The alteration will not impose any further obligation on the States, rather it will add to the liability of the Commonwealth, and perhaps to that extent it will relieve the States. I am not sufficiently a lawyer to argue that issue. We should assume a responsibility that is equal to that of the States with regard to State debts. </para>

                            <para>- That is what the measure proposes to do, but, as I have stated, there is nothing permanent about it. It may have a good effect in removing the misgivings created in the minds of oversea bondholders by the Commonwealth's delay in paying the interest in respect of which New South Wales defaulted a few weeks ago. This bill has no relation to the other measure providing for the enforcement of payment to the Commonwealth by a defaulting State. It is a mere declaration, and while it remains in force, will prevent a repetition of the folly of the present Government in refusing to pay interest on the due date. The bill will have a restraining effect upon future governments, because even though it may be repealed, Parliament must first be consulted. In November next the Commonwealth will require to convert £13,000,000 of maturing debt, and a further £9,000,000 in the following July, and to remove any possible doubt in the minds of those to whom we shall be appealing for conversion, this definite guarantee by the Commonwealth should be placed in the Financial Agreement. Meanwhile, I support the bill, which I hope will be carried unanimously. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> regarding the desirability of a unanimous endorsement of this bill as an indication to the investing public that, irrespective of party political differences, the whole Parliament affirms the liability of the Commonwealth under the Financial Agreement for all the debts of the States. The Prime Minister has rightly said that this measure is completely severed from the bill for the enforcement of payment to the Commonwealth by a defaulting State. It has no relation to any steps that may be taken to compel a State to honour its obligations ; it merely expresses the direct liability of the Commonwealth for the interest on Australia's public debt. That cannot be regarded by any section in this House as a controversial proposal. We should do everything in our power to allay any doubt that has been raised, and establish beyond question the liability of the Commonwealth. Undeniably, the intention of the Financial Agreement was to consolidate and strengthen the credit of Australia generally, and the people were repeatedly told that the financial strength of the Commonwealth would buttress that of the States, so that subscribers to Australian loans could feel assured that the whole resources of the nation were backing their investment. A further consideration is that under the financial Agreement, every debt as it matures will be converted into a direct Commonwealth obligation. Future borrowing, whether the proceeds are to be used by the Commonwealth or the States, will be covered by Commonwealth securities. Moreover, by the great conversion loan last year more than half the total public debt was converted into Commonwealth securities, for which the Commonwealth is liable to the bondholder. The stage is rapidly approaching when Commonwealth bonds will cover the whole of </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Australia's public debt, and it is eminently desirable that any doubts regarding the Commonwealth's liability in the meantime should be removed. Even if the Financial Agreement be not amended as the Leader of the Opposition has suggested, unanimous approval of this bill will give to bondholders an additional guarantee, and an assurance that every party in the Australian Parliament admits the primary liability of the Commonwealth for the payment of both Federal and State debts. That will undoubtedly strengthen Australia's credit. The credit of the nation as a whole is much greater than that of an individual State; that was shown by the improvement in our stocks following the adoption of the Financial Agreement. Investors knew then that the credit of the States was backed by the credit of the Commonwealth. We cannot afford to leave any doubt about that during the critical years immediately ahead. The conversions to which the Leader  of  the Opposition has referred, will be  more  easily, cheaply, and satisfactorily effected if our internal and external credit is strengthened by this bill, especially if it is passed with the unanimous approval  of  all parties. </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition has contended that there was no doubt of the Commonwealth's ultimate liability for the payment of the interest on State debts'; that any doubt that may have arisen in the last few weeks was created by the Government, which thereby has done incalculable harm. The right honorable gentleman will agree that if any doubt does exist, it should be removed, and I propose to show that there is a real doubt. The opinions obtained by the Commonwealth from learned counsel vary to some extent, but there is fairly general agreement that in respect of State securities issued prior to the making of the Financial Agreement, and for which State bonds were issiied, the bondholder has no direct right to sue the Commonwealth. The bondholder received from a State a security which represented a promise by the State to pay principal and interest; the adoption of the Financial Agreement did not give to him the right to sue the Commonwealth directly, notwithstanding that under that agreement, the Commonwealth had assumed liability in respect of those bonds. Another point generally accepted by our legal advisers is that, whilst the Commonwealth is not liable to be sued directly by the bondholder, it is liable to the States, and any State, other than the defaulter, can take steps to compel the Commonwealth to pay. Apparently, there is a clear liability on the part of the Commonwealth to pay interest in respect of which a State Government has defaulted, and a clear right in the States other than the defaulting State, but not to the bondholder, to sue the Commonwealth if it does not pay. But have the States an unqualified and absolute right to make the Commonwealth pay in any circumstances, and. regardless of whether it has received any of the moneys in respect of which default has occurred?- One interpretation of the law may be that the Commonwealth has an obligation to the States, other than the defaulter, to make good any default. </para>

Doubt has only to occur in the minds of those persons to create trouble for us and to undermine our credit. There is a doubt, and the bill has been introduced to resolve it. Personally, I have not the slightest uncertainty as to the intention of the original measure. It was never meant to make the liability of the Commonwealth subject to the .receipt of moneys from the States. The doubt has evidently arisen by reason of the drafting. We cannot, of course, act on what was the intention of Parliament, we must take the actual wording of the clause. It was to remove any doubt that the Commonwealth Government determined to introduce this legislation. </para>

                    <para>I do not propose to deal with the course taken by this Government on the 1st February, because that has already been the subject of much discussion. The question whether the Government was right or wrong in the action it took to bring home exactly where the default lay, does not arise under this measure at all. What we are now considering is the difficulty that this measure is designed to overcome, and whether it is desirable that we should at this stage take this action to put the position beyond any doubt, and to make clear to the investors in Australian securities the  opinion of the Federal Parliament. The Government considers, and the Leader of the Opposition concurs, that this is the most desirable course. I urge upon honorable members the desirability of passing this bill unanimously, to show to those who have moneys invested in Australian stocks that they have behind those stocks the security of the Commonwealth as well as of the States. The passing of this measure will have a material effect upon Australia's credit, and will make easier the big task which we have to face of converting a considerable portion of our long-dated securities which are shortly falling due. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not intend to labour this bill, nor to traverse the arguments which I raised during the second-reading debate on the original measure. The whole subject has been thoroughly thrashed out. We all agree on the principle of the bill, and it will be simply flogging a dead horse to continue discussing it. I congratulate the Government on separating this bill from the original measure, thus making the Commonwealth liability for State debts no longer a matter for controversy. There is no question that had the original measure not been so altered the Government would probably have been dragged into litigation under another part of the bill. The mere fact that the Government is introducing this measure shows its obvious desire to put the whole issue on the highest plane. The Government may have made a mistake in not paying the interest commitments of New South Wales on the 1st February. Had it a doubt at all it should have paid the money and afterwards brought down legislation of this sort to prevent any limelight from being thrown on the subject. The time has come to bury that mistake. We gain nothing by holding continual post mortems on the corpse. We should get back to the living problems that are associated with" the remaining portion of the original bill, which is urgent, and still has to be dealt with. I hope that this legislation, because of its national character, will be carried unanimously by all members of this House, and that when this proposed alteration has been made it will be embodied in the Financial Agreement, from which the particular words referred to by the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> should be removed. I appeal especially to the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> and his followers in this chamber to support this bill, and induce the Government of New South Wales to agree to this alteration being incorporated in the Financial Agreement itself. </para>

                        <para>. - At this stage of the debate, it is obvious that, the honours have gone to the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> for finding a way out of the difficulty with which the Government was faced, but apparently was unable to overcome. It was upon the suggestion of the right honorable member for Cowper that the original measure was amended, and this bill introduced. The reason for the bill now under discussion, according to the Prime Minister, is that certain doubts have arisen regarding the obligations of the Commonwealth to make interest payments to overseas bondholders. As the members of the Government in this and another chamber have taken particular care in the draftsmanship of measures concerning which the question of pounds, shillings and pence arises, it is remarkable that they did not. know that the alleged doubt in this legislation existed previously. The Prime Minister was a member of the Scullin Government for over twelve months, and it is remarkable that he did not take steps during that time to have this matter cleared up, particularly as it is now the intention of the Leader of the Opposition to support this bill. Apparently he did not know of any doubt during that period. We have, therefore, to question politically the argument, put forward in favour of this procedure. I am not prepared to accept the explanation that has been advanced. This so-called doubt, has been brought forward merely to cover up the failure of the present Commonwealth Government to meet its obligations. I feel quite satisfied about that, because the Assistant Treasurer, when questioned just now by the Leader of the Opposition as to when the rumblings of doubt to which ho had referred had arisen, suggested that they originated with the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham).</inline> Although the legal know-  ledge of that honorable gentleman may be of the highest character - I am not competent to question it - he has political feelings just as I have, In spite of his high legal training, his decision on financial questions in which the law is involved must be coloured by his political feelings. The human factor must prevail. </para>

                            <para>- This alleged distrust or doubt is not based upon fact, and in reality does not exist. It has been raised for the express purpose of covering the failure of the Government to meet its obligations, a failure which has been severely criticised, not only in Australia but also overseas. I intend not to assist the Government to cover up its mistakes, but to forcibly express to all and sundry that the motives directly behind this legislation are purely political and not in our national interests. I am not prepared to help it to overcome a difficulty which it stupidly created. I am not prepared to allow it to pass a measure, the object of which is to strengthen further its efforts to destroy the party which I represent in this House. I have listened attentively to the Assistant Treasurer, and his reference to the rights of the States. After all, it must be admitted that the position confronting this country is exceptional. We all agree that a similar position is confronting most other countries throughout the world. Despite the Financial Agreement, I argue that it is competent for a State which is confronted with exceptional circumstances to declare to what extent it can meet its commitments. It matters not to me what honorable members on the Government side may say about the need to discuss this subject irrespective of party. We have not short lived memories. We cannot forget the recent utterances of the Prime Minister in Sydney to the effect that any and every means had to be taken to remove from New .South Wales' the incubus of the Lang Government. Another Minister said that he would eat his hat if the Lang Government were not removed a fortnight after this Government took office. The Government supporters who now ask us to discuss this- question irrespective of party and to take the broad national view, have attempted to strike a deadly blow at the party to which I belong. </para>

                    <para>Before the sum of £900,000 for interest payments fell due recently, New South Wales asked the Loan Council for £500,000, because it was unable to find all the money necessary. It could not do so, because of the economic depression which was effecting New South Wales in common with the other States. The Loan Council resolved that it would furnish no assistance to New South Wales, although, of the £900,000 owing, £300,000 represented exchange. The Loan Council did not refuse assistance to the other States which needed help, and we know why it singled out New South Wales for such treatment. I have listened to the speeches that have been made from the Government side of the House on this bill, and it has become clear that the Loan Council and the Commonwealth Government refused to help New South Wales because they disapproved of the social services which were provided in that State. Even the right honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> suggested at the Premiers Conference that the £500,000 which New South Wales could not find might be taken from the railway and tramway employees. It is obvious, therefore, that political animosity had a great deal to do with determining the attitude of the Commonwealth Government on this matter. I am not prepared at this stage to allow the Commonwealth Government final determination in any matter regarding loans or interest payments. The Commonwealth Government has shown no disposition to move in the direction of having our overseas interest burden reduced. When an unofficial statement was published that the right honorable member for Flinders would, when he went to London as Resident Minister, take steps to have overseas interest rates reduced, he flatly denied the statement the following morning.

                    <para class="block">Government is, apparently, to force the people of Australia to go on carrying on the present enormous interest burden, although it has been shown that the burden is too great for them. When the Loan Council refused to provide money to meet the interest commitments of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> cabled to the New South Wales Agent-General in London, requesting him to get into touch with the Bondholders Association in order to make some arrangement for deferring the payment, or for a reduction in interest rates. Immediately this was done, the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bavin)</inline> published a statement in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun,</inline> that even though <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis</inline> was successful in his negotiations, the arrangement could not be given effect unless the Loan Council approved. Even though the bondholders themselves were willing to meet New South Wales in this matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bavin</inline> would not allow the taxpayers this measure of relief without the consent of the Loan Council. Why should we not seek some relief in regard to overseas interest payments? The farming community has obtained relief to the extent of over £2,000,000 on their interest commitments which have been deferred and, in some cases, waived, so that they may have a chance to recover. Similar concessions have been granted to other sections of the community, because it is recognized that, at the present time, it is humanly impossible to meet all obligations in full. Therefore, rather than force the farmer off the land, the business man into the street, and the tenant into the slums, payments have been deferred and concessions granted in the hope that, when better times come, every one will be able to pay his just debts. </para>
                    <para>This bill proposes to remove certain doubts, but those doubts, I claim, are purely imaginary. The bill has been introduced to cover up the failure of the Government to meet its obligations when they fell due, and I will not be a party to screening the misdeeds of the Government. Bather will I do all in my power to focus public attention upon them. Even the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> in a published statement, said that, if the Government had taken  any  other course in regard to the default of </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members opposite talk glibly about taking a broad, national view of the situation, and of preserving the economic stability of the country; but on the confession of one of their leaders, they are more concerned with whether or not they will look ridiculous in the eyes of the press. They seem to be unduly sensitive to press criticism. For my part, it does not affect me, and I recall that certain members of the Labour party, who have grown old in its service, have declared that, when the press begins to eulogise a labour man, it is time for his colleagues to ask just where he stands in regard to labour principles. I am just as much concerned with the welfare of Australia as are honorable members opposite, and I will not be a party to the passing of any legislation the only purpose of which is to save the face of a Government which has committed an error of judgment. </para>

                        <para>.- When the people agreed to the amendment of the Constitution in 192S, they had no doubt that the effect of the amendment would be to make the Commonwealth responsible for the debts of the States. No one has ever raised any doubts on that point until the present time, and I do not believe that there is any real doubt in the mind of the Government even now. Members of the Government have declared publicly that the Commonwealth refused to pay the money due by New South Wales in order to emphasize the default of the State Government. That is the real reason why the money was not paid; it was not because there was any doubt regarding the liability of the Commonwealth to pay. The highest legal authorities in Australia and in Great Britain have given it as their opinion that the Commonwealth is liable, and the Government has now accepted their opinion, and has paid the money. Therefore, this measure is unnecessary. The Government is pleading for a unanimous vote on this bill. Why? So that it will be able to say " We did default, but there was a grave doubt as to whether we were liable. Even Parliament was in doubt, and unanimously passed a bill exonerating us from blame ". </para>

                        <para>. - I am rather apprehensive regarding the effect of this bill. I do not approve of the suggestion of the honorable member for Hunter that we should vote against this measure because the Government has made a mistake, and because we should not help it out of its difficulty. I am not anxious to uphold the Government, except when it does something which is in the interests of the people generally. If the Government made a mistake, as I think it did, in temporarily suspending the payment of interest to overseas bondholders, that is no reason why I should not help it to restore the confidence of those people to whom we may have to go again for the purpose of raising money. The people of New South Wales and other States, unfortunately, may again have to resort to interna] and overseas borrowing, although I hope that the day will soon come when the monetary system will be so altered, on sound progressive lines, that the people of this country will be less dependent on the private banks than they are to-day. This could be achieved by our own national Government bank creating and releasing the credit necessary to meet the requirements of industry. The argument advanced by the honorable member for Hunter does not appeal to me. I understand that this measure has been brought down solely to remove any doubt that may exist in the. minds of bondholders as to the authority to which they must look in future for the payment of the interest due to them, as well as the repayment of the principal. I am still willing to support the bill if it is designed only to achieve that object. The other portion of the Financial Agreement Enforcement Bill deals with the methods of enforcement to be adopted. I am not objecting to that enforcement on constitutional and democratic lines; but I take strong exception to the methods laid down in the other measure for enforcing payment by a defaulting State. I would not vote for the present bill if I thought that under clause 5, which is the sting in the end of its tail, it would be possible to raid the revenue of a State, and do all the objectionable things to which I  took exception in discussing the previous measure. We have been assured that clause 5 is intended merely to give an assurance to the bondholders that the Commonwealth Government accepts liability to them. I have a doubt on that point, and when the measure reaches the committee stage, I desire the Minister in charge of it to make a clear statement as to the extent of the powers given under this clause. </para>

            <para>The Commonwealth shall be entitled to recover from a State, by suit in the High Court, any moneys (due and payable and unpaid by the State by virtue of the Financial Agreements or this act) for which the Commonwealth has become liable by virtue of the Financial Agreements or this act, or which the Commonwealth has paid in pursuance of those agreements or this act. </para>

The honorable members who belong to the party which 1 have the honour to lead, regard this clause as obnoxious to the principles of democracy, and the rights of the States, both financially and otherwise. It is provided in the next clause that regulations may be made " not inconsistent " with the provisions of this measure.  1  realize that the power to make regulations rests with the Executive Council, and, without being disrespectful in any way to those whose duty it is to give legal advice to the Government, I know very well that an Executive Council exercises this power very often to give effect to the aspirations of the political party to which the majority of its members belong. The last Government exercised the power to make regulations to give effect to certain desires which it had. I approved of those desires, and supported its action in framing the regulations which I have in mind. I therefore feel justified in saying that there is every reason to believe that this Government will cause regulations to be framed to suit the interests of the people which it represents. I shall, therefore, vote against the clause </para>

                    <para>.- The object of this clause is to give bondholders power to sue the Commonwealth in the High Court for the recovery of debts due to them in the event of a State making default in its payments. The honorable member for "West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> has referred to the power to make regulations which is given in the next clause of the bill. I remind him that regulations made pursuant to that power must he consistent with the provisions of the measure. I entirely disagree with the honorable gentleman when he suggests that the previous Government strained its power to make regulations to serve the political ends of its followers. The regulations referred to by the honorable member stood the test of examination in the High Court, and were held to be consistent with the act under which they were made. The Executive Council can only make regulations consistent with the provisions of the act under which  such regulations are made. I draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the words in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of clause 5, which read " and any other powers which in the opinion of the Governor-General are necessary". These words are ambiguous, and should be eliminated. </para>

                <para>I contend that the Commonwealth Government has no right to impose upon a State employee duties that neither he nor the government to which he owes allegiance desires to carry out. An officer of a State Government is peculiarly bound to that Administration, and he has superannuation fund commitments and accrued benefits which should not be prejudiced by any conscientious objection that he may entertain about giving to the Commonwealth Government or its representatives information which he considers is the property only of the government to which he owes, allegiance. Para graph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> seeks to introduce a conflicting authority, and, if approved, it would leave a conscientious State servant in a difficult position. I know that if I were such an officer I should regard the State Government as my employer, and implicitly obey its instructions. It would be improper if another government were granted authority to mulct, in penalties, and even commit to prison, any person who insisted upon being loyal to the administration that employed him. To put a State official in such a position would be wrong. In honorably discharging his duty to the State, he has a right to refuse to divulge to any authority information which he regards as the confidential property of his employer. </para>

                    <para>. - The clause will create a conflict of authority, and place upon a State officer responsibilities which he might not regard as consistent with his duty to his employer. Such a test of his loyalty would be unjust-. I can imagine State officers questioning the authority of any other Government to undermine their discipline and allegiance to their employer, and they would be especially resentful if the State Government were opposed to the demand of the Commonwealth. Surely the Commonwealth can have its services performed by its own officers. During the deportation proceedings it did not ask the State police to violate their oath of allegiance. We have no right to give to State officers orders which may run counter to their natural desire to be loyal to the authority that employs them. </para>

I do not agree that this legislature has not a right to impose duties on State officers but, where possible, it should avoid doing so. There is no need for the power conferred by the clause, because the production of documents could be secured by order of the court. </para>

The bill proposes merely to impose on State officers certain obligations; if this law is valid, State officers will do no wrong  in obeying it. </para>

                    <para>.- The regulations must be consistent with the bill. The Commonwealth must have power to call for returns and documents, and a refusal to comply must be punishable. I would not whittle away the right of this Parliament to give effect to its legislation; it must have power to require State servants to produce documents. We have only to provide safeguards against undue interference with the employees of another government. The services referred to by the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> are not analogous to the duties to be imposed by this clause, because those services are rendered by agreement between the Commonwealth and State Governments. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> may allow of unwarrantable interference with State officers, and in that way might prove vexatious. It should be struck out. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am astonished that in relation to a bill of this character some members of the Commonwealth Parliament should be concerned only for the State Governments. The Commonwealth, in order to make the payments in respect of which a default has occurred, must be able to get information regarding the exact amounts payable and the persons to whom the money is to be paid. The justice of that is obvious. Moreover that information may be necessary to enable the Commonwealth to recover the amounts it has paid. Surely a State cannot expect more than a fair deal. The Commonwealth should be in a position to recover the payments it has been obliged to make because of default by a State Government. After all, the object of this provision is to obtain information; to get at the truth. For instance, we have not been able to obtain from the Premier of New South Wales information that we have sought from him. The Leader of the Opposition has said that by agreement certain duties are performed by State officers on behalf of the Commonwealth. That is so; but when we are endeavouring to recover from a State government a certain sum that we have paid on its behalf, it may refuse to allow its officers to supply information to us. </para>

                        <para>- That might be possible, but when we are definitely accepting the liability of a State government, every facility should be given to the Commonwealth to enable it to recover payments made on behalf of that State government. I admit that the object of this clause could be achieved without the retention of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b;</inline> and therefore I am prepared to accept the amendment proposed by the honorable member for West Sydney to delete it. I wish to make it perfectly clear that I am not accepting the principle that the Commonwealth should not have power to impose duties upon State officers. It will be absolutely essential to insert in the other bill a provision which will enable the Commonwealth to recover amounts paid on behalf of a State government, and, therefore, I am not prepared to make the proposed amendment in that, bill. </para>

                    <para>. - The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> should inform honorable members why it is necessary to move that an appropriation of revenue be made in connexion with this bill. The committee is entitled to know what expenditure is likely to be involved. The Government was elected on a pledge to reduce expenditure, and already it is asking for authority to embark upon new expenditure. The money to be spent must come from the taxpayers, and honorable members opposite are always asking that relief be given to the taxpayers, and the alleged burdens lifted from industry. A government which is always talking of economy, and has reduced wages and living conditions, should be careful before involving the country in greater expenditure by introducing a measure of this kind. </para>

                    <para>. - I think we would get through this bill more expeditiously if the rather numerous amendments proposed by the Government were embodied in the text of the bill, so that honorable members could see just what was before them. Many of the amendments are consequential on the rearrangement of the previous bill into two separate measures. With very little trouble the bill could be reprinted, showing the alterations in black type. </para>

The amendments seem somewhat numerous, but many of them are consequential, and others have been rendered necessary because the Government has decided to give effect to suggestions offered by honorable members. Certain drafting improvements have also been made. </para>

                    <para>. - The Prime Minister says that Parliament could not spare the time to have the bill repainted so as to show clearly the effect of the proposed amendments. If it is a waste of time to do what is necessary to enable honorable members to understand the proposed legislation before them, then the Government might as well save as much time as possible, and suppress all discussion, allowing the decisions of the Executive to have the effect of law. Very few honorable members will be able to follow the effect of the amendments which have been proposed. It is always difficult for new members to understand amendments, and if honorable members opposite would speak their minds, they would agree with me that it is desirable that the course suggested by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> should be followed. The last Government assisted honorable members, particularly in regard to the taxation bills, by placing before them memoranda explaining the nature of the proposal. I venture a prophesy that, before we have finished with this measure, the drafting office will have sent forward a fresh batch of amendments. </para>

                    <para>.- This is the principal machinery clause of the bill. I suggest that there is such a close relation between clauses 5 and 6 that some reference to clause 6, and the amendments proposed to be made to it, might be permitted in discussing the present clause. I am opposed to this clause, because it provides what I consider to be an unnecessary method of securing money from a State. I do not desire to traverse all the ground that I covered during the debate on the second reading of the bill; but under this clause an extraordinary method of recovering money due by a State is provided. Some honorable members seem to have the idea that the last Government attempted to recover the money with respect to which the New South Wales Government had made default, and it having failed, it was necessary to bring down this extraordinary legislation. That is an entirely erroneous impression. </para>

                        <para>- The last Government issued writs against the New South Wales Government. There was some criticism as to the delay that occurred; but there was no unnecessary delay. My Government had a new situation to grapple with. After it had gone a certain distance with its legal proceedings, the Premiers Conference was held. At that conference, seven governments, including the Government of New South Wale3, were represented. The Premier of New South Wales attended the gathering, and discussed for weeks the .plan for financial rehabilitation, in which he joined. The various governments agreed unanimously to effect economies for the purpose of balancing their budgets, and then we launched the scheme for the conversion of bonds amounting to over £500,000,000 with respect to our internal debts. 1 submit that it would have been ridiculous for the Commonwealth Government to proceed with its litigation while the Premiers Conference was in progress, or during the period when attention was being directed to the internal conversion loan. My Government merely marked time while it was conferring with the various State Governments, because we hoped that the Premier of New South Wales would give effect to the plan. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> who, I believe, discussed, the plan earnestly, wanted the interest rates scaled down to 3 per cent. ; but he accepted the best terms he could get. That indicated to my Government that to that extent the Lang plan had been modified, and that the Premier of New South Wales was willing to fall into line with the rest of the governments of Australia in regard to the conversion loan. Therefore, my Government did not push on with the legal proceedings against New South Wales. </para>

                <para>Before we made the appeal in connexion with the conversion loan, the Premiers Conference appointed a special sub-committee, consisting of the Prime Minister, the Premier of New South Wales, and the Premier of South Australia, to endeavour to overcome the difficulties created by the default of New South Wales. The sub-committee met, in conjunction with the  Chairman  of Directors and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and the commissioners of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, because another outstanding matter was the closing of the latter bank. It was agreed to co-operate, so far as possible, in order to bring about the rehabilitation of the finances of Australia. My Government did not push on with the proceedings against New South Wales when that stage had been reached. Even in private litigation the delay often runs into months, and it is not fair criticism of the last Government to say that it allowed months to go by without taking steps to deal with the Government of New South Wales. Up to that stage, we had pressed on with our writs with as much determination as any other government could have displayed; we were determined to recover the money that was owing. I was glad to have the approval of the present Attorney-General (ifr. Latham), who admitted that every possible step was taken by my Government. In similar circumstances, I would again push on with an action in the court in the ordinary way. Do honorable members realize that in seeking to attach the revenues of the State by legislation of this kind we are doing a thing  such as caused war between America and Great Britain? We have ample power at present to take all necessary action to recover. A good deal of use has been made in this debate of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell's valuable book <inline font-style="italic">What Every Australian Ought to Enow.</inline> I wish that the Government had studied the book a little more closely in certain aspects. Had it done so it would have realized that there was no need for legislation of this kind. On page 35 of the book the author refers to the proceedings taken by the Commonwealth last year to recover money from New South Wales, and says - </para>

In those circumstances I think it is wrong for us to talk at this stage about what will be the next step after judgment is obtained.

                    Mitchell then quotes a Privy Council case to support his contention, and mentions the provisions of sections of our own Constitution in which officers of the State are referred to as Ministers and Ministers as officers of the State. Proceeding, he then goes on to say that -

                <quote>
                    <para>Section60 of the Federal Judiciary Act appears to have been carefully framed so as to ensure that an injunction against the State should be as effectively enforced as against subjects, whether corporations or individuals. It appears to recognize the difficulty of enforcing, in certain respects, an injunction fully against a sovereign entity and, for that reason, gives specific power to make the injunction against the State and against all officers of the State and persons acting under the authority of the State, and then power to enforce the injunction specifically against any such officers and persons. </para>
                    <para>I can see no reason why that last specific provision should be cut down so as to relieve an officer who happened to be the Premier or Treasurer, or any other highly-placed Minister of State, from suffering the ordinary consequences of contempt of court, if he were guilty of wilful disobedience of the injunction  . . I can hardly visualize all the members of the Ministry, especially the Attorney-General, flouting a mandatory order made against each of such Ministers in the State under section 60. Nor can I see how a Premier or other Ministers of State against whom such an injunction had been made under section 60, and who wilfully did execute acts in disobedience of it, could continue to act as a responsible adviser of His Majesty's representative in that State. Nor even if he advised such executive acts. </para>
                    <para>The Crown must obey the law, and it would be impossible for the King's representative to retain as an adviser a Minister who counselled the doing of executive acts in disobedience of an injunction against a State and such Ministers. There may be no modern precedent, but precedent is hardly required. On principle the matter seems clear, for what would any alternative view necessarily involve? That  His  Majesty's representative in a State should join or, at least acquiesce in executive acts which were in direct disobedience of a mandatory  order of the High Court made against such State and its Ministers of State. </para>
                    <para>That would certainly amount to a direct violation of the duty of His Majesty and his representative in every British Dominion to obey the law. Everything I have said is consistent with the Commonwealth or other party enforcing such repayment, and with the High. Court, on any such proceeding, making all reasonable allowance for Ministers bona  fide  attempting to carry out an injunction without dislocating government operations and providing for the same in any such order. </para>

                        <para>- Although I have made only brief extracts from the comments of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell on these important points, I have quoted sufficient to show that extreme care is necessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> observes that he cannot contemplate an executive acting in absolute defiance and disobedience of the High Court. In these circumstances, I think that the Government would be ill-advised to adopt this procedure against a sovereign State. It should arm itself with the authority of the court, obtained by the taking of legal proceedings in the ordinary way. It is not justified in asking Parliament to take judicial action. Parliament should confine itself to legislative action, and leave judicial action to the appropriate authority. It may be said that this would involve delay, because documents and witnesses may have to be obtained from various places. My answer is that if the Government desires Parliament to act, it should make the burden of proof not less, but greater .than in the case of a High Court action, for the reason that there are not in Parliament the trained legal minds that are to be found on the High Court bench. It is not sufficient merely to call upon this Parliament to declare by resolution that the liability of the State is so much. A decision of the High Court should be obtained on the subject. When mention is made of delay, it should be remembered that we have already devoted two weeks to the discussion of this bill, and another week will certainly elapse before the measure can be finally dealt with by Parliament. Surely it would be possible for the High Court, in an important case, to move a little more rapidly than usual. The Minister representing the Attorney-General in this chamber said in his speech, a day or two ago, that proceedings which involved the consideration of the constitutionality of this measure need not occupy very long; yet I have known of many long-drawn-out cases on constitutional points. But I do not confine my argument on the time aspect to the possible duration of the High Court proceedings on the constitutional aspect. When the court is called upon to deal with any action taken pursuant to this legislation, that is when an application is made for a declaration, every point will be called into question that would be involved if writs had been issued in the ordinary way. Every document necessary to prove the indebtedness of a State, and every other element in an ordinary legal action will come under consideration. I make one exception, to which I shall refer presently. In addition to that, the constitutionality of the legislation under which the action is being taken will be certainly questioned. There will thus he litigation on some points that would not have arisen if action had been taken under the existing power. I know that the Government will reply to this argument by saying that I have omitted to refer to clause 5 which purports to provide a short cut by declaring certain documents to be prima facie evidence. This bill seeks to enact that a certificate of the Auditor-General shall be prima facie evidence; but that is one of the hurdles that will have to be jumped very early in the piece. That provision is, in my opinion, unconstitutional. I do not for a moment believe that the High Court will accept as prima facie evidence a certificate of the Auditor-General. I know that provision is made in our customs, immigration and taxation legislation for certain affirmations to be received as proof of debt; but there is a vital distinction between those measures and this one. Surely it will not be argued that the constitutional power granted under section 105a is unlimited ; on the other hand, our powers in respect of immigration, taxation and customs and excise are unlimited, except that we may not, in our taxation law, discriminate between States or parts of States, or put two taxing measures in one law. Our power under section 105a is strictly limited to the carrying out of the financial agreement. There is nothing in that agreement which gives this Parliament power to declare certain documents prima facie evidence, and I do not believe that any judge of the High Court would agree that we have such power. There is, therefore, no royal road open to us. We shall ultimately have to proceed in the ordinary legal way. For all these reasons I submit that this procedure is wrong. There is no authority for the taking of such action. We shall meet the constitutional hurdle at the very inception of action under this measure. The biggest bar in the history of Australia will be briefed to test the validity of these provisions. In these circumstances, what becomes of the quick action ? It is a most dangerous thing to ask this Parliament to exercise judicial power. It will use such power if it declares how much a particular State owes to the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but a judicial process that will take much longer than the ordinary judicial process. It will not be the attaching of revenues or the issuing of a garnishee order after the taking of ordinary judicial action, but after the passing of a resolution by Parliament. I believe that the adoption of these extraordinary and unusual methods will arouse keen resentment. This will not be the taking of calm judicial action in the High Court, but the taking of action in an atmosphere of political suspicion. The Government should be content to take whatever steps are necessary in ordinary judicial procedure, and it should not seek to take this extraordinary action. We must read clause 5 in conjunction with clause 6. I know that the Government has indicated that it intends to submit several amendments, but these do not remove fundamental objections. Clause 5 creates the machinery, the basis of the whole thing. </para>

                        <para>- Clause 5 lays down the procedure as also, in fact, does clause 6 ; it is an alternative in case of urgency. Setting aside clause 6 for the moment, I submit that the methods that are employed in clause 5 will not effect a saving of time. Why then, should we adopt that legislation, particularly as a method is already provided in ordinary judicial procedure? The Government proposes to adopt the method of making a document prima facie evidence. That will be challenged immediately  on  the objection that the Federal Government, as a party to the Financial Agreement, is assuming a right of enforcement, which is not granted to the other six parties  to  the compact. The proposal is fundamentally unsound. It is wrong for the Commonwealth Government to sign a document entering into an agreement with the State Governments, and then to introduce legislation enabling it, in the event of a State Government defaulting, to adopt methods which are denied to the State Governments. If the Commonwealth defaulted, the Stateswould have to approach the High Court for a judgment, and for any other legal restraint that was necessary, and would have to prove their case. The Commonwealth Government should be compelled to take similar action. Then the people of Australiawould be satisfied that everything was lifted high above the taint of political interest's and vindictiveness. Matters would be raised to the calm, judicial atmosphere of the High Court, and the Commonwealth Parliament would be saved from the questionable procedure of enacting legislation to enforce the fulfilment of the conditions of an agreement knowing full well that the remaining parties to the compact were  powerless  to pass similar legislation to enforce its conditions against the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> concerned himself unnecessarily with his own reputation when he dealt at such  length with his Government's delay in issuing a writ against the State of New South Wales. I heard very little criticism of the previous Government on that score, and probably if the right honorable gentleman had not been at such pains to excuse himself in advance, such delay as occurred would not have been mentioned. He was entitled to assume that the promises made to him by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> would be honored, but having been grossly deceived, I am surprised that he should now believe that any measure short of compulsion would be effective in dealing with that gentleman, or any of his Ministers. The contention of the right honorable member for Yarra is that the Commonwealth should proceed by writ to obtain from the High Court a mandatory injunction, which, he said, no Minister would dare to disobey. Apparently he has a sublime confidence in the respect which New South Wales Ministers would have for orders of the court. I, on the contrary, imagine that those gentlemen would take the greatest delight in openly defying an order of the High Court, and in inviting the Commonwealth to get its money as best it could. The Leader of the Opposition said that this proposed legislation would delay the procedure by writ, and, if it should be declared invalid, considerable time would be lost. That is not correct. Action under this bill would not hold up procedure by writ. Writs have been issued already, and are proceeding in the normal way. </para>

                        <para>- And they will proceed irrespective of this legislation. But while the Commonwealth has recourse to process by writ, the Government believes that the legislation we are now considering will provide speedier and more effective means of compelling the Government of New .South Wales to meet its obligations.  Judgment  on the writs may not be obtained for twelve months, during which the revenues of New South Wales would be received and spent, thus rendering any order of the High Court abortive. The virtue of this legislation is that it will enable the Commonwealth to attach the revenue of New South Wales at its source, and before it is received by the State Government. The Leader of the Opposition also questioned the power of this Parliament to legislate in this Why for the enforcement of an agreement to which the Commonwealth is a party. He declares that no Parliament has a right to do that. He seems to have overlooked section 105a of the Constitution which reads - </para>

                <para class="block">That section expressly vests in this Parliament power to legislate to ensure the performance of the financial agreements. The giving of that power was ratified by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and the States and was approved by the people by referendum. It was also, I believe, supported by the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin).</inline> That same statutory power answers the right honorable gentleman's further objection that the Commonwealth Parliament, being a party to the agreement, should not exercise power to legislate for the performance of it, when similar power is not given to the States, which are the other contracting parties. .He complained of what he called the unilateral right which this legislation confers upon the Commonwealth Parliament. But power to legislate in this way was deliberately given to this Parliament by the States and the people, after full consideration. It was thoroughly understood that if laws should be necessary for the carrying out of the agreements, the National Parliament was the proper authority to make them. The right honorable gentleman's argument invaded the realm of constitutional law. I submit with all respect that it is futile for honorable members in this chamber to debate purely constitutional issues; the only sound course is for the Government of the day to take the best legal advice obtainable and act upon it. I deprecate the statement made too often in and out of this chamber, and repeated by the Leader of the Opposition to-night, that legislation of this character may be an incitement to civil war. Such words, if they have any influence at all, are calculated to provoke resistance  to the claims of the Commonwealth. </para>

Talk of this character is similar to that of fomenters of insurrection, who issue a warning that if their demands are not conceded, they may not be able to restrain their supporters. The majority of the people of New South Wales desire that that State shall act honorably and honestly; they do not approve of their representatives flagrantly violating their pledges. If this issue has to be determined by force, I am confident that the better element in New South Wales will stand definitely for the honorable discharge of obligations deliberately undertaken. </para>

                        <para>- The Government of New South Wales appears to have made up its mind to resist in every way possible the Commonwealth's just demands, and for that reason temporising by this Parliament would be futile. The majority of the people by their votes at the recent federal election showed that they desire the Commonwealth Government to deal with this matter resolutely, and I believe that the Government having entered upon the task of compelling performance of the Financial Agreement, will not be deterred by cheap sentiment such as has been repeatedly expressed during the discussion of this bill. A fair and proper contract was made, and the breach of ii is admitted. We need not anticipate trouble by saying that the court will nor accept the Auditor-General's certificate as prima facie evidence of the debt. Undoubtedly, the certificate will state the correct amount, and objections to prima facie evidence will be made merely for the purpose of defeating or, at any rate, delaying justice. As the objections by the Leader of the Opposition would, if accepted, defeat the purpose of this measure, the Government should not give way to them. </para>

He said that a writ, which is a process of law, would not be effective against the Government of New South Wales. He ignored the fact that the Scullin Government proceeded by writ against the State of New South Wales, and eventually as the result of that action the money then owing was fixed up. If there was any doubt of the efficiency of that process, why has the present Government issued writs against the State of New South Wales? </para>

                        <para>- What is the use of that if, as the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> has declared, one barrel is ineffective? Obviously, the Government must expect that both barrels will function. In several instances the opinions of some of the highest legal gentlemen in Australia have been obtained in regard to certain legislation, and when the law has been put into operation it has been found to be entirely ineffective. As has been stated during this debate, the opinion of one legal authority is often countered by the opinion of another legal authority. Many of the long drawn out cases in the courts are the result of this legal uncertainty. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> querulously touched upon the fact that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> stated that there might be a civil war in New South Wales as a result of any action taken by the Commonwealth Government under this provision. I am sure that the Leader of' the Opposition did not say that in any provocative way. Rather he suggested that there was a remote chance of civil war. If that should be so, it should cause this Government to halt. The Bruce-Page Government made mistakes in matters of this kind. It was responsible for the Transport Workers Act which has thrown the industrial life of this country into turmoil. On one occasion that Government set the law in motion to deport certain persons, but it did not succeed. This Government is continually telling us that a man who preaches class hatred and sedition is an enemy to Australia, yet it has introduced this provocative legislation in a country in which 300,000 workers are on the bread line. I warn the Government that its action is exceedingly unwise. We have been told to put aside party politics, and to take the broad view, but I ask the honorable member for Perth, the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> and the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> to visualize what would happen if this provision were applied to Western Australia. Indeed the honorable member for Swan has already expressed a fear in that regard. If the Federal Government attempted to compel the public servants of Western Australia to carry out its behest against the interests of the Government of that State, nothing short of a revolution would take place. I cannot help thinking that this proposed action on the part of the Government is a spectacular gesture in accordance with its promises on the hustings; otherwise why should it take this circumlocutionary  and provocative action ? </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable gentleman will find that his alleged short-cut will prove to be the longest way round. I do not know whether the Government intends to put this measure into operation when it is passed. The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> although he has occupied the seats of the mighty, has had years of experience of work among the lowly, and he seems to think that this provision is a most dangerous experiment. What will happen if a member of the Commonwealth Public Service is sent into the State tramways or railways offices of New South Wales to collect revenues? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> is a wonderful poseur. He has a large following in New South Wales and particularly in the thickly settled centres. If this legislation is enforced, he will pose as a patriot. He will say that he is standing for the rights of that State against the depredations of the Federal Government, and unless I am mistaken in my estimation of the ordinary psychology of mankind, he will create a feeling of hostility against the Federal Government. I urge the Government not to heed the views of its supporters who represent New South Wales and a»e anxious to hit <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline> They attend their own political meetings and are urged on by the New Guard or some other similar body. They hear the opinions only of those who are of a political complexion similar to theirs. We should consider the interests of Australia as a whole, and on this occasion the interests of the States as a whole. I cannot imagine any sane government proceeding with this legislation unless it has some ulterior motive. If this Government does not follow the ordinary procedure of law it will crash as did the Bruce-Page Government on two previous occasions. </para>

                    <para>. - The only "comment that I shall make on the speech of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> is that I do not think that he has read the bill carefully, because he devoted a good deal of his time to talking about what will happen if we place the officers of the Commonwealth Public Service into the tramway offices, or other offices of a State. The real object of this bill is to prevent anything of that kind having to be done. If the bill has any merit - which some honorable members opposite seem to have difficulty in detecting - surely it is that it offers no provocation to violence, or any of those dreadful things of which we have heard so much from the honorable member for Kalgoorlie. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I rose to deal with some of the points made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seullin).</inline> He put his case, as he always does, admirably, concisely, and logically, but he had much to say of the action that his Government took last year. He showed great sensitiveness to, and very much magnified, any criticism that has been directed at what was then done. Most of his critics have admitted that the right honorable gentleman took the right and proper course when New South Wales defaulted. The Government of which he was the head met the obligations of New South Wales, and promptly issued a writ against that State. The proceedings were withdrawn only when the Premier of New South Wales made, apparently, a complete change of front, and promised to meet the obligations that he had previously repudiated, giving an undertaking to conform to the plan that was then under discussion between the Commonwealth and the States for the balancing of budgets. The Premier of New South Wales also undertook to live within a limited deficit, as laid down by the conference, and agreed to reduce his expenditure by 20 per cent. I, therefore, dismiss that part of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, which was entirely due to over sensitiveness, arising, I suggest, from the fact that he now realizes that he might have been a little more energetic, and might have shown some of the initiative which the present Government is showing in dealing with the situation. </para>
                <para>The main point of the Leader of the Opposition was that, under clause 5, we were departing from the principles of having determined by the judiciary the liability of either a citizen or a government of this country. Whatever criticism could be levelled at clause 6 would be entirely wide of the mark if levelled at clause 5. What the right honorable gentleman contends is not possible under that clause. It provides that no action shall be taken against New South Wales or any other State until a declaration has been obtained from the High Court that the amount to be recovered is due and owing by the State to the Commonwealth. There  i3  no flouting of the judiciary, nor could any of the things suggested by the Leader of the Opposition happen under clause 5. The Leader of the Opposition said that the Government was attempting to accelerate the proceedings before the High Court, instead of adopting procedure taken by his Government last year, which was protracted and almost interminable. As the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> has said, the Government is in this instance proposing to take proceedings, first, by proving that an amount is owing to it by the State of New South Wales. It is provided under this measure that the Auditor-General's certificate is prima facie evidence of the amount owing, and the obligation is then on 'the' State of New South Wales to disprove it. The Leader of the Opposition has suggested that the action that we are contemplating will lead to no acceleration of proceedings, but let me say that, on the contrary, there will be a tremendous acceleration of proceedings. In High Court proceedings such as we are taking now,, and such as were taken last year, it is necessary to claim the amount that is alleged to be due, and the judgment of the court will be in respect ,of the whole amount claimed. A claim cannot be dealt with piecemeal. If, however, proceedings are instituted under the clause we are now considering, it will be possible to sue for a declaration that the whole or part of the amount claimed is due. When we have to deal with the present Premier of New South' Wales who, apparently, is prepared to take any legal objection in his power to occasion delay, there is certainly a very good chance of shortening the hearing by proceeding in the manner we propose. </para>
                <para>I pause here to say that it is amazing to find the responsible head of a State government taking advantage of every legal point to cause delay in determining whether his State does or does not owe money claimed hy the Commonwealth. I could understand <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> if he were quite honest, saying, " Yes, the Government of New South Wales owes the money, and I am prepared to allow the High Court to determine the amount owing, but I am not going to pay it, for the reasons set forth in this wonderful policy statement of mine." That might be decent and honest, but he should not descend to such tactics as trying to delay proceedings when everybody knows that some amount, at any rate, is owing. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> further suggested  that the Commonwealth  should institute High Court proceedings, obtain judgment, and then proceed to enforce it. It was unthinkable, he said, that we should act on the assumption that any Premier or government of a State might defy the High Court. That is a most optimistic view to take regarding a gentleman who has shown that he will stick at nothing; who has not hesitated to repudiate his obligations and forswear the undertakings given on behalf of his State. He has allowed nothing to stop him up to date, and it would be strange if he should hesitate to defy the High Court or, <inline font-style="italic">ia.deed,</inline> any other authority. </para>
                <para>There was one very remarkable feature about the speech of the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon. He read copious extracts from the book written by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell, K.C;, his purpose being to show that the collection of money due by a defaulting State should be really a simple matter. It was only necessary, according to the statement as quoted by the Leader of the Opposition, to obtain a judgment, and to do various things. When these were done, the money would flow into the coffers of the Commonwealth Government. The Leader of the Opposition read steadily, but I was following him from another copy of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell's work. One sentence on the page from which he was quoting, he omitted altogether, and that sentence is as follows : - lt might suit some highly placed Minister of State for ulterior purposes to pose as a martyr and go to jail rather than obey something the court had ordered - but which lie was politically pledged to oppose. </para>
                <para class="block">That omission by the Leader of the Opposition strikes me as remarkable. He read practically the whole of the page on which the sentence appears, and what he i Tad is now on record, and will be published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The sentence he omitted shows that even <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell's legal mind saw the possibility that there might be a State Premier who would desire to pose as a martyr, and even go to gaol in support of Ids policy. It is obvious that that is exactly what a man like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> might choose to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell has suggested various remedies to which the Leader of the Opposition attaches much importance; but there is no guarantee that those remedies will prove so effective as he thinks.. We must remember that there is a judiciary act, section 65 of which provides that no execution or attachment against properties or revenues of a State pan take place. It further provides that a certificate of the Registrar may require the Treasurer of a State to satisfy a judgment of the High Court out of moneys legally available. I remind honorable members that "moneys legally available" are those which have been appropriated by Parliament, and we have to ask ourselves how much money will be appropriated by the. Parliament of New </para>
                <para class="block">South .Wales, controlled as it is by a government which has already broken its obligations, if, as soon as the money has been appropriated, the Commonwealth can step in and attach it. Very little would be available from that source. Ii may be claimed that, under the recent amendment of the Constitution and the Financial Agreement, certain other obligations rest on the Treasurer of a State; but they are uncertain and difficult to define. If the Commonwealth attempted to proceed under those provisions it would merely entangle itself in interminable legal difficulties. I have great respect for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell, but after all, many other eminent legal authorities have given opinions contrary to his. </para>

                        <para>- I know the esteem in which the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> holds the Attorney-General, and I share it. It would not be possible to get a better opinion than the Attorney-General's, and the Government is fortunate in having his assistance and advice. There is a large body of legal opinion which differs from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell's opinion, that the Commonwealth would have no difficulty in recovering moneys due by a defaulting State. The Government has decided that it is necessary to provide more certain means of collecting moneys due. At the present ' moment, the committee is considering clause 5, and it cannot be claimed that this clause eliminates the judiciary, or even postpones its intervention. This clause provides that the Commonwealth must obtain a judicial decision, and having done so, may take certain steps to enforce the judgment. It is necessary to define the steps to be taken. It was never contemplated in the past that there would be a defaulting State, or that we would have to enforce remedies against a government which takes every step in its power to avoid paying. The action proposed is fair and equitable. Other clauses of the bill provide safeguards for the rights of individuals. Whatever may be said regarding clause 6, there is no justification for the assertion that clause 5 in any way flouts the judiciary. Such an argument might he applicable to clause 6, although I do not think that it is, but clause 5 is entirely distinct, and is, I contend, absolutely necessary, unless we are to get into a position in which a dishonest Premier of a State can repudiate all his obligations under the Financial Agreement. If that sort of behaviour spread to the other States it would undermine the whole financial structure that has been built up since the signing of the Financial Agreement, </para>

                    <para>. -  Honorable members . might reasonably have expected that, when eminent lawyers addressed themselves to this bill during the second-reading debate, they would have made its legal provisions clear, but instead of that they succeeded only in making confusion worse confounded. I understand that a law student, when seeking his degree, must write a thesis. After listening to the speeches of honorable members opposite, who are learned in the law, I am convinced that they are well-qualified to write an admirable thesis on the art of apology, if on nothing else. They sought to justify this bill, but how would they be received if they were to ask  His  Majesty to agree to a proposal that the judges of the courts should be both accusers and judges in one.  His  Majesty, [ am. sure, would turn a deaf ear to any such advice. It is no wonder that the people of this country are beginning to lose their respect for the law, when they see its chief ornaments paying such little regard to the principles of common justice. The honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holman),</inline> the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">((Mr. Nairn),</inline> the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Littleton Groom),</inline> and the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> have all spoken in defence of this bill, a measure which, even if legally valid, is repugnant to British sentiment. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The title of this bill should be changed. It should be called " The Record Bailiff Bill ", because it will create about 2,500,000 bailiffs in New South Wales. Every ratepayer and every taxpayer becomes a bailiff. I ask some of the legal luminaries opposite what will be the position of a taxpayer of New South Wales, whether he resides in New South Wales or not, if the Commonwealth Government succeeds in attaching the revenue received by New South Wales from taxation? It is well known that these taxes must first of all be assessed by the Taxation Department, and until then the individual taxpayer will have no idea of the amount due. If a taxpayer wishes to appeal against his assessment, he must, under the laws of the State, first lodge his tax; but under this bill he is required to pay both Federal and State taxes. What would be the position if the Commonwealth authorities attached the revenues received by the State from, say, butchers, storekeepers, wine, tobacco and motor licences? Suppose the State authorities informed the persons so licensed that unless they paid their licence-fees to the State, the licences would be withdrawn, and they would be prevented from continuing in business. Confusion would result as soon as an attempt was made to give effect to this legislation. What legal power has the Commonwealth to declare if New South Wales does not meet certain obligations, that those licences shall be issued. I say advisedly that this legislation was handed to the people of Australia as if it were a bouquet, but when the people realized its true significance, they found that it was only a posy of noxious weeds. This bill is but a smoke-screen to hide the insidious legislation that is to come in the form of tariff and other proposals. The Country party cannot escape its share of the blame for this action. Time after time it has abused the last Minister for Trade and Customs for the tariff schedules brought down by him. Let the members of the Country party now come forward and make amends for their shortcomings in this direction in the past. They have got the girl into trouble, and should stand by her. In the corner occupied by them, they have cried " wolf " ; but to-day the wolf is in that corner, and they now desire- the Opposition to help them to save the primary producers. This measure should have been served up with spaghetti, because it has a distinct Mussolini flavour. </para>

                    <para>. - The committee is indebted to the real Leader of the Government for the reply which he has attempted to give to the arguments advanced from this side of the chamber. He tried to answer the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition : but having gone only one-fourth of the way in that direction, he dismissed the whole matter with a wave of the hand. If he thinks that he can justify the Government's action so easily as that, I am sure that he is sadly mistaken. The right honorable gentleman had the hardihood to invite us to join in this debate in a spirit of sweet reasonableness, and yet, as a .member of the Government he proposes to attach the revenues of New South Wales for the purpose of meeting interest obligations to overseas bondholders. Twelve months of the worst period through which Australia has passed were spent by the right honorable gentleman on the other side of the world, so he knows very little of the circumstances that confronted this country during that time. He will not find the taxpayers of New South Wales anxious to part with their money so that it may be transmitted overseas, leaving them in a state of semi-starvation and bankruptcy. L do not suggest for a moment that civil war may result from the passage of this measure. </para>

                <para>It is suggested that the proposal in this clause is constitutional; but, after all, the people of New South Wales will have to provide the money that is demanded. It is useless to worry about the Premier of New South Wales or the members of his Government; -they are of secondary consideration, because the money required to meet the State's obligations must be collected from the taxpayers. Whatever our views may be on this matter, the money required must be put into the pockets of the people of New South Wales before it can be taken from them. My colleagues and I have discussed the situation from the point of view of the primary producers, who, as honorable members in the Country party corner know, have not the means of carrying further burdens of taxation whereby the payments due by New South Wales can be met. Other sections of the community are in a similar predicament; but I have no doubt that if certain commercial interests in New South Wales have revenues of any kind to assist the State Government in meeting its obligations overseas, that Government will provide the necessary legislative machinery whereby they can hand over their money, and then our friends opposite will he quite happy in regard to the overseas obligations of that State. Without giving any secrets away, all these possibilities are being carefully and quietly examined. The practical effect of this clause is a matter for consideration by the lay members of this committee, who have to consider whether New South Wales is in a position to make any payments of the character contemplated under this bill. I maintain that the taxpayers of that State will adopt the easy course, rather than resort to civil war, and simply refrain from paying. </para>
                <para>I have heard a good deal, during the discussion of the Premiers plan, of the alleged necessity for honouring agreements, and so on. What was the final decision of the Premiers Conference? It was that (the States should cut down their expenditure by  22^  per cent., and each State was left to effect economies in its own way. Anybody considering this matter in an unbiased fashion would admit that the method employed in New South Wales did not meet with the wishes of the political party opposite, which favours the policy followed in the other States. The utterances made in this chamber, and the speeches delivered at  banquets and in various public places by the political leaders opposite- </para>

                        <para>- The object of these remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> is to reply to the observations made by honorable members opposite that honest methods should be adopted by governments. The previous  speaker  had something to say, on this point, relative to the Premier of New South Wales. At the foot of the report from which I am quoting appears a reference which reads, "A.A. Dividends in arrears". That, I take it, refers to dividends declared but not paid. Those who feel impelled to discuss motives should ask themselves, first of all, whether their own motives and conduct are honest. They should- make a check of themselves before they criticize others. How much honesty is there in a business firm which declares dividends but does not pay them? </para>

                <para>It appears to me that the Government has introduced this bill because it feels called upon to do something spectacular. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has truly stated that if the Government acts in accordance with the provisions of this bill it will usurp the powers of the judiciary by taking action simply on a resolution submitted to both Houses of the Parliament. We have been invited to discuss this subject apart altogether from party political considerations; but I ask whether the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lane)</inline> and the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> will disregard all party- political considerations when the resolution to which I have referred is before the House. The appeal to consider this subject on a broad national basis will fall on deaf ears in their case. I suppose that in spite of everything that is being said, the Government, will proceed with this vindictive legislation. It has, no doubt, made this clause as vicious as possible. But that fact will in '.no way reduce our power or- prestige, as we criticize the Government ' here and elsewhere for this unwarranted action. I can visualize what will happen if this drastic measure becomes law, and unjust regulations are made pursuant to its provisions. The individual taxpayers of New South Wales will be the people who will suffer. This is an attempt to corner them and force them to meet commitments which they cannot afford to meet. In these circumstances, the people will take the only course open to them, and refuse to pay. </para>

                    <para>. - The necessity for the introduction" of this clause is easily explained. An attempt is being made to  insist that people shall honour their obligations and pay interest on the money that they have borrowed. That there is much confusion about the subject is shown by the remarks that have been made by honorable members opposite. It is also evident how dangerous is the. leadership of some of the honorable gentlemen who profess to be leaders of the people. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> has referred to a company, which he did not specifically name, but which, it is perfectly obvious, is a company with which I am personally associated. In discussing whether people should honour their debts, he quoted a note which appears at the bottom of a stock exchange list relating to " dividends in arrears." If the honorable member had grasped the significance of that note, he would have realized that this company has borrowed money, and that it will have to pay interest on the money so borrowed as it becomes due, even if it means the selling of every asset which it possesses. This company will be obliged to dispose of everything it has in the world, if necessary, in order to meet its obligations. The . "dividends in arrears " to which the honorable member has referred, are due to the unfortunate shareholders who are the proprietors of this company - the people who have invested their all in the company, and have received nothing in return. The company will have to pay every shilling that it owes, even if it means the loss of every asset it has. That is the true significance of the facts referred to by the honorable member. </para>

                    <para>.- Whenever we get into difficulty there is a tendency for us to rest too much on the advice of lawyers. We frequently get too much law and too little justice: I did not think that I should live to see the time when a Commonwealth Government would -try to bring force to bear on a State Government in the way that this Government is trying to bring force to bear on the New South Wales Government. I am very sorry that such a time has arrived. But we must remember that it is the people who will have to pay. This Government may say that it is attacking the Government of New South Wales for not carrying out its obligations, but it is really attacking the people of New South Wales. The result of an attack of this kind will be serious. Even a little more taxation in any of the Australian States will mean a very much bigger insolvency list. The Government does not seem to realize that it cannot draw blood from a stone. It appears to me to be very likely that the people will refuse to pay, as the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> has said. It has been demonstrated time after time that people will not submit to unjust taxation. I do not know whether the Government of New South Wales has borrowed any money from the United States of America, but if it has done so, it will be required, under existing circumstances, to send £179 back to that country for every £100 that it has borrowed. We know very well that every country in the world, except the United States of America, is saying, through its leaders, that it cannot pay its war debts. Even brave old England is in this position. Would any honorable member of this chamber dare to say from a public platform in this country that there is any justice in a financial system which requires the repayment of £179 for every £100 borrowed? I have had a long political experience, and I do not believe that any honorable member would dare to justify such a thing. Shylock is a gentleman, and Ned Kelly an archangel, in comparison with those who demand such repayment. I did not meet Ned Kelly in the flesh, but I was once mistaken for one of his colleagues. The <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> newspaper, at one time, made the statement that Steve Hart, a member of the gang, had been driven into Benalla under escort; but it was not Steve Hart, it was I. This was in the happy days of long ago. </para>

                <para>Various State governments have recognized that under existing conditions people cannot meet their commitments, and have passed moratorium legislation. We know very well what has happened in the past. A person may have desired an advance on a property valued at £3,500, and after an inspection of it by one or two agents, he may have obtained a loan of £2,000. But trouble has afterwards overtaken him so that he has bees  unable to meet his payments. Is it just in such circumstances to allow the mortgagee to foreclose ? No mortgagee should be allowed to foreclose unless he is willing to pay the difference between the valuation of the property on which he advanced money, and the amount due in principal and interest. If a simple law like this were enacted we should have very little trouble about foreclosures and forced sales. I do not think that the Commonwealth Government is justified in putting the bailiff in on 2,000,000 people. To do so will result in great hardship to tens of thousands of men, women and children. We should do some good if we devoted the time that we are wasting on this measure to devising means to relieve our unemployment problem. Why should we have these troubles ? God has not forgotten Australia; He has treated us bountifully, and we are able to produce three times as much food as our population needs. Let us get down to the job, instead of frittering away the time of the National Parliament on this legal enactment which will never be operative. God forbid that there should be any revolution in Australia; hut I point out that every revolution has been built up on a foundation of want and starvation. To-day there are 400,000 human beings who need and seek work in Australia, and have to live on 5s. a week. In England an unemployed man is paid 15s., and an unemployed woman 13s. a week, and they have the advantage of being able to buy Australian meat, wheat, butter, and other commodities much more cheaply and of a better quality than our people can here. Therefore the position of the unemployed in Great Britain is better than that of the unfortunates who are suffering in Australia. I am confident that if the people of the Commonwealth had the power they would not allow the creature called Parliament to pass such a measure as this. </para>

The people of New South Wales are not endeavouring to avoid their commitments. The trouble is that they cannot pay. As a public man </para>

                <para class="block">I possess the knowledge that my constituents, who are as honest as any honorable member sitting opposite, are not in a position to pay taxes, and have been compelled to seek an extension of time from the Taxation Commissioner. That condition of affairs also applies to business firms, municipalities and shire councils. I have in mind a municipality that is represented by the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill),</inline> the Manly Council, which has gone farther than any honorable member on this side, and stated that it will not pay its dues. People are neither able to collect nor to pay their dues, as there are so many who are unemployed and unable to meet their commitments. To assist the community generally, the Government of New South Wales has granted such persons extensions of time. Now the Federal Government steps in and, in order to harass the Lang Government, it proposes to take direct action, put in its bailiffs, and recover the money that is owed to it by the State of New South Wales. </para>
                <para>This matter must he regarded from the human point of view. Personally, I do not owe a penny to any man, but if the £5 or £10 that I received as a weekly wage for my labour as a working man was the only money that I possessed, and I owed that amount in taxes, it would be criminal for me to starve my children in order to pay that debt; and it. would be equally criminal for my creditor to accept payment of the amount while my children starved. That is the position in New South Wales to-day. Its Government seeks an extension of time in order that it may feed its people, recognizing that that duty must receive prior consideration' to that of the payment of interest to overseas investors. </para>
                <para>The framers of this bill have no human feelings for. the people of Australia. I say Australia, for, shortly, the whole of our States will be in a similar position to that of New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George and other Imperialists have acknowledged that the game is up so far as the payment of reparations is concerned. That is not the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> whom some consider an awful person, but whom I know to be one of the most humane individuals in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> considers the women and children rather than the wealthy bondholders overseas, the representatives of Shylock. </para>
                <para>The Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> is anxious to rush this legislation through, in order that he may return to London, where he has spent more time than he has spent in Australia. The honorable gentleman's sympathies are directed overseas rather than to the country that bore, but did not rear him. I assure him that my remarks are not intended in a personal manner. The position of the company in which the honorable gentleman is interested should improve in future, as its London representative will be paid by this Government. </para>

I shall say what I think is fit and proper when comparing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> with the individual who is trying to grind him down, and chase him out of public life by introducing a measure such as this, which may, as was stated by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> cause a revolution. I am curious as to how this Government will act. If it puts its bailiffs into New South Wales, it will have to arrest every State public servant who carries out the orders of his employers. The Victoria Barracks will quickly be filled. Then, perhaps, the Commonwealth Government will ask the people of New South Wales, who run contra to its desires to lock themselves up in their own gaols and provide for themselves. Or will it place these people on Garden Island, Cockatoo Island, or even in No. 4 Camp at Canberra ? In any case the process will be an expensive one. I am entirely opposed to this clause and to the bill generally, and I shall record my vote against it. </para>

                    <para>.- During the debate on this clause, and on <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> bill as a whole, much talk has been indulged in about the meeting of obligations. The measure proposes that action shall be taken to seize certain revenues of the State of New South Wales. Where does the Commonwealth Government imagine that that revenue is going now? </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Does it believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> takes it for his own personal use? If it takes some of the revenue to meet State commitments to overseas bondholders will this Government reduce the present rate of unemployed relief, cut pensions, or reduce the basic wage? If those are the intentions of the Commonwealth Government, the Labour Government of New South Wales and the Labour movement itself will fight them to the last ditch. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> stated that each of us should indulge in a little retrospection before we talked about other people honouring their obligations. Governments have commitments to their own people as well as to overseas bondholders. To-day I asked several questions of the Prime Minister regarding the obligations that he has incurred as a result of promises that he and members of his party made prior to the 19th December last. Are those promises to be lightly waved aside, because only unfortunate Australians are concerned? This legislation has been introduced solely for the purpose of disciplining the State of New South Wales, and in an endeavour to force it to sacrifice the welfare of its own people in order to pay interest to overseas investors. When I asked the Prime Minister to indicate when the Government would announce its policy for the relief of the unemployed, he brushed my question lightly aside. But the State Government, which has been charged by ministerial members with not having met its obligations, has, following representations by honorable members on this side of the chamber, agreed to provide rations for the thirty unemployed men in No. 4 Camp, Canberra, an obligation that should have been shouldered by the Commonwealth Government. Are the representatives of New South Wales who are supporting this bill prepared to tell their electors that the interest must be paid to overseas bondholders before the unemployed are fed? Are those who talk of equality of sacrifice and the honouring of obligations prepared to tell the returned soldiers that they and their dependants should accept reductions of their pensions by as much as 80 per cent.; whilst the bondholders are to be repaid, not merely what they lent to Australia, but much more? I entered this Parliament only a few months ago, not because it offered an easy position for -me, but in the hope that I should be able to do something to assist the people who sent me here, and I shall not sit idly by whilst an anti-Labour Government in this Parliament attacks the people of New South Wales merely because a real Labour Government occupies the treasury bench in that State. I shall oppose every endeavour by the anti-Labour forces in this Parliament to compel the Government of New South Wales to lower the social conditions of the workers. As the honorable member for West Sydney said, we have no desire that civil war should occur in Australia, hut the men of New South Wales have not forgotten how <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> fight, and if the opponents of Labour in this Parliament are cowardly enough to" use their position to attack the unfortunate unemployed in that State, and their women and children, they will find, there, men who are prepared to fight in defence of  the  liberties and working conditions of the New South Wales people. I say frankly and definitely that somebody must stand up for the people of Australia and protect the conditions of the workers against the demands of overseas bondholders. We have a leader in New; South Wales who is prepared to do that, and many thousands of followers will stand solidly with him. This legislation will probably be enacted by force of numbers, but honorable members must not imagine that the Commonwealth will then need only to stop into the Treasury of New South Wales and take what it requires. If honorable members from other States attempt to ride roughshod over the people of New South Wales and break down the social and industrial conditions for which the workers fought- in years past, probably many of the marauders will not leave the State alive. I ask honorable members to examine the facts for themselves; if they do so they will find that the Government of New South Wales is not only doing more than any other government to provide food, shelter and clothing for its own unemployed, but is also giving relief to the unemployed from other States. The New </para>
                <para class="block">South Wales Government is not refusing to meet its obligations ; it is endeavouring to redeem every promise it made to the people who placed it in office. If honorable members opposite desire the State Government to pay the overseas interest bill, they should use their influence to induce the tory members of the Legislative Council to withdraw their opposition to the legislation by which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> endeavoured to rectify the financial position of the State. If that legislation be enacted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> will be prepared to balance his budget and meet the State's overseas interest liabilities. But members supporting the Commonwealth Government want to compel the people of New South Wales to work longer hours, and suffer a reduction of the basic wage, and the loss of widows' pensions and childhood endowment. Because the State Labour Government is not prepared to sacrifice its people the Commonwealth Government declares that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> must be disciplined. He and his Ministers are under no delusions regarding the present social order. Despite the endeavours in all countries of the world to prop it up, it is failing rapidly. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> who is the most far-seeing statesman that Australia has ever produced, realizes that the existing evils can be cured only by a complete reconstruction of the social order. Of what avail are the professions by honorable members opposite of their sympathy with the unemployed, and their talk of restoring confidence? The confidence of whom? Of the unemployed in No. 4 camp, whom the Commonwealth Government has refused to feed? The confidence of the <inline font-style="italic">men and</inline> women in New South Wales, who are suffering because of the policy of the Federal Government? No; confidence is to be restored to men like the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lane),</inline> who prior to entering this Parliament was a time-payment collector. After all, the people who are the real mediums of production in this country are those who count, and I say candidly that if this Parliament can do no more for the people than it has. done during the short period for which I have been a member of it, we should consider whether Parliament itself should not be closed down, and the cost of it saved. When I return to New South Wales at each weekend, I tell the electors what I am telling this committee, but other representatives of that State are not prepared to repeat in their electorates the speeches they deliver in this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I exclude the honorable member; whether he speaks in this Parliament or in his electorate, nobody understands him. Many honorable members may sincerely believe in the existing social order, but I ask them not to be blind to the facts. They should consider the existing position calmly, not in the spirit of vindictiveness which prompted the introduction of this bill, and then ask themselves whether representatives of New South  Wales  are justified in voting for a measure which, if effect can be given to it, will not only smash the "Labour Government in that State, but also will bring ruin to every resident of it. I believe, however, that New South Wales will be powerful enough to resist the effort of the Commonwealth and the other States to enforce their will upon it. Wo, who are opposing this legislation, do not want serious trouble to develop; we ask honorable members to realize that the Commonwealth Government is attempting to justify its election promises by making a spectacular attack upon the Labour Government of New South Wales. That policy is not wise, and I ask honorable members to reject it. </para>

                <para>Mr.RIORDAN (Kennedy [9.43].- Clause  5  suggests that the Government is seeking to follow up its threat during the last election campaign that if the United Australia party were returned to power in this Parliament, the New South Wales Labour Government would be sent to the electors within a month. That prediction has not been verified. Honorable members opposite have failed to upset the verdict of the people of New South Wales given fifteen months ago, and likely to be repeated less than two years hence. Is the Commonwealth entitled to put a receiver into the Treasury  of  any State? Obviously, the purpose  of  this legislation is to enable the Commonwealth to collect, not from the State Government, but from the already harassed taxpayers. If a New South Wales taxpayer desires to appeal against his assessment, he must first lodge the amount of his tax with the commissioner. Under this legislation that will be an offence; he will be required to pay his tax to the Commonwealth Government, but to establish  his  right of appeal he must also pay to theState Government, and by the time the appeal has been disposed of, his money will have been spent by one of the governments. How will he fare then ? This bill applies not only to New South Wales but also to other States, and if any State cannot meet it's interest obligations the Commonwealth Government will have power to put a receiver into the Treasury of that State. In addition, if the  Commonwealth  Government defaults, the States may take similar action against it, but, if such a position arose, the press of the Commonwealth would be unanimously opposed to this legislation. What is the position  of  many of the Australian Governments to-day? What is owed by the land-owner or the primary producer in deferred taxation as a result of his inability to pay? The amount outstanding is nearly £3,000,000. Would members of the United Australia  party in this chamber be prepared to put receivers on the holdings of landowners who are unable to pay, and, if necessary, to foreclose on them? In New South Wales and Queensland, -because of the big drop 'in the price of wool, thousands of primary producers are not in the position, to pay taxation. Only recently Ae Taxation Department put a receiver on a selection out west in an endeavour to collect the amount of tax outstanding, which was retrospective to 1919, and the assessment was made by the department in 1926, after the taxpayer had passed through five years of drought. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> introduced this  bill, and then ran away from it. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> then took charge and he ran away from it to Geneva. Before the bill is passed by this Parliament, the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> who now has charge of it, will flee to safer quarters in London. What is the trouble in this country to-day? </para>

                    <para>- That is an obsession with some honorable members. Most of our trouble has been due to the cry of stinking fish on the part of the members of both Federal and State legislatures. The position of New South Wales to-day will soon be the position of the Commonwealth and. the other States. We have to meet this year an interest bill of £59,000,000. The more we throw people out of production the more revenue we lose. The year before last we expended about £8,000,000 for unemployed sustenance". This year we have expended about £12,000,000, and next year we shall need to expend about £15,000,000. At the same time, we have to meet a big interest bill. The Commonwealth as well as the States is drifting on to the rocks. To-day it is the turn of the State of New South Wales. To-morrow it will be the turn of some other State.. This Government, instead of passing harassing legislation bristling with difficulties, would be better engaged in making provision for the employment of our people in industry. The high cost of transport is ruining the very people upon whom we rely for revenue to meet our interest payments. The attention of the previous Government was drawn to the exorbitant shipping charges on our primary products, particularly wool, and yet no action was taken to compel the shipping companies to give relief to the wool-growers. Australia has lived on the back of its sheep for many years, but cannot do so for ever. The mining industry is languishing. There is a clamour for gold, which is bringing £7 an oz. What effort' is being made by the Government to encourage the mining industry, and to put this country on the road to progress? The Cabinet or the Loan Council meets the bankers, who stress the fact that the note issue must be curtailed, otherwise inflation will be brought about. They say, " We must dismiss more men and take a few more shillings from the unemployed : to provide employment we must substitute a 48-hou.rs week for a 44-hours week". The only effect of that would be to throw more people out of work. How is the money owing by a State to the Commonwealth to be collected? I remember the incident of the Warwick egg, which hatched the Federal Police Force. Is that police force capable of enforcing penalties under this legislation ? Is the police force of New South Wales likely to accept instructions from the Commonwealth? This Government says that it will put a receiver into Th: banks of New South Wales, but if I am any judge of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> he will not put his money in the banks. He is a wise bird. We have, since the opening of this Parliament, wasted nearly a month in beating the air. The bill is not worth the paper on which it is printed, and is so much humbug and rubbish. In any case, I do not think that the High Court would give a decision in opposition to the voice of the people. </para>

Whatever the rights or wrongs of this proposal may be, it is only fair that ample time should be given to the parties concerned. No doubt the Government has the numbers to pass the bill as drafted, but, in order to place on record our protest against this attempt to proceed with undue haste, we shall divide the committee. In its indecent haste to clutch the revenues of a defaulting State, the Government would not allow the party proceeded against a reasonable time to enter an appearance. </para>

                    <para>. -  The suggestion of the honorable member is entirely unfounded. The clause provides that three days' notice shall be given, but that refers to the notice to the Attorney-General of a State. This action is to be preceded by a motion, and there is no necessity for extending the period of notice. Three days is sufficiently long for the Attorney-General to enter an appearance, and, if further time is necessary, the court, at its discretion, may grant an extension. The honorable member's suggestion that this is an attempt to restrict the time allowed for the preparation of a defence is a reflection on the court, not on the Government. </para>

                    <para>. -  The clause provides that the application shall be heard by the Full Court. That is the direction which Parliament proposes to lay down, but it insists that the court shall consist of not less than three justices. The actual number of justices to sit to hear the motion will be determined by the Chief Justice. The Government attaches such importance to this matter that, in addition to providing that a Full Court  of not less than three justices shall hear the application, it allows the Chief Justice to exercise his discretion as to the availability of the judges, and I should say that, in a matter of such importance, every available justice would be required by the Chief Justice to sit and hear the application. </para>

                    <para>.- I think the most convenient procedure will he to discuss the whole clause before dealing with the important amendments that are to be proposed. As originally drafted, the bill provided that the Attorney-General "may" apply to the court for a declaration. The provision was not mandatory, and even if the Attorney-General did decide to apply, there was no time limit upon his action. One amendment which I shall move later enacts that the Attorney-General " shall " within a period of two months, apply to the court for a declaration that the amount claimed is due and owing to the Commonwealth by the State concerned. The other important amendment provides that, at any time after the resolution has been passed by both Houses of the Parliament, the Attorney-General for the State concerned may, entirely at his own discretion, and at. any time, make application to the court for a declaration that the amount is not due and owing by the State. </para>

                        <para>- I have already dealt with proposed new sub-clauses 3 and 4. Proposed new sub-clauses 5 and 6 provide that any application under either of the last two preceding sub-clauses shall be made by motion, of which not less than three days' notice shall be given, and that the application shall be heard by a Full Court consisting of not less than three justices. Under sub-clause 6 an application is made to the court, and it gives a declaration that a certain sum is due and owing. Under sub-clause 5 it is provided that when the court makes that declaration, resolutions may be passed by both Houses of the Parliament; but under sub-clause 6, the resolutions will have preceded the declaration of the court. Sub-clauses 7 and 8 set out that after the declaration by the court, it will not be necessary to go through the whole of the procedure outlined in sub-clause 5, that having already been done. Subclause 9 merely provides that clauses 7 to 13 of the bill shall cease to apply if the court declares that no amount is due and owing by the State. </para>

                    <para>.- Although the amendments to clause 6 constitute an attempt to meet some of the criticism offered to the bill, they do not remove the fundamental objection that may be taken to this clause. The criticism levelled against the bill has resulted in numerous amendments being submitted, and to that extent it has not been in vain. As this clause was originally drafted, it provided simply for a certificate by the Auditor-General, resolutions by both Houses of the Parliament, and action to attach the revenues of a State. It was pointed out by a number of speakers during the second-reading debate, beginning with myself, that under the bill no approach to . the court was provided for; but now it is made mandatory that the Attorney-General shall make application to the court within two months. That, however, does not meet the fundamental objection that this Parliament is being asked to take judicial action, and declare, without recourse to the court, that certain money is due and payable by a State. It is one of the greatest outrages ever attempted upon the sovereign rights of a State, under any federation, for a Government to assume the right, merely by resolution of the Parliament, to declare on the certificate of the Auditor-General that a State owes a certain amount, and then to proceed to attach its revenue. </para>

I am not pleading merely for a recognition of the rights of the States; but such rights as they have ought to be respected. I believe we should have one sovereign power: but we should bring about the necessary change by the will of the people, who accepted the Constitution, and not by a resolution of this Parliament. If we do something which is either unconstitutional or suggestive of sharp practice, it will be resented by the people. I indicated, in discussing clause 5, that alternative methods of achieving its object were available to the Government. I made certain quotations from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell's book, <inline font-style="italic">What Every Australian Ought to Know,</inline> and I told the committee frankly that I had made excerpts from his observations. I understand that the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> endeavoured to convey the impression that I had deliberately suppressed a passage that was of some significance. I have never been guilty of knowingly suppressing any part of a quotation relevant to a matter under discussion, and I resent the right honorable gentleman's suggestion.

If that is the best case that can be put up for this class of legislation, all I can say is that the Government is hard pressed for arguments. This is the urgency clause, which it is obvious the Government proposes to use. It violates every fundamental principle of justice between equals. There is no authority in the agreement for it.

This is legislation not to enforce an agreement, but to amend the agreement. It gives to the Commonwealth powers not given to the States, which are partners to the agreement. I am not offering any defence on behalf of any particular State, nor am I attempting to justify default. There are already ample powers to deal with defaulting States. Merely because we desire to reach one State we have no right to deprive the States of their undoubted rights. Such legislation only invites resentment and resistance. Should the Government persevere with this one-sided legislation it must accept the full responsibility for the consequences. </para>

                <para>The making of those laws is directed to the carrying out of the agreement by the parties to it. The clause has to be read in connexion with whatever powers and authorities are contained in the Constitution. Therefore, whatever additional authority can be given, under section 51  (xxxix),  dealing with " matters incidental to the execution of any power vested by this Constitution in the Parliament," can be called to our aid. We have to remember that section 105a (3) must be read in conjunction with the fundamental structure of the Constitution - the distribution of powers under three headings, namely; the legislature, the judiciary and the Executive. The Commonwealth is entitled to call to its aid whatever additional powers are contained under the heading of the general executive power. It is sometimes difficult to know how far the executive power goes, or the limits of the judicial power. The position is set out in <inline font-style="italic">Sidgwick's</inline><inline font-style="italic">Elements of Politics</inline> in the following terms : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>It is not always easy to draw a distinction between executive and judicial power. It is sometimes difficult to decide whether a particular act is judicial or ministerial. Sometimes the executive  has  to perform coercive work as a preliminary to or before, or apart from the decision arrived at by the judicial power - such as service of process and execution of warrants of arrest. Sometimes the coercive work of the executive consists in carrying out the decisions of the Judiciary, such as the imprisonment or execution of an offender and the enforcement of a warrant of distress. In these instances the coercive interference of the executive, either as essential preliminaries to or consequences of judicial decisions, frequently necessitates the exercise of judicial functions and thus renders the distinction between executive and judicial duties ambiguous, since executive officers, in so acting, have to interpret the law in the first instance, and the decisions after they are given. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Clause 5 makes it clear that so far as the determination of the liability of the _ States is concerned, it is a judicial power that is exercised, the power being vested in the High Court. I mention incidentally that this clause when amended will provide, as does the preceding one, that the Full Court shall consist of at least three justices. In section 23 of the Judiciary  Act  it is set out that on a question affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth at least three justices must concur in the decision. My view is that that section of the Judiciary Act will have to be read in conjunction with this legislation. In. constitution al matters, it will be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Judiciary Act. Wo must bear in mind the distinction between the judicial power and the executive power. Clause 6 provides for the issue of a certificate by the Auditor-General, which shall be regarded as prima facie evidence before the Court. The effect is to make that certificate equivalent to an affidavit or other prima facie evidence of a debt. Both Houses of Parliament must then by resolutions approve and adopt the certificate. The resolutions are to contain the words : " and that by reason of urgency it is desirable that the provisions of sections 7 to 13 inclusive of this part should apply." That is an approving power, not the exercise of a judicial power. This clause amounts practically to an invitation by the Executive to the Houses of Parliament to join in an executive act. How do sections 7 to 13 apply? A proclamation is issued under clause 7, on the issue of which a debtor to the State is immediately affected under clause 9. The Commonwealth is then in the position to sue for, and recover, any moneys owing by any person to that State, and becoming payable during the currency of any proclamation, which, if received by or on behalf of the State would have formed part of the specified revenue of that State. We thus arrive at a position in which the Commonwealth is able to sue a debtor of the State in order to recover moneys owing to the State. That liability is imposed upon the debtor without the intervention of the judiciary up to that point. The question then arises as to what power can be conferred upon the Executive to issue any executive proceedings of any kind to enforce a debt before any judicial proceedings are taken. In the old English law there is a procedure somewhat analogous to the procedure in the preceding clause. In Halsbury's <inline font-style="italic">The Laws of England</inline> it is stated that - </para>

                </quote>
                <para>In clause 9 the Commonwealth is issuing a process against a debtor's debtor - the taxpayer owes the State a debt, and the State owes the Commonwealth a debt. The position is similar. Extents in chief are now comparatively rare; they were formerly the Crown's favorite method of recovering its debts. Extents in aid were practically abolished by the Extents In Aid Act of 1817. The only species which it is worth while to discuss at length at the present day is the immediate extent in chief iri the first degree. In this procedure there is the affidavit of debt and danger, &amp;c. A judge of the King's Bench Division, on the production of the affidavit - and, if the debt be by bond, the bond - signs his fiat, and the other steps follow. Apparently the amendment is intended to overcome the complaint that judicial procedure has been omitted. The amendment has been proposed to make it obligatory, in the enforcement of the debt, under this clause, to adopt judicial procedure. In other words, the fundamental debt, upon which the execution is being taken, is to be a matter of judicial determination. To that extent, therefore, the judiciary is being brought in. </para>

                        <para>- It must be within two months. The point is that provision is made for a judicial determination. When, an application has been made to a court, it is open for a State to raise any issue, such as that the money is not owing, that the Executive has not complied with the provisions of the act, or that the act under which action is taken is not constitutional. But all those questions are capable of speedy determination. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I do not know the reason for this omission in the proposed amendment. No means is being provided in this clause, apparently, to follow up the declaration of the court. The intention of the bill as amended appears to be directed towards the preservation of the distinction between the Executive and the judiciary. It is not unusual in State acts to provide executive remedies to preserve rights. Probably this is the intention of this clause. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause has been substantially amended by the Government in an endeavour to meet the points that have been brought out during the discussion of the bill, to safeguard as far as possible the right of the Commonwealth to recover money due to it from the States, and also to protect the States against unfair or unwarranted action on the part of the Commonwealth. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> was not in the chamber when I quoted from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell's book a sentence which the right honor able member had omitted to quote. The right honorable gentleman has suggested that it is quite wrong to contemplate that a State Government might not obey an order of the court, and my quotation was intended to show that even <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Mitchell had contemplated the possibility of a State Premier making a martyr of himself by standing rigidly by his principles in defiance of the, judicial authority. The suggestion that the head of a State, or a State Minister, might decline to obey the law is, therefore, not so outrageous a thing as the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition would have the committee believe it to be. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I disagree with the right honorable member that the parties to the Financial Agreement would not have signed it if they had had such provisions as these before them. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that they would not have attached the slightest significance to them. It did not occur to any of the representatives of the governments which made the Financial Agreement that the Commonwealth or a State would do other than stand honorably by its obligations. Any suggestion to the contrary would have been scouted, and, consequently, no one at that time contemplated or foresaw the need for such provisions as these. </para>
                <para>It has been suggested that this clause in some way flouts the judiciary, and is an assumption of judicial power. Whatever may have been said when it was optional for the Commonwealth only to go to the court, there can be no possible ground for that objection now that a State can approach the court the very day after resolutions have been passed in this Parliament. The eventual judicial determination of the issue is thus provided for. </para>
                <para>Another objection urged strongly by some honorable members is that the Commonwealth proposes to collect a debt before the court has decided that it is owing; that there is no precedent for such a course.  That is utterly ridiculous. The bill only provides for something which is taking place every day in this country. Have honorable members forgotten the power that this Parliament gives with regard to the collection of taxation? The Government makes a  demand upon the citizen for the payment of income tax. If the individual declines to pay, he has recourse to the courts, but that does not prevent the Government from taking action against him to recover the money which Parliament says is owing. That is an exact analogy of what is provided for in this bill. This Parliament declares by this bill that certain money is owing to the Commonwealth. Under its provisions officers authorized by this Parliament will demand payment of that money. If the debtor declares that he does not owe die money, and appeals to the law to protect his rights, this Parliament is not debarred from authorizing its officers to take the money from him before the court has given a decision upon the issue. That is exactly what will happen under this  bill. The final determination, of course, will be with the judiciary. If the court finds that no money is owing to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Government has immediately to refund what it has taken. The Commonwealth, however, is entitled, as it is under ordinary taxation laws, first to recover the money from the State. If, eventually, the judiciary determines the issue, and finds that the money is not owing, the Commonwealth must refund it, just as it is obliged to do in the case of the ordinary taxpayer. This principle is necessary for sound government. It is followed in the United States of America. In the American Constitution there are the same divisions as we have iii our Constitution - the Executive, the legislature and the judiciary. The position in the United States of America is stronger against anything of this character than it is here, because embodied in the Constitution of that country is a provision that no money shall be taken except in due process of law. Yet again and again the courts of that country have re-affirmed the right of the State - and by the State I mean the Government, whether of the Federation or a State - to recover taxation by distraint, or other means, before a court has given any decision, and before, it can bo said that action is being taken in due process of law. The reason is that administration becomes impossible if the recovery of moneys by a government can be delayed until there has been a judicial determination of the amount that is due and owing. It has been suggested that this clause disregards a principle. It does nothing of the sort; it merely  give3  the Commonwealth power to recover, with expedition, moneys due to it. I refuse to accept the argument that was advanced by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> as to the character of this legislation. It is for this Parliament to determine whether it is necessary for. the Commonwealth to have the power to take definite action against any State that defaults. If that is determined by Parliament there is no flouting of the judiciary nor any disregard of any established principle. </para>

                    <para>.- In a* plausible way the right honorable the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> airily brushed aside, and failed to face, the important issue before us. The right honorable gentleman referred to the powers possessed by the Commonwealth Government in connexion with a taxpayer who disputed his assessment. He declared that as it could compel him to pay, pending a judicial determination, <inline font-style="italic">ipso facto,</inline> similar action could be taken with a State. Does the right honorable gentleman propose to deal with a sovereign State as he would with a subject of the Crown ? That is the fundamental difference. I have already pointed out that there is no analogy. The Commonwealth Government possesses extraordinary powers with regard to taxation, immigration, and customs and excise, and it has to take drastic measures to make the application of those laws practical. But that is a transaction between government and subject. I submit that the Commonwealth Government does not possess power under section 501a or 51 (xxxix), or any other section of the Constitution, to carry out this enactment. Seven sovereign governments have entered into an agreement, and the Commonwealth Government contemplates proceeding against one party, at the same time taking to itself power to take similar action against any of the other six. Where in any agreement between individuals or governments can be found the right to enforce that agreement in the manner that is here proposed? The right honorable gentleman said, " Of course the State Governments would have signed the agreement if such a provision had been incorporated in it originally, because not one of them contemplated default." That was no answer to my question. Supposing that the Commonwealth had had the foresight to put such a provision in the agreement,  does  any honorable member believe that the States would have accepted a contract that gave to only one party the power to enforce this provision, denying to any State, an equal partner to the agreement, the power to pass similar  legislation? Is it feasible that the States would agree to a certificate being issued by the Commonwealth Auditor-General as to the amount that was owing by a State, when similar action could not  be  taken by a State Auditor-General with regard to a Commonwealth obligation? Yet the right honorable gentleman has the hardihood to tell this Parliament that the States would willingly have agreed to such a proposal. The assumption is that the Federal Parliament dominates, and that the State Parliaments are the subjects of the Federal Parliament. The whole thing is too ridiculous for words. Actually we are dealing with partners to an agreement who possess equal rights with the Commonwealth. I watched the proceedings of the Premiers Conference, and I saw the difficulties encountered by the right honorable gentleman, who presided, in dealing with the States, which were exacting to the last degree. I know how jealously the States guard their rights. We have a Constitution, which we must uphold. This provision will apply to other States as well as to New South Wales. It undermines the whole federal system. We hear it said that hard cases make bad laws. Here is an example of a bad case making hard laws. </para>

As a representative at the conference at which the Financial Agreement was drafted, I can support the declaration of the Assistant Treasurer that the States would have embodied in that agreement the principle contained in this measure, because of the protection which it affords the States. My signature is attached to that agreement. It is true that the State representatives did everything in their power to protect State interests, and to ensure that they should not be placed at a disadvantage by the withdrawal of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment. Each State representative endeavoured to obtain the best for his State. I was opposed to the abolition of  the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment because that system  was  considered of advantage to the State which I represented. As a member of  the  conference I say, emphatically, that all the State representatives, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> would have agreed to the principles embodied in this measure being included in the agreement, principally because of the action of the Commonwealth in assuming responsibility for  the  States' debts. </para>

                        <para>- I say, emphatically, that as the Commonwealth was standing behind the States in the matter of giving a guarantee to the bondholders, and obtaining better terms and improving the credit overseas, the representatives of the States, would not, as the Assistant Treasurer has stated, have objected to what the Leader of the  Opposition  says is an interference with the rights of the States. At that time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> was prepared to meet all his commitments. Had it  been  anticipated that the Commonwealth would have to make payments on behalf of a State the States would have given the Commonwealth all the power it required, seeing that it was taking over their responsibilities in the matter  of  debts. Unlike the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition, I speak with experience. The arguments advanced by the Leader o£ the Opposition to the effect that in matters of this kind there is a distinction between a . State and an individual surprises me. Does he suggest that an individual should be subject to Commonwealth law, and that a State should not? Does he contend that it is within the power of the Commonwealth to collect income taxation, or any other form of revenue from an individual, and that it should not have the power to collect moneys due to the Commonwealth by a State ? If the Commonwealth has power to collect from a resident of the Commonwealth, it should also have the power to collect what is due to it hy a State. These arguments have been advanced in order to prevent the recovery of money due by a defaulting and dishonest State Government and, apparently, to make it easy for such a State Government to continue to default. </para>

                    <para>. - It would appear from the arguments advanced by the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> that the clause as originally drafted was defective. The Government now considers that it is necessary to obtain a judicial decision in order that the law may be effective. In the meantime it is proposed to employ the powers which the bill provides for the issue of a certificate by the Auditor-General supported by a resolution of both Houses before proceeding to confiscate the revenue of a State, regardless of the' difficulties that may be created. It is now clear that a judicial decision is necessary in the final analysis. Notwithstanding what may he said to the contrary, I submit that no State representative would allow the Commonwealth to go to the bank with which his State did business, and confiscate the State's funds in that institution to satisfy a debt due by it to the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister, when Premier of Tasmania, would not have supported an agreement giving the Commonwealth such extensive powers. There is a distinct difference between an individual and a State. Why should the rights of a State be protected hy its Constitution if they are similar to those of an individual?

The course adopted by the New South Wales Government, under the present circumstances, will be supported by a majority of the State electors. The easiest way in which to arouse the interest and attention of the people is to pass legislation which detrimentally affects their interests.

                    <para>.- As I stated during the debate on the second reading, it was my intention to oppose this clause on principle. We have heard a good deal concerning the constitutional powers of this Parliament and the Financial Agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the States. We have to remember that conditions have altered since that agreement was adopted. Had the States retained the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment, they would have been in a better position than they are to-day, but more than one of the Premiers sold their States and accepted the Financial Agreement, because it made finance easier for the first few years. Every action that is possible within the law should be taken to make the Government of New South Wales meet its. commitments. I shall' endorse whatever action the Government can constitutionally take to compel New South "Wales, .or any other State, to meet its liabilities. I do not know whether the Commonwealth can seize the chattels of an individual, to satisfy a debt due to it. The 'Commissioner of Taxation must sue  for a debt that is due. We are adopting by this legislation a procedure that may prove exceedingly dangerous in future. These powers to deal with a government deliberately defaulting and refusing to make any effort to meet its obligations may be used when the default is not wilful. The present circumstances in New South Wales are extreme, and I would endorse almost any action in accordance with ordinary legal procedure to force the State Government to pay its debts. But I do not approve as a general principle the setting aside of the usual processes of law and the empowering of the Commonwealth to seize the revenues of a State without prior recourse to the High Court. This bill contains an impertinent provision that if in the subsequent proceedings before the court a decision is given that the Commonwealth is not entitled to the money it has seized it shall merely hand the amount back to' the State without compensation. Apparently, the court will not have power to award even costs against the Commonwealth. I desire to uphold State rights. I realize that in the hear future several of the States may experience difficulty in meeting their obligations. The powers which this clause purports to give to the Commonwealth are not restricted to wilful default on the part of a State. I hope that the Government will not try to force through the chamber legislation of this dangerous character. The present Prime Minister is trustworthy; but I am not prepared to give to any government power to demand of States that are in. financial difficulties, "Hand over your railways ". </para>

                        <para>- The State railways are a liability only because of the interest and sinking fund charges. If the Commonwealth could take over the railways of New South Wales without those charges, it would soon recover the interest which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> has refused to pay. Time after time this Parliament has arrogantly entered fields which are closed to it by the Constitution. The Commonwealth Parliament was never intended to create an Arbitration Court to deal with almost every industry throughout Australia. The sooner we withdraw within the limits of the Constitution, the better. This bill could be used to bring about unification. Frequently, Ministers when introducing legislation, think only of how they intend to administer it. For instance, the Customs Act gives power to impose embargoes under certain conditions. Parliament when conferring that power could not define all the articles to which the embargo might be applied - including, say, indecent literature and pictures, spurious coins, and drugs - but subsequent governments took advantage of that general provision to impose prohibitions against all sorts of imports. That is an abuse which Parliament never intended. </para>

                    <para>.- On other occasions in this chamber, and during the period that the Commonwealth Parliament sat in Melbourne, we have had exhibitions of justice from different governments, but particularly the Bruce-Page Government, and more recently the Lyons-Latham-Bruce Government, even common sense being sidetracked in order to attack this or that section of the community. When the Bruce-Page Government was not attacking a section of the working class it was attacking a primary or secondary industry. The latest tariff schedule brought down by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> affords a further illustration of this tendency. Meanwhile the present Government is carrying on a war of hate against a certain gentleman in New South Wales. Apparently it has become obsessed by the cranky and futile schemes of this man, and is quite prepared to sacrifice that or any other State in its determination to " get " him. It can see nothing else but him. It cannot see the federation, or the constituent parts of the federation. It cannot even see the Financial Agreement, which was solemnly entered into by seven different parties. That agreement laid down clearly and definitely the different powers that were  to be invoked under it. Each of the parties to it possesses certain rights, and no one party has rights greater than those of any other party. This bill, however, not only assumes rights, but takes what it has not the right to enforce or to attempt to bring into operation. </para>

                        <para>- Knowing the hon-  orable  gentleman, and the methods which he adopted as Premier of Tasmania to rid that State of the problems that confronted it - and they were many - I can only conclude that he would probably be the most conservative party to such an agreement. The honorable gentleman has been caught up in a whirlpool of political rancour and hatred. He does not see  even his own State. Heaven forbid that he should ever lose sight of it. It has remained for the Parliament of that State to draw his attention to its continued existence, and its ardent desire to remain a party to the Financial Agreement into ' which it originally entered, not to one which usurps the rights and privileges of the various parties to it. Responsible men in the Parliament of the State have made strong speeches in condemnation of clauses 5 and 6, which are now so hotly defended by the honorable gentleman. So far as I can learn, not one voice was raised in the Tasmanian Parliament in praise of the steps that are now being taken by the Commonwealth Government. This is not the first blunder' that that Government has made, and I do not suppose that it will be the last. The Premier of Tasmania is not obsessed by the futile and foolish tactics of one party to the agreement, nor blinded into doing what may or may not have the effect of compelling the Premier of New South "Wales to recognize his responsibilities and obligations. He realizes, as do we who sit on this side of the House, that the legislation which we are now considering will have more far-reaching effects than the " getting " of somebody who for the time being has gone mad. </para>

                        <para>- On the motion of the Premier of Tasmania, the State from which the Prime Minister comes, but which he has forgotten very quickly since taking up his residence in Canberra, the Tasmanian Parliament to-day adopted a motion " viewing with grave concern the far-reaching and dangerous nature of the Financial Agreement Enforcement Bill ". This gentleman is a conservative Premier; he is almost as conservative as the Prime Minister. It was agreed " that the bill would place the State in a most lamentable position if, at any time, through causes over which the Parliament had no control, it was unable to meet  it3  obligations ". I venture to assert that if the Prime Minister were to take this bill to-morrow to a meeting of the Loan Council, that body would not agree to it. I am fortified' in that opinion by the observations that have been made by the Premiers of Western Australia, Queensland, and, last but not least, Tasmania. Thus at least three of the parties to .the agreement condemn the extraordinary methods that are being adopted by this Government to bring about an enlargement of the powers of one of the parties to it, an enlargement that was never contemplated when the agreement was consummated and never agreed to by the parties to it. I am perfectly certain that the honorable gentleman would have a majority of the Loan Council against him if he submitted the measure to them. </para>

In opposing this legislation, I have in view the protection, not of State rights, but of federation. The Government has but to intro- duce another bill as drastic as this and federation will indeed have been dealt a great blow by the Federal Parliament. We cannot afford to be parties to legislation of this character. The Prime Minister has made certain statements  as  to what he would do and would not do, but I challenge him to withdraw the bill temporarily, and to submit it to the Loan Council for its approval. As a party to the Financial Agreement, the Loan Council has that right. We are accepting the responsibility for the payment of the debt of a defaulting State, and the rest of the States have exactly the same responsibility. As parties to the agreement, they must stand side by side with the Commonwealth so long as the Commonwealth. Government proceeds along sane and safe lines. In this instance, the Commonwealth Government is adopting a high and mighty attitude. It is acting as if it were the only party to the agreement. In the circumstances,I cannot see my way clear to support the bill. </para>

                <para>Mr.RIORDAN (Kennedy)  [12.15  a.m.]. - After the passing of this bill one can visualize the Prime Minister and the Assistant Prime Minister, headed by the Assistant Minister for Defence, marching on Sydney to collect the revenue of New South Wales. The Prime Minister stated to-night that had this clause been in the Financial Agreement, when it was put before the Premiers Conference, he would have accepted it, as would the Premier of New South Wales. If I remember rightly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> who represented New South Wales at that conference, opposed the formation of a loan council, and actually refused to sign the agreement. He said that he was not prepared to place the finances of New South Wales in the incompetent hands of the then Treasurer, the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> At that time there was a Labour Government in power in Queensland, and had this clause been in the agreement the Premier of Queensland would not have signed it. When this clause becomes operative, the Financial Agreement will become a very one-sided instrument. When the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> suggested that consideration of the bill be postponed for a few days so that a meeting of Premiers might be called to consider it, the Prime Minister interjected that the Government might as well refer the bill to a city council for an opinion. He added that he was accepting responsibility in the matter. I remind him that legislation of this kind is not so much his concern as that of the States. </para>
                <para>This bill was introduced more than a week ago, and now the Government comes down with a sheaf of amendments almost as large as the bill itself. It is stated that the amendments are to be moved by the Prime Minister. Which, I ask, is the Prime Minister, the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> or the right honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> ? The bill should be referred to the representatives of the States for consideration before this Parliament passes it. There is likely to be a change of government in Queensland within the next few months, and who is to say that, under this measure, the same treatment will not be meted out to the new Queensland Government as is now intended for the Government of New South Wales. </para>

                    <para>. - The fact that the Opposition has not called for divisions on a number of clauses does not indicate its approval of those provisions. Clause 11 embodies some of the principles contained in preceding and subsequent clauses. We have discussed those principles at considerable length, both on the second reading of the measure and in committee, and I propose to call for divisions on clauses 11 and 12 as a protest against a number of clauses the principles of which the Opposition cannot endorse. </para>

                    <para>.This clause should be omitted, for many reasons. The honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holman)</inline> considered that its provisions were invalid, and the same opinion lias been expressed to me by other legal practitioners. The clause cuts right across the Loan Council procedure, and is unnecessary; in fact its inclusion in the bill would make the legislation of this Parliament look rather ridiculous. The Financial Agreement provides that the Loan Council may raise moneys and allot them among the various States. By a unanimous agreement, the moneys may be allotted as the Loan Council may determine, but in the absence of unanimity they must be 'allotted according to a certain formula. It would be extraordinary if the Loan Council, after allotting certain moneys, issuing treasury-bills in respect thereto, and requesting the Commonwealth Bank to cash the bills, then seized the money in satisfaction of a debt incurred* through the default of a State. A much more simple procedure would be to make no allotment to the State in default. That was done by the Loan Council during the regime of my Government. I do not know whether an allotment was refused in respect of money for public works, but moneys for the purpose of meeting revenue deficits were certainly withheld from New South Wales. I submit that if moneys may be withheld after allotment there is no need to make an allotment. I cannot imagine any loan moneys being allotted to a State which has declared that it does not intend to pay its interest bill. A State which would make that declaration would more likely also refuse to repay any principal due by it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and that was a proper procedure. It seems to me to be ridiculous for the Loan Council to allot moneys, for the Commonwealth Treasury to issue bills, and for the Commonwealth Bank to cash the bills, only for the Commonwealth Government to seize the cash in the event of default by a State. Why go to all that trouble? I shall oppose this clause because I think it is unnecessary. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause has been inserted for the purpose of imposing additional hardships on New South Wales. If the Loan Council authorized the issue of treasury-bills and the Commonwealth Treasury subsequently issued them, the part of the issue to which New South Wales was entitled would be backed by the productive capacity and other resources of the State. At the last meeting of the Loan Council, Tasmania and Western Australia insisted upon having  their share, despite the fact that they have not lived up to the terms of the so-called Premiers plan by balancing their budgets. As honorable members know, those two States have been receiving subsidies because of the alleged difficulties that they have suffered under federation. All this has been to the detriment of New South Wales, and it is  beyond  my comprehension that some of those who represent the Mother State should approve of a law which is designed to penalize New South Wales. If the Loan Council provides certain moneys for defined public works, those moneys should be expended, so that the works may be completed and made revenue-producing. The proposal of the Commonwealth Government will throw thousands more into unemployment, and those who represent the State of New South Wales should resist it. There should be no restriction of the works programme that was approved by the last meeting of the Loan Council. </para>

                        <para>- I know what is in the honorable member's mind. He should cultivate a broader outlook. I have  repeatedy  stated that the major portion of our costs is due to the enormous rate of interest that is charged on borrowed money. The annual wages bill of the New South Wales railways is £9,000,000, while interest on that public utility amounts to .£7,000,000! Wages were reduced and employees were rationed, but the interest rate was left untouched. The honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. John Lawson)</inline> is the only honorable member opposite who has been frank in this matter of costs. In his maiden speech in this chamber he admitted that those engaged in industry have already made adequate sacrifices. I remind the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchin)</inline> that special authorities have been set up to determine rates of wages. This Government declared that it would not interfere with that procedure. I remind honorable members opposite that the Bruce-Page Government was defeated on that issue in 1929. Honorable  members who represent New South Wales have a duty to perform to that State. They must give its Government an opportunity to complete the public works that it has in hand, otherwise many more will be thrown out of employment. </para>

                    <para>. - It is absolutely necessary that the Commonwealth Government should have power to deal with moneys that have been allocated to States by the Loan Council. In normal circumstances the Loan Council meets prior to the commencement of the financial year, to determine, among other things, how much money can reasonably be raised to meet the programmes submitted by the Commonwealth and the States, and a .unanimous decision is come to concerning the allocation of the amount available. The figure for the present year was approximately £9.000,000. The money was raised by issuing treasury-bills, which were discounted by the Commonwealth Bank, and the different States received instalments of their allotted proportions. Upon the dissolution of Parliament in November last, an arrangement was made with the Commonwealth Bank to continue the payments until January, when a new government would be in power. The bank then agreed to finance a loan programme on the basis of that formulated for the first eight months of the year, and to find the necessary amount, some £2,100,000. That money had already been allotted to the States by a unanimous decision of the Loan Council, which could not be reversed other than by a further unanimous decision. Obviously, it was impossible to obtain the consent of New South Wales to such a reversal. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The- Leader of the Opposition asked whether it was necessary. *for the Commonwealth Government to issue treasury bills, intimating that the Commonwealth need not borrow the money. The Financial Agreement provides that if the amount desired can be borrowed within the terms that the Loan Council lays down, the Commonwealth Government shall make reasonable efforts to raise it. There was no question of the Commonwealth being under no obligation to obtain the money. Further, New South Wales had to receive its due  proportion  of whatever amount was raised, in accordance with the original allocation. It is obviously a stupid position which provides  that a State government that had declined to pay its interest commitments, land probably will not repay the capital, must receive its proportion of any further moneys raised. This clause gives the Commonwealth Government power to retain any such moneys that come into its possession on behalf of a defaulting State. </para>
                <para>The right honorable gentleman also raised the point that the State of New South Wales would not claim this money. Appearances go to prove that that State would not hesitate to claim the money, for in its counter-claim to the writ that has been issued by the Commonwealth Government it makes a claim for the whole of its instalments for the balance of the year, on the ground that they are moneys that the Commonwealth is under an obligation to pay over to the State. </para>

                    <para>. - As a representative of New South Wales I do not desire to give a silent vote on this clause. Such a provision is absolutely necessary. If when the Financial Agreement was drafted the possibility of a State refusing to pay its interest liability had been considered, a safeguard of this kind would have been inserted in the agreement itself. There should be some provision in the Agreement, or in the legislation relating to it, to give the Commonwealth power to retain moneys raised by it for a State which has defaulted.

                <para class="block">Under that provision New South Wales would be entitled automatically to a certain proportion of the money available. Obviously, but for the Financial Agreement, a dishonest State which would not pay interest would be unable to borrow from outside sources. In those circumstances, it is outrageous that money raised by the Commonwealth because of its reputation for good faith and integrity should be automatically handed over to a defaulting State. Although I am a representative of New South Wales, I have no hesitation in supporting the clause. </para>

This is a matter of vital concern to everybody, because if the cattle herds are destroyed by this pest the meat and milk supplies of every city in Australia will be jeopardized. If the Commonwealth Government recognizes its responsibility to protect the credit of the whole of the Australian people against default by one State, I hope that it will appreciate also its obligation to ensure that the tick pest shall not spread throughout Australia. </para>

If the tick reaches the south coast there will be no milk for the starving children for whom members of the New South Wales Labour party profess so much sympathy. When rinderpest entered Western Australia the Commonwealth Government went generously to the assistance of the State government. It has a similar responsibility in regard to the tick menace. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask the Prime Minister also to take particular care to exclude from the operation of this clause any works of particular concern to members of the Country party. For instance irrigation works may be in progress, the holding up of which, through lack of loan moneys, may interfere with land settlement and prevent the supply of vegetables and other products to the starving women and children in the cities. Throughout the consideration of this measure the members of the Country party have shown a merely sectional interest; they have adopted a hypocritical attitude, but when other members express concern regarding the effect of this legislation upon the electorates we are refused any consideration by that party. </para>

As a medical man he must know the effects of withholding the necessaries of life from the people; yet regardless of the consequences to the health of the community, he is prepared to send overseas money that is required to buy food, clothing and shelter for the people. His attitude varies on different causes, according to the interest at stake. I ask the Prime Minister to exercise the greatest care and discretion in the administration of this measure, so that the right honorable member for Cowper may obtain his pound of flesh. The needs of other sections may be disregarded, but at all costs let us protect the interest of country members. </para>

                    <para>.As we proceed from clause to clause of this drastic bill the fact becomes increasingly evident that the Government is determined to get its pound of flesh from the State of New South Wales, regardless of the suffering entailed. Not only are the revenues of the State to be confiscated, but loan moneys on their way to the State are to be arrested by the Commonwealth, and national works that are in progress will have to be discontinued. The right honorable member for Cowper spoke in defence of country interests. I do not represent only miners; there are approximately 25,000 rural electors in my constituency. Portions of the electorate have no proper water supply, and have to rely on tanks, which breed mosquitoes and disease. Extensions of the water mains have been promised, but if the Commonwealth withholds loan money from the States, such works cannot be proceeded with. The people in many country towns in my electorate and elsewhere are suffering in health through the inadequate water supplies, and if the Government operates this legislation it will prove that its members are stark, staring mad, in their vindictive political prejudice against the Lang Government. </para>

                    <para>. - I protest against this proposal to confiscate State Government funds which may he in any of the private hanks. Evidently the Government will stop at nothing in its determination to go on paying the present exorbitant rates of interest to overseas bondholders. If this clause is passed, the money belonging to ordinary citizens will not be safe. Even the savings of the people in the Commonwealth Bank are threatened. The members of the Government are behaving like burglars and embezzlers. They will be robbing' the poor boxes next. </para>

                    <para>.- I protest against this clause, which provides that at. any time during the currency of any proclamation the Treasurer may serve upon the chief executive officer of any corporation carrying on the business of banking, a notice requiring him to render forthwith to the Treasurer a return of the amount of the balance standing to the credit of the State to which the proclamation relates. That is grossly unfair, and will be deeply  resented  by the people of New South Wales. I am certain that the citizens of Australia would never have accepted the financial agreement if they had thought that the Commonwealth Government was to have power to do what is proposed in this clause. I remind the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchin),</inline> who has been interjecting freely, that his own State may shortly be in the same position as New South Wales. . The Premier of Tasmania, when asking for £80,000 recently, said that, in carrying OUt the Premiers plan, his Government had taken £300,000 out of circulation, and if they took another £1, financial collapse would follow. As a matter of fact, Tasmania is proportionately further behind in its payments than New South Wales. The Premier of Western Australia stated recently that it was all very well to say that they could do this or do that, but, - in the final analysis, who was going to pay their interest bill and feed their unemployed? Of course, honorable members opposite are not concerned with that. To them the feeding of the unemployed means nothing. There is not the slightest doubt that before very long some of the other States will be unable to meet their commitments. In Queensland, under the Moore Government, wages .have been reduced, and the standard of living brought down to the coolie level, but the unemployment problem has not been solved. Before long the bailiffs will be in every State in the Commonwealth. To whom is the Treasurer going to give the job of collecting the revenue of defaulting States? Perhaps he proposes to give jobs to members of the New  Guard, under the direction of " Little Eric". The Government  is rushing  blindly into this matter, actuated by political prejudice against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline> During the election campaign, honorable members opposite declared that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> was an incubus which must be removed. Some even went so far as to take vows that they would eat their hats or their boots if they did not shift <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang;</inline> but he is still there. He is too astute for all of them. He will be there when the whips are cracking, and he has behind him the solid support of the people of New South Wales. </para>

                    <para>.Honorable members opposite are treating this matter lightly, but they will realize before they are through with this legislation that it is serious. When this bill is passed it will be possible for the Commonwealth Government, merely by resolution of Parliament, and without a judgment of the High Court, to call upon the head officials of a bank to hand over the banking account of a State. What will be the position of a government operating on that account in order to carry on essential social services? The funds of a State Government may be seized and transferred to the Commonwealth without any proof being estab- listed that the money is owing. It is an outrageous proposal. The bank may refuse to hand over its client's money without an order of the court. On the other hand, it may accept the view that this legislation is valid, and, under section 109 of the Constitution, overrides State law. It may, therefore, hand over the funds of a State Government, and thus cause great inconvenience and loss to that Government, and suffering to the citizens of the State concerned. Moreover, as was pointed out by the honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Baker)</inline> if this legislation is proved to be invalid, it ceases to be an act, and, in the eyes of the law, never was an act. Therefore, there will never have been any authority for the bank to hand over the funds of the State, and the State Government may sue, not only for the recovery of the money, but for damages as well. Honorable members on the other side who are such champions of the banks might pause and consider where the Government is heading. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause is similar to the regulation clause to which we objected in the preceding bill. As a matter of fact, it goes further than the clause in the other bill, because it involves, not only Ministers of the Crown, but also " officers and persons employed by the State." If the Governor-General is permitted to make regulations involving the welfare of State officers who owe allegiance to the State Government, a grave position may arise. I ask the committee to vote against the clause, because I do not think it is fair to give such extensive powers to the Executive. </para>

                    <para>. - It is obvious, even in the last stages of the debate, that this measure is specifically designed to operate against the present Government of New South Wales. The contention of the Minister in charge of the bill that the provision is intended only to enable the matter to be reconsidered by the Premiers at the Loan Council is not borne out by fact. If that were the purpose, why should the bill continue for two years? I assure the Minister in charge of the bill that in spite of him this measure is the greatest advertisement that my party can have politically, and that it will help us considerably more than he imagines in the struggle that lies before us. </para>

Prosecution on indictment would proceed only after full consideration by the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General; therefore the permission of the Treasurer was thought unnecessary. However, there is no objection to the suggested amendment, and I, therefore, ask leave to amend my amendment by omitting the word " summarily ". </para>

                    <para>.Being entirely opposed to this bill, I am naturally against a clause which prescribes penalties for breaches of its provisions. If the Government considers that a summary prosecution, involving a fine not exceeding £100 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both, is  so  serious that it should not be undertaken without the consent of the Treasurer, surely a prosecution upon indictment, involving a fine not exceeding £500 or imprisonment for a  term  not exceeding two ' years,  or  both, should not proceed without permission. That is why I asked that the qualification "summarily" should be omitted from the proposed subclause 4. </para>

                    <para>. - This proposed new clause is unusual in that it empowers the Treasurer  to  decide whether an offence shall be prosecuted. As the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> has clearly shown that this legislation is introduced from political motives, it is possible that his decisions regarding prosecutions will be influenced by similar considerations. </para>

                <para class="block">A prominent person recognizing his obligation to the State might pay his taxation to the State Treasury instead of to the Commonwealth, whereupon the Commonwealth Treasurer, viewing the matter only from one angle, would instruct that he be prosecuted. If a person be guilty of an offence let him be prose- . cuted without the intervention of the Treasurer, who may be influenced by political bias. The proposed new subclause creates an undesirable precedent, and I shall vote against it. </para>

I understand that there is in Canberra a deputation from the tobacco-growers, and I have no doubt that it will suit their convenience to wait upon the Minister before the discussion on the report takes place in this House. </para>
