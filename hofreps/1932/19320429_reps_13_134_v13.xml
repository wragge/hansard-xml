Relief committees in the Hunter electorate' have applied to the Salvation Army for clothing, and have been informed that none is available. Will the Government see that sufficient clothing is made available to these committees for the relief of the unemployed during the winter months? </para>

                        <para>- As soon as it becomes available part-worn and surplus military clothing is handed over to certain charitable organizations 'which are prepared to bear the expense of distributing it. Owing to the attitude of the Government of New South Wales, which has refused to issuesuch clothing, the Commonwealth Government has arranged with the Salvation Army to distribute clothing in the country districts in that State. I regret that at the present time very little clothing is available for distribution. </para>

                        <para>- I applied to the Department of Defence for clothing to be made available to the more important centres in the Hume electorate, and was advised that the Salvation Army was the approved distributing agency. When I applied to that organization for informationregarding the towns which had been supplied, I received a reply that clothing had been distributed in industrial centres only. I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence to inquire into this policy, and,  if possible, instruct that clothing be sent to country centres also. </para>

                        <para>- In most of the States such councils already exist, and the Commonwealth will have the right to nominate two representatives to serve on each. In New South Wales the Commonwealth Government will not be able to co-operate in that way with the State Government. As only Commonwealth money is to be expended in that State, the council to be appointed there will represent the Commonwealth alone. Probably the council will consist of five members, whose duty will be to investigate proposals for the expenditure of the grant, but the personnel has not yet been decided. </para>

                        <para>One of the by-products of the discussion of European indebtedness to America has been the discovery of repudiated debts in certain American States. No onehas so far asserted that the Federal Government has ever ignored its obligations, but particular sins of the States, especially those of the south during the reconstruction era, have been brought to our attention, especially by writers in the British press. Why should America be so harsh to Europe when we have many claims outstanding against us? </para>
                        <para>But it appears that there is astain on the British shield as well as upon that of South Carolina and other American commonwealths. The adroit Italia n intellect has uncovered it. </para>

How, then, does the right honorable gentleman reconcile his statement that Great Britain has never repudiated a debt with the passage that I have quoted? It is stated that at2½ per cent. compound interest this unpaid debt has now accumulated to a sum which would liquidate Italy's debt to England, and the whole of the debts of the European nations to America. </para>

It is the parliamentary practice to require honorable members to vouch for the accuracy of the newspaper reports on which they base questions, but in the majority of cases, of course, it is impossible to give that assurance. </para>

                        <para>- The passage which the honorable member for Hunter (Mr. James) has just read from an American' magazine, merely confirms what I said the other night as to the honour and integrity of Great Britain. In endeavouring to show that Great Britain has acted in regard to her creditors as discreditably as certain of the American States, all the writer could do was to go back nearly 600 years to the days of Edward III., when, it is alleged, the King borrowed money from the Republic of Florence, a State which no longer exists. I remind the honorable member that there was then no " Great Britain " ; it was centuries later that the United Kingdom came into existence. It is regrettable that the honorable gentleman should try to support unfounded charges as to lack of integrity on the part of Great Britain, and give countenance to inaccurate and ludicrous statements. </para>

                    <para>.-I do not regard the passing of these clauses as merely a matter of form. If a man is absent from his duties without good reason it should not be overlooked. A fairly good salary has been fixed for the  chairman  and members of this commission, and we ought to ensure that the country will receive good service in return. What part of their time will these persons be required to spend at their broadcasting work? Nothing is said about this in the bill. For what part of their time may they absent themselves </para>

                    <para>.- Has not the power of the Minister to make regulations been taken from him by reason of certain amendments that have been made to the bill? It appears to me that any regulations will be drafted by the commissioners, who will undoubtedly take care to protect themselves. We desire to ensure that listeners and taxpayers generally will be protected. It is not our wish to make easy jobs for the political friends of the Government A man may absent himself from his duties for twelve months, and it may not be possible to take action against him. We all know how difficult it is to terminate the services of a person for inability, inefficiency, or misbehaviour. </para>

                    <para>. - I am opposed to the amendment. If we are going to appoint this commission to do the job why should we tie its hands? At first I favoured an amendment of the clause to provide that the action of the commission should be subject to the approval of the Governor-General, but after consideration I thought that inadvisable; that it would be  wiser  to leave the appointment to the commission itself. The responsibility of carrying out this important task will be on the commission, and it would be most improper to subject that body to political -control. Already it is provided that the salaries to be paid to the general manager and certain others are to be approved by the Minister. I should prefer to see the words " Governor-General " substituted for " Minister ". It is well that we should specify exactly what is desired. I reiterate that it would be most unwise, after, appointing the commission to do the job, to tie its hands and allow the Government to step in and make this appointment. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the amendment. It is only reasonable that the Federal Ministry should appoint the general manager. The success of tine broadcasting commission will depend largely upon the sort of person selected to act as general manager, particularly as the Government appears to have the idea that the members of the broadcasting commission will be in a position similar to that occupied by the board of directors of an insurance company. Apparently members of the commission will meet only once a month or once every two months, and the executive work will be ,in the care of the general manager. The right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> rightly pointed out that the federal Minister appoints the Governor and the  Deputy  Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, two officials who perform work that is infinitely greater than that which will be allocated to the general manager of the broadcasting commission. </para>

                    <para>. - I suggest that the interests of the community are amply safeguarded by the present wording of the clause. We have decided that a commission shall be appointed to control broadcasting, also that there shall be a general manager and competent staff to carry out the technical details of the scheme. The two bodies appear to me to be quite separate. It is especially desirable that the general manager and staff should be thoroughly competent, and this clause provides that the members of the commission shall cast about for the very best brains available for the executive positions. There is the implied safeguard that after the desired personnel has been located their appointment shall be approved or otherwise by the Minister, or in other words, the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment moved by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> conclusively proves his inconsistency. Throughout, the endeavour has been to free the Australian Broadcasting Commission from political control. The bill was temporarily withdrawn last March because it savoured too much of political control. Re-adjustments were made, and the Minister was deprived of many of the powers that previously were allotted to him. Now the right honorable member for Cowper desires that, after an efficient body of men has been selected and paid high salaries to act as the Australian Broadcasting Commission, they are not to be deemed competent to select a general manager; the Minister or parliamentary machine must do that for them. Yet I must congratulate the right honorable member for Cowper on seeing the light. Gradually he is coming round to our point of view, and shortly he will make the statement that he believes in the nationalization of this and other great public services. Although of a conservative disposition, he has a secret hankering for nationalization, but he lacks the courage of his convictions. This party does stand for nationalization, and it does not attempt to humbug and mislead the people on the issue. The amendment involves the principle of political interference. The right honorable member for Cowper cannot have it both ways. He must either stand for national control or noninterference, and give the commission full power to select its staff. No man with an independent spirit would act as  chairman  of the commission if he were dictated to by a political party. I contend that we should not interfere with the activities of the board. </para>

                <para>The country is calling out for economy, and this Government was appointed to put such a policy into effect. Now, after appointing five commissioners at substantial salaries to conduct broadcasting, it proposes to appoint a general manager and six senior officers at salaries which are not disclosed. My experience of government departments is that when an officer is placed in charge of a new department he has a staff of twelve or more around him within three months. </para>

                    <para>. - I oppose the amendment of the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> because the assumption is that the commission will not be competent to take over the complete control of broadcasting. That matter was thrashed out last night, when it was decided to abolish ministerial control. In view of that decision it is only right that the commission should appoint its own officers. If that were not so, what would be the position if the general manager came into conflict with the commission on a particular line of policy? If the general manager had the right of appeal to the Minister the commission would have absolutely no control. We should avoid any possibility of a deadlock occurring between the commission and the general manager. The amendment, if carried, would violate the first principle of business. If broadcasting is to be a success, the commission must have absolute control of its officers. In turn the general manager should select his own staff. If the Government interferes in any of these matters the staff will become disorganized and inefficient. The staff must be highly efficient if this great industry is to develop on proper lines. </para>

I agree with the contention of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory).</inline> If we are to repose confidence and responsibility in the commission surely we should allow it to select the staff which is to conduct broadcasting operations. If that responsibility is taken out of the hands of the commission, and conflict arises between that body and the general manager, it will say that it is not responsible for the appointment. The British legislation provides that the chief executive officer shall be called the Director-General, and that the first Director-General shall be John CharlesWalsall Reith. </para>

                    <para>.- With all due respect to the Minister, who desires to press on with the bill I, and those associated with me, are compelled to remind him that we are opposed to the appointment of any commission at all. If we are unable to defeat that proposal, at least we desire that as much control as possible may be left in the hands of the executive officers of the Government of the day. There seems to me to be nothing inconsistent between the amendment of the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> and clause 5 of the bill, which gives the commission authority to take charge of the general administration of the act. If the Government of the day is not to be trusted to appoint the general manager, how better can it be trusted to appoint the commission itself? If it is to be taken for granted that a general manager appointed by the Government must be an unsuitable person, it follows that those appointed by the Government as members of the commission are also likely to be unsuitable persons. The bill at present provides that the commission may appoint a general manager, and such other officers and servants as it thinks necessary, but it then goes on to say that the Minister must approve of the salaries paid. If the Government has to do the paying, it should have the say as to who is to be appointed. </para>

In this respect I find myself in agreement with the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan).</inline> Some honorable members appear to be overlooking the basic fact, that the general manager is to be the servant of the commission, and it will be his duty to carry into executive effect the policy decided upon by the commission. If that is not to be the procedure, why appoint a commission at all? For my part, I should not object very strongly  to the elimination of the commission, but if there is to be one, then the general manager must be subject to it. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment. It seems to me that the Government proposes to depart from ordinary business procedure in the manner of these appointments, and in this respect I disagree with the last  speaker.  In the commercial world it is the principals in any concern who  appoint both the manager and the board of directors. In the case of an ordinary joint stock 'company the principals are the shareholders. In the case we are considering the principals are the public, whose power is vested in this Parliament. In a business concern the manager is the responsible person, while the board of directors is appointed to safeguard the interests of the principals, that is, the shareholders. The general manager to be appointed in connexion with broadcasting control should possess the highest qualifications, and a full knowledge of all the phases of the undertaking. We should then appoint a reputable directorate to oversee his operations, and to receive from him reports of his activities, either' daily, weekly or fortnightly, as the case may be. I, myself, have been manager of a company, and I was the responsible person. The principals, that is, the shareholders, appointed me, and they also appointed the directorate. For every board meeting I had to prepare certain recommendations, which I submitted to the directors for their approval. </para>

                    <para>. - The arguments which we have just heard regarding the application of business principles convinces me that it is high time that persons with business training took charge of the biggest business in this country, namely, the National Parliament. As a matter of fact, it would outrage all business principles to appoint a general manager and then appoint a board of directors to conflict with him. I support this clause because I feel that if the Government attempts to appoint a general manager and set him up in opposition to the commission, it will be asking for trouble. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> got tied up in the same way when he stated that the board of an insurance company left the whole of the business management of the concern to the general manager. I agree with him in that, but, at the same time, it is the directorate who appoint the general manager, and they exercise a full measure of control over him. There is no higher authority than the board of directors in the ordinary management of the business, and the board has full authority over the engagement and dismissal of staff. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment moved by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> I am somewhat of the opinion of the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan),that</inline> in all probability the amendment conflicts with clause 5, which was amended to prevent any ministerial direction over the general administration of broadcasting. But everything depends on the interpretation of the words, "general administration". Lawyers may read into their meaning something which was not. the intention of the framers of this legislation. Broadcasting is a national utility, and as such should be controlled by the Government of the day. Listeners-in who provide the wherewithal to finance this venture should have some measure of protection, but they will not have it under commission control. I am opposed to the appointment of a commission, but now that the committee has accepted the principle of commission control, like the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear),</inline> I want to get the best possible for those who pay the piper, and who should have some say in calling the tunes they get over the wireless. Under commission control, what redress will they have? If a member of Parliament receives a protest from a constituent, and makes representations to the responsible Minister, he will receive the stereotyped reply, " As the prescribed authority reports adversely, I regret that the request cannot be granted ". The Minister should be the prescribed authority. </para>

                <para>The right honorable member for Cowper is to be complimented on his amendment, because it would provide at least some control by this Parliament over appointees, and enable this Parliament to criticize the Minister if the persons selected were not fit to occupy their positions. As the bill stands, we do not know who are to be appointed. We have no guarantee that Eric Campbell or " De Goat " may not be appointed, or that New Guard concerts may not be broadcast contrary to the wishes of listenersin. Appointment of the general manager by the Governor-General is the proper method to adopt, and I trust that ministerial control will be re-inserted in the bill. </para>

                    <para>.- Ordinarily, I should be satisfied to follow the guidance of the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> on this bill, because it was clear from the address he delivered yesterday that he has made a closestudy of the subject; but I cannot help thinking that the amendment he has now proposed involves a departure from, not perhaps business principles exactly, but from administrative principles. I do not think that business principles should dominate the control of broadcasting provided for in this measure. I share the disappointment of the right honorable member that we have not received the information we should have as to the proposed personnel of the broadcasting commission ; but the chamber has already determined that this enterprise shall be conducted by a commission which is not subject to ministerial control. If the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> will permit me to say so, I think that broadcasting can be conducted as a national enterprise with safety, provided that it not subjected to the eccen- tricities  of political management. That is the policy that, has been adopted. The committee has determined to set up an independent commission, which will be a sort of buffer, to prevent infliction upon an  inoffending  public of the aesthetic and political ideas of members of Parliament and their friends. Surely the right honorable member for Cowper does not desire to bring in by a side door what has already been shut out at the front door. </para>

                    <para>. - A good deal of the discussion on this particular matter has been based on theoretical assumption. It is suggested that, if the general manager were appointed by the Government of the day, the commission would be deprived of power ; that it would not be able to function, and that the control of broadcasting would be lacking in business principles. But, when the British Broadcasting Corporation was brought into being, the British Parliament deliberately adopted the principle I am now recommending, by appointing, not only a board of governors to lay down a general policy, but also the director-general, and naming him in the bill. That system has now been in force in England for seven years, with the result that the British broadcasting system is one of the best in the world. Yet we are assured to-day that the same method of appointment would result in general chaos and disturbance. </para>

If the general manager were appointed by the Government, his actions would be subject to criticism, which might effect him in the exercise of his duties, and through him influence the commission. The example of the British Broadcasting Corporation has been mentioned by the mover of the amendment, but we are not obliged to follow any precedent; our endeavour should be to improve upon what has been done elsewhere. If the commission is not absolutely free from political control we shall create serious obstacles to the selection of the best man for that work. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> has declared that the commissioners should be men of ripe judgment, full knowledge, and independence. We shall get the services of the best . men available only if they are assured that they' will not be hampered by political interference. </para>

                    <para>.- The bill originally drafted by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A.</inline> Green) contained a clause similar to that now before the committee, and for that reason members of the Opposition might be expected to support the clause now; but the present Government has drastically altered the proposals of its predecessor in regard to the control of broadcasting. My government proposed a salary for the  chairman  of the commission, which contemplated a full-time appointment; necessarily that appointment would have been made by the Government. If that principle had been retained there would be no need for the amendment proposed by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> But as the commission is to be composed of part time men whose attention will range over many fields of activity, there will not be one full-time officer appointed by the Government in charge of broadcasting unless the amendment is agreed to. The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchinson)</inline> seemed to be astonished that anybody should suggest that Parliament should exercise control over the commission. When he has had a little more experience he will not give expression to such reactionary sentiments. The general manager is to be the only full-time officer directing broadcasting throughout the Commonwealth, and yet we are told that this Parliament should not, through the Government, have a voice in his appointment. If that is to be our policy we had better abolish. Parliaments, and hand over government to a bureaucracy. The danger pf political control can be exaggerated. There is justification for the amendment which, however, would not be necessary if the  chairman  were to be a full-time officer as the previous Government intended. The departure from that principle has gravely weakened the control of broadcasting. I have no desire for finicky interference by any minister or government with the control of broadcasting, nor do I desire a member to be embarrassed 'by the importunities of persons who believe that their talents should be voiced over the air. But in the final resort this Parliament must have control. Broadcasting is one of the most important services of the community </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The commission now proposed will consist of men giving only the fag end of their time to this important work. The only permanent directing officer will he the general manager. Honorable members have spoken of the lack of harmony that might result if the general manager were appointed by the Government ; but in connexion with the Commonwealth Bank the Governor was so appointed. The Commonwealth Bank Board is charged with the management and control of that institution, but broadcasting does not fall within the same category as banking; it is not of the same serious importance. Would any member of this committee favour the appointment of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank by the Board of Directors, who themselves are part-time officers? The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is the only controlling officer of that institution who is employed on full time, and, therefore, he is appointed by the Government. If the  chairman  of the Broadcasting Commission were made a full-time officer and were appointed by the Government, I would not support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I intend to support the clause as it stands. I was somewhat impressed by the statement of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> that the position should be considered in the light of the fact that the  chairman  of the commission would not be a full-time officer, but whether he is a full or a part-time officer is immaterial. It will be the duty of the commission to see that the policy laid down is carried out, and, therefore, I contend that the commission should be charged with the responsibility of choosing the general manager. This Parliament is providing for the appointment of a commission, because it is considered that a commission will be a more suitable body than the Parliament to formulate the broadcasting policy. The honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> mentioned that he would support the amendment, because it would result in a step nearer socialization than would be made by the clause as it stands. If a general manager is appointed by the Government, he will be likely to adopt the policy favoured by the Government. It is possible that the Governmerit, as well as the commission, will lay down a broadcasting policy. If the general manager owes his position to the Government, he will probably favour the policy of the Ministry, lest he may lose his job. Much will depend on the character of the government in power. If it happens to be one-tenth as bad as the Ministry now in office in New South Wales, I have doubts as to the suitability of the appointment that will bo made. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cleary</inline> was appointed to take charge of the railways in that State because he was considered to be the best man for the position, but he lost his job because he refused to carry out the policy of the State Government. If the general manager of the broadcasting commission were appointed by the Commonwealth Government, he might be a pliable servant in its hands, whereas if the commission made the appointment, the general manager would not be responsible to the Government. </para>

                    <para>. -  I have followed the debate with much interest, althoughI have not previously participated in it. The right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> drew rather a false analogy in suggesting that the members of the House are directors. The members of this Parliament are elected to legislate within their constitutional powers, to criticize acts of administrations, and make and unmake ministries, and to discuss matters of policy; but it is hardly within the province of a Parliament to select officials and administer. This Parliament makes laws in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth, and as the listeners-in cannot be organized as a corporate body, and as broadcasting is a matter of public interest, it is advisable to establish a commission for the purpose of controlling the business ofbroadcasting. The vital principle to be observed in the appointment of the commission is the prevention of political influence. Parliament cannot, of course, divest itself of its responsibility, and there must always be a Minister to answer for any legal body set up under the authority of Parliament. </para>

                <para>The bill as it stands seems to safeguard us against the dangers of political interference; but ministerial responsibility must be exercised in the appointment of the commission. The government of the day will be responsible to the Parliament for the commission that is appointed. If the personnel of the commission is not such as that indicated by the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holman),</inline> this Parliament can call the Ministry to task for its failure to secure the best men available, and if it were subsequently found that the commission was not carrying out its duties satisfactorily, the Ministry would be responsible. Parliament will always retain control; but the commission, once constituted, should be free from political interference. The commission can surely be trusted to appoint the officers needed to carry out the service of broadcasting. Therefore, I consider that it would be wrong to make the general manager an appointee of the government of the day. That might well lead to a conflict of authority. The general manager would naturally look for the approval of his conduct to those who had appointed him, and would expect direction from them. </para>

                <para class="block">My purpose is to ensure that the appointment of the general manager - I am not so much concerned about other officers of the commission - shall be made with the approval of the Governor-General. I submit the amendment because, following the decision of the committee last night, it would appear that this anaemic commission will meet only occasionally, so that practically the whole control of national broadcasting will ultimately fall into the hands of the general manager, who will be a full-time official. I do not suggest that he should be appointed by the Government. An appointment so made might result in some person with ideas inimical to the general policy of the commission securing the position ; but if the commission has power to make the appointment, subject to the approval of the Governor-General, we may be reasonably sure that the person selected will be in sympathy with the general policy of the commission. Last night the committee decided that the control of national broadcasting should virtually be in the hands of the general manager. In these circumstances I consider it desirable that, as regards the appointment of general manager, the power of veto should be vested in the Government. The bill really contains no indication of policy at all. This must be determined by the general manager. "With - the alteration of a few words the measure might just as well be regarded as one for the appointment of a milk board or an egg board. It is right that the duration of the commission should be for a definite and fixed term of years, but the Governor-General should have the right of veto as regards the appointment of the general manager. </para>

I also deprecate the tone adopted by the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lane).</inline> It is regrettable that, simply because some honorable members may in all sincerity disagree with others upon certain aspects of the Government's proposals, they should be charged with endeavouring to secure the adoption of amendments almost, identical with proposals that have already been rejected. The Minister and his supporters should realize that there is honest disagreement with the Government on this matter, and they should be prepared to listen to the views of the minority, even if they cannot accept the amendments submitted. This amendment is entirely different from that rejected by the committee prior to the luncheon adjournment. If an appointment made by the commission is not approved by the Governor-General, the position will not be affected so far as the commission is concerned, because that body will still have the right of selection. All that the amendment means is that the person appointed shall be approved of by the Governor-General, which, as we all know, means the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment'. It is a modest request, and despite what the honorable member for Barton has said, it differs entirely from the amendment submitted by the right honorable member for Cowper this morning. I remind honorable members that sub-clause  2  provides that the fixation of the salaries of the general manager and the next six senior officers shall be subject to the approval of the Minister. Is it not anomalous that honorable members raise no objection to that, but oppose the amendment of the right honorable member for Cowper? No doubt the amount of salary that will be paid depends upon the support that these executive officers are prepared to give to the Government. We know that the amendment forecast by the Minister in sub-clause 2 is on all fours with that with which we are now dealing, and to which the honorable gentleman refuses to give approval. There should be consistency in these matters, and the Minister should accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- Now we shall be able to test the sincerity of honorable members opposite. Throughout this debate we have heard them claim that if the commission is to be appointed it should be trusted and given an absolutely free hand. Yet it is now proposed that the fixing of the salaries to be paid to the general manager and his six senior executives shall be taken out of the hands of the commission and placed under the control of the Government. That makes it possible for the Government to hamstring the operations of the commission by offering salaries that are absurdly inadequate for the jobs. These details should be left in the hands of the commission, and I hope that the committee will reject this amendment. </para>

                <para>Mr.RIORDAN  (Kennedy) [2.48].- If the Minister's amendment is carried, all control over expenditure will pass from this Parliament. We do not know what salaries are to be paid. The </para>
                <para class="block">Premier of every State, and the Prime Minister and the Assistant Treasurer of the Commonwealth are exerting every effort to cut down expenditure; yet, without having any say as to what appointments shall be made, or what salaries shall be paid, we are asked to agree to a proposal under which control over expenditure will be taken away from this Parliament. The Government will be the custodian of the revenue collected from broadcasting, and should not delegate to a commission its powers in regard to expenditure. In the past we have had highly-paid officers controlling commissions, and the results have been detrimental to the best interests of Australia. I am the holder of a listener's licence, and look for the redress of any wrong to the body to whomI pay the fee of 24s. a year. Is it intended that the commission shall be responsible for the collection of wireless revenue? If the Minister allows control to pass out of his hands, the commission will be able to spend the revenue it receives without any regard for the protests of those who contribute to the upkeep of wireless services. From an educational point of view, the bill is not worth' the paper on which it is printed. The arrangement of the programmes will rest with the general manager and the board. How could they be removed from office unless this Parliament were able to exercise some control over them? The right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> claimedthat Government members should show their consistency by supporting a proposal to take control out of the hands of the Minister. It is now sought to cover up their inconsistency by substituting the Governor-General for the Minister; and that, it is pointed out, is a distinction without a difference. The principle involved is identical with that to which the Government so strongly objected at an earlier stage, and its acceptance now means that the time occupied in the consideration of the bill this morning was wasted. The Minister has not given the committee any information as to what the effect of his proposal will be. If the position is not altered, why is it necessary to make the change? In the interest of the taxpayer, some limitation should be placed on the salaries that are to be paid. The bill should be dropped, and control of broadcasting allowed to remain where it is at the present time until our financial position improves. This will impose an additional burden on the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, who will not have any say in the expenditure, although the Government will be responsible for any losses incurred by the commission. </para>

                    <para>. - The intention of the Government, when framing this clause, was to protect the revenue by preventing the payment by the commission of the excessive salaries referred to by the honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan).</inline> Probably there will be in each of the States some person acting on behalf of the commission. If the salaries of the general manager and of those who conduct the operations of the commission in the six States have to be approved by the Governor-General, the funds of the commission will be protected, and no excessive payments can be made. This is a proposal to ensure that the standard set at the commencement of the commission's operations shall be by no means extravagant. The honorable member for Kennedy argued that some limitation should be placed on the amount that may be paid by way of salary, so that it may not be excessive. The amendment imposes that limitation, and I appeal to the committee to agree to it. </para>

The  chairman  is to receive £500 a year, the vice-chairman £400, and the other commissioners £300. Considerable work will devolve upon the general manager, and his time is likely to be fully occupied. A salary of £800 would be reasonable and sufficient to enable the general manager to live in comfort, taking into consideration the difficult times through which we are passing, and the fact that to-day many of our people have not the means to purchase even the bare necessaries of life. </para>

                    <para>.  - There should be in the bill some direct link between the Government and the commission. The extreme view in this chamber is that private enterprise should have absolute freedom. The Government is anxious that the commission shall be absolutely untrammelled, so that it may carry out its work successfully, but always with the idea in mind that private enterprise must be safeguarded. I am supporting every clause which leaves some link between the Government and the commission, and as this clause does that to a slight degree, 1 have no wish to alter it, and shall, therefore, vote for it as it stands. I voted for the previous amendment of the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> because its object was to provide a permanent link between the Minister and the commission. I thought that a wise and proper provision, and if accepted it would have been a reasonable compromise with the Government, As this clause does provide some link between the Government and the commission, I cannot understand the objection of the right honorable member for Cowper to it. </para>

                    <para>.- There arc three points of view in respect of this clause. The first is that of the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> who does not seem to believe the contention that he has put forward.I, therefore, do not think that this committee should record a vote of the nature that he has suggested.  His  contention is that because the committee would not agree to the amendment which vested control in the Minister in respect of the appointment of a general manager, the Minister should have no say in the fixing of the salary of that officer. He is undoubtedly demanding consistency from Government supporters. I agreed with his previous amendment, but, because of that, I must support the clause as it stands. I shall not call for a division or cast a vote merely out of pique. I support the clause as amended. The amendment after all makes no real difference, because it merely substitutes the word, "Governor-General " for the word " Minister." One could hardly imagine the Minister acting without the concurrence of Cabinet. The next question is whether there should be any safeguard as to the amount of the salaries that the commission will pay to its staff. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> has moved an amendment which, if accepted, will fix the amount, but that is not a sound way to fix salaries, because this committee is not in a position to determine what is equitable remuneration for the members of the staff. The provision in the bill is a wise one. It does not give untrammelled power to the commission to fix the salaries of the officers: it provides that the salaries payable must be subject to approval by the Governor-General. For all practical purposes the Governor-General means the Government, I urge the committee to support the clause as printed. </para>

If that is the view of the committee - that the commission should be in complete control of wireless broadcasting in Australia, and with one exception, it is my view - then I submit that the commission should not be debarred from paying to its officers whatever salaries it thinks should be paid to them. Otherwise, we shall definitely restrict the range of possible appointees. </para>

It has been urged that the committee should insist on the salary of the general manager being fixed by the commission. I agree with those who maintain that no authority is better qualified than is the commission to estimate the importance of the position of general manager, and, surely, in that case, no one is better qualified than the commission to estimate the value of his services. I shall vote against the sub-clause. </para>

The bill provides that a proportion of the fees from listeners shall be allocated to the commission. I am prepared to allow that body to decide how that money shall be spent. Should the commission consider it advisable to expend a larger proportion of its revenue than we think necessary in order to obtain a suitable man as general manager, I am prepared to trust it to do what is best.

                    <para>.- There is no indication in this provision, which deals with the powers and functions of the commission, that there will be any improvement in the programmes broadcast. Many country people are anxious that the broadcasting service shall be used more extensively for educational purposes, perhaps by using the system in country schools. Some of the musical programmes now broadcast are of little or no educational value. Families living in the country have not the same opportunities for receiving musical instruction as those in the metropolitan area. The teachers themselves, in country districts, are not able to keep abreast of current musical developments. Hundreds of thousands of pounds are paid to the Royal Academy of Music in examination fees - a fact which indicates the interest taken in musical training in this country. The Government should do its part to assist in this direction by seeing that dwellers in country districts are able to receive lectures and instruction on musical subjects by wireless. Even the ordinary programmes given over the wireless would be made much more interesting and instructive if they were accompanied by suitable explanations. For instance, to the uninitiated, the song, "You tak' the HighRoad and I'll tak' the Low," probably means very little, because they do notknow thehistory of the song. It is much the same as if I were to go to a performance at a French theatre. It would mean nothing to me, because I would be unacquainted with the language ; but, if the script of the play were put before me in English, I should be able to follow it with enjoyment. Pianoforte music appeals to me very much; but, because I have not had the advantage of a musical education, a selection from Chopin would mean little or nothing to me unless it were properly explained. Only recently the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> told me something of the story behind the song " When other lips and other hearts." What would that song, without any explanation, convey to the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> ? Probably about as much as it would convey to me. I was told that the man who composed the music of that song was never able to publish it, because he was a beggar. On one occasion, he went to the house of a certain bank manager to beg for clothes. While the bank manager was out of the room getting the clothes, the beggar sat down at the piano and played the music which he had composed. Hia benefactor, hearing the music, was greatly impressed by it, and promised to finance its publication. The beggar went out into the street, and Was killed in an accident. That story would be of great interest to the child mind, and, in regard to music, the child mind may be of any age from five  to 55. </para>

                <para>Let us consider the position of a boundary rider living on the borders of the Northern Territory. He may have a family of eight or ten, and be desirous of  giving  them something in the nature of a musical education. He purchases a wireless set, pays his licence-fee, and has a right to expect instruction as well as amusement from the programmes he is able to pick up.  His  children are as much entitled to the benefits of a musical education as are those living in the cities. Provision should be made on the broadcasting programmes for lectures and instruction on musical and other educational subjects for the benefit of country dwellers. A direction to this effect might, of course, be regarded as interfering with the authority of the commission, which will probably be composed of city men chosen for political purposes. In my opinion, there should be on that commission a representative of the country districts, one who knows the requirements of those living in the country, and who will see that they get some return for their money. The Government might even go so far as to make wireless sets available to country residents, for which they Will merely have to pay rent. This would be at least some compensation to them for their isolation. A close acquaintance of mine is an old blind pensioner Who has a little crystal set for which he pays a licence-fee of 24s. a year. He was a pioneer of the mining industry. "What service doe3 he get now in the mornings? Nothing but headlines from the newspapers - no lectures. En my opinion the blind should be given free licences to listen in. I repeat that the story behind the song or musical selection should be given. Country residents should have the opportunity to learn something more than the prices of their potatoes or their wool, important though that information undoubtedly is to them. </para>

                    <para>.- In reference to the question which I asked the other day relative to the price of poisons used for the destruction of rabbits, I should like the Prime Minister to say that an immediate investigation will be made to see  why  these essentials are so scarce and  whY  they .cannot be supplied at a much cheaper price. The rabbit menace is assuming great proportions, not only in Western Australia, but in other parts of the Commonwealth, and the price asked for poisons is, to my mind, somewhat in the nature of barefaced robbery. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like the Postmaster-General to take into consideration the position of persons in receipt of invalid pensions who are not able to pay the  listeners'-in  licence-fee entitling them to the privilege of enjoying the reception of music over the wireless. We all know that in some institutions where these invalids find shelter the provision of  wireless  is a wonderful help to them in their moments of affliction. To listen in on a wireless set would be an equally great source of comfort to others who are living in private homes, whos( lack of means  prevents  them from enjoying it. I should like the Minister to go into the matter carefully and see if he can extend to those persons living in private homes the privilege of relieving the serious monotony which their invalidity entails by permitting them to have free  listeners'-in  licences. </para>

In this connexion I pay a tribute to the officers of the Postal Department who devote their week-ends and Saturday afternoons to the making of wireless sets, which they install in various public institutions. I cannot say that I would go the whole length suggested by the honorable member - I am hopeful that the control of broadcasting will very shortly pass into other handsbut I can assure him that the matter is being considered and that, so far as is practicable, we hope to be able to adopt his suggestion. </para>
