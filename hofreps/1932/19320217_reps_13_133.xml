The honorable gentleman has already given long service to his constituents, having been first elected to this House in 1917. He has, moreover, occupied the position of Temporary  Chairman  of Committees in several parliaments, and in that office has had an opportunity to show that he possesses those qualifications which justify his promotion to the higher honour of the Speakership. The occupant of the Speaker&#39;s chair should be a man of calm temperament and impartial judgment, and the honorable member for Lilley possesses both quali- fications. He enjoys the distinction of possessing the longest unbroken period  of  loyal service  of  any member of the United Australia party. </para>

          <para>. - It was ten years ago, in this very month, that I first took advantage of the opportunity which presents itself only once in the life of a parliament, when any honorable member can speak untrammelled by rules of debate - some of them absurd - which unfortunately up to the present have not been properly altered and amended. I do not object to the honorable member for Lilley, who has been nominated for the Speakership, because he and I have been the best of friends ever since he entered this Parliament. I have a great respect for him, and if he is appointed I hope he will emulate the splendid work of his predecessors. Rut I object on principle to the present method of appointing the  Speaker,  because once an honorable member is elected to that position, his electors are disfranchised; they have no further representation in this House. Realizing that the officers of this </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Parliament know far more of parliamentary procedure than does the average honorable member who is appointed to the Chair, and that the conduct of Parliament really rests upon the parliamentary officers, I would prefer that some officer, and not a member of Parliament, should be elected each session  to  the speakership. This would enable all honorable members to represent  fully  their electors. Those remarks  apply also to the  position of Chairman of Committees. It is strange how frequently some of my dearest friends fill the positions of Speaker and Chairman of Committees, and thus become subject to my criticism. </para>
        <para>I raise one other matter. This is one occasion on which I can hold up to scorn and contumely some of the judges of the High Court and other courts. These judges, even in the hour of their country&#39;s need, have refused to allow any reduction to be made in their salaries, but they &#39;are so terribly blinded that they have drastically reduced the wages of the workers. Five years ago I expressed the contempt and loathing in which I held Judge Lukin. To-day I hold him in still greater contempt. He receives in addition to his salary a pension of &#163;1,000 a year from the Queensland Government. He sits in court with all the dignity of his horse-hair wig, and refuses to suffer any reduction in his salary. Men of his type took part in the French Revolution. At that time one fool said that the people should eat grass, and according to Carlyle, he was eventually strung up to a lamp post, and hanged with grass stuck in his mouth. &#34;When the people properly control Parliament no longer will Australian men and women receive a dole of 5s. a week plus ls. 6d. for each child, while in the Motherland an unemployed man receives 15s. a week, and an unemployed woman 13s. a week. Our Defence Department has issued a regulation to the effect that 7s. 6d. a week shall be provided for each child. Is there any difference between the children who have to be maintained on Defence Department money and those who have to be maintained by other government expenditure? This is a very serious matter, although I am not blaming this Government for it._ The previous </para>
        <para class="block">Government deserved a lot of the blame, and they received their reward at the election. But the people have not yet obtained control of Parliament. </para>
        <para>We talk about our democracy in Australia, but there can be no democracy here so long as this Parliament can control the people who create it. The people have the right to control the Parliament, and we shall never have a democracy until they can exercise that right. Private members have at different times tried to improve matters in this respect, but the previous Government, like those which preceded it, limited the rights of private members to the greatest possible extent. Those who were members of the last Parliament know that this statement is true. </para>
        <para>I had a motion on the business-paper to provide for the bringing into effect of the principle of the referendum, initiative and recall. Honorable members who are sitting on the front Opposition bench may laugh, but they, like myself, have signed a platform which contains this plank. If they were sitting in a Labour conference they would not be complimented upon their laughter. Let me tell them, and honorable members generally, that I have held the respect of my constituents longer than any of them - in fact for nearly 43 years. For very many years I have tried to get this House to carry a motion approving of the principle of the referendum, initiative and recall. On one occasion, when the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was Prime Minister, such a motion was agreed to unanimously; but no Labour Government has ever taken steps to give effect to this principle. </para>
        <para>I am loyal to the Labour party. The planks of the platform of that party are as sacred to me as the Prayer Book and the Bible, and I wish to see them put into effect. I do not want to see members of this party holding on to place and pay. I say definitely that there were more &#34;gold-diggers&#34; in the last caucus than in any in which I have sat during my long parliamentary life. Honorable members opposite seem amused, but by and by I shall have something to say about them, and I shall not hesitate to say it. I hope to continue to hold the respect of my colleagues as I have held it during all the years. I have never said anything in this House that I did not believe, and I have never tried to attain an object unconnected with the welfare of humanity. I know that the right honorable member for North Sydney, in his heart of hearts, believes in the referendum and initiative. </para>
        <para>I have taken care not to speak of the recall. I believe that I am the only member of this House who has trusted his constituents, and who, for 42 years, has given them the right to render the seat of their representative vacant at a day&#39;s notice. By presenting a petition signed by one more than half the number of voters who voted for me in my constituency the electors could bring about my immediate recall. Honorable members are again laughing, but they laugh in ignorance. Poor children, there is a lot yet for them to learn. There was a time when 556 signatures could have brought about my removal from Parliament. </para>
        <para>I have mentioned Judge Lukin. I wish also to mention Judge Drake-Brockman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Evatt. I am sorry to have to do this. </para>
        <para>If my suggestions had been accepted our poor country could be helped out of its troubles. Let us do here as they did in England during the war period. At that time food was rationed, and the highest aristocrats in the land had to submit to rationing just like the poorest people. We should remember too, that poor old England can produce only enough food for every fourth man, woman and child living there. Australia, on the other hand, is producing more than three times as much food as she requires to feed her people. Let us ration our food supply and everything else, and use all the surplus to meet our debts. </para>
        <para>In regard to the monetary position, I wish to place on record tha following letter which I received from tho Treasury on the 16th January, 1932 :- </para>

        <para>With reference to your telephone inquiry of to-day relative to the cost of remitting money to New York, I would point out that taking the exchange rate as 3.40 dollars to the &#163;1 it costa &#163;143 in London to place &#163;100 in New York. </para>
        <para>This &#163;143 must be remitted to London from Australia, and at a rate of approximately 25 per cent, would cost, say, &#163;36. </para>
        <para>Xt will be seen, therefore, that the cost of remitting &#163;100 from Australia to New York is approximately &#163;179 - &#163;79 being in respect for exchange. </para>
        <para class="block">It is in such circumstances that Germany has said that she cannot and will not pay her debts. All the European nations are thinking about refusing to pay their war debts. I ask whether it is right, when Australia, is willing to pay her way, that she must send abroad &#163;79 as exchange for every &#163;100 of principal and interest in respect of her indebtedness? If the people of this country were asked to reply with a plain &#34; ye3 &#34; or &#34; no &#34; to the question, whether they are willing to do this, I am sure that they would say no. I trust that this Government will find some way of placing all debts upon a different footing from the indebtedness incurred in respect of ordinary trade and commerce. I hope that some agreement will be made which will lift the  burden  of this terrible interest charge from the shoulders of the people. I shall watch the Government very carefully. Although I cannot hope to point my finger at any member so gracefully as- the  Clerk  of the House has done it to-day, I shall nevertheless watch the Government, and hope that it will find some means of removing this terrible burden. </para>
        <para>I hope that I shall live to see Australia, the land that I love, and which I believe honorable members opposite love as well as I do, become a real democracy. I trust that this Parliament will come under the control of the people. At present the people have control on only one day in three years. I say with all reverence, as though in the presence of my Maker, that if God be God, He would never create anything  His  equal and never allow any created thing to make itself  His  equal. Why, then, I ask, as a representative of the people, should those who create this Parliament control it on only one day in three years? They should control it every day. Why should Ave be able to make ourselves more powerful than they? That is why, for 42 years, I have given my constituents the right of recall. I hope that some day the system will be made general. Then no longer will so many vile and wicked happenings, with their associated fraud, misery and trickery, be countenanced. -Jobbery occurred even in connexion with the building of this Capital. It fell to the lot of a member of the Labour party, the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. C. .Riley),</inline> to make the exposure that certain contractors had fraudulently withheld 600 tons of cement from the foundations of a Government building in Canberra, the cost of which was estimated to be about &#163;1,000,000. Yet no one was sacked or even censured. I know that had the Scullin Government been in charge of affairs the delinquents would have been dealt with. That great genius, Walter Burley Griffin, prepared the design for a beautiful permanent Parliament House, which was to cost &#163;250,000, and provided a room for every member of Parliament, whether of the Senate or the House of Representatives. Through the machinations of certain departmental heads that great man was set aside and his design superseded. In place of that beautiful permanent building we have this temporary Parliament House, which was estimated to cost &#163;230,000, but which has cost &#163;760,000 of the people&#39;s money. If any honorable member doubts the accuracy of my statement I refer him to the report of the inquiry that was made into the matter by the then Leader of the New South Wales Bar, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilfred</inline> Blacket, K.C., which shows clearly how vilely Walter Burley Griffin was treated. And no one was censured. The roof of this building would not keep out the rain, and, when I drew attention to that fact 80 tons of gravel was placed upon it in a vain endeavour to rectify the fault. If a committee could be appointed with power to obtain full information before the available informants disappear or die, very severe punishment would be meted out to those responsible. I had intended speaking of this matter when the  Speaker  of the last Parliament was elected, but my chief dissuaded me. That I have regretted ever since. </para>
        <para>I urge all young members of Parliament, who may feel that they are trammelled by our rules of debate to take advantage of the happy opportunity that is afforded to them on an occasion such as the present and give utterance to what their conscience prompts them to speak. </para>

        <para>Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SPEAKER</inline> ELECT, standing on the upper step, said - I desire to express my keen appreciation of the great honour which honorable members have conferred  upon me. I realize the responsibility that is mine in assuming the duties of the office, following as I do so many who have occupied the Chair with distinction, and I feel that I can be successful only if I have the full support of honorable members, whose goodwill I shall endeavour to deserve by the exercise of tact, courtesy and strict impartiality. Honorable members who may think that the Standing Orders are too rigid have the remedy in their own hands. In return for the efforts that I shall make to carry out my duties satisfactorily, I shall expect from all honorable members strict obedience to my rulings and decisions. It is my intention to endeavour to uphold the best traditions of parliamentary procedure, and to apply common sense to the interpretation of the Standing Orders. </para>

In the years that you have been associated with the National Parliament you have won the respect and confidence of your fellow members, and you have on many occasions demonstrated that you possess qualifications admirably fitting you to perform with dignity, impartiality and ability the duties associated with the high office to which you have been called. I am confident that the splendid traditions that have been established by your predecessors in office will be maintained by you, and I offer you the co-operation and assistance of honorable members on this side in carrying out your important duties.

On behalf of the members of the party that I have the pleasure and the honour to lead, I offer you their support and co-operation in carrying out the Standing Orders, and in upholding the best traditions of our National Parliament. I have not the slightest doubt that you will be both fair and unbiased. Those of us who have been privileged to know you for a number of years are aware that you possess the qualities of impartiality and fairmindedness that go so far towards achieving the success of a  Speaker.

            <para>. - On behalf of the Australian Country party, I congratulate you, sir, on your elevation to the important position of  Speaker,  and assure you of the support of the members of this party in carrying out the difficult duties of your office. I am confident that you will bring to that task the qualities of impartiality and justness, because I remember that, many years ago, before you entered this Parliament, you were responsible for an extraordinarily fair piece of dealing in connexion with myself which demonstrated to me the innate justness and fairness of your character. I am satisfied that those qualities will characterize your actions as  Speaker. </para>

          <para>I hope that during the term of this Parliament you will carry out the practice of previous Speakers, and recognize, in their turn, the members of the several parties in the House as they rise to take part in a debate. That method has been used in previous parliaments. It was adopted when the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was Prime Minister, and also when other governments were in office, and the practice is observed at the present time in the British </para>
          <para class="block">House of Commons, where the various parties are recognized in their turn in the matter of calls from the Chair. I trust that this practice will be followed in this chamber. At the same time, I point out that members of the Country party are occupying their present seats in this chamber to suit their own convenience. They desire, so far as possible, to sit together. The object of the Country party in coining to this Parliament is to put into effect, at the earliest possible moment, the policy that was jointly agreed upon by the United Australia party and the Country party prior to the election. So longas the Government carriesout the policy on which the people voted, it can rest assured of the support of this party. </para>

          <para>. - Almost invariably on the meeting of the House after an interval, it is the sad duty of the Prime Minister to announce the death of present or past members of this Parliament. Unfortunately, this occasion is no exception. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the Hon.</inline> James Ernest Ogden died on the 5th February at his home in Tasmania. The late senator was not a robust man, and his health had been failing for some time. The news of his death, however, came as a shock to his colleagues in this Parliament, most of whom had not been in close touch with him since the adjournment in November. The sudden removal from our midst of one who had been so recently sharing in the work of the Parliament, and whose personal friendship was valued so very highly, is felt particularly keenly by those of us who were associated with him. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline>had a long record of parliamentary service, having been a member of the Tasmanian and Commonwealth Parliaments. I was associated with&#39; him in the Tasmanian Parliament, and in the Government led by the late Honorable John Earle. I valued his friendship and respected him for his sincerity. Before his election to the Commonwealth Parliament in 1922 he had been a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly for sixteen years, during which time, in addition to a brief period as Treasurer, he was Chief Secretary and Minister for Mines and Labour for two years. For a brief period he was Leader of the Opposition in that Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> was a member of the Commonwealth Government as honorary minister from the 29th November, 1928, for approximately twelve months.  His  parliamentary life covered a period of 26 years, during which time he did not spare himself to give of his best to Tasmania and the Commonwealth. Before his entry into Parliament, his efforts on behalf of  hi3  fellow workers were such as to merit special remembrance. We tender our deep sympathy to his widow and family in their loss.

He died worn out by the years of service which he devoted to the public. For a brief time I worked with him as a colleague in a Government, and no one could have been more conscientious or painstaking than he in the discharge of his duties. Despite constant ill health he spent many years in the service of his country, and I am convinced that the public have lost a valuable servant by his death. </para>

I was not a member of this House when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Foster</inline> was representing Wakefield, but I know of his work and of the high personal esteem in which he was held by his fellow members. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Foster</inline> first entered Parliament when elected to the House of Assembly of South Australia, in 1893, and was a member of that House for thirteen years,  during which time he held Ministerial office for periods totalling five years. His election to the House of Representatives took place in 1909, and he retained the seat until the general elections of 1928. He attained Ministerial office in the Hughes Government as Minister for Works and Railways, holding that portfolio from December, 1921, to February, 1923. His colleagues in this chamber remember him as one imbued with a high sense of public duty, who was at all times prepared strenuously but fairly to uphold his political beliefs. Our sympathy goes out to the widow and family of one who has left behind a very valuable record of public service. I move - <inline font-style="italic">by leave -</inline></para>

          <para>.- I second this motion, and regret the occasion which has led to its being moved. The Prime Minister gave a brief summary of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Foster&#39;s</inline> career. The deceased gentleman had a long record of public life, a record which was in every way honorable. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> did not know him in this House, but many of us here knew him well. He was one of those figures in public life that one never forgets. He was a strenuous fighter, and a vigorous debater - none more vigorous. He fought for what he believed in, and fought strenuously, but he was personally one of the kindest men it was possible to meet. I am sure that all of us who knew him regretted the vicissitudes of public life which led to his disappearance from this House during one of those periodical upheavals which trouble the political history of the country. He was missed more in this Parliament than many others would have been, because of his driving force and personality, and because there was never any doubt of his sincerity. All members of this Parliament, no matter what their political opinions, felt a sense of personal loss when he went out of the House. Every one who knew him will join in regretting his death, and in extending their sympathy to his widow and family in their loss of a husband and a father. </para>

The vicissitudes of life, both public and private, he met breast forward, and I question that he ever entertained a momentary doubt that right would ultimately triumph. When :we meet on an occasion like this to consecrate ourselves to the service of our King and country, and remember with honour those who have gone before, I sometimes wonder whether we are not compassed about with a great cloud of unseen witnesses - those who have finished their course and gone before. It may be so. One thing of which I feel certain is that men such as those whose memory we are honouring to-day, being dead yet speak to those who have ears to hear. They are saying to us, &#34; Work while it is yet day, for the night cometh when no man can work.&#34; The most effective way in which we. can express our respect for the memory of such men is by giving earnest heed to their silent admonitions. </para>

        <para class="block">On the 6th of February, the death occurred in Tasmania of the Honorable John Earle, who had a lengthy career of public service as a member of the Tasmanian and of this Parliament, and as a Minister of the Crown in both his own State and the Commonwealth. It is about nine years since the late gentleman was a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, but up to that time he had been a prominent figure in the public life of Tasmania and of the Commonwealth. He commenced his parliamentary career in the State of Tasmania, being elected to the House of Assembly for .Waratah in 1906. He subsequently represented Franklin in that House. He was Premier of Tasmania on two occasions - on the second occasion for a period of two years. I was personally associated with him, being a member of his Ministry which was in office from April, 1914, to April, 1916. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> was also a member of that Ministry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle&#39;s</inline> appointment as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator dated</inline> from the 1st March, 1917, and he was re-elected at the general election of 1917, holding his seat until 1922.

His  was a long and distinguished career in public life in both Federal and State spheres, and the members of the Country party desire to associate themselves with the expressions of regret contained in the motion. </para>

        <para class="block">We have just paid tribute to the memory of three former members of the Federal Parliament. I now refer to one who, having been elected to Parliament, did not live to take hisseat in this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Joseph Clasby was elected to the House of Representatives as member for East Sydney at the general elections in December last, and died in Sydney on the 15th of January. The stress and strain associated with an election campaign had taken their toll, and he was suddenly stricken with an illness which ended in his untimely death at the age of 38 years.  His  was already a very useful life, which had included active service in Egypt and France during the war, and association with movements having for their object the stimulation of interest in public affairs. It seemed that he was on the threshold of a promisingcareer of parliamentary and public service, but he was not destined to take his seat in Parliament.  His  funeral was attended by myself and several other members of the Government. The tributes paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clasby</inline> on that occasion afforded a striking testimony of the esteem in which he was held by all sections of the community. The members of this House share the universal sympathy with his mother and members of his family in their sad bereavement. </para>

          <para>.- We have been expressing our deep sympathy with the relatives of former members of this Parliament who have died after long careers of usefulness in the service of the public and close association with us in strenuous public life. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Joseph Clasby was in a different category, his death made a special appeal to our sympathy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clasby</inline> was a young man who had just taken the first step in a promising parliamentary career when he was stricken down.  His  end was, no doubt, accelerated by the strenuous election campaign in which he had participated. We all feel the deepest sympathy with his mother and the other members of his family, who, no doubt, were looking forward with pride to the time when their son and brother would win an important position in the national life of Australia. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clasby</inline> was not privileged to sit for even one day in the Parliament to which he had been elected. That circumstance has aroused the sympathy of the whole nation. I did not know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clasby,</inline> although I believe that I met him for a few moments on one occasion when I was travelling to Queensland and he was returning from that State; but I have heard those who knew him well in Sydney express the highest opinions of his ability, manly qualities and fine disposition. My party joins with honorable members generally in expressing the deepest sympathy with his mother and family in their great sorrow and bitter loss. </para>

          <para>.- Personal knowledge of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> J. Clasby, which dated back many years, led me to predict a very great future for him in the public life of Australia, and I deeply regret that on the very threshold of a career which promised to be brilliant he should have met with such an untimely end.  His  death was largely the result of war service, and of the strenuous efforts he made in the time at his disposal after his ordinary work was done to benefit the public life of Australia. He was of the right age to enter political life, for although he was a man of experience, he still had the energy of youth.  His  death is a definite loss to Australia, and we associate ourselves with the motion of sympathy moved by the Prime Minister. </para>

I appreciated the fighting qualities of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clasby,</inline> and shall long remember the battle which was waged in that electorate in December last. I took an active part in that struggle, and fought <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clasby</inline> strenuously in a political contest. He was a fair fighter, who took his part manfully, and he won from us a seat which we had held for many years. He was not permitted to enjoy the fruits of the victory he won, and we regret his death. As we look round this chamber to-day we feel that his mother and the other members of his family would have felt honoured to witness the ceremony of the opening of this Parliament, and to see their son and brother in the place to which he was elected, but it was not to be. &#34;We regret deeply the circumstances which have made this impossible, and express our sincere sympathy to his sorrowing relatives and friends. </para>

        <para class="block">Since the Commonwealth Parliament was last in session, the British submarine M2 whilst manoeuvring off the coast of England, has been lost and all her personnel have perished. It was a tragedy with, fortunately, but few equals in the naval history of Great Britain. While exercising in the Channel off Portland, Dorset, on the 26th January, the submarine dived, and did not again come to the surface. At first there was a slight hope that the lives of those on board would be saved, but that hope soon gave way to the sad realization that the 56 officers and men comprising the crew had gone to their deaths. We can hardly imagine the plight of those unfortunate men, but we can be certain that when the time came for them to abandon all hope they faced their deaths bravely, and in keeping with the best traditions of the Royal Navy. We extend our deepest sympathy to the relatives of those who perished in the disaster, and to His Majesty&#39;s Government in the United Kingdom in the loss the country has sustained. </para>

          <para>.- I associate myself with the motion of the Prime Minister. The news of the sinking of the submarine M2 struck the whole civilized world with &#34;horror, not only because of the loss of so many lives, but of the circumstances under which the men went to their death. Although we can only imagine the feelings of those who went down in the submarine, we can appreciate something of the tragedy of the whole occurrence. We extend our very deep sympathy to the relatives of the men who died. The sinking of this submarine reminds us of the great risks taken by those who man such vessels, not only in times of war, but also in times of peace. Of course, the risks are very much greater during war time. This occurrence affords additional  evidence of the urgent need for the nations to do everything that they can do, not only to prevent the possibility of war, but also to render unnecessary any preparations for war. It is one of the hopes of this Parliament that the Disarmament Conference will take the first real step towards total disarmament, and thus remove the possibility of similar disasters to this occurring in the future. </para>

            <para>- When, some time ago, my attention was drawn to the possibility of there being a shortage of refrigerated space for the export of Australian apples to Great Britain, I communicated with the Oversea Shipping Representatives Association, which undertook to provide the necessary space for all Australian apples available for export this year. It is easier and more satisfactory to arrange for the prior booking of refrigerated space for apples than for the majority of our other primary products, the output of which varies during a season. The actual details of the allocation of the available space for different consignments is now being worked out by the council in Sydney. </para>

            <para>- Will the Minister for Markets, when making arrangements for refrigerated space for the export of apples, take into consideration, not only the quantity of apples to be exported during the present season, but also the dates upon which apples become exportable in the various States? This is important, because the season is a month earlier in some States than in others. </para>

            <para>- Is the Minister for Markets aware that delays are occurring in the payment of the bounty on last  season&#39;s wheat? By way of explanation, I may say that I have been advised by wheat-growers in my electorate that statements of claim were put in as long ago as last November, and not only has no payment been made, but no acknowledgment of their claims has been received from the department. </para>

            <para>- The work of paying the bounty entails a great deal of checking, and the expedition with which that work can be done depends largely upon how accurately and completely the necessary forms are filled in by the farmers themselves. In New South Wales not nearly so much bounty ha? been paid out as in the States of Victoria and South Australia. In New South Wales there seems to be a much wider misunderstanding than in the other States mentioned of what is required on the forms. This not only causes delay to the individual, whose application forms have to be referred back, but it results in delay throughout the department. It has been necessary to employ in New South Wales nearly double the staff to carry out the checking that has been necessary, for instance, in South Australia. I hope that henceforward the payment of the bounty will be proceeded with much more expeditiously than in the past, since everybody concerned is now becoming more familiar with the procedure. </para>

            <para>- I have already made a public statement to the effect that the Government feels that in times like these, when practically every section of the community and every industry is suffering, no particular industry should be left in such a position that it enjoys, generally speaking, all the advantages that it had inthe past. A definite agreement was entered into by the previous Government with those associated with the sugar industry. The present Government recognizes the existence of that agreement, and it does not propose that by any direct action, that agreement should be broken; but it feels that the time has come when the parties to the agreement should be invited to recon sider the matter, in view of the sacrifices made by every other section of the community throughout Australia, and that a voluntary agreement might be arrived at until the financial and economic conditions in Australia improve. I may say definitely that only on a voluntary basis would an amendment of the agreement be suggested. </para>

It is the duty of that State to safeguard the interests of its cattle growers, to provide for the dipping of cattle and the eradication of the tick. The Commonwealth has already done more than its share in providing funds to assist New South Wales. It has cost the Commonwealth to date &#163;55,000 for this purpose, and it is now the duty of the New South Wales Government to take drastic action for the control and eradication of tick. </para>

            <para>- My Government has been endeavouring to obtain from the Premier of New South Wales <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> information that would enable it to make the payments due. We have asked for a definite statement as to the amount due, and the amount that the State is able to make available, so that the Commonwealth Government may make arrangements for the payment of the balance, but we have been unable to obtain a satisfactory reply from the Premier of New South Wales. We recognize that this position cannot be allowed to continue, and that the default of New South Wales must not be per mitted to become the default of the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, I have only this morning notified the Premier of New South Wales that my Government proposes to go ahead in the matter. I think that it will be well for me to inform honorable members of the text of the telegram that has been sent to the Premier of New South Wales. It is as follows. - </para>

            <para>On 10th February I advised you that in the interests, of Australian credit, Commonwealth Government had decided to make arrangements for payment as soon as possible on behalf of New South Wales of overseas interest due beginning this month in respect of which Government of New South Wales had defaulted. I advised what amounts Commonwealth understood were due and asked you to confirm same. I also asked what contribution your Government was prepared to make towards paying overdue interest. On 13th February, I gave undertaking sought by you that Commonwealth would not without consent of State use or suffer to be used any reply to my telegram of 10th February in evidence against State in any pending or future litigation. To date I have not received reply from you. In view of my announcement on 10th February that Commonwealth Government would make arrangements for these payments on behalf of New South Wales as soon as possible, Commonwealth Government cannot longer waitfor reply from you and has now decided to carry out immediately its undertaking to pay on behalf of New South Wales the overdue interest. This payment will be made on basis of information now in possession of Commonwealth. My Government however is still desirous of ascertaining precise details of payments overdue by New South Wales and what contribution your Government can make towards those payments and desires that your Goverment should make this information available immediately subject to the undertaking given in my telegram of 13th February in that regard. </para>

Owing to the great importance of the problems of disarmament, and their possible interrelation with problems of war debts and separations, it has been decided that the Commonwealth should be directly represented at Geneva. The importance of the problems to be dealt with makes it imperative that the ablest available representative should attend on behalf of Australia as leader of the delegation. In the meantime the High Commissioner in London, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Granville</inline> Ryrie, will represent Australia at the conference. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - I take this opportunity of informing the House that the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> and the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> will represent the Commonwealth at the forthcoming Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa. After the Ottawa Conference has concluded, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> will proceed to London as Minister representing the Commonwealth. He will discharge the functions of the High Commissioner, thus avoiding the necessity of a further appointment to that office after Major-General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Granville</inline> Ryrie&#39;s term expires in May next. The financial position in London requires the most skilled and careful attention. There are the questions of the large, shortterm debt, and of meeting the loan of &#163;13,000,000 which falls due in November. It is believed that the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> in connexion with these matters will be of the greatest value to the Commonwealth, and the Government is satisfied that the arrangement proposed is the one most calculated to promote the interests of Australia during the present critical period. </para>
