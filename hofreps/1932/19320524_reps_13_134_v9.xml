                            <para>- The amalgamation of some of the former departments in the new Department of the Interior has involved the displacement of between 30 and 40 officials. They include about nine or ten returned soldiers who, in accordance with the policy of the Government, are entitled to preferential treatment. The Government is endeavouring to find positions for all men whose services have been dispensed with, returned soldiers and others, in order to inflict as little hardship as possible. The possibilities of employment for the surplus men have been explored, but the matter is being dealt with on an equitable basis, and the 400 workers to whom the honorable member for Darling referred need have no apprehension. </para>

(2)  Do experts now consider that a continuous wireless telephone service between Tasmania and the mainland is practicable? ; (3) If money cannot be made available in the near future for the laying of a submarine telephone cable to Tasmania at a cost of £180,000, will the Postmaster-General again consider the proposal to establish wireless telephonic communication between that State and the mainland at an estimated  cost of £20,000 ? </para>

                        <para>- Such a letter from the Graziers Association is now receiving consideration. I am to confer in Sydney on Thursday with interested parties in  New South Wales and representatives of the State Department of Agriculture regarding the methods by which protection can be given to stock owners. The Commonwealth cannot make further moneys available for this purpose, but it is hoped that some arrangement may be made for the utilization of a portion of the unemployment relief grant in the construction of dips. That can be done, however, only with the co-operation of the State Government. </para>

                        <para>- The purchasing of the tobacco crop has scarcely commenced. For instance, the largest manufacturing company will only commence buying this week, apart from a few purchases already made in Queensland. Buying cannot be said to have begun in Victoria, where grading is still in progress. It is still too early to estimate how the agreement made between the Commonwealth and the manufacturers is operating, but if it be necessary,in order to keep the manufacturers up to their undertaking, the Government will not hesitate to place anembargo on imported tobacco. </para>

It would have given pleasure to the members of Cabinet had they been able to give representation on the board to the six States, but as only five persons were to be appointed, one State must have been left out. Other factors, such as the cost and loss of time in travelling over the vast distances of Australia, had to be considered. The Cabinet appointed the best commission available in the circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- As promised in my reply on the 17th March to the honorable member, I directed that an investigation be made into the allegations in question. This involved inquiries in Sydney and Launceston. The reports have just arrived in Canberra, and I hope to write to the honorable member on the subject within a few days. </para>

                <para class="block">A bill will be based on the resolution of the committee to provide two months' Supply from the end of the present financial year, the 30th June next. It is not proposed that Parliament should adjourn for the whole of July and August, the intention being to bring down the budget in July, if possible. But if Supply obtained now were for one month only, it would be necessary to bring down another Supply Bill immediately on the reassembling of the House, and that might delay the consideration of the budget. </para>
                <para>The provisions of the bill have been framed in the ordinary way. When Supply is asked for prior to the Government bringing down its financial proposals for the year, the practice is to base the sum asked for on the appropriation for the previous year. In this case, we ask for a sum which is one-sixth of that appropriated for the financial year 1931- 32. The amount of Supply which is now being asked for is £2,721,845. No greater sum will be expended, although, when the budget proposals have been introduced, it may be that the expenditure for the year will be less. </para>
                <para>The items of £200,000 for refunds of revenue, and £1,000,000 for the Treasurer's advance, may need some explanation. Refunds of revenue have to be made in cases in which taxpayers and others are entitled to get back money that they have paid, and an appropriation by way of an advance to the Treasurer is always made to enable him to meet certain expenditure so that the services of government can be carried on until the annual appropriation has been made by the Parliament. The provisions of  this measure are those ordinarily found in a Supply Bill, but if honorable members wish for information regarding any items, it can be given in committee on the bill. </para>
                <para>This appears to be an appropriate occasion for giving to the committee an indication of the general financial position of the Commonwealth. Last year it was estimated that there would be a deficit of £5.176,000 in the accounts of the year 1931-32, on the proposals in the last budget which were approved by the Parliament. When that budget was introduced, the granting of a moratorium with respect to war debts, and the suspension of reparations payments were under consideration, but as no final decision in the matter had then been made, provision for the interest payments with respect to war debts had to be included in the Estimates submitted to thisHouse. Happily, shortly after the Appropriation Bill was passed, the  Hoever  moratorium came into operation, and theeffect upon the Commonwealth financee was the reduction of our expenditure by £4,028,000. That is the net figure, obtained by deducting from the war debt interest payable the reparation paymentsof £800,000 per annum which we had been receiving from Germany. Consequently, the estimated deficit of £5,176,000 was reduced to £1,148,000, which became the substituted Commonwealth deficit under the Premiers plan. I do not intend to give the estimate for each individual item, but I shall indicate to the committee the total anticipated falling off of revenue, and the probable expenditure in broad outline. More than ten months of the present financial year have now passed, and it is thought that the receipts from customs and excise, and from the sales tax, will be less than was estimated in the last budget. The decreases, though substantial, are not staggering. There will also be a decrease in the revenue received from the Post Office, and from the Commonwealth railways. On the other hand, there will be an increase in income tax, brought about mainly by collections on assessments. for years prior to the present year. There will be other slight increases in revenue, but the genera] effect of the decreases and increases is that there will probably be approximately a gain in revenue to the extent of £1,000,000, against which has to be set off increases in expenditure. There is every indication that expenditure will be greater in several directions than the amounts appropriated. So far as controllable expenditure is concerned, there will be no increase, and the items of departmental expenditure will not be exceeded. But £250,000 more than was provided for has been spent on the relief of unemployment. I think that the members of the committee will agree as to the necessity for that disbursement. There will also be an increase in the expenditure on .old-age pensions and war pensions. The increase in the expenditure on invalid and old-age pensions is duc in considerable measure to the fact that, because of the depression, many old persons have found it necessary' to take advantage of the pension who in more prosperous times would have remained independent of government assistance. </para>
                <para>An increase in the road grant to the States has been caused automatically by the operation of the act under which that grant is made. As honorable members axe no doubt aware, an amount equivalent to the customs duty of 2£d. and the excise duty of lid. per gallon collected on petrol was substituted for the annual grant of £2,000,000 by the Commonwealth to the States. The estimate of the amount that would be payable under that arrangement has been substantially exceeded, because the imports of petrol are greater than was anticipated when the budget was introduced. </para>

                <para>The various increases in expenditure that I have indicated, plus a certain increase in sinking fund payments, make a probable total increase of about £1,000,000. Balancing that against the increase in revenue of about the same amount there is every prospect that at the end of the year the Commonwealth's position will be as forecast in the financial statement of last year - that is, we shall not exceed the deficit allowed under the Premiers plan. If anything, our expenditure will be slightly under that provided for under the plan. I have not given detailed figures because, as every"one accustomed to deal with Treasury matters is aware, an estimate of the income tax receipts for the last months of the financial year cannot be made confidently; but, broadly speaking, it is likely that the position contemplated under the Premiers plan will almost certainly be realized. </para>

                    <para>.- This is a Supply Bill to carry on the ordinary services of government for two months. No new matters arise out of it for discussion, and I take it that the general financial position can be more appropriately considered when the next budget is brought down, which, I presume, will be early in the new financial year. Therefore, I do not intend to delay the committee at this stage, beyond asking for an assurance from  the  Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> that during the forthcoming Parliamentary recess the Government will, within the two months for which Supply has been granted, devote itself to the formulation of a definite plan for the permanent relief of unemployment. It is admitted on all sides that the sum of £1,800,000 already granted for that purpose is but an instalment. I have estimated that it will be necessary to provide at least £1,000,000 a month, and a plan on that basis was formulated last year by my Government when we introduced the fiduciary currency legislation. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> stated that the grant of £1,800,000 was intended to meet the immediate needs of the unemployed during the winter months. I understand that a conference between the Commonwealth and the States will be held to consider the whole budgetary position, and I take it that on that occasion the fullest consideration will be given to the unemployment problem, because relief on a permanent basis is essential. </para>

                <para>It is true that the introduction of a Supply Bill opens up a number of avenues for discussion, but after all, in debating this measure we should be merely anticipating the discussion that will occur on the new budget. It is reassuring to know that the financial forecast made by the last Government is likely to be realized, and that the methods it adopted for the rehabilitation of the finances are proving practicable, since the Commonwealth expenditure is being kept well within the limits permitted under the Premiers plan. Evidently the Treasury officials and the departments generally have been keeping a watchful eye on the situation. I hope that all future forecasts will be as accurate and successful a3 the last has proved to be. In conclusion, I ' repeat my request that during recess the Government will give  the  closest possible attention to the unemployment problem and take definite action regarding it. </para>

                    <para>. - I congratulate the Government on being able to produce a budget which approximates the estimates prepared in accordance with the Premiers plan, and I hope that the various State Governments will also be able to bring their budgets into line. I am particularly pleased to learn that the Federal Aid Roads grant is to be increased by £400,000 over the amount first estimated. This will provide relief for unemployed in country districts, and there is no more useful way of spending such money than in improving access to country districts, thus facilitating production and cheapening costs. </para>

                <para>I should like to have heard from the Government some announcement of the procedure to be followed at the Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa. I recognize that it might not be wise for the Government to make a comprehensive statement on this matter, but I cannot help expressing my regret that efforts have not been made to encourage, to a greater degree than has been done, the representation of various commercial interests at the conference. I know that five representatives have been appointed; one from the manufacturing industries, two from the two primary industries - meat and butter; a fourth to represent Labour; and a fifth to represent general commercial interests. I had hoped that there would be a stronger business representation. If the discussions at Ottawa lead to the granting of certain tariff concessions, it would be wise to have the agreement arrived at concurred in by the representatives of as many Australian interests as possible. If this happened the arrangement would receive general endorsement in Australia. It would be a calamity if concessions were granted by Great Britain to Australian industries, in return for consideration in regard to certain matters in which that country is interested, and commercial interests in this country declined to give effect to the Australian side of the understanding. If that were to happen, the concessions would probably lapse. I believe that, at the Ottawa Conference, we might take the first step towards the formation of a comprehensive plan of Empire development which, if carried out, would do more to advance the interests of every part of the Empire than anything yet achieved, besides helping to lift the world out of the existing depression. It is important that as many contacts as possible should be established between the representatives of big business interests in the various parts of the Empire. The problem of the future economic relations between the various parts of the Empire is one that governments of themselves cannot solve ; all they can do is to ratify agreements arrived at between the representatives of business interests. If those representatives are brought together at a conference such as is to be held at Ottawa, a favorable atmosphere can be created for the making of trade agreements. A great opportunity presents itself atthis conference for taking an important step towards the rationalization of industry throughout the Empire. That this can be achieved without any marked change in tariffs has been proved by what has taken place recently between Canada and Great Britain in connexion with two important industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Colville,</inline> speaking in the House of Commons two or three months ago, stated that, as a result of a working arrangement between Canadian and British iron and steel interests, the percentage of British steel used in Canada had increased from 3 per cent. in 1928, to 25 per cent. in 1931. At the present time, negotiations are in progress between the representatives of the leather industry in the two countries. On 27 th February, the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> stated, in a message from Canada, that the tanners were prepared to divide the leather industry with Britain. They urged their association to analyse the position so as to define the limit of concession which could be granted for the purpose of establishing an Empire-wide trade in leather. </para>

                        <para>- We should have representatives at Ottawa to meet the trade representatives of other countries in order to compare costs and prices. A rational arrangement might be arrived  at, not only in regard to primary industries, but in regard to secondary industries as well. If we could induce the dominions, which supply so large a portion of Great Britain's foodstuffs, to make a joint request for concessions, we should have a sound case to work on. Australia herself cannot supply all the meat Britain requires, but Australia, New Zealand and South Africa could probably supply all the mutton and lamb, and a great deal of the beef which Britain consumes. Much the same thing applies to butter. In regard to secondary industries, it should be possible to enter into an arrangement that would ensure maximum production at the cheapest rate in each section of the Empire. Thus the Empire would present a united front to foreign competition, and would not only supply its own market, but would be able to compete in foreign markets as well. If Empire-wide co-operation on this scale could be achieved, the re-arrangement of tariffs would become comparatively simple, because the distrust and resentment which is now too often associated with tariff making would be removed. </para>

                <para>I am disappointed that the financial statement placed before us contains no reference to the holding of referendums in accordance with the policy announced by the Prime Minister and by myself before the last elections. In order to bring about a reduction in the cost of government, and of production generally, it was arranged that referendums should be held to enable a federal tribunal to determine the minimum basic wage and maximum standard hours throughout Australia. It was also decided that a referendum should be held to amend the Constitution so as to allow the people of any State, regardless of the inactivity of their government, to partition that State if they thought fit. The Commonwealth was also to seek power to deport from Australia foreign agitators disturbing the public peace. </para>
                <para>I believe that we shall not be able to reduce costs of production, or obtain harmony in industry, until we have a uniform basic wage throughout Australia. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> when speaking at the Premiers conference in February last, said that he was wholeheartedly in favour of a uniform basic wage, because he re garded the present system of varying rates as one of the prime causes of industrial unrest. If Parliament rises for several months as has been suggested, much valuable time will be lost before these proposals can be put into effect. No provision has been made in the Supply Bill to defray the cost of referendums. I observe that the Treasurer's advance amounts to £1,000,000, some of which, no doubt, could be spen t in taking referendums, so that I am not entirely without hope that the Government may yet change its mind in regard to these matters. I impress on the Government the urgent need for action. Costs of production and of government must be reduced,and the method agreed upon before the elections is the best way of bringing it about. </para>

                    <para>.- I am disappointed that no provision is made in this Supply Bill for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to probe further into the possibilities of extracting oil from coal. On many occasions I have ventilated the subject in this House. Because of its geographical situation Australia relies wholly on imported oil fuels, and, should we be involved in hostilities, ours would be an unenviable position. I have many times directed attention to the splendid research and practical work that has been done by Messrs. Lyons Brothers. Both the Scullin Government and the New South Wales State Government have obtained reports upon those activities, and I quote the following extract from the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rivett,</inline> who acted on behalf of the Government. It states - </para>

                        <para>The outstanding factor was the special nature of Maitland (40 per cent. volatile) coal which is said to be different from any others yet worked with, and one ton of which produces 40 gallons of oil. </para>

                <para class="block">This activated fuel has been used to propel a five-ton motor lorry, with very satisfactory results. It has been reported overseas that the extraction of oil from  coal is not a commercial proposition, because there is no market for the accumulated coke residue, even in such a highly industrialized country as England. Here, surely, is the solution. After the oil is extracted, the remaining coke, which represents fourteen to fifteen cwt. of every ton of coal, can be activated to produce a fuel admirably suited to drive motor vehicles of the type referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rivett.</inline> The report of that gentleman also states - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>There are too many unknown and undetermined factors about the Lyons Brothers low temperature distillation work on Maitland coal to permit the drawing of any definite -conclusion in favour of the economic feasibility of the establishment of their process on n large scale. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">These unknown and undetermined factors exist only because of the lack of capital possessed by Lyons Brothers, who have demonstrated that they can produce oil of a high-grade quality suitable for the propulsion of motor vehicles, also oil suitable for Diesel engines. It is tragic that any Australian Government should neglect to foster an industry which promises, if properly developed, to mako Australia independent of overseas oil supplies. It would further bring about the rehabilitation of the coal industry, which is languishing because coal has been superseded by benzine. The development of the new industry would give us a favorable trade balance with the United States of America, in which country we expend £17,000,000 per annum to purchase oils and motor fuel. That money could be retained in Australia for the good of the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>I should like to know what is to be done with the balance of the £100,000 that was allotted by the Scullin Government to repatriate coal-miners. I understand that between £50,000 and £60,000 of the money has been expended; a proportion of it in developing the shale oil industry at Newnes, in conjunction with the State Government of New South Wales. It was recently disclosed in the press that that industry has been handed over to private enterprise, and that the Commonwealth Government' proposes to subsidize the new company on a £1 for £1 basis to the extent of £10,000, so that a tunnel may be put through from Wolgan Valley to Capertee Valley, where shale deposits of a high commercial value are said to exist. There can be no question that the re-establishment of our coal industry possesses far greater possibilities than the development of the shale-oil industry. Further, the development of the latter is a very expensive process, whereas our coal-mines have already been developed, and are lying idle. It would be a far better commercial proposition for the Government to foster the endeavours of the Lyons brothers, who, if granted £20,000, will immediately employ 30 men, and undertake to employ 300 men within two years. </para>

That would be a regrettable action, tantamount to a breach of faith with the coal industry. The opportunity presents itself to establish our coal industry, and satisfactorily to adjust our trade balance with the United States of America, and I hope the Government will take advantage of it. </para>

                    <para>. - I am disappointed with the manner in which the unemployment relief council in New South Wales is functioning. To date I have forwarded to the council, either directly or through the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> about 30 applications for the allocation of money to various public works. Included amongst them was a proposal for a water supply which would cost about £2,700, of which between 70 per cent, and 80 per cent, would be expended upon labour. The Prime Minister and his colleagues have repeatedly said that the relief grant should be expended on reproductive  works, and to my amazement this water supply project was rejected by the Unemployment Council. The secretary of that body wrote to me that this matter was one to be dealt with by the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission. That body has no money for carrying out new works ; otherwise this job would have been undertaken long ago. I ask the Prime Minister to expedite the publication of the list of works approved by the Unemployment Council in New South Wales. </para>

                <para>I am sorry that the Government did not see fit to ask Parliament to appropriate an amount for the relief of the unemployed in Canberra, and has decided instead to make a sum available from the Consolidated Revenue. This. Government has reduced considerably the unemployment relief in the Federal Capital. The domestic responsibilities of the Commonwealth towards the citizens of its own territory are insignificant compared with those of the Government of Tasmania, yet the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> has adopted a cheeseparing policy which has resulted in the discontinuance of works and the placing of men on the dole. From hundreds of platforms during the last general election the Prime Minister and his supporters emphasized the necessity for taking men off the dole. The Scullin Government established in Canberra the best system in Australia for ration relief and the provision of work for the unemployed.. The present Government has substituted a policy which may save any amount up to £30,000 by discontinuing employment on relief works, but will largely increase the amount to be expended on rations. Canberra offers excellent opportunities for the saving of money by the expenditure of unemployment relief funds. It is better to expend £30,000 on the permanent surfacing of existing gravel roads, thus saving from £300 to £1,100 a year in maintenance, than to spend only half that amount on the dole. These road works, if not reproductive in the ordinary sense of the term, will at least save money to the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>In addition to the serious diminution of unemployment relief in Canberra and the Northern Territory, the Government has adopted a policy of drastic retrenchment. </para>
                <para class="block">Any Government may balance its budget by sacking its employees, but I do not agree with the methods adopted by the Government to effect economies at Canberra. Men who have given as much as twenty years' loyal service to the Commonwealth have received merely a curt note that they are no longer required. I have in mind three married men with families, men who are householders and taxpayers; their services have been dispensed with, and their positions have been filled by men whose domestic obligations are less. One single man, I am told, is to be brought from Queensland to Canberra to take the place of a married man. There are also disquieting rumours that effect is being given to the inhuman policy enunciated at a recent meeting in Canberra that government employees should be dismissed in order to make room for returned soldiers. I have been told that men with large family responsibilities are to be sacked to make room for ex-soldiers who have been displaced from clerical jobs. I received assurances to the contrary from the Prime Minister yesterday and from the Minister for the Interior this morning, but the rumours are so persistent that I again raise this matter now, knowing that Parliament may adjourn to-day for a couple of months. I hope that the Minister for the Interior will not countenance any policy which involves the sacking of men, many of whom were not fit or able to go to the war - men who have helped to pioneer this city, and who have large family responsibilities. When preference to soldiers was first introduced, not even the most enthusiastic advocate of it ever imagined that it would be applied as is contemplated by one section in Canberra. Repeatedly within the last few weeks returned soldiers have come to me with assurances that they do not believe in this policy, that every man should take his chance, that no man should be discriminated against because he could not go to the war, and that no man with large family responsibilities should be displaced by men without such obligations. </para>

Indeed, while I was Minister for Home Affairs I saw correspondence asking that all Government posts, from Civic Administrator down to nightman, should be given to returned soldiers. I hope that nothing will be done to make worse the conditions of employment in Canberra, and that the drastic policy of retrenchment and diminuation of unemployment relief will be discontinued. Instead of putting men on the dole the Government should provide employment on works that will constitute a definite improvement to the Federal Capital city. </para>

                    <para>. - For 40 years the abolition of unemployment has been one of my most cherished ideals. Amongst the curses by which humanity is afflicted unemployment is second only to war. Ministry after ministry in both State and Federal Parliaments has tackled this problem, but no permanent cure for it has been found. No ministry has handled the problem as it should have been handled. Whatever relief the Commonwealth Government proposes to give should be given quickly. I recollect asking the right honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> early in his political career that drill halls should be made available to shelter the homeless unemployed. So promptly did he act that within 24 hours the homeless in Melbourne were housed in the drill halls, and supplied with blankets. I am sorry that when subsequently confronted with similar emergencies the right honorable gentleman did not act with the same promptitude. We must remove from Australia the curse of unemployment, and it would be well worth while to hold a special session, from which party feeling would be eliminated, so as to do all within our power to solve the unemployment problem. If it were a question of war, how quickly would we act ! But is not the present difference between those who want work and those who have it of greater moment ? During the war human life was sacrificed with a recklessness which made one view it with horror. There was no trouble in Australia until after the war, when we introduced a system of bookkeeping which saddled, not only this generation, but every generation to follow, with huge debt and interest commitments. For every £100 we pay to America to meet our interest debt, we have to send an additional £19. Yet some people say that if we refuse to do that, we shall be a party to repudiation. I can only say " God give sense to the people who contend that Australia should bear such a burden ". Germany has said that it cannot, and will not pay its debts. Every European nation is in a somewhat similar position. The United States of America set a splendid example of generosity when, in respect of the debt owed to it by Italy, it arranged that no interest would be paid for five years, that an interest rate of 2s. 6d. per cent, would " apply for the next ten years ; 5s. per cent, for the next ten years ; 10s. per cent, for the next ten years, and so on, until towards the end of the 60 years' period, the interest rate would be 1 per cent. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>If we are to follow the scriptures we must get rid of the curse of interest payments find unemployment. If we would only spend one-tenth of what we expended willingly on the war, there would be little or no unemployment in the community. Although every government throughout Australia is at present disorganized, our workers have completed the Sydney Harbour bridge. The Englishman who supervised that work stated that our educated workers were unsurpassed in the world. The great Australian, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bradfield,</inline> who designed the bridge said that if it were necessary, the same organization could bridge the Sydney heads. I asked him how was it that our politicians, our thinkers, our statesmen, our university professors, could not suggest some solution of the unemployment problem? He replied that, they would not organize, that they had brains but would not use them. Professors who have studied the habits of ants and bees tell us that never in the hive of the ant or the bee has want or privation existed. It is said that the human being is the highest form of life, and that man is fashioned in God's image; but I doubt that, because I cannot imagine that the Almighty has a form similar to that of some human beings whom I have seen. What is Godlike aboutus is our little spark of conscience, which never lies to us. No human being should suffer in a country like Australia, which produces far more of the necessaries of life than its people can consume. This so-called civilization has been fooled by a system of bookkeeping which has piled up our war debts. It has been said that the great Napoleon left France without a national debt. One of the most important merchants of Melbourne, who had been abroad for some years, told me that he had lived in France in preference to London because the taxation in Great Britain was so heavy that it would have ruined him to live there. He told me that the taxation in Paris was almost a bagatelle in comparison. I asked him the reason for that. He attributed the low taxation in France to the wonderful organization of which the great Napoleon laid the foundations when he appointed what are known as the 800 Communes. Those Communes had to present their accounts every quarter to the central authority. He also attributed the financial stability of France to the wonderful management of the Bank of Franco. Instead of following the example of that nation, the Scullin Government invited a gentleman from Canada to come here and to institute the awful sales tax. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer was also invited to Australia. I was told that he had come here uninvited, but some months later I learnt that that was a lie. Seeing that he was an invited guest, he should have received more courtesy than he did receive at the hands of the Government of the day. We did not follow his advice, because similar advice had not enabled Great Britain to overcome its financial problems. I disagreed with his views, but he certainly admitted that I was right when I said that the United States of America had treated Great Britain with generosity by reducing the interest rate on its loans to 3 per cent. for ten years. He also stated that Australia could not be treated by Great Britain as generously as the United States of America had dealt with Great Britain. That is where he and. I differed. I still say that England, despite its financial problems, should treat usasgenerously as it has treated France, Italy and Portugal. God has blessed Australia; because it produces three times as much food as the people can consume, yet there are in the community little children whose health is being impaired by lack of milk and proper food. There are medical men who will verify my statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Robertson</inline> and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur</inline> did a great deal of good work in that respect. They have shown clearly that a child which does not have proper food will never become a healthy adult, and healthy citizens are the. greatest asset that any nation can possess. </para>

                        <para>- That is very satisfactory. The difficulties with which thisGovernment has had to contend in connexion with New South Wales has caused it to defer much legislation which should have been before this Parliament. There should be no undue delay in lightening the burden of taxation upon the people, particularly in respect of the tariff. I desire to impress upon the committee the absolute necessity for cutting down governmental expenditure in Australia. It would be disastrous to continue along the lines that have been followed in the past. Both Commonwealth andState Governments are taking from the people much money that ought to be used in production. In 1920, about £115,000,000 sufficed for Commonwealth and State Government activities, but in 1930 the expenditure in that direction had increased to £391,000,000. The Government might well have introduced its Supply bill yesterday, and afforded a full opportunity for considering in what direction economy  could be effected. I was greatly surprised to learn, a little while back, that u clerk in the Commonwealth Public Service, whoso salary is under £450 per annum, is paid, under an arbitration award, when travelling, say, between Melbourne and Canberra, not only a travelling allowance of 8s. Sd., with a free ticket, and a free sleeping berth, but also an " excess " allowance at an hourly rate, varying according to his pay, for the time occupied in travel between that at which be would ordinarily leave his office and 10.30 p.m., when he would go to bed in the sleeping car, and again from 7 o'clock, when he rose, until the ordinary time for commencing work. For travelling between Melbourne and Canberra, " excess " travelling time would cost £1 128. 10d., and between Canberra and Melbourne 19s. lid. I have no objection to the payment of officers' out-of-pocket expenses when travelling on duty, but it is scandalous that the travelling allowances prescribed by the Public Service Arbitrator are approved by the Government. Members of the Public Service Board receive high salaries for the work of classifying the service, and the effect of their labours is being destroyed by decisions of the Public Service Arbitrator. Under one stupid regulation, if a boy of seventeen or eighteen years of age marries, he must be paid at the rate applicable to adults. Goodness knows where this extravagance will end. </para>

                <para>I would have liked to hear from the Prime Minister what the Government proposes to do regarding the conversion of loans, and what prospect there is not only of the success1 of the conversion this year of stock amounting to £15,000,000, but also of making large conversions in the future years. Next year £37,000,000 ; in the following year, £47,000,000, and in the year after that £57,000,000 will have to be converted. Some of these loans were probably floated at 3 per cent, or 3£ per cent., and a blunder might be made if we suggested that they should be converted at a certain rate of interest, which might be higher than the original rate. The success we shall achieve with regard to those loans will be determined to a great extent by the efforts we make to reduce governmental expenditure. Australia needs to encourage capitalists from overseas to come here, and to help in the development of the resources of this country. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> recently asked the Government to advance some thousands of pounds for the promotion of a certain scheme of development; but I claim that private enterprise should be left to undertake such work. Governments in other countries recognize that such risks properly belong to private enterprise. If schemes are worth developing, private capital will be available for the work. I recently had a conversation with a geologist from the United States of America, who is now proceeding to Longreach for the purpose of making  geological investigations. He told me that the interests with which he was associated made a practice of sending geologists into new areas and allowing them to carry out their work for two or even three years, without supplying reports; but, he said, that when  favorable  indications were reported, hundreds of millions of dollars were made available for the purpose of carrying out exploration work. When it can be shown that a margin of profit is obtainable from a certain undertaking, private enterprise will provide the necessary capital; but, in this country, there is generally some person with a plausible tongue, who, having failed to obtain money from private sources, can induce a government to grant a subsidy. Public expenditure of this kind too often results in heavy loss to the taxpayers. *  </para>
                <para>I see no reference in this bill to a grant to Western Australia. In 1927, a bill was passed through this Parliament under which that State was to receive £3,000,000 per annum on account of its disabilities under federation. It was recently stated by the Premier of South Australia that owing to the operation  of the tariff, that State lost about £2,000,000 per annum. If South Australia is a heavy loser under federation, how great must be the loss of Western Australia, which is essentially a primary producing State? Its productions are chiefly wheat, wool, and metals, and at every turn its settler? are faced with the injurious effects of the tariff. Whenever new land is  developed in that State increased employment is found for secondary industries in Victoria and New South Wales. Owing to the operation of the Navigation Act, the freight from Melbourne to Perth is greater than from London to Perth. Western Australia is the greatest sufferer of all the States under federation. I do not suppose, for a moment, that the Government will suspend the payment' of the annual subsidy to that State. The independent commission which investigated the claims of Western Australia recommended by a majority that £450,000 per year should be granted, and the amount made available was £300,000. Two of the Commissioners reported that, under federal legislation, Western Australia had no chance of making good, and the sooner she left the federation the better it would be for her. Personally, I am not in favour of the principle of federal subsidies to States. Such payments would not be necessary if all the States were placed on a fair competitive basis, and allowed to buy in the cheapest markets of the world. </para>

                    <para>. - It is necessary to make substantial provision for unemployment. The depressed conditions now experienced generally in Australia should make us intent on establishing payable industries. Australia to-day supplies 80 per cent, of the world's output of pearl shell, and it could easily meet the whole of the requirements. Under present conditions, the output is restricted " under regulations issued by the Commonwealth Government. This means that only half the number of boats formerly employed are working to-day, but seeing that Australia has almost a monopoly of the output, what logical objection can there be to producing and manufacturing the whole of the world's requirements in Australia! There are, in the north of Aus-  tralia, huge pearl beds which are not being worked because of the controlled ' output. Last year, the total value of the output amounted to £81,520, but that production could be increased threefold if an incentive were given for increased activity in the industry. I draw attention to the last paragraph in the Tariff Board's report on this industry. </para>

The value of the peanut crop last year was £9,777, and the nuts realized 7.22d. per lb. About 50 tons was sold outside the government ring, and it realized a slightly higher price. The land that is available and suitable for the cultivation of this crop belongs to the people of Australia, and we should make use of this means of providing employment in profitable directions. The mining reports show that about 150 men have "been sent out, and, with the assistance of the Government, a considerable quantity of ore has been mined, but no assistance is given in treating the ore. I pointed out the other day that many industries have reached the saturation point, but in north Australia numerous opportunities for development are offered. I gave the Minister the official report of the American cattlemen who visited the territory. If land like that in many parts of the Northern Territory were found in America, it would quickly be put to profitable use. This country, being Crown property, could be leased at a peppercorn rental, and people could be removed to it from the congested city areas. I hope that the Government will consider the advisability of expending money for developmental purposes in the manner I have indicated. The present method of relieving unemployment by giving such work as shifting sand will not provide a permanent solution of the problem of unemployment.

                <para>I was interested in the statement of the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> that he hoped that some concessions would be granted to Australia at the forthcoming Ottawa Conference. Unfortunately, the Government has not afforded this House an opportunity to discuss the matters to be considered at the conference, but I have read in the press, that not only members of the British Labour party, but representative men in other parties, are already preparing the Australian public for the disappointment they must experience. The Ottawa Conference, so far from conferring benefits on Australia, is more likely to produce a threat from the British Government that all existing preferences to Australian produce will be withdrawn if we are not prepared to lower our tariff wall. The right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> whilst professing to be almost a free trader, yet advocates the erection of a high tariff wall about the Empire, in the hope that Australia may be better able, if that is done, to sell its exportable products. During the war we had no difficulty in selling our wheat and wool, and some professing patriots may be interested to know that the British Government was buying Australian wheat at half the price it was paying to other Dominions, and at one-third of the price paid to other countries. This House should at least have an opportunity to discuss the proposals to be submitted at the Ottawa Conference by the Australian delegation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> Runciman, *president of the British </para>
                <para class="block">Board of Trade, has already been outspoken regarding the little that Australia may expect from that gathering, and Lord Vestey, the meat king, has been very frank on the subject of meat. No doubt Great Britain could provide an enormous market for Australian produce, but it takes only a very small proportion of our exportable surplus, and but for the market that was found in the East last year, an enormous surplus of wheat would have been left on our hands. The Government should consider whether it is worth while for the Commonwealth to send delegates to Ottawa in the absence of any assurance that definite advantage will accrue to this country. If the conference is to be utilized merely to enable the British delegates to brow-beat the Commonwealth into the reduction of tariff duties, the Government should not inspire our wheat-producers with hopes that are doomed to disappointment. During thd war Great Britain bought our wool at a fixed price, and sold it to foreign countries at a considerable profit. The British Government, not the Australian producers, obtained the benefit of the high prices thus realized. Australia has never received a fair deal in regard to the sale of its primary products overseas. When the British people wanted our wheat or wool they bought it, and did not concern themselves with world prices. They appealed to the patriotism of the Australian people, and our producers sold their wheat and wool overseas at much less than world prices. Today world prices are quoted against us: we are told that the cost of production must be reduced to enable our exportable commodities to be sold at prices which will enable them to compete with the products of other countries. When a shipload of timber arrived in Sydney from the Russian Soviet Republic some honorable members were much concerned, and demanded that the Government should inquire whether that timber had been produced with slave labour. Why do they not ask the British Government to inquire into the conditions under which the Soviet wheat, that is now being bought in England, was* produced ? The <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Sun</inline> published, a week ago, an article warning the Australian people that Great Britain will continue to buy wheat,  meat and other commodities in the cheapest market. One gentleman closely connected with the British Government stated that the United Kingdom would have to purchase large quantities of Soviet wheat; otherwise the dumping of Lt on other markets would cause a further depression of prices. </para>
                <para>Regarding the alleviation of unemployment I have definite views. This problem will never be solved while the existing social order continues. There must be a complete reconstruction of the system of government so that the welfare of the people will be the first concern of constituted authority. Those honorable members who are continually defending private enterprise should realize that it has failed to meet the needs of the people to-day. They do not speak of leaving to private enterprise such businesses as the conduct of hostels; those conveniences they declare should be provided from the public purse. I suggest to honorable members opposite that if, instead  of always looking to the other side of the world for their political opinions, they would take an Australian national view of these problems, there would be some hope of making substantial progress. The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> is one of the most sincere men in this Parliament, but I have no faith in his proposal for the holding of a special session to deal with unemployment. There is no prospect of curing this evil until currency and finance are controlled by the representatives, of the people. Honorable members say that there should be no political control of banking and currency, but the Commonwealth Bank is controlled politically, and by one party only. Currency problems should be decided by Parliament and not by a" board representing only one section of political opinion. </para>

                <para>Two or three things are worrying me at the moment. First of  all, the possibility of a long  recess,  during which unemployment may become even more acute. Parliament will not be sitting, so it will not be possible for the Government to obtain further supply to meet an emergency; although, I hope, one will not arise. Nor do 1 think that the Government has done all that is possible to encourage companies to respond to its appeal, and do something to relieve unemployment by stimulating industry. I have in mind the project of a company in my electorate. That concern bought a large area of land from the Melbourne Harbour Trust, with the concurrence of the State Government, prepared plans, and was about to build an oil refinery on most modern lines. The land cost between £50,000 and £60,000, and in a signed agreement the company guaranteed that within twelve months it would expend £750,000, largely on labour. I immediately set to work on behalf of the unemployed in the district, and arranged that the company should employ a larger number of men than was originally intended by flooding the area with electric light and using three shifts, instead of one. At the time I had not the remotest idea that the Federal Government would object to the work proceeding, as the operations of the company did not involve any alteration of the tariff. Ever since the agreement was signed in November last work has been held up, and 600 men have been denied employment. </para>
                <para>I understand that the Federal Government takes exception to the enterprise. Judging from the utterances of Ministers.  on tobacco and other items, the. Government does not intend to interfere in fiscal matters except when an enterprise or duty would result in a loss of revenue. That, of course, is a consideration, but it is more than outweighed by the field of taxation that would be introduced if this large number of men were set to work. The preliminary part of the work would take twelve months, and would employ 600 men, working in three shifts of 200 each. That would merely prepare foundations for the building. Every body knows the indirect advantage to the surrounding district would be almost incalculable. A further twelve months would be taken to complete the building, 90' per cent, of Australian raw materials being used, and two years would elapse before the company began to place its products on the market. The Commonwealth Government would, therefore, have ample time to readjust any slight unbalancing of its revenues that might occur. Personally I foresee only advantage from the enterprise. The company would manufacture crude into refined oil. I see no more objection to that than to the manufacture of boots, hats, clothes, or anything else. Every time I go to my electorate I am worried by those who were promised employment, and I should like the Government either to allow the job to proceed promptly, or make a definite pronouncement on the subject. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> spoke about the sum of £100,000 which was allotted for the re-absorption of surplus coal-miners into industry. I had something to do with the inauguration of that scheme, and I have seen some of the samples of oil that have been extracted from shale deposits as a result of the expenditure of a portion of the money. This country has numerous shale oil deposits, but at present lacks a modern refinery to treat shale. The factory to which I have referred would have provided adequate facilities, and it undertook in writing to use Australian raw products whenever they could be supplied. Surely it is of advantage to Australia to have this modern oil refinery? I know that the Minister for Trade and Customs believes that transport costs would be reduced if we had refineries in two or three, or, if possible, in all of the capital cities, rather than one great central refinery. I do not know whether his scheme is possible, but I do know that we have nothing in Australia that can be compared with the refinery that was to be established in my electorate. Because of that, I can ascribe^ no sound reason to the objection raised by the Government, which, in common with every other Federal Government since federation, seeks to initiate industries and to foster existing ones. I urge the Minister to give a favorable decision,, or, at least, to make a definite pronouncement on the subject. </para>
                <para>I should also like to know whether the Government has made provision for the taking of the census at an early date. Our present census statistics are woefully out of date, "and are of little use for economic calculations. There are many unemployed who cannot do pick and shovel work, but who could be most appropriately employed taking the census. That task, and the building of the oil refinery to which I have referred, would create the stimuli which the Minister says is so necessary, if we are successfully to grapple with the unemployment problem. </para>

I assure honorable members that that is certainly being done. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> At the recent Premiers ' Conference, an arrangement was arrived at whereby the expenditure of £3,000,000 would be undertaken in an effort to assist in the solution of the problem of unemployment. All the employment councils are now operating,  and it  is sincerely hoped that, out of the work that they are doing, there will be evolved schemes of a truly reproductive character which will lead to the permanent absorption of our unemployed. If those schemes are a success, there will be every reason for proceeding further, and of expanding the undertakings now being embarked upon. I assure the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> and honorable members opposite, that the Government will carefully watch the unemployment situation during the recess. There appears to be some uncertainty as to what I said regarding the reassembling of Parliament. I said that the Government proposed to bring down the budget during July, and that, of course, would necessitate the re-assembling of Parliament. </para>

This is a matter which is, to some extent, associated with the problem of unemployment. The honorable member spoke of the Government. " allowing " the work to go on. The Government is doing nothing to prevent it. The company could begin erecting the refinery to-morrow if it wanted to. The only way in which the Government isinvolved is that the company, apparently, desires, the Government to give an undertaking that the existing margin of 3d. a gallon between the import duty and excise rates on refined petrol will be maintained. The Government will certainly not give any such undertaking. The; honorable member's statement that the present margin has- existed for a considerable period - for ten or fifteen yea,rs - is not true. Up- to 1927, the difference was only Id..- The honorable member may confirm my statement by consulting the official figures-. The Government is not likely to give the undertaking asked for when it has before it a report of the Tariff Board stating that a margin of 1-Jd. would be sufficient, to protect  the industry in this country. </para>

The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> reminded him that, if the pro position were as good as he made out. there would be no difficulty in getting private capital to develop it. The most exhaustive experiments have been proceeding over a period of years in Germany and Great Britain with a view to making a. commercial success of this process. Through the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Government has access to the results of those experiments. The honorable member may rest assured that if anything of real promise is discovered - and enormous sums of money are being spent on research - the Government' will not be dilatory in- taking such steps as may be necessary to place the industry in Australia on a. sound basis-. Athe  present time, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is bringing an expert to Australia, before whom the honorable member for Hunter may pui his case. </para>
                <para>I deprecate the attitude taken up by the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> when discussing the Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa. According to him,. Australia has. been badly treated by Great Britain in regard to trade. He stated that, during, the wai. Great Britain had paid less for Australian wheat than foc wheat bought in other countries. The honorable member forgot to mention that Australian wheat had to be conveyed an enormous distance to Great Britain as compared with wheat from other countries, and thai if Britain had used her available transport during the war to&gt; bring all her wheat supplies from the nearest point of production, say, Canada, Australia would not have sold one bushel of wheat, and it would have been left rotting on our hands. The honorable member also said that Britain had treated us ungenerously during the war with regard to wool. Again, the honorable member forgot to mention that we entered into an agreement with Britain for the sale of all our wool at ls. 3d. per lb. for the period of the war, and that half of any profits made by Great Britain should be returned to Australia by the British Government - the actual owners of the wool. I do not think that that can be regarded as ungenerous treatment. The honorable member said that Britain had taken only a small portion of our exports - a " fleabite," I think, was the word he used. The fact is that, for many years, Britain has taken more than half our exports. 1 agree with the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> that it would be impracticable for the Government to permit a general discussion regarding the policy to be pursued by Australia's delegates at the Ottawa Conference. Many difficult questions have to be settled; but negotiations on both sides will be conducted with a view to achieving the maximum mutual benefit. It is of vital importance to Britain that Australia should regain her prosperity. Whatever concessions we grant to Britain at the present time can be of relatively little value, because of Australia's reduced purchasing power. In the days of our prosperity we were Britain's second best customer, and, if we can overcome our economic difficulties, there is no reason why we should not resume that place. It is also important to Australia that Britain's purchasing power should be restored, because it is to the British market that we must look for any real expansion of our exporting industries. We, in Australia, have conceded important benefits to Great Britain over a period of many years. I was extremely sorry to have brought under my notice the British press references to the attitude Britain was likely to take up at the Ottawa Conference. It was stated in those newspaper extracts that Britain had recently imposed a tariff under which it had granted a preference of 10 per cent, to many items of dominion produce. That preference, however, would expire in November, and, unless Australia was prepared to grant greater preference to British goods, British preference would not be renewed in respect to our produce. The tone of the articles was something in the nature of an ultimatum. I am certain that that will not be the attitude of the British Government. If it were, it is not one that Australia or her representatives could tolerate. If we are to be treated at the conference to statements about what the British Navy has done for us, and are to be told that our stocks in Great Britain are trustee stocks, it will be necessary for Australia to remind those who say such things that Australia, for many years, and with a very meagre response from Britain, has granted substantial preference to British goods. That this preference has been of value is indicated by the great volume of trade Britain has done with Australia. I am certain, however, that such an attitude will not be taken up by the British Government, nor will it be necessary for the Australian representatives to mention the things I have referred to. </para>
                <para>At the forthcoming conference all the delegates must look to the future. Australia must do whatever is possible, consonant with her own vital interests, to promote British trade in the Australian market. Britain, I am sure, will reciprocate with respect to Australian products. Until our representatives get to the conference we shall not have an opportunity of discussing with the British delegates those products which it is vital to us that we should place on the British market, nor the means by which we may assist British trade in the Australian market. We must assure to Britain all the trade that we can possibly give her in this country, because it is our desire to give her priority over other nations. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> referred to the taking of a census. The Government has this matter under consideration at the present time. It is most anxious to proceed with the census, because it desires to obtain necessary information for statistical purposes, and because this work will provide employment for a class not catered for under any of the existing unemployment relief schemes. The matter is largely governed by financial considerations, and in these is involved not only the finances of the Commonwealth, but of the States as well. We have already made considerable progress with a general review of national finances, and I hope that we shall shortly be able to decide whether or not it will be possible to take a census. </para>
                <para>The suggestion has been made that Parliament should not go into recess, as is proposed. Some honorable members implied that the Government would be guilty of a dereliction of duty if it were to adjourn Parliament now, and not call it together again until July. I suggest that that opinion has no foundation in fact. It is contemplated that a </para>
                <para class="block">Premiers Conference and a meeting of the Loan Council should take place during the third week of June. The budgets of the Commonwealth and of the States will : then be considered, so that we may arrive at the financial policy of Australia for the coming year. The task that is confronting the Commonwealth and the States is one of the greatest difficulty, and if we are to find a solution of our many problems, it is absolutely essential that the fullest preparatory work should be done before those conferences take place. It is, therefore, necessary that Parliament shall adjourn now so that Ministers may concentrate upon the questions which have to be considered at the conference. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Swan has referred to the economies that are to take place in the coming year. He has raised certain specific questions which he thinks should be considered. I can assure him that all those questions are being considered, but they do not arise under the Supply Bill, which is based upon last year's appropriation. I agree with the honorable member that it is desirable that we should reduce taxation in order to stimulate industry and employment. But, although we have reached a point beyond which we can scarcely go in the matter of taxation, the financial stress is so great that it is extremely difficult to see how taxation can be reduced. The honorable member indicated that he would like to know what the Government contemplated in respect of maturing loans. We have a loan of £13,000.000, borrowed by New South Wales falling due in London next November, and other large loans mature in the following year. At the moment I cannot give any indication of the Government's loan policy. I do not think that any one in Australia could indicate now what the financial policy of Ausis to be, or what are the possibilities. The decision made by the electors of New South Wales and Queensland on the 11th June, is the vital factor. If, as a result of those elections, governments are returned to power which declare for a policy of honesty, the standing to our obligations, and the balancing of budgets, which would restore confidence in Australia, I do not think that there will be any difficulty in secur ing satisfactory renewals of loans. We could then begin to think of converting loans bearing interest at 5 per cent. and over to a lower rate. But if the electors of New South Wales and Queensland do not thus assist to restore confidence in Australia, it will be impossible to say what we shall have to do in regard to our maturing obligations overseas. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister for the Interior dealt with that point this morning. The Minister has previously dealt with the whole question of sustenance, and the policy of the Government in the Federal Territory. He has pointed out. that it is impossible for the federal authorities to relax its restrictions regarding the granting of sustenance,' or to make its terms too liberal, because the effect of that would be to attract immediately to this territory the unemployed of the States, and thus place an additional burden on this Government. The honorable member stated that the obligations of the Commonwealth in regard to unemployment were nothing compared to those of Tasmania. I agree with him. We really have no problem of unemployment to solve, and we could, if it were thought fit, help the unemployed inside our territory to a generous extent, but that would be unfair to the unemployed in the States. We must keep in line with the States. If we relax our restrictions we shall attract many unemployed from the rest of Australia. The honorable member also made reference to the taking of men out of employment, and putting them on the dole. I entirely agree with him that that should be avoided as much as  possible, but I would remindhim that we have definitely indicated chat while we are rendering assistance to the States to enable them to provide employment, we have an obligation to the residents of the Federal Territory. We are taking action in the Territory, quite apart from the general scheme, to give a measure of assistance to the unemployed. That assistance will continue, and I hope that it will bring about the reduction of the n umber of persons who are unfortunately unemployed in the Territory. The honorable member also spoke of the demands made by certain returned soldiers. I subscribe to the policy that the Government has adopted in regard to the employment of returned soldiers, and the preference that is given to them. They are entitled to fair and equitable treatment, hut I part company with returned soldiers who demand in these times an expansion of their privileges to the extent of dismissing men and putting unemployed returned soldiers in their places. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is true that the grant which was made to Western Australia for a period of five years has now expired, and that the position of that State must be reconsidered, on the basis of what is fair and equitable treatment for it. The question of what financial assistance it would be fair and reasonable to grant to Western Australia will comeup at the conference to be held in June, to which I have already referred. We are in communication with the Premier of Western Australia. It will be remembered that a few days ago certain questions were asked in this House about the representations that had been made by South Australia for a grant, and I have no doubt that similar representation will be received at an early date from the Government of Western Australia, and that the matter will be given consideration prior to the meeting of the conference. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that the order of the day which the Government desires to bring on for discussion immediately is the second reading of the Bankruptcy Bill, a measure which contains about 67 clauses. Only this morning members received a memorandum setting out the alterations made by this bill in the original act. Last week,' the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> in reply to the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb),</inline> stated that this bill would not be further proceeded with prior to the adjournment for the recess, and I believe that that answer was repeated when I again mentioned the matter. Can the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> now say why he wishes to proceed with the consideration of this bill, seeing that if the Parliament rises for the recess to-day, it will be impossible to give it the full consideration that it deserves? </para>

                    <para>.- I also protest against the manner in which this bill has been brought before the House. This morning we received a memorandum, consisting of 50 printed pages, showing proposed amendments to the bankruptcy law. Some of the amendments provide for definite variations of the principal act. With the limited time available to members for the consideration of the measure, it would be impossible to do justice to the bill. Members might reasonably ask that the discussion be resumed a couple of months hence. </para>

The wish of the Government is that the second-reading speech on the Bankruptcy Bill shall be made forthwith, but as the measure is a long one, if the House then considers it desirable to discuss the clauses in detail, there will obviously be insufficient time to pass the measure before we rise to-day for the recess. But certain facts ought to be put before the House before we decide whether or not the bill shall be immediately proceeded with. </para>

                    <para>That  the bill be now read a second time.  This measure, the object of which is to amend the Bankruptcy Act, contains a considerable number of clauses, embodying amendments of the Principal Act. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members will recall that in 1924 the control of bankruptcy was taken over by the Commonwealth, and a comprehensive measure was brought down which was really a charter of Australia's bankruptcy law. The act was proclaimedin 1928, and all bankruptcy proceedings are now carried out under Commonwealth legislation. During the period that has elapsed since the act came into operation, certain defects have been discovered, due to some extent to the fact that the State legislation and procedure with regard to bankruptcy practice differed somewhat, particularly with respect to such matters as deeds of arrangement. When the amending bill was being drafted, representations regarding the measure weremade to the Government by such bodies as the Associated Chambers of Commerce, Bankers, Trustees Association, and the Law Institute; they suggested certain amendments of the law. No doubt many honorable members have received from those bodies representations on the points that they desire to have considered. The representations made cover the whole field of bankruptcy proceedings, and various alterations of the principal act have been considered and agreed to. These bodies are in accord with the bill as it now stands, and they are desirous that it should be passed before Parliament rises for a recess. </para>
                    <para>The greater part of the amendments are of an administrative and machinery character and have been found necessary because of difficulties that have arisen in the operation of the act. But certain major amendments are also made. I put it to honorable members that it is of urgent importance that this bill should be dealt with immediately. </para>
                    <para>Different practices have obtained in the various States in regard to procedure in cases short of actual bankruptcy proceedings. In South Australia and Western Australia certain arrangements were provided for, such as compositions and assignments without sequestration of the estate of the bankrupt. In the other States the matter was dealt with generally by means of deeds of arrangement, and different practices were followed. In the Commonwealth Bankruptcy Act an attempt was made to bring about a general procedure in conformity with the existing practices. Therefore, in Part XI. of the act, provision was made for the retention in those States of the practice which had prevailed in South Australia and Western Australia, and the procedure adopted by the rest of the Commonwealth was embodied in Part XII.Ineednotnowdiscusstheslight differences between Parts XI. and XII., but a general basis of procedure was laid down. Provision was made to meet such a case as that of a trader, such as a country storekeeper, whose affairs had become involved and whose creditors were not prepared to give him further financial aid.' There is always the possibility of an unfortunate man in such a position being forced into bankruptcy, with all its attendant disadvantages. To avoid this, an inspector is often appointed under a deed of inspectorship, to give the debtor a chance to weather the storm. In such a case there is no bankruptcy. The business is carried on under a deed of inspectorship, the inspector accepting responsibility for its proper conduct. Under such a deed there is a postponement of the payment of the trader's debts, and the business is conducted really for the creditors who have executed the deed of inspectorship. The general practice and understanding has always been that goods supplied under such a deed shall receive preferential treatment, and be paid for within seven days, or some other short period, and, in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy, the advances so made shall be in an advantageous position compared with those made prior to the date of the deed of inspectorship. This is a perfectly reasonable arrangement, the object being, as I have said, to give a trader a chance to overcome his difficulties. That was the position that prevailed in regard to inspectorships and straightout deeds of assignment prior to the passing of the Commonwealth law; but. in consequence of certain decisions of the Bankruptcy Court, preferential treatment cannot now be given in respect of goods obtained under a deed of inspectorship, because, if the debtor is subsequently declared bankrupt, andhis estate sequestrated, all the debts come into the estate on the same basis. I am sure that honorable members generally will agree that it would be unfortunate for a struggling country storekeeper to be made bankrupt in these depressed times. The trader's creditors may be quite satisfied that he is an honest man, and may be willing to do their best to help him. They may desire to execute a deed of inspectorship, postponing the date for the payment of their debts, the business being carried on in the hope that there will be a surplus from time to time sufficient to repay the money owing. It is, however, essential where there is such an arrangement that goods supplied in the period intervening between the making of a deed of inspectorship and a subsequent bankruptcy should receive preferential treatment. </para>

                            <para>- No; the mortgagee would be a secured creditor not affected by the bankruptcy. Out of my own experience, I know how unfortunate it will be for men who have got into business troubles, and whose creditors are willing to help them, if they are prevented from receiving this help because of the decision of the Bankruptcy Court. The object of the first group of major amendments in this bill is, therefore, to open the door for creditors to come in and help debtors in whom they have confidence. If a man's creditors have faith in him, it is only reasonable that they should give him an opportunity to recover the ground that he has lost. Amendments of the law to provide for this being done are universally desired by those dealing with bankruptcy matters. The amendments in proposed new section 19c are designed to protect the supplier of goods in the circumstances I have outlined. </para>

                    <para>The amendments in proposed nev section 88a have been framed with the object of protecting trustees. At present, if a bankruptcy supervenes in respect of a business which a trustee is carrying on under a deed of assignment, the trustee is held personally liable for any contracts that he has entered into. That is an impossible position, which still further limits creditors in their desire to help an unfortunate debtor to overcome hi3 troubles. The object of the amendments in thi3 group therefore is to protect the trustee in respect of anything that he does in the legitimate carrying out of the responsibilities entrusted to him by creditors under a deed of assignment. </para>
                    <para>Another amendment has to do with third-party risks in motor accidents. Under the law as it stands ut present, a policy against thirdparty risks which comes  into force must be taken into account in the general assets of a bankrupt estate, and its proceeds are not available to the third party who has suffered loss or damage. It will appeal to honorable members as unfair that the injured party should rank <inline font-style="italic">par i passu</inline> with other creditors. That defect is being cured. </para>
                    <para>The other group of major amendments deals with life policies. Under Part XII. of the act, which is availed of in all the States other than Western Australia and South Australia, the life policy of a bankrupt may be protected, and in the event of an assignment, a debtor can provide that his life policy shall be devoted to the assistance </para>
                    <para>Df his family. But under Part XI. of the act, which is availed of in South Australia and Western. Australia, a life policy falls in with the general assets of the estate, and is available to all the creditors. </para>
                    <para class="block">The object of the amendments relating to life policies is to protect a life policy under Part XI. as it is protected under a sequestration and under Part XII. </para>
                    <para>These are the major alterations that are being made to the law. They have been introduced following upon strong representations by those associated with the administration of our bankruptcy law, and it is urgently desired that they shall be agreed to before the House rises. If honorable members will accept the amendments, I give an undertaking that in the event of it becoming necessary, after the House re-assembles, to introduce any other amendments consequent upon them, the Government will do so. The utmost efforts and fullest investigations have been made to ensure that the amendments now proposed are sound, and I ask the House, even at this late stage of the session, to' allow them to go through. Their object, as I have said, is to alter the law in respect of deeds of inspectorship with the object of giving debtors a chance to recover their position; to protect trustees under deeds of assignment and deeds of inspectorship; to protect the interests of persons entitled to the benefits from a third-party-risk policy of a bankrupt; and to protect the position of certain debtors in regard to their life policies. I appeal to. honorable members to allow the measure to go through without delay. </para>

                <para class="block">This measure was brought down to enable the Commonwealth Government to meet its obligations in respect of war pensions. Ever since such pensions have been payable, appropriations of revenue, amounting in each instance to  £10,000,000, have been made from time to time for this purpose, and any pensions approved by Parliament under the financial proposals for the year are paid out f this appropriation. The amount or incidence of pensions is not affected by the measure. The last appropriation was made in August, 1930, and on the 30th April last, only £1,483,795 was left. As that would not be sufficient to meet pension commitments until Parliament meets again, this further appropriation is necessary. </para>

                    HOLLOWAY (Melbourne Ports) [3.3 j. - I have been informed that the officials of the Repatriation Department, acting upon instructions, have cut down  sis  much as possible the amount paid in pensions to soldiers' dependants. Recent instructions have been so drastic that the officers themselves are somewhat ashamed to have to carry them out. Of course, they must obey their instructions to the letter, and I have no complaint against the officers who, from
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline>
                    the Chief Commissioner, down to the clerks, are an excellent body of men. I have in mind the case of a deceased soldier's mother, who has for years been in receipt of a pension. Recently a set of questions was issued to pensioners, asking for information regarding their incomes, and because this lady answered the questions with extraordinary honesty, her pension has been stopped. She stated, in answer to a question, that sometimes she received meals and lodging free from relatives, and for this reason the department stopped her pension of 15s. 6d. a week. I do not think that it was ever intended that such action should be taken. The officers of the department, of course, have no choice, but they assured me that, had the woman not given the information, her pension would not have been affected. Old-age pensioners, and others in receipt of pensions, particularly elderly people, frequently visit their relatives, and have a meal and a night's lodging free. Things are getting to a pretty bad state, however, if that is to be taken into consideration in determining whether or not a person is entitled to receive a pension.
                </para>
                <para>Another case which has been brought under my notice involves the position of women whose husbands have disappeared. </para>
                <para class="block">This, on the face of it, looks as though the wife has been deserted, but other considerations may be involved. The case to which I refer concerns an excellent family; the soldier had a good record, and was a man of excellent character. After he returned from the war he developed tuberculosis, and although he used to be a fine physical specimen, standing 6 ft. 2 in. in height, he wasted away almost to a skeleton. 2Tine  year3  'ago he disappeared. He was last seen by the officers of the Repatriation Department when he called to collect his pension at the St. Kilda barracks. Since his disappearance, of course, his pension has been held at the office according to the requirements of the law, and his wife has not been able to get a penny of it. She asked me to try to get a portion of the pension, at least. I put it to the officers that, in the ordinary course of things, if the man had continued to draw his pension, some of it, at any rate, would have been spent by him in the support of his wife and children. They admitted that that was so, and that if they were allowed to take a common-sense view of the matter, they would undoubtedly pay part of the pension to the wife, but the law would not - permit them to do so. The act says that the pension belongs to the soldier, and must be paid to him. If he cannot come to collect his pension, it cannot be paid to any one else. I suppose that provision is necessary to protect the department from fraud. In this case, however, the belief is that the husband disappeared because he did not wish to be a burden on his wife and family. He had nothing to gain by his disappearance, because he ceased to draw his pension. I have gone into the matter with the State Attorney-General, as well as with the Repatriation Department, with a view to having the woman declared a widow, or enabling her to obtain a divorce. But although either of those things might be done, she would still not be able to draw the pension. She would become eligible to receive the money only if it were certified that her husband had died as the result of war injuries, or of illness arising out of his war service. I trust that the Government will take steps to meet cases such as these. </para>

The second case cited by the honorable member would involve an amendment of the law to provide a remedy. The Government is prepared to study cases arising out of the administration of the Repatriation Department, to see whether some general principles might not be deduced to govern an amendment of the act, so as to enable the administration to deal with anomalies. </para>

                    <para>.- I draw attention to the unfortunate circumstances of migrants of mature age who come to Australia and are without means. Many of them were in receipt of pensions when in the Old Country, but their pension rights cease on arrival here. Is it not possible to bring about. reciprocal arrangements similar to those which exist concerning the payment of war pensions to ex-imperial soldiers domiciled in Australia? I have in mind a number of cases, and particularly that of an old lady living at Kurri Kurri who came to Australia in 1924, and is now 80 years of age. She is suffering hardship because she is unable to obtain a pension, although she drew one when in the Old Country. Will the Assistant. Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> interview the imperial authorities when he goes to London as Resident Minister with a view to establishing the necessary reciprocal arrangements? </para>

                    <para>. -  The adoption of a reciprocal basis with regard to invalid and old-age pensions has already received consideration. I discussed it with the authorities when I was last in Great Britain, as also did the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin).</inline> The difficulty is  that we in Australia could not enter into a reciprocal arrangement on the understanding that we should pay the pensions of any British person who migrated to Australia if the British authorities extended similar consideration to Australians who go to live in Great Britain, because the flow of aged migrants is principally from Great Britain to Australia. Australia would be assuming the liability, and the British Government laying it down. The proposal that I stressed, but to which the British authorities would not agree, . was that the British Government should extend to British migrants in Australia any benefits to which they were . entitled in the Homeland. I was informed that the British Government had a sufficient obligation in meeting the. requirements of those resident in Great Britain, and it could not extend these privileges to persons who had migrated. I am afraid that the arrangement that the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> visualizes is impossible of attainment, unless Australia carries the whole burden. Our invalid and old-age benefits are most generous, and if we granted them to any migrant from the Old Country we should merely he extending an invitation to persons of mature years to spend their old age in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. -  I call attention to the hardship that is inflicted upon a migrant who comes to Australia, and has to leave his aged parents behind, simply because he cannot afford to bring them here if they are debarred from receiving a pension. I remember the sacrifice that was made by my own mother, who left her parents in the Homeland in order to accompany her brothers to Australia. The result is that migrants save sufficient money to return to the Old Country to see their parents before they die, and the shipping companies are the principal beneficiaries. I think that the British Government should adopt a humanitarian attitude in this matter. </para>

The principal cause for the substantial increase in expenditure is that during the year 1930-31 the exchange rate rose from £6 to £30 10s. That increase had not been budgeted for, and had to be met during the year from the Treasurer's advance. Exchange accounted for £1,571,000 of the total amount of £1,830,977 covered by these Estimates. The Government is now seeking parliamentary approval of this expenditure. The other items included in the Estimates are numerous but relatively small. </para>

                    <para class="block">The existing legislation provides that certain sums are to be made available by the Commonwealth to the States for the relief of unemployment, and provision is mads for the Commonwealth itself to raise the amounts and to make them available either to the States or, through the States, to the local governing bodies, but under this bill the Commonwealth, instead of actually borrowing the money, will allow the local governing bodies to raise loans, and the Commonwealth and the State Governments will contribute their share of the interest. The object of the bill is to extend the purposes for which the unemployment relief moneys may be used and to enable the employment councils to use the money in the most advantageous way. It neither increases nor diminishes the total amount provided under the original act. The scheme originally contemplated the raising of £3,000,000 as follows:- </para>
                    <para class="block">The money was to be borrowed by the Governments shown, from or through the Commonwealth Bank on terms approved by the Loan Council in April - principally by the issue of treasury-bills discounted at 4 per cent. It was to be expended by the State Governments - except in New South Wales - or granted or lent to local bodies to be expended by them on substantial works, preferably reproductive. The scheme is to be amended by providing that, as far as possible, the money shall be raised by local governing bodies and other statutory authorities constituted under Commonwealth and State laws. Such borrowings are to be arranged by the statutory bodies directly from or through the Commonwealth Bank, and these bodies are to be responsible for the repayment of the principal amount. Where the local bodies cannot raise loans in that way, they may be assisted by the Government concerned by grants or by loans or by both - the object being that the money is to be spent principally through the local bodies rather than through government departments. Where moneys are borrowed directly by statutory bodies in New South Wales, the Commonwealth may contribute towards the interest to an extent not exceeding 4 per cent, per annum. Where moneys are borrowed by statutory bodies in other States, the Commonwealth and the State concerned may each contribute towards the interest to the extent of not more than 2 per cent, per annum. As far as possible, moneys expended under the scheme are to be expended on reproductive works in a manner calculated to provide the greatest possible amount of employment. Moneys are to be expended only on approved works to provide relief to persons out of employment. In New South Wales the works must be recommended by the employment council established by the Commonwealth, and must be approved by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. In the other States the works must be recommended by the employment council established by the State and must be approved by the State Treasurer. The State employment council includes two representatives of the Commonwealth. No Commonwealth moneys are to be expended on any work unless that work lias been approved by both representatives of the Commonwealth on the State employment council, or unless that work has been approved by the Commonwealth Treasurer. The employment councils will secure such information as they deem necessary in regard to each proposed work. In New South Wales the employment council will submit to the Commonwealth Treasurer full particulars of works recommended by the council. At the same time the employment council will forward particulars of the works to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney. Already it has sent in a list of works for approval, and those works will be under the consideration of the Government immediately. When the Commonwealth Treasurer approves of any works recommended by the employment council, he will advise the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney, of those works. In the other States the employment councils will submit to the State Treasurer particulars of the works recommended by them. On any of these works being approved, the State Treasurer will submit particulars of them to the local manager of the Commonwealth Bank, and to the Commonwealth Treasurer. In forwarding these particulars the State Treasurer will advise regarding each work whether it has been approved by both representatives of the Commonwealth Government on the employment council. Works which may be recommended and approved will include - </para>

We are hoping that in respect of practically every work, the local governing body concerned will find at least the materials, so that the unemployed will receive the full benefit of the money that we are contributing. To the extent that the local governing bodies contribute in that direction, the grant of £600,000 will be increased, but, if at a later stage whatever government may he elected in New South Wales is prepared to join the scheme on the same basis as the other States, Commonwealth moneys will bc subsidized £] for £1 by that State as in the case of the other States. </para>

                    <para class="block">Government's programme, and that there would be no loss of momentum to the operation of the general scheme. At present, employment councils are expending certain sums of money on what are commonly known as works. We are all agreed that that is part of a short range policy, and we are looking forward with confidence, in view of the utterances of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> and of the Assistant Treasurer, to the development at the Premiers Conference of something in the nature of a long-range policy. When speaking on unemployment previously, I stated that we  must  develop some form of land policy to assist in the absorption of the unemployed. It is becoming, more and more apparent as time goes on that the secondary industries will not be able to employ not only their former employees, but also others who wish to enter the industrial field. One difficulty in Australia, which is perhaps not generally recognized, is that many of our farms are too large, not too small, [f we are to have a better balance of population between the cities and the country, wo must intensify settlement in the more favoured areas of Australia - the coastal regions - where there is plenty of room for useful work to be done. In Tasmania areas that .were formerly under cultivation are now reverting to bush and blackberry. Surely the Tasmanian Government, under the inspiration given by the Commonwealth Government, could evolve some scheme which, although small :tt the beginning, would afford practical relief. I do not think that the difficulty of providing finance would be insuperable. On the mainland, in districts like Gippsland, for instance, and along the coast of New South Wales and Queensland as far north as the tropics, there are almost limitless possibilities for useful land settlement schemes which, if rightly handled, would absorb large numbers of people, particularly the younger people. I urge upon the Government the desirability, at r.lie Premiers Conference, of commencing a long range policy of development. That is absolutely essential if we are to make a continuous effort for the removal of unemployment. </para>

                        <para>.- It appears that under this proposal, New South Wales will not receive more than £600,000, and as the unemployed in that State now number 100,000, it seems that they will receive not more than £6 each during the winter months. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> has pointed out that local governing bodies can borrow additional sums, but I imagine that they can borrow at any time, quite apart from this bill. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. When I was an alderman in the Newtown Council, the State Government advanced it £2,000 free of interest for two years, and the council also received £1,500 from the last Federal Government. Probably over 85 per cent, of that money was distributed in wages for the relief of unemployment. Certain parks at Trangie are under the control of trustees, and I understand that the local governing authorities wish to obtain, some of the money to be advanced under this bill. I fail to see why it should be necessary for a shire council to dispense with the services of trustees before it can obtain money through the unemployment relief council. I should like to have the position cleared up, in order to set at rest the minds of the local authorities at Trangie, who desire to make useful additions to the local parks. The Government should not limit New South Wales to the proposed expenditure of £600,000. </para>

                        <para>. - The matter referred to by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gander)</inline> is purely one of local concern. All we are concerned about in considering this bill is the amount which the Commonwealth Government proposes to make available, to the States. New South Wales is to receive a larger sum than any of the other States, and the local bodies may, in addition, raise any sums that may be required for augmenting relief work. If sound schemes are submitted, the Government will do all it can to help local bodies to raise further sums through the Commonwealth Bank for the carrying out of those works. The honorable member for Reid is rather optimistic in saying that every shire council in New South Wales is in a sound position. On the contrary, a large number of municipal and "shire councils cannot raise a single pound towards financing the relief schemes which have been submitted to the Commonwealth Government. If work is to bo done in those districts, the Commonwealth will have to provide the whole of the necessary funds. The Government has already advanced over £80,000, so it is making money available actually as a grant, because it has to find the whole of the interest. The Government does not desire the unemployed in certain districts to be left without relief, and thus to be placed under a disadvantage compared with unemployed in other localities. </para>

                    <para>The excise duty on petrol, honorable members will notice, is being increased by <inline font-style="italic">l$d.</inline> to 5£d. per gallon. At present the excise duty on petrol refined within Australia is 4d. per gallon, aim the import duty on refined petrol from overseas is 7d. per gallon. It has always appeared to me that the margin of 3d. was too great. This subject has been investigated by the Tariff Board, which has recommended that l-£d. per gallon is ample protection to cover the cost of refining within Australia. This new duty will be collected on about 19,000,000 gallons of petrol per annum, taking the present output of the Australian refineries as a basis, and it will yield an additional revenue of over £100,000 a year. To throw some light on the cost of refining, I remind honorable members that the f.o.b. price of refined petrol in oil-producing countries is less than 3d. per gallon, which covers the cost of mining, transportation to the coast, and refining. In these circumstances, I am sure that honorable members will agree that the margin of 3d. hitherto allowed was extravagant. The Government had also to consider that, if it encouraged the general refining of petrol in Australia on an excessively profitable basis, the time would soon arrive when sufficient petrol would be refined here to meet our requirements. We have no objection to all the petrol being refined here, but it should be on a fair margin. If the margin were excessive it would tend to keep up the price of petrol in Australia, and rob the revenue. At present Australia is importing between 160,000,000 and 170,000,000 gallons of petrol per annum, and the loss of 3d. per gallon on that quantity, if it were refined in Australia, would be about £2,000,000. </para>
                    <para>An excise duty of Id. per packet on cigarette papers, and Id. per 60 cigarette tubes, is being imposed. At first glance this may seem an insignificant impost, but a phenomenal development has occurred in recent years in the purchase and use of fine-cut tobacco for the making of cigarettes by individuals. The Government thinks that there is a good opportunity to increase the revenue lucratively in this direction. The annual consumption of pipe tobacco in Australia is between 13,000,000 and 14,000,000 lb. So far as we can discover, about half that quantity of tobacco is made up as " fine-cut," and is consumed by smokers who make their own cigarettes. The reasonableness and equity of this new impost cannot be gainsaid. The total impost in customs and excise duties on manufactured cigarettes, in which there is practically no Australian-grown leaf, is 12s. Sd. per lb. The impost on fine cut tobacco which is used for rolling into cigarettes would be 7s. 6d. per lb. if it were wholly imported, and 4s. 6d. per lb. if it were wholly Australian. Assuming that the cigarettes made by individuals contained a blend of imported and local leaf, the total impost on them would be about 6s. per lb. It will be seen, therefore, that the smoker who makes his own cigarettes out of fine-cut tobacco contributes only about half as much to the revenue as the man who buys his cigarettes ready.made. In these circumstances this relatively small increase in the tax is justifiable. Combined with" the increased customs duty on these goods the duty is estimated to yield an additional £200,000 in revenue annually. </para>

                    <para>An excise duty of 6d. per gross of boxes of matches is also being imposed. It is unfortunate that taxation of this kind should be necessary ; but in our present circumstances it is unavoidable. I do not think that this new impost will be regarded as outrageous by those who know the position in regard to matches in other countries. In Canada, for instance, the duty, which is on a cent basis, is equivalent to 2s. Id. per gross. I do not suggest that these additional imposts will not increase prices to some extent; but the addition of 6d. on a gross of boxes of matches should not add to the conventional selling price of Id. per box, though it may increase the bulk price slightly. </para>
                    <para>The fixed rates of duty now being imposed on wireless valves exceeds the deferred rates which had been postponed to the 1st July, 1932. This duty is definitely for revenue and not protective purposes, and should be so regarded by any manufacturers who may be contemplating the manufacture of valves in Australia. I am glad that we appear to be approaching the time when valves will be manufactured here. When the manufacture of them is undertaken here on a commercial basis an excise duty will be imposed and an adjustment will be made between excise and customs duties. </para>
                    <para>The item dealing with the admission under by-law of goods which are at present, or which may be prescribed, under tariff items 174, 404, and 415a, makes provision for the obtaining of an additional amount of revenue. Broadly speaking, it is the intention of the Government to prescribe under this item machines and machinery, raw  materials  and semi-finished goods for use in the production or manufacture of luxury and semi-luxury goods. The whole of the existing by-laws under the items referred to will be reviewed with the object of ascertaining whether any of the goods at present prescribed could, without inflicting hardship, be called upon to contribute to the revenue. The new rates under this item are, generally, 5 per cent, higher than those at present operating. </para>
                    <para>The Government estimates that about £500.000 additional revenue will be obtained, as a result of these new imposts. Honorable members will recognize that, in times like these, it is extraordinarily hazardous to venture  an  estimate of the increased revenue which may be obtained, but we think that we are safe in placing the figure at £500,000. </para>
                    <para>Included in the schedule are three items upon which the duty has been increased for protective purposes. They are almond kernels, canary seed, and cork board. In respect of these items, the Government is following the recommendations of the Tariff Board, but the board has not been consulted regarding items on which revenue duties have been imposed. That is a matter of Government policy, aud I understand that the board has requested that it should not be asked to make recommendations in regard to what are purely revenue imposts. The duty  ob  almond kernels has been restored to the old level in accordance with the vote taken in this chamber last week. I accept the verdict of the committee, and have taken the earliest opportunity to restore the duty. However, inasmuch as the duty places a heavy impost on 75 per cent, of the kernels and almond products used in this country, I shall from time to time, when the Australian pack has been completely cleared, explore the possibility of giving the manufacturers some relief by way of by-law. The increased duty on canary seed is in accordance with the Tariff Board's recommendation. I am not quite satisfied with the position of this small industry. I remind the farmers of Queensland, who have now obtained this very generous measure of assistance, that they have an obligation to supply, as far as possible;, the whole of Australia's requirements in this product. For many years they have not produced anything like the whole of Australia's requirements. Last year they were handicapped, I know, by drought and other difficulties, but the fact remains that the Queensland crop was only 60© tons, while Australia's consumption was 1,500 tons. A little while ago I removed the embargo on canary seed, having first ascertained that the Queensland crop had been sold at the fixed price of £32 10s. a ton. The Tariff Board recommends that the duty be increased from 7s. 6d. a cental to 15s. It is a very generous increase, and I hope that the growers will respond by increasing their production. The duty on cork board has been varied in accordance with the amended recommendation of the Tariff Board, which has made a frank declaration that had it, at the 'time it made its previous inquiry, been in possession of all the facts now available, it would have recommended the duties which have been imposed. These  duties, however, are substantially below those which were in force under the last Government's tariff schedule, but they are, I am pleased to say, acceptable to the manufacturers. </para>
                    <para>The special duty resolution which I have also moved, exempts from special duty a further batch of goods. In all, twelve tariff items are exempted from the duty, and this action is in keeping with the promises made by the Government chat the restrictions imposed for the purpose of rectifying the adverse balance of trade would be lifted as soon as possible. The prohibition imposedon the importation of many lines of goods was lifted by proclamation issued on Thursday last. Since this Government assumed office the number of prohibited lines has been reduced from  78  to  24,  while the number of items subject to special duty has been reduced from  58  to  36. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - I desire, on behalf of the Government, to make a suggestion with regard to this measure. Honorable members who have studied the bill will agree that it is certainly an improvement on the existing act. In many respects it tightens up existing provisions, and if it were put into law it would be a useful measure to have on the statute-book. At the sametime, the Government recognizes that it is desirable that honorable members should have an opportunity of examining the bill thoroughly, and particularly its effect on our bankruptcy legislation in general. The Government suggests that the bill now before the House should be allowed to go through as it stands, and the Government undertakes to appoint a committee, representative of all sections in the House, to examine the measure fully, and report to the House later. The Government further undertakes to allow this committee's report to be debated fully, and, if it is desired to amend the act further, an opportunity will be given to honorable members to bring forward their proposed amendments. </para>

                    <para>. -  I recognize that some of the proposed amendments in the Bankruptcy Bill are urgent. It is a very technical matter, and time is needed for  a  complete examination of the measure. The suggestion of the Government is  a  reasonable one. On the assurance of the Government that a committee will be appointed to inquire into bankruptcy legislation, and that the House will have an opportunity of considering the committee's report, and of proposing further amendments, I am prepared to agree to the Government's proposal. I understand that it will not he necessary for a majority of the House to request that amending legislation be brought down. Even if a minority is convinced that a major alteration should be made, the House will, I understand, be given an opportunity of considering proposals to that effect. </para>

                    <para>, -  I am naturally interested in proposals to amend our bankruptcy legislation, because I was entrusted with the preparation of the original measure, and of submitting it to this House some years ago. Upon this work the law officers were mainly engaged. The offer of the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> is a reasonable one. I have studied the bill, and I realise that it would be impossible for the House to give the measure adequate consideration in a few hours. Many of the proposed amendments are of an urgent character, and the proposal of the Government should meet with the approval of honorable members. I presume that the Government will assist the. committee which is to be appointed by placing before it the reports and evidence in the possession of the department. The promise that such a committee will be appointed ought to facilitate the passage of this legislation through the House. The important thing is to make the necessary and urgent amendments. Obviously, a new measure, dealing comprehensively with bankruptcy, and substituting for the State law a Commonwealth act - a measure that is intimately connected with the commercial life of the community - must in its working reveal deficiencies and need amendment. I hope that -an invitation will be extended, not only to chambers of commerce and trustees, but also to the whole trading community, to give their opinions on this legislation, for, after all, we have to consider the debtor, as well as the creditor, when framing a measure of this kind. </para>

                    <para>.- I realize that this is important and necessary legislation, and I have no desire to impede its passage. There is one anomaly that can be rectified with little difficulty. The present law adequately protects the employees of a bankrupt by making them preferential creditors in respect of wages and salaries due to them. All leading callings and professions are also protected to some extent, with the exception of the commercial traveller working on a commission basis. When the principal act was brought up to date some years ago, the majority of commercial travellers were paid both salary and commission. Owing to the changed economic conditions, they are now mainly paid only on a commission basis. A good deal of inconsistency exists in this legislation, for, while a commercial traveller who is engaged by only one firm, and is paid on a commisison basis, receives protection, the same man, if engaged by several houses and paid on a commission basis, receives no protection at all. It is beyond my comprehension why the law protects the one and not the other. Commercial travellers are obliged to expend large sums of money to effect sales, and they are continually on the move. They receive their commission on a monthly basis, and if, during the interval between pays, their employer files his schedule, they are in  an absolutely unprotected position. Those men are employees just as much as is any clerk or other worker. I trust that, when the committee is set up, it will give favorable consideration to the rectification of this anomaly. </para>

On the 12th September of last year, the Loan Council issued authority for sales over the counter of stock of this character. The Loan Council intends to use that power sparingly. So far it has done so only for counter sales, which are made almost entirely to superannuation and similar funds, which are almost universally tax free. </para>

                    <para>.- This is really the major clause in the bill. The principal act already provides for deportation, but under this clause the wife and family of a person concerned may also be deported. In certain circumstances that would be a humane course, but a deportee may have married an Australian girl, an which case no deportation of his dependants should be possible without their consent. If the children are under age, the consent of both parents should be obtained before they are deported. I know that the clause says "may", but a great wrong and cruelty could be inflicted if it were harshly applied. I ask the Minister to give an assurance that in no circumstances will this power be used to send an Australian wife and her children out of the country against their will. </para>

                    <para>. - I give the assurance for which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has asked. This bill deals exclusively with immigrants, and, therefore, its provisions would not apply to Australianborn women and children. Proposed section 8ba provides that the wife and dependant children of a deportee " may " also be included in the order for deportation; the power is deliberately made discretionary to allow provision to be made for the transport of the wife and children if they wish to accompany the husband. If, on the other hand, the wife does not desire to accompany her husband, the Government need not compel her to do so. </para>

An Australian-born woman who marries an alien takes the nationality of her husband, and if he is deported she also is liable to that punishment, and is not protected by her Australian birth.

                <para class="block">In his second-reading speech, the Minister stated that the wife of a deportee might remain in Australia if she was not likely to become a burden on the Government. Apparently his concern was not with her nationality, but only with the possibility of her being maintained by friends or relatives. When a man is imprisoned, the Government provides rations for his wife and children, and no Australianborn wife of a deportee should be sent out of the country because of her financial circumstances. My amendment, if agreed to, will give her the right to decide whether she will leave the country. </para>

                    <para>.- An Australian woman who marries an alien becomes an alien, and loses the' rights of citizenship which she formerly enjoyed by reason of her birth. Apart from that, the Government should consider the constitutionality of this measure. Under the principal act an Englishman who commits an offence within five years of his arrival in Australia may be deported, but his wife remains a British subject. This clause, however, gives the Government the right to deport her. I doubt whether that would be constitutional. Children born in Australia are Australian subjects, even though both parents are aliens, and I question whether the Government has the right to deport them. The amendment proposed by the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> would protect the Australian-born wife, but not the British or Australian wife of an English deportee. I imagine that the purpose of this clause is to assist the unfortunate wives of men who have incurred the penalty of deportation. Of course, if the wife herself has offended against this law she, too, is liable to deportation, but for her own offence, not that of her husband. </para>

Sometimes no country will accept a deportee, and he spends months travelling from port to port, seeking an asylum. That happened to Paul Freeman during the war. A deportee's wife and children should not be compelled to roam the seven seas with him. The person who drafted this provision that because a man commits an offence against the arbitration law or the Crimes Act, his Australian wife and children may be deported, had a twisted mentality. </para>

                        <para>- TheMinister now states that he is prepared to exclude Australian-born wives and children from this drastic provision, but it will still apply to a wife horn in England. She will he deported with her husband. I can read nothing else in the amendment. It is a shame that a government which is supposed to be administering the law for the benefit of the people should be prepared to hit the unfortunate woman whose husband has committed some offence for which he is to be deported. I am reminded of these words which appear in the Scriptures : " The iniquities of the fathers shall be visited upon the children even unto the third and fourth generation ". In this case we are visiting the sins of the husband on his wife and children. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. J. Harrison)</inline> may scoff at the idea of some unfortunate woman being deported from this country. </para>

                        <para>- It is handy to get that statement into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> so as to show the callousness of this Government and its supporters. I am entirely opposed to the amendment submitted by the Minister, and I should like the honorable member for Angas to widen the scope of his amendment so as to exclude from the operation of this provision all wives whose husbands may be deported.We know that a woman's life is hard enough in this world, particularly when she has children dragging at her knee, without being compelled to part from her husband. The amendment is utterly unsatisfactory, and I shall oppose it tooth and nail. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not prepared to accept the amendment of the Minister. No honorable member is more anxious than I am to exclude the revolutionary from this country; but at no time should we be party to making any woman liable to deportation because of the sins of her husband. There is no justice in that at all. - This provision may apply to any class of woman. Quite a number of British women may be married to the  class of persons who may be deported under this legislation. It frequently happens that a woman is anxious to be parted from her husband, because of his worthlessness. Therefore, if he is deported, she should not be compelled to accompany him. It has been suggested that my remarks are purely propaganda; but I submit that legislation of this character isputting propaganda into the mouths of those whose sympathies are with the revolutionaries. There is no necessity for this provision at all. The Minister has not even explained its value. </para>

                    <para>. -  I wish to make a suggestion to the Minister, because I think that he will be prepared to extend the scope of hit amendment if he sees some logic in the suggestions made to him. I ask how can he discriminate between the wife of one man and that of another ? For instance, he has tried to meet the objections of honorable members by agreeing that no Australian born woman shall be deported. But I contend that, in the case of a foreign-born woman who may have lived in Australia for fifteen or twenty years, and has a growing family, perhaps some children going to school, and others, perhaps, engaged to be married, a hardship would be inflicted upon her if she were compelled to leave this country just because her husband had been deported. That woman should be as much entitled to stay in Australia as the Australian-born wife of a deportee. I should like the Minister to accept an amendment which would make it voluntary on the part of the wife of any deportee to accompany her husband. </para>

                    <para>. -  The real object of the clause is to ensure that the shipping company shall, if called upon, take deportees andtheir families back . to the country whence they came. The word " may " appears in the clause. If the wife and children of a deportee wish to stay here, they may do so. There is no compulsion upon the wife to accompany her husband. It may happen that she is a native of Great Britain, France, or Russia, and may want to return with her husband to her own people. The point at issue is not the deportation of women at all, because the wife of a deportee has the choice of accompanying her husband or remaining in Australia. That is the intention of this legislation. The express purpose of this provision is to make it compulsory on the part of the shipping companies to take deporteesback to their country of origin. </para>

                        <para>- As  a  general rule the country of origin accepts deportees. Of course, there may be exceptions. This provision is to compel shipping companies who bring these people here to take them back to their country of origin, but it does not apply to Australianborn women. A woman who  is  a native of another country may remain in Australia, provided that she can show that she will not be a charge upon the Government. Of course she may desire to accompany her husband, and to return to her relatives. The security of the wives of deportees is amply safe-guarded by  the  amendment and the provision of the word " may " in the clause. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> has dealt mainly with the question of the nationality of a woman after she marries  a  foreigner. That question does not arise under this legislation. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause, which was most objectionable, is now to be made acceptable. I do not accept the principle of deportation, and I shall certainly call for a division on the third reading of the bill; but I would not vote -against the clause as proposed to be amended, because I regard it as one of the redeeming features of the measure. It now provides that if the wife of a person who is to be deported wishes to be included in the deportation order, she may be permitted to leave the country in company with her husband. That is a humane provision. </para>

                    <para>.- I am glad that the Minister has accepted the alteration suggested to him. If the wife of a person who is to be deported desires to accompany her husband, no impediment should be placed in her way. Although I am opposed to the principle of deportation, I accept this clause, as proposed to be amended. I claim that the measure is aimed entirely at the, working classes. </para>

                    <para>. -  The necessity for this provision recently arose in a case in which a man, after serving a sentence for a criminal offence, was released from prison before an order for his deportation could be given effect to. The ponce authorities are unwilling to put such a person iu custody without a warrant, unless there is statutory authority for it. This clause is required merely to provide the necessary machinery to carry out the law. A deportation order may have been signed because a certain person has been convicted of a crime of violence. In one case, a person fired shots through another man's hat, but did not kill him. An offence of that nature would be regarded  as  a crime of violence. </para>

                <para class="block">A measure was passed at 3.30 a.m. to-day making it possible to deport, on the order of the Attorney-General, executive officers of trade unions or any other organizations that may be declared by a judge to be unlawful associations. There would be power to arrest such persons on suspicion without warrant. The proposed new section will not apply merely to persons who have been imprisoned for acts of violence. Acts of violence are sometimes committed in consequence of intimidation in a time of industrial trouble. When the members of a union are locked out, as were the northern coalminers two years ago, and free labourers come along to take the bread out of the mouths of their wives and children, it is not to be wondered at if violence occurs. In such circumstances, if any one is arrested, it is invariably the unionist, and not the " scab." A man may be convicted of a crime of violence when, in point of fact, he was defending himself.  We  know that the members of the New Guard recently attacked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garden,</inline> and he had to defend himself. Crowds have recently attacked certain public speakers in Melbourne, on the Yarra Bank, and in Sydney, at the Trades Hall.' </para>

                        <para>- That is all very well; but these provisions will have to be interpreted by judges, and their interpretation may be much wider than that of the Minister and his officers. There may be Englishmen, Irishmen, and Scotchmen in Australia to-day who were enticed to come here by glowing promises of abundance of work and good conditions. Naturally, many of these people, who to-day are without employment,, are feeling desperate, and in such a condition they may commit acts of violence for which they may be deported. I am. totally opposed to the deportation of my fellow citizens, and I shall not support the Government in its effort to pass this panic legislation. If certain honorable members opposite could be deported, it would be a different matter. An honorable  member opposite has interjected that I may be deported. I am not afraid of that ; but I am afraid that the provisions of this measure may react most unexpectedly on certain people. I am not likely to be excited into committing an act of violence, nor are the unfortunate work less people of this country likely to subject me to violence, because they know very well that I am in deep sympathy with them, and am endeavouring to do <inline font-style="italic">all</inline> that I can to help them. I, and the members of the party to which I belong, will resist this provision and this bill as vigorously as possible, for the principle of deportation is totally repugnant to us. </para>

                    <para>.- I, also, am opposed to this clause. It is all very well for the Minister to say that it means this, that, or the other; but, as has been pointed out, it will ultimately be interpreted by a judge. I well remember that a gentleman who, as a Minister in a certain government, introduced a particular bill and piloted it through. Parliament, had subsequently to interpret its provisions as a Supreme Court judge. He then said, " When I introduced this bill I thought it meant so and so; but I now find that I was wrong." We have to anticipate the possibility of something like that happening in this case. The Minister has said that the provisions of this bill will not be operated in the case of political offences. . The unfortunate coal-miners, who were locked out on the northern coal-fields in circumstances outlined by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James),</inline> were incited to violence, and one miner was actually shot dead. </para>

                        <para>.--I protest once more against this measure on the ground that it may be used to prevent the entry into this country of any person who has served a term of imprisonment for twelve months. Evidently  the  Government is not prepared to forgive, even though honorable members, in the prayers read in the House each day, ask to be forgiven. Under the existing act, if five years have elapsed since the expiration of a term of imprisonment,  an  immigrant may not be prevented from entering the country; but this bill proposes to remove the five-year limit. The Government should encourage men who have committed an offence, and have been punished for it, to reform, and become good citizens: Large sums of money are spent each year in the maintenance of prison reformatories, and a considerable measure of success is achieved in putting men who have committed offences back into decent society. If a family attempted to migrate to Australia, and one of ite members had served a term of imprisonment for twelve months, for perhaps some quite trivial offence, he might  be  prevented from landing, although the rest of the family would be admitted. This provision is opposed to all the principles of humanity and Christianity. It is vicious and vindictive. Evidently the Government is determined to cast back into the gutter any one who has  ever  erred. This National Government refuses to give to such persons the right to rehabilitate themselves. Once they have committed a fault, they are to be condemned for the rest of their lives. </para>

                        <para>. - I  protest against this bill. A few years ago, two illustrious gentlemen, Eather 0'Flan.agan and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> J. 0'Kelly were denied admission to Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 0'Kelly is</inline> now a member of the Government of the Irish Free State. Presumably, under this legislation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. de</inline> Valera could be denied admission to Australia on the ground that he was once in gaol. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> ought to support my protest against this legislation because his forefathers, I believe, came from the land where the Shannon flows. The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> should also be with us. </para>

                    <para class="block">The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn)</inline> said that this provision might be invoked against revolutionaries. In all parts of the world men have been incarcerated in prisons because of their advanced political beliefs. I should like the honorable member for Perth to define what is meant by a revolutionary. I can remember when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> himself was, in the opinion of his political opponents, a revolutionary. I recall that the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> and the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holman)</inline> at one time expressed opinions which would have brought them to the verge of being proscribed under this proposed legislation. The honorable member for Martin once advocated bloodshed and revolution in the streets of Sydney. I remember when the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holman)</inline> enthusiastically declared that he would welcome the time when the red flag was flying from the flag-staff on Parliament House - not this Parliament House, for federation had not then been accomplished. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fen ton)</inline> was prone to make similar utterances, and it was only by good fortune that he and his colleagues escaped imprisonment - in which case they would now be liable to deportation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was the most prominent socialist of his day, and at any May Day meeting he was always the person to move that everything should be done to hasten the arrival of the revolution. I also remember the honorable members for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath),</inline> and Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Guy)</inline> indulging in the same sort of propaganda. The former was expelled from this House because of the fight that he put up for the poor and lowly. I assume that he is now prepared to fight against deportation, and I hope that he, the Prime Minister, and all of the old-time socialists that I have mentioned will link up with honorable members on this side, and vote against this iniquitous proposal. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of the measure is to make three small alterations in the Insurance Act recently passed. The definition of " insurance " business does not include workers compensation, and the hill proposes to rectify that omission. The act requires a person carrying on insurance business, other than life insurance, to deposit with the Treasurer  £1,000  for each  £5,000  of annual premium income, subject to a maximum deposit of  £40,000,  but if the annual income, excluding work men's compensation, should  be  such that the maximum deposit would be required, it would be competent for the States to require a further deposit in respect of workmen's compensation insurance business. That was not intended when the original act was passed; therefore, the definitionof " insurance business " is being amended to include workmen's compensation insurance business. </para>
                    <para>Parliament did' not contemplate that any person or firm should conduct the businessof insurance without paying a deposit; but a company operating with a premium income of less than  £5,000  would be exempt from making any deposit. The bill requires a deposit to be made in every instance. </para>
                    <para>The third alteration is to section  16,  which empowers the Treasurer to call for certain returns. An amendment in the bill will enable the Treasurer to proscribe the returns to be furnished, and thus dispenses with the obligation to make repeated, and probably numerous  requests  for returns. </para>

                            stated that grave irregularities had been committed by the North Australia Commission and its officers, in connexion with the administration of Crown lands in the territory. Immediate steps were taken to have this matter thoroughly investigated. The ex-members of the commission and the officers concerned were informed of the charges, and asked for a full statement regarding them. Two of the members, Messrs. Horsburgh and Hobler, declined to make any statement without having an opportunity of examining the files bearing on the matters which the honorable member for the Northern Territory raised.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton,</inline>
                            the third member of the commission, in his reply traversed the charges and gave a general denial of the allegations of irregularities, dummying, &amp;c, and stated -

                    <para>In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd's</inline> statement, he admitted having placed his signature on a transfer application which was handed to him by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> bearing signatures of "0. T. Siddons" and "R. Bennett," which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> requested him to sign, knowing that he was acquainted with both Siddons and Bennett. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd</inline> also admitted that in December, 1931, he had informed the Administrator, in reply to a request for particulars regarding the matter, that he had witnessed the document just referred to while on the Western Australian border, and that Bennett was a stockman, although he knew that Bennett was in reality a sur veyor, and on that account not supposed to hold land, and he made this incorrect statement to protect Bennett. He further added that about a week after having informed the Administrator of the circumstances connected with the witnessing of the document, he received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton,</inline> intimating that he had written to the Administrator putting the facts of the case before him, and that he (Shepherd) then told the Administrator that he knew Bennett, and that he -was a surveyor. On the receipt of these reports the whole of the papers were at once transmitted to the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor for careful investigation, with a view to his advising whether they contained any evidence of improper dealings in respect of the charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nelson,</inline> and if such evidence existed, what charges based on them should be formulated against the persons concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sharwood</inline> has very carefully examined <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nelson's</inline> charges, and the whole of the other papers relating to the matter, and has now furnished a very full report.  His  conclusions may be summed up as follows: - <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> and the other members of the commission committed irregularities in the discharge of their duties by accepting and acting upon applications for leases which were not in the form required by the regulations; <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton,</inline> in particular, committed serious irregularities in connexion with the application for the transfer of the leases from Siddons to Bennett; (c) <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> carried on a personal correspondence with Siddons which appeared improperly to influence his action as a commissioner with regard to the leases in which Siddons was concerned; <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> showed an interest in and an acquaintance with Bennett's affairs which appeared improperly to influence his action as a commissioner with regard to the leases in which Bennett was concerned ; (e) the commission unjustifiably discriminated between the applications of Ayliffe and Hamilton, and those of Grainger and Hand, by rejecting the former for informality and approving the latter, which were more obviously and seriously. informal; (/) <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton</inline> committed a serious irregularity in making, in official time, a survey which he had no authority as a commissioner to make. </para>

                        added that, in his opinion, there was no evidence that any signature on a document in the file was a forgery, and the Crown Solicitor expressed the opinion that it appeared to be unlikely that any further investigation of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Easton's</inline>
                        conduct would elicit any material new evidence, unless the investigation were made by a body or tribunal such as a royal commission, having power to compel attendance of witnesses, the answering of questions, and the production of documents. In view of the fact that the commission is now out of existence, the Government is of opinion that neither the results likely to be obtained by investigation by such abody, nor the expense involved, would warrant the appointment of such a commission, and has decided, therefore, that no action in that direction shall be taken. , As regards

                        position, the Crown Solicitor indicated that he had admittedly been guilty of improper conduct in signing an official document as a witness to signatures when he did not see the persons sign the documents, and in making false and misleading statements to the Administrator with regard to official documents. In view of the serious position in which the report has placed
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shepherd,</inline>
                        action has been taken to reduce his status from that of Chief Surveyor to that of Surveyor, with a reduction in salary of £100 per annum, and to cancel his appointment as a member of the Land Board.

                    <para>.- I join with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> and other honorable members, in wishing the Ministers who will represent Australia at Ottawa, the greatest success from their efforts there. The conference will be truly significant indeed; it stands out among such conferences for two reasons. First, it is being held at a time of great stress and depression, and, secondly, it is being held at a time when every government that will be represented is open to the consideration of tariff reform and adjustments. The last economic conference held in London was important in many ways. It was important in the sense that some of the delegates there were representing nations which were in the midst of a depression. Australia was one of the first nations to encounter the depression, and at that stage Great Britain had not got beyond the edge of it. A great change has since come upon the British horizon. When I was in London many of the British Ministers would not consider for the moment any tariff change, nor agree to the imposition of any duty other than for revenue purposes. The change which has since occurred is remarkable. There is now a common ground for negotiation. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I wish the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> in particular every success in the negotiations. We expect our Ministers not to give away the protectionist policy of Australia,, nor allow the safeguards that apply to our own Australian industries to be weakened, but after we have considered our own industries, there is a big scope for negotiations regarding the reciprocal relations of this country and the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations </para>
                <para>Three important subjects are interwoven; tariff reform, the exchange question, and monetary reform. Of these, the most important is the monetary system. Without some change in it, I see no hope for world rehabilitation. I believe that the nucleus of such a reform can come from what will be done at Ottawa, and a lead could thereby  be  given to the world. I said on my departure from Australia for London nearly two years ago, and on my return, and other honorable members have repeated it, that it is our privilege to belong to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> British Commonwealth of Nations, and that it is our duty to maintain that commonwealth if, for no other reason, because of the ties of blood and sentiment. I believe, however, that the British Commonwealth of Nations is the nucleus of an international organization that must eventually make for the peace of the world. I believe, too, that some great understanding between the nations could lay the foundation of a wider international co-operation in monetary matters that will end the depression from which the world is suffering to-day, and bring to the workless millions a brighter outlook. </para>
                <para>I join in wishing the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs every success. May good fortune attend their efforts, and may they return from the conference having entered into agreements with our sister dominions and. the United Kingdom that will be of mutual benefit to the people of Australia and to the nation as a whole. </para>

                    <para>.- On behalf of the Country party, I offer our best wishes to the representatives of Australia who are to attend the Ottawa Conference - the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> and the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> - and to express the hope that their mission may be completely successful, and that they will return to Australia bringing agreements with them that will be of benefit to not only Australia but also the rest of the British Empire, and through that to the whole of the world. I trust that the work done at the conference may in no small measure be done by the Australian representatives, and that it may cause the first ray of daylight to appear through the clouds of depression. At Ottawa, we seem to be breaking new ground in imperial relations in two respects: first, this is the first time that such an important conference has been held in the capital city of one of the dominions, and, secondly, this is the first time on which, in any discussion on the question of mutual reciprocity, Great Britain has had a tariff with which to offer anything substantial to the dominions in return for what they offer. Therefore, I think that there is a greater chance of success on this occasion than ever before. It is especially fitting that the right honorable the Assistant Treasurer should represent Australia at this epoch-making conference, because, it is still fresh in our memory that in  1923,  as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, he brought the subject of Imperial preference to the forefront. He was then able to secure substantial concessions for Australian producers, and I trust that the delegation under his leadership will be able to add at Ottawa another story of the edifice which was then commenced on solid foundations. This will be one more step in the direction of Empire economic unity which is found necessary to-day by reason of our traditions and race, and can be further secured by the ties of mutual commercial interest. </para>

                    (Flinders- Assistant Treasurer [7.35]. - I am extremely grateful to the right honorable the Prime Minister, to the right honorable the Leader of the Opposition, and to the right honorable the Leader of the Country party for their kind remarks with regard to the mission which I and the Minister for Trade and Customs will shortly undertake. This will nOt be the first occasion on which I shall have gone abroad to represent Australia. I well remember my feelings in 1923 when, soon after I became Prime Minister, I was called upon to attend an Imperial Conference to represent this country. I then felt considerable regret that Australia had not a better representative ; but I was heartened and encouraged by the support that I received from all parties in this country, irrespective of their political differences. I have somewhat similar feelings to-day, and considerable trepidation, because the issues involved are so vast and can have far-reaching effects, not only upon Australia and the British Empire, but upon the world as a whole. I am sure, however, that we shall have the support of the people of Australia generally at the forthcoming conference, and the knowledge of that will inspire us to do possibly even better than we may, at the present time, regard as possible.
                </para>
                <para>I have a very real feeling of responsibility with regard to this mission, and f am encouraged to hope that the great majority of the people of Australia recog nize that all my efforts will be directed to the promotion of the best interests of this country, and that I am sincere in my faith in Australia, and in my belief in its destiny. My one aim will be to weld more closely together the British Commonwealth of Nations, so that it may become the great world force which ii ought to be. We hope that the dark clouds that now darken civilization may be dispersed, and that out of the Ottawa, conference may come arrangements and understandings which will remove the depression which is now world-wide, anr) is causing misery to tens of millions of people. </para>
                <para>I am grateful for the good wishes thai have been expressed, and I give the House and the people of Australia my assurance that everything that lies in my  powewill  be done to solve some of the great problems that confront every nation to-day. </para>
