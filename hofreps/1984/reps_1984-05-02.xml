<TITLE>Chiropractic Services</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of certain citizens of Australia shows :</PARA>
<PARA> That, with the exception of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, all State Parliaments have enacted chiropractic legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> That chiropractors provide a safe, effective and economical health care service that is complementary to medicine.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare, Queensland</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> We have become the innocent victims of your Government's Medicare scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> We are forced to pay 1% of our wages only to receive less per capita benefits than the people of other States.</PARA>
<PARA> Without canvassing the rights or wrongs of the dispute between the Federal Government and the State of Queensland the fact is that because of it over one million Queenslanders, who contribute to health funds, are being blatantly discriminated against compared with people in the rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the dispute over the introduction of Medicare, Queensland public hospital bed charges are $120 per day compared with $80.00 per day in the other States. This is grossly unfair.</PARA>
<PARA> As it was the Federal Government which decided to introduce Medicare, we believe it is their responsibility to take action allowing health funds' rates in Queensland to be kept at reasonable levels.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill, debate having been adjourned from 5 April and previous debate having taken place on 2 April. A reading of Hansard of that previous debate shows an unusual viciousness on the part of government. Perhaps that is not so unusual; matters of social legislation are characterised by unnecessary vitriolism on the part of Government. Government members have sought to portray members of the Opposition who sincerely hold strong beliefs on immigration matters as being out of touch with the Australian electorate. I suggest that quite the opposite is true. Members of the Opposition more properly represent the traditional values and views of the overwhelmingly majority of the Australian electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I examine more closely the specific measures of the legislation I will say something about the multiculturalism of Australian society. Members of the Government are delving into the realms of the ridiculous if they do not think that members of the Opposition support and encourage in every way possible the great multiculturalism of Australian society. We are proud and very supportive of the changes that have taken place in Australian society since the end of the Second World War. We are proud to have members of the ethnic community on our benches and we are proud to mix with and have friends in the ethnic community. Such communities form a large part of our electorates. Certainly in the electorate of Gippsland there are a great many immigrants of every nationality. </PARA>

<PARA> Looking more specifically to the provisions of the Bill, we see that the first thing this amendment Bill does is reduce the qualifying period for Australian citizenship from three years to two years. I expressed concern about that reduction in the qualifying period. I understand that we are the only Western country in the world to have a qualifying period of three years. Certainly to reduce it further is of concern. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason is that the conferring of citizenship is the greatest honour a country can bestow on an immigrant. Therefore it is of the utmost seriousness and a measure of the greatest respect that a country can bestow on an immigrant. That immigrant in turn must demonstrate a commitment to Australia, its heritage, its traditions, its government and its system of justice. Therefore, to reduce the qualifying period to two years strikes me as watering down to some extent, not totally, that sense of commitment. Thus, I express concern, as have other members of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to your guidance, Mr Speaker. The second matter worthy of reference in this Bill is that it will amend the requirement that an applicant for citizenship demonstrate an adequate knowledge of the English language. I suppose we could debate for some time what is meant by an adequate knowledge of the English language. Without delving into the technicalities, I suggest that we all have an understanding of what that means. It means, surely, that an immigrant is able to communicate at the day to day level, to travel throughout the country, to obtain lodgings, food and all of those mundane matters. One would not expect an immigrant, under the definition of 'adequate knowledge', to be able to deliver a speech in this exalted chamber, although I suggest that an adequate knowledge of the English language is not always a criteria for some Government members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly I suggest that if an immigrant is to assimilate properly and be able to communicate properly with others in his or her new country, proper knowledge of the English language is required, otherwise we run the risk-and no Government member has addressed this-of keeping immigrants apart. Surely it is the bipartisan agreement of this chamber that we should not create ghettoes. I do not mean ghettoes in the sense of those in America, where there is great poverty , but the separation of communities and ethnic groups. That is of great concern. If immigrants are not required to have a proper knowledge of the English language, we do run that risk. I ask any Government member who follows me to address himself or herself to that aspect, because nobody has yet done so. Of course, this Government is not concerned about creating a separation of ethnic minorities because of its divisive and discriminatory treatment of land rights, but I will save that argument for another day. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter which is of great concern in this Bill is the treatment of those of British origin. The present Australian Citizenship Act allows the automatic acquisition of Australian Citizenship by British subjects resident in or with close connection with Australia in 1949, when that Act came into force. That provision has been removed because the Bill provides for the repeal of the definition of British subject status from the Australian Citizenship Act at a date to be proclaimed following further examination. That is of concern because in recent days debate has been conducted in the public forum about whether this Government is placing too great an emphasis on immigrants from Asian countries rather than from Europe and, in particular, the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday a very worthwhile contribution to that public debate was made in the Sydney Morning Herald, by Mr Jock Collins who is a senior lecturer at Kuring-Gai College of Advanced Education in New South Wales. In that article Mr Collins set out at length the history of post-war immigration in Australia. He reached no conclusions but was able to set out a number of facts for the public, some of which are of concern and some of which would dispel the irrational arguments of those who argue for greater Asian immigration and those who argue for greater European immigration. I will not dwell on that as I do not believe today is the proper time--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about the Pommie shop stewards?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Pommie shop stewards, as the honourable member for Gwydir has said, have created great concern in Australia. They have been very destructive. The English system will not tolerate the Pommie shop stewards, and unfortunately we have had to cope with them. Not surprisingly, they have found their way largely into the Australian Labor Party, and they are responsible for doing great damage to many aspects of Australian life by their prolonged strikes and their disruptive industrial tactics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fourth matter which concerns me and my colleagues in the Opposition, and which is probably the crux of this debate, is the deletion from the oath of allegiance of reference to the Queen of Australia. My friend and colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), who is the shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, addressed himself extensively to this aspect of the amendment Bill in his speech of Monday, 2 April. Mr Speaker, let me read for you just what this amendment Bill will set up in place of the traditional oath of allegiance. The new pledge of Australian citizenship will take two forms. The first form-the affirmation-is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I renounce any current citizenship and allegiance to any State other than Australia. I pledge that I will faithfully uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>The alternative form of the pledge-the oath-is:</PARA>
<PARA> I renounce any current citizenship and allegiance to any State other than Australia. I swear by Almighty God that I will faithfully uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>Neither form of citizenship pledge has a reference to the Queen of Australia. Yet the Constitution, the cornerstone of our parliamentary democracy, sets out that the Queen is the constitutional monarch. If we are to delete from the citizenship oath reference to the Queen, I suggest that this Government put to the Australian people an amendment to the Constitution. We would welcome such a referendum because we know there is no doubt that the Australian people would reject out of hand the removal of the Queen as our constitutional monarch. It cannot be surprising that the Government seeks to remove references to the Queen ; after all, the Governor-General is her representative in Australia. We know the bitterness and, quite simply, the hatred that so many members of the Government have towards the Governor-General who, in 1975, properly exercised the powers conferred on him by the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> What mandate does the Government have to delete reference to the Queen from the citizenship oath, given that the citizenship oath is the most important aspect of a migrant's new life in Australia? It is the symbol of that migrant's acceptance of the traditions, the parliamentary democracy and the system of law and justice in Australia. If reference to the Queen is deleted from that oath, that migrant, that new Australian, is not bound in any way to the protection of the institution of the Queen. Deletion of reference to the Queen from the oath of Allegiance is a further attempt by this Government to move down the road of republicanism. What clearer evidence could come before the Australian people than that by stealth this Government, over a period of time, has become committed to republicanism. </PARA>

It is interesting that members of the socialist left are in the chamber. They have been reduced to political irrelevance by the Prime Minister's dictatorship. So, Mr Speaker, it is not surprising that for that reason the socialist left supports the Prime Minister in removing reference to the Queen to allow him at another time to assume the responsibilities and office of the head of a republic.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is out now, as the honourable member for Murray said, but it is no surprise; it is simply a matter of coming out of the closet. If deletion of reference to the Queen in the oath of allegiance is a sure indication of the Government's commitment to a republic, the alteration of the flag is definite proof. There can be no doubt. That would be conclusive. There is every indication that this Government intends changing the flag. The Special Minister of State (Mr Young), who sits in the House at the moment, has given a very clear indication that that will be the result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleague the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), on behalf of his electorate, recently wrote to the Minister asking for assurances that the flag will not be changed and that the traditions which we so value in Australia and which are represented by our flag will not be overturned in an arbitrary, dictatorial manner. The reply that the honourable member for Murray received was equivocal, hinting that the Government was looking at altering the flag. The Minister is in the House. If I am misrepresenting him, I invite him to dissociate himself from moves to change the flag. If he does not choose to dissociate himself from such moves, he stands condemned and his proper purposes will be abundantly clear. </PARA>
<PARA> Representing rural electorates, my National Party colleagues and I are very aware of the need to maintain traditional values based on a Christian ethic. The people of Gippsland, like other people in National Party electorates, have been over the years the salt of Australia. They are sensible people. They do not believe in change for the sake of change. I have put before the House their view that any alteration of the respect and commitment to the constitutional monarch, the Queen of Australia, and to the flag, the symbol of our nationhood, is absolutely abhorrent. Furthermore, at the risk of stating the obvious, let me impress on the members of the Government what the flag represents. It represents our heritage. It represents the sacrifices that so many Australians have made in lives as well as in toil towards building this country into a great nation. </PARA>

<PARA> In conclusion, I reaffirm my commitment to the multiculturalism of Australia. On a personal note, citizenship ceremonies are amongst the most enjoyable electorate functions I have to attend. They often take place throughout Gippsland and I enjoy those occasions because every person taking the oath portrays a commitment to Australia. We are very proud of that commitment. Certainly, from my discussions with them, they do not want to see a weakening of that commitment. When they take the oath of citizenship they want it to mean something. They do not want it to be based on some false premise. They do not want it to be watered down in any way; they want it to be a clear statement of their commitment to the Australian values, traditions and way of life. This legislation and this Government seriously hamper and weaken that commitment. </PARA>

It is always a pleasure to follow him in debate because he usually speaks such utter rubbish that it makes one's own speech, no matter how bad, sound so good. That clause relates to the proposed changes to the oath of allegiance. That is only a minor part of a wide-ranging package of amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act.

<PARA> Another group that has been rather concerned is the Bowral Senior Citizens Association which, in the period of a month, wrote to me four times on the topic . Each letter received a reply from me pointing out that references to God would remain in the oath for those who so wished but those who did not wish to swear allegiance to God could make an affirmation. The group finally wrote to me saying that it was disgusted. I can only guess why. This Government is not forcing its particular brand of religious belief on the whole population. That is what the Opposition wants us to do. Members of the Opposition talk about democracy. They are trying to force one form of narrow religious belief on the whole of Australia. The days of the Inquisition are over. Opposition members should not try to force their narrow political and religious views on the whole of Australia. I finally suggested to these people that there were more important concerns facing Australia today. From their comments in the local newspaper I do not think they accepted my argument. However, they have not been able to convince me that this is the most important issue facing contemporary Australia. Nor could they convince the unemployed or those pensioners facing hardship that this is the most important issue facing contemporary Australia. The views of the Opposition on this matter show how bankrupt its policies are. It is talking this matter up and trying to make out that it is the most important issue facing Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the opposition by the RSL. This is part of a campaign being waged by the RSL in New South Wales about the flag. I raised a point of order during the honourable member for Gippsland's speech-it was overruled-that nowhere in this Bill is the flag mentioned. This is not a Bill about the flag. The flag has not been mentioned anywhere in the Bill. I know that there is debate in the community about the flag. However, this legislation has nothing to do with that. I do not know whether we will have a new flag. I do not particularly care; I am not worried. I do not think it is an important issue. If we decide to have a new flag there will be extensive debate in the community about it, and rightly so. However, I do not think it is the most important issue facing Australia. There are far more important issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I sent copies of the statement by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr West) concerning the Bill to every RSL sub-branch in my electorate. Unfortunately, some deliberately distorted it. Recently I was invited to address a meeting of the south-east region of the RSL sub-branches. At that meeting I outlined again the Government's thinking on the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill. Even before the meeting, two sub-branches gave to the media details of motions that were to be moved at the meeting. The information in those motions was wrong, and I said so at the meeting. Later I was shocked to read a statement by the Port Kembla RSL Sub-Branch Secretary, one Mr Charles Rose, that the Government's move to alter the oath of allegiance and eliminate references to ' God and Queen' was pandering to people who had come from undemocratic and underdeveloped countries. He went on to make the outrageous claim that if one is against law and order one does not swear allegiance to the Queen. What utter rubbish!</PARA>

Diversity of views is part of the democratic process. The right to live in a democratic society is one of the things, we are told, that members of the RSL fought for. The amendments contained in the Bill follow extensive national consultations during 1982. In relation to the existing oath, the report on those consultations stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The strongly held and predominant view emerging from the consultations was that swearing allegiance to a sovereign, and especially to a named sovereign resident elsewhere, was inappropriate in Australia at its present stage of history. </PARA>
<PARA>I share that view. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> This view was shared by persons from a variety of backgrounds, including holders of imperial awards and persons who maintained that they were not republicans. </PARA>
<PARA>One does not have to be a republican to believe the oath should be changed. Despite the advantages of Australian citizenship, over one million people in Australia who are residentially eligible to become citizens have not applied for citizenship. Many such people have made it clear that their reluctance to become citizens results from their unwillingness to swear the oath in its present form. I know that from personal experience. The honourable member for Gippsland talked about some of the migrants, the new settlers, in his electorate; I think I have more in mine. People in my electorate have told me that they will not take out Australian citizenship and swear the oath in its present form. The pledge of allegiance now proposed for new citizens captures the key elements of becoming an Australian citizen. As is now the case, new citizens will be able to choose between a religious and a secular form of pledge to their new nation. The wording of the proposed pledge states:</PARA>
<PARA> I renounce any current citizenship, and all allegiance to any State other than Australia. I pledge-</PARA>
<PARA>or 'swear by Almighty God'-</PARA>
<PARA>that I will faithfully uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes this pledge of allegiance is distinctly Australian in character, expressing a clear commitment to Australia, its laws and Constitution , and avoiding what is for many people a confusing requirement to swear allegiance to a sovereign resident elsewhere. While there are legitimate differences of view on the monarchy, they should not be invoked in an Australian citizenship ceremony. The proposals bring everyone together, allowing all of them to make a full commitment of allegiance to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument put by the honourable member for Denison so long ago, on Monday, 2 April, about why people come to Australia is absolute rubbish. One wonders whether he has any contact at all with the communities for which he purports to speak. Why is the honourable member for Denison always prophesying the end of the Hawke socialist Government? One thing of which we can all be sure is that the honourable member for Denison will keep making this prophecy. The other thing that is for sure is that it will not come to pass. </PARA>

I must admit that I would not go as far as my colleague the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Maher) when he spoke, and the sentiments he expressed, but I differ from many in the Opposition ; I lived in the United Kingdom for 11 years. I have two university degrees, both from British universities. Few in this House have greater respect or affection for Britain than I have. But, above all, I am Australian, despite my 11 years in the United Kingdom. I want to cast off the colonial cringe that those on the Opposition benches revel in so much.</PARA></TALK.START>

I actually beg those opposite to get out of the 1880s and move in to the 1980s. I ask them to show a little bit of national pride and stop talking this rubbish that they talk in his House. They should be Australian, think Australian and support this Bill. I conclude by paying tribute to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I have the great privilege in this House of representing the people of the Illawarra region, this great ethnic centre, as indeed does the Minister represent his great ethnic centre.

But it is important because it goes to the very heart of what this country is all about. The Government seeks to change the nature of citizenship in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thought the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) made an excellent speech, as he always does. He made the point that we should recognise the importance of multiculturalism in this country. I have some doubts about that concept although I think we are very fortunate to have in Australia people from all parts of the world. It is great that we have people from all over Europe, from the Indian sub-continent and from Asia. These people coming to Australia have given us a vitality which has enriched the Australian community. But it is important to recognise that we have to understand that people have their different cultures. They have different heritages and backgrounds and they should be able to practise those things within Australia. That is great. But we are one country and there has to be this unity. There should be some diversity, certainly. It would be a terrible place if we all did the same thing. But also there must be a strength and a unity. We must be one nation. It would be a tragedy for this country if we became divided up into a whole lot of quite separate ethnic communities. Let us recognise the heritages and the cultures of these people, and the culture of our Aboriginal people also. Let them practise those cultures and even develop them within Australia, but also let us be one nation together. </PARA>

They come here because we have a very good standard of living and very high standards of education, health and welfare. These are the sorts of things people have come to Australia for. But when people come to Australia they also have to recognise something of our heritage and history, and the Queen is part of that history. I think we can get carried away with the idea of the monarchy. Let us recognise that we have a constitutional monarchy but the Queen, Her Majesty, does not make the decisions. I think the arrangements are very sound. They have worked very well so far. What is wrong with Australia? Why do honourable members opposite want to change these fundamental things and break down the structures and institutions that have made this country so great? Why do they want to change them as they obviously do? The honourable member for Macarthur did not say that he did not want to change the flag. He avoided that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QK5">Mr GROOM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Macarthur raised it too, and I will reply to him. Members of the Australian Labor Party all around Australia are saying: 'Let us change the flag. Let us have a new flag by 1988.' They have not got the guts to say so in the Parliament. They are using sneaky methods to achieve their aims . The Government pretends to be a government of moderation. It has endeavoured to create an image of moderation but behind this moderation, if one looks into the depths of the Government, one sees that there is a very radical element. Some members of that radical element are in the House at the moment. This issue has dragged them in. They are trying to change a number of things. No one could suggest that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is not an avowed republican. He is on the record as saying that he is an avowed republican. A significant number of members on the Government benches are avowed republicans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macarthur said that God has not been taken out of the oath. But what has happened to the oath? The word 'oath' has been removed. If the honourable member wants to know what the word 'oath' is all about, he has two university degrees from England and he ought to look up the dictionary, read it carefully and see what the word means. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr West) does not have the decency-I do not know where he is; he is hiding somewhere-to be in this House. What is he up to? He is following the same line as Al Grassby. He initiated all this in 1973. The same sorts of things were attempted in 1973 and they were knocked out. The word 'oath' has been replaced. I ask honourable members opposite seriously why they have replaced the word 'oath' with the word 'pledge'. What is a pledge? What is the difference between a pledge and an oath? I suggested that the honourable member for Macarthur look at that issue carefully and then he would understand why we are concerned about these moves. There is no doubt that we are moving down the prickly path towards republicanism. The people opposite may want to put this to the test. I note that the Minister has had the decency to come into the chamber at last. I would like him to say whether he is a republican. Does he want to change the flag?

There is a continuous attack upon Her Majesty, the Monarch of Australia, the Queen of Australia. I do not refer to her as the Queen of England . She is the Queen of Australia. Why is this happening?

Why are honourable members opposite against the Queen? Has not our system worked very well so far? What are the hangups of honourable members opposite? The Minister for Aviation (Mr Beazley) said a short time ago: 'Look at President Reagan.' Do honourable members opposite want an American system? Do the left-wingers want a American system with a president? I think this is the aim. There is some evidence of this. The aim is to have by 1988 a new flag, a republic and a president of the Australian Republic. No doubt, the man who has that ambition is Bob Hawke, the present Prime Minister. I think it is arguable that he is now the President of Australia but I will not develop that argument at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the oaths that we have had to this point. I refer to an excellent speech by the shadow spokesman for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman). He referred to the existing oath of allegiance. It was brought in by Whitlam and the Labor Government in 1973. It is in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> I, . . . renouncing all other allegiance, swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty, Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>What could be more Australian than that? It is dinky-di Australian talk. That is a very appropriate oath of allegiance. Of course, a person can make an affirmation in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> I, . . . renouncing all other allegiance, solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that I will be faithful, and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors, according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>These amendments were brought in by the Hon. E. G. Whitlam, Prime Minister of Australia. I believe those words remain most appropriate. However, as I said before, the Government wants to change this arrangement by requiring people to make a pledge. A pledge might be all right for someone who wants to take himself off drink or something like that, but why is a form of pledge appropriate in this instance? An insidious anti-God approach has been adopted in this legislation. The man behind the legislation, the creator of the legislation with his colleague, Mr Grassby, is the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, who is at the table. He is the leader of the left wing of the Australian Labor Party. We should be suspicious of this legislation because the Minister comes from the left wing of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall put something to the Minister at the table and I want a sincere answer. The Minister made an affirmation when he became a member of this Parliament. Who knows whether he will be a member of the next parliament. When he affirmed his obligations as a Minister he affirmed that he would bear allegiance to the Queen and that he would serve her faithfully. I wonder, as a matter of conscience, whether the Minister would be honest enough to say that he did not give a damn about that affirmation, that he has no allegiance to the Queen and that he has no allegiance--</PARA>

Is there some importance in an affirmation? If there is importance in the affirmation and if the Minister meant what he said-I very much doubt it-why does he breach the solemn affirmation he gave and attack the Queen in every way he can? Why does he try to get rid of her from this country and make Australia a republic? That is what he wants to do; that is what it is all about. Perhaps he should come clean and admit now that that is what he wants to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is also concerned with citizenship. How important is citizenship? It is very important for a person who wants to become a citizen of Australia. Such a person is declaring his desire to be part of Australia, to live in Australia and to become a true citizen. He wishes to indicate his true allegiance to the country and what it stands for. Citizenship conveys a sense of belonging. Of course, citizenship carries heavy responsibilities as well. I am disappointed when people who come to Australia and who want the best things that Australia can offer in terms of material gain are not prepared to become citizens of this country. Freedom has been mentioned in this debate and this is a great thing. We are probably freer than any other country in the world. United States of America surveys indicate just how free we are as a nation. People come from strife torn parts of the world to enjoy our freedom, our material wealth and our standard of living. They come to enjoy the good life that we have in Australia. However, according to the honourable member for Macarthur, some of them say: 'But I do not want to be part of this thing called the constitutional monarchy', which has made Australia great. People over a short time have worked to change these fundamental things. These people have had an influence on the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is tragic that we have downgraded the value of citizenship by reducing the residential period of three years in the previous eight years to two years in the previous five years. A person can reside in Australia for only two years and then become eligible for full citizenship of Australia. In fact, he can be here for two of the past three years. He could be here for two years, fly to some other country and be absent for 12 months and, under this piece of legislation if passed by this House, become an Australian citizen. He will be required to live here for only two years of the previous three years. </PARA>

I believe that in some countries they have to be resident for as many as 12 years. But in Australia the period is only two years. I think that this requirement tends to undermine the true value of Australian citizenship. The explanation given by the Minister in his second reading speech is that we are living in a mobile world, that we have to understand that people travel around the world regularly and they should not have to stay here long to be able to qualify for Australian citizenship.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I would like to address my remarks to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom). I also want to thank the Minister for Aviation (Mr Beazley) for reminding us of the changes that the Whitlam Government made to the status of the Queen in this country. The honourable member for Braddon has asked this House why the Government wants to change the legislation. I wonder whether the honourable member ever reflects on the fact that this country in terms of settlement is less than 200 years old and that this Parliament is less than 100 years old. Because of that we will be changing many things. We are in the middle of constant change. If this country did not change we would not be looking at bringing in people from overseas and we would not be learning and advancing so that this country could change for the better. Of course we are going to be involved in change. This Parliament should be involved in legislative change. There would not be much point in having a parliament if we did not change the legislation, introduce new legislation and rescind other legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I address my remarks to the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1983 I would like to read briefly from the second reading speech of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr West). In that speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to ensuring that the Act reflects the national identity of all Australians; that it does not discriminate between persons on the basis of their sex, marital status and present or previous nationality; that it provides for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of decisions to deny or deprive persons of citizenship under the Act; and that it is thoroughly Australian in character. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to those commitments. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest also that the purpose of this Bill is to give effect to these changes. As the honourable member for Braddon should be aware, the Australian Citizenship Act as it exists today did not exist prior to 26 January 1949. In fact, citizenship has changed in status from 1788. We have had a variety of citizens of this nation. In the State of the honourable member for Braddon, as in mine, we have had a different history of settlement. We had free citizens and we had convict citizens. They were not citizens then, but they eventually became citizens. People have come from over 250 nations and settled in this country. The nature of this country changes every five to 10 years. I suggest to honourable members who ask why we want to change this Act that we want to change it to make it fairer and more just and to reflect the current thinking in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I address myself to some of the changes in the Bill itself, I comment briefly on some of the statements made by previous speakers, not necessarily during the debate today. As has already been mentioned by some of my colleagues, this debate has now been going on for a month and we have addressed ourselves to it at various times in this chamber. I make some comments about some of the things that have been said here because I think many of us should reflect on some of these remarks and be rather ashamed of them. I might add that such remarks come from the other side of the chamber. We in the Government have spent the greater part of this debate trying to spell out in the clearest possible way what the Citizenship Amendment Bill entails. We have done this because we believe that the Bill is important both to the Parliament and to the people of Australia. One would have thought that the Opposition also would have concentrated on clarifying the various aspects of the Bill which have been discussed in the community. Looking back over the debate, however, I have found that the opposite has been the case. </PARA>
<PARA> We have just heard the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt), say that Australia will become a banana republic because of this Bill. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Millar) agreed with him and added that the Government is motivated by resentment of Britain and all things British. I suggest that that is utter nonsense. If the honourable member for Wide Bay thinks that Australia's acknowledgement of its British heritage depends on whether migrants swear an oath of allegiance to the British monarch, I suggest that he is demonstrating a complete lack of understanding about what it means to recognise a cultural, social, economic and political link. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the honourable member for Wide Bay did not confine himself to giving the House his rather quaint version of Irish history and Anglo-Australian associations. He also gave us his definition of multiculturalism and his views on racial equality. I was truly appalled to hear a member of this House associate himself so unashamedly with such a blatantly racist position. In relation to people discharging the duties of Australian citizenship, the honourable member said that some people lacked the capacity to educate themselves directly on Australian issues. To illustrate his point he chose the Aboriginals, the Australians who have been here for generations, for thousands of years. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> They became dependent on others who must make good the inadequacy and, therefore, they are not volunteering an expression of view that is a result of their own reasoning and their understanding. They became simply an echo for the opinions and ambitions of others. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to make his point absolutely specific:</PARA>
<PARA> A particular grouping of Aborigines, with all understanding, have been totally incapable of coming to an honest and objective conclusion about where their best interests lie in regard to voting. They have been totally dependent on best friends or advisers who, in many instances, have had no particular interest in the Aborigines' welfare but certainly have had a keen interest in the result of a ballot. So we create a citizen, and leave him lamentably ill-equipped to cope with the responsibilities he faces as a citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>My colleague the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Maher) was moved following that speech to remark on the disgraceful performance by the honourable member for Wide Bay. He hoped that Al Grassby never reads the Hansard report of this debate . I add to that that I hope that no one of Aboriginal descent ever sees the way the Aborigines were referred to in this debate. The offensive attitude displayed in this House by the honourable member for Wide Bay is a blot on this House. I suggest that it reflects some of the minority views at the moment being expressed in the community in an endeavour to whip up an issue. Many politically motivated people in the community who look at this Government today cannot find any other issue than one such as racism on which to attempt to stir up some form of sympathy for their position in the political system. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wide Bay dared to talk about not undermining the status of Australian citizenship by accepting second and third class citizens. It is not very hard to understand what the honourable member means by a first class citizen. One of his colleagues, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron) talked about traditions which had made Australia great. We know some of the traditions of old-style conservatism in Australia, the old divisive ethnocentric traditions that were tearing Australia apart before the people of Australia woke up and threw out the party which even now cannot get over the fact that it was not born to rule. What kind of attitude does the honourable member for Moreton have towards migrants in general? He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Many people play it quietly until they get Australian citizenship and then resort to what may be bad habits. </PARA>
<PARA>What on earth, I ask, could he mean by that? Many people? Bad habits? This really is the language of bigoted paranoia. </PARA>
<PARA> I comment very briefly on the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) in which he refers to the 'overwhelming majority of Australians'. I suggest that this is another demonstration of the terrible difficulty the Opposition seems to be having in counting. In my view a small number of people either have failed to acquaint themselves with the actual terms of the Bill before rushing in here yelling about abolishing the Queen-we have heard that again today-or their capacity to understand what it means to acknowledge a rich and diverse heritage is so limited that they are content to base their criticisms on the distorted, alarmist reports which circulate in certain quarters every time a change of any kind is proposed. Let us face it, some people, for their own reasons, cannot admit that Australia is a free and independent multicultural society. To turn this small number into an overwhelming majority is, I suppose, worked out according to some mathematical logic that keeps the Opposition from recognising how little support there is in the community for its outdated attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like briefly to address myself to some of the proposed changes. This Bill reflects the Government's four basic principles relating to the provision of Australian citizenship. All of us have spent many evenings in our electorates at citizenship ceremonies. We recognise the importance of these ceremonies and the fact that they are held in high esteem by people in the community who are either performing ceremonies for the Minister or who are there to become citizens of this great country. Firstly, the Bill ensures that the Australian Citizenship Act reflects the common national identity of all Australians. Secondly, it removes from the Act discrimination between persons on the basis of sex, marital status and national origin. Thirdly, it provides for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of a decision by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs of the Minister to deny or deprive persons of citizenship under the Act. Fourthly, it amends the Act so that it is thoroughly Australian in character. In applying these principles to drafting the proposed amendments it became necessary to include measures to eliminate various anomalies, reduce subjectivity in criteria for citizenship, clarify and simplify administrative requirements, and remove redundant provisions. I once again remind the honourable member for Braddon that that is why we are changing the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I now briefly address myself to a rather contentious issue, which seems to generate a lot of antagonism across the chamber, and I refer to the nature of the pledge. During national consultations-initiated, I might add, by the previous Government in 1982-a number of points emerged about what people wanted the pledge to express. I remind the House that there was strong support for a pledge which is distinctly Australian in character, which expresses full commitment to Australia, its laws and Constitution, and which avoids the requirement to swear allegiance to a sovereign resident elsewhere. It may come as some surprise to the Opposition to know that the report of the consultations made it clear that these views were expressed by people from a variety of backgrounds, including holders of imperial awards and people who thought Australia should retain its links with Great Britain. The Bill proposes two forms of pledge. One pledge contains a reference to Almighty God, in recognition of the fact that many people want to swear an oath before God when giving allegiance to Australia as they become a citizen. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WD4">Ms FATIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the honourable member for Braddon asking which god or which pledge? I suppose it depends on which country these people come from. A Buddhist who came from China might take that up with me and say that he or she does not necessarily believe in a god. A Moslem may come here and wish to take the oath and swear to his or her god and a Hindu to his or her gods. One pledge contains a reference, as I have already said, to Almighty God, in recognition of the fact that many people want to swear an oath before God when giving the allegiance to Australia as they become citizens. Both pledges incorporate the same three basic elements. The first is the renunciation of former allegiance, the second is a commitment to observe the laws of Australia, and the third is a declaration of new allegiance to Australia. I am sure many of my colleagues in this chamber have been to citizenship ceremonies and have seen the numbers of people who affirm at those ceremonies. I suggest that my electorate is very similar to many others in terms of mix of people and their religious or other beliefs, and I find that there are quite substantial numbers of people who do affirm. So I do not see that there will be any problem. There are a number of people in this community who do affirm.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WD4">Ms FATIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a substantial number, I would suggest. A number of people have made representations objecting to the possible deletion of references to God from the oath of allegiance. Their feelings have been taken into account in drafting the two proposed forms of the pledge of Australian citizenship. Likewise, some people have expressed their concern about the removal of reference to the Queen from the oath of allegiance but, just as the new forms of pledge will allow people to express their full commitment to Australia, whatever their religious beliefs, so neither form differentiates between Australians on the basis of their attitudes to the monarchy. By this change I suggest we have removed the possibility of discrimination in that respect. As the Government has stressed throughout this debate, a citizenship ceremony is not the appropriate forum for a discussion about the relative merits of republicanism and the monarchy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also comment on the change relating to the responsible parent. This Bill removes the present discrimination between men and women by giving equal rights to both parents. Under the present legislation the father is the responsible parent. The mother is the responsible parent only if the father is dead, or the mother has custody, or the child is born out of wedlock. The Bill removes any distinctions between the mother and the father and between children born in or out of wedlock. Instead it defines 'responsible parent' in terms of having guardianship or custody of the child, whether jointly or otherwise. I acknowledge that the Opposition is also pleased with that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the present requirement that applicants for citizenship have an adequate knowledge of English. The Government believes that, rather than bringing people down because of their lack of English, we should be encouraging them to improve their English. With the new requirement of a basic knowledge, applicants will still have to understand enough English to be able to go through the citizenship ceremony, unless they are over 50 years of age. Even members of the Opposition admit that this latest amendment is a humane proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the Minister for his commitment to these changes. Since I have been in this place he has indicated to us, both here and in committee and party meetings that he is totally committed to changing the Act and introducing this Bill, and I commend him for that. I wish not only to congratulate him but also the Government for the changes. I have to say that I have been horrified and at times disgusted by some of the racist comments from the other side of the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Time after time this Government claims that it is a government of reform. It claims it is healing the divisiveness within our community. What humbug and hypocrisy that is. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr West) opened his speech on the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill by saying that the Bill is 'thoroughly Australian in character'. Obviously the Minister has a different understanding of what is Australian. Perhaps it is from a socialist left factional perspective that the Minister believes it is Australian to pillage the rightful role of the Queen of Australia . Perhaps from his myopic Labor view it is considered Australian to downgrade the Queen, God, our language and our democratic system based on the Westminster principles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is a well planned move towards dragooning Australians into republicanism. Members on the opposite side may scoff, but let us not forget the comments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's world today program as recently as 26 January 1984. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this--</PARA>
<PARA>that is republicanism--</PARA>
<PARA>is something that ought to and will happen. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister has merely converted the immature 'little Australian' nationalism of earlier decades into an artificial ocker nationalism of the 1980s . I can happily and confidently tell this House that the people do not want a republic and will not accommodate the Prime Minister's ambition to be President. The people do not want the changes proposed in this Bill to the oath of allegiance, as the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) has resolutely told this House time and again. I know this from the reaction within my electorate and the gallup polls, and the hilarity which has greeted the offer of a portrait of the Prime Minister to Commonwealth departments and units of the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a proud history as a constitutional monarchy. It joins the ranks of many other such countries, all of which have stable governments and are democracies that are an example to new emerging nations. Let me remind the House that the real significance of a monarch is in the power the monarchy denies to others and not so much in the limited power the monarch has. It is a safeguard that has worked well throughout our history. The Queen of Australia is recognised by all residents in this country. It is malicious to suggest that new settlers are confused by the role the Queen plays. Even if one accepted an argument that initially some new settlers are unsure of the role of the Queen of Australia then surely they should become aware of that role before they seek Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind this House that citizenship should be seen as a privilege and an honour, and not be demeaned to the level of a driving licence. Citizenship places certain rights on the individual but also demands certain duties in return. I will come to that later. Yet the Minister proposes in this Bill to do away with any reference to the Queen. I note that he did not have the courage to eliminate God. Is that because in the gallup polls God still outrates the Prime Minister? If I recollect correctly, the Prime Minister is well behind God in the gallup polls. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes to abolish the oath and replace it with a 'pledge'. What does the Minister mean by a pledge? To whom is this pledge made? Mr Deputy Speaker, let me read the proposed 'pledge'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> I renounce any current citizenship and allegiance to any state other than Australia. I pledge that I faithfully uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>This is foreign to Australians. Perhaps the Minister has been watching too many American television shows. As I said earlier, the Minister has purposely eliminated any reference to God. I agree that a new citizen will be able to specially request the so-called pledge with reference to God, but again I ask why this change is necessary. There has always been a provision for those people who wish to make an affirmation. To do so, why is it now necessary, by legislation, to place the onus on the new citizen to have to make a request for an oath to God? I remind the Minister that again he is out of touch with the community. In the last census an overwhelming percentage of the population identified themselves with a religious denomination believing in a god, Christian or otherwise. Why has the Government decided to ignore the majority? Why is there such a manical desire to abolish, to tear down, the values that are dear to so many Australians? What will be next to go-the national flag?</PARA>
<PARA> This obsessional desire to water down the basis of our heritage is continued by the proposed changes in English language requirements. Again there is no logic in the Bill. The Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA>Knowledge of English is essential to full participation in Australia's social, cultural and political life . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with what the Minister says. But then the Minister continues and says that the Government does not wish to deny citizenship to those with limited English. Then, a few words later, the Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . applicants for citizenship must have only a basic knowledge of English. </PARA>
<PARA>What does the Minister mean by his words 'limited English', 'basic English' and 'knowledge of English'? It is my understanding that the English language requirement has been conversational ability. Does the Minister propose to lower the standard already set by the previous Government? If that is the intention of this Government, the Opposition is totally opposed to such moves.</PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that citizenship not only provides certain privileges but also demands certain responsibilities from a citizen. One of the responsibilities is jury service. It is the obligation of every Australian citizen to serve on a jury when required to do so. If we lower the language criteria we are making a mockery of the jury system-but perhaps this Government plans to abolish that institution of our lifestyle, too. How can citizens who have a very limited knowledge of the English language fulfil this duty? Does the Minister propose to establish two classes of citizens-English speaking and non-English speaking? Let me also refer to the question of exercising one's constitutional rights of voting. A lowering of the English language requirements will contribute little to encouraging the casting of a valid and thought out vote. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot fathom the purpose of this move. It is especially difficult to understand when we find that the number of applicants meeting current standards is increasing. I cannot understand, when 1.2 million residents meet citizenship requirements and do not wish citizenship, why a lowering of requirements is needed to attract these people. They have made their choice not to seek citizenship. Why should we either try to buy their interest by lowering standards or entice them in some other way? Again the Minister aims to demean the status of citizenship as an integral part of our heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to a very serious matter that will emanate as a result of this Bill. The Minister, in his headlong rush to attract more people, proposes to reduce the residence eligibility period from three years to two years. He says one reason is 'increased international mobility'. For once the Minister is right but has he considered the security aspects emanating from the increased mobility? Australia, like most other countries, faces the ever-increasing dangers of terrorism and drug trafficking. In such a climate security checks are most important. One need only talk to members of the forces protecting this country to realise how difficult this increasing mobility makes establishing proper and accurate security checks. One need only read the report of the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking to realise the importance of passports and citizenship to the international drug trader. Yet in the face of all that the Minister proposes to relax the continuous residence requirement from the 12 months immediately preceding the application to 12 months residence in the previous two years. </PARA>

<PARA> This Bill does nothing to enhance citizenship. This Bill has not been thought out clearly and fully and, more importantly, it is being used as a veil over this Government's intentions to force Australia to become a republic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I go back to a couple of comments made by previous speakers. The content of the debate so far on the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill has been a judicious mixture of analysis of the existing provisions of the Australian Citizenship Act and also a lot of hyperbole. That is to be expected, having regard to the history of inactivity of those on the other side of the House. We have heard a lot about the new national anthem and proposals about a new flag for Australia, but we have heard very little from the other side about what the Bill comprises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me go back to a couple of comments relating to the new national anthem that are deserving of some further attention. A poll recently taken in Queensland indicated that some 84 per cent of those polled actually supported Advance Australia Fair as the new national anthem. In the next few months that may be cause for some reflection on the part of the Queensland Premier who, I think, assumes that there is widespread support for the old anthem. I certainly do not think that is the case. The poll tends to confirm that is indicative of the lack of touch of the coalition parties not only on this issue but also on a whole range of other issues. I think they ought to give some consideration to leaving behind views that are firmly entrenched in years gone by and have a review of what they are about. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition parties apply the same sort of argument to the issue of the Australian flag. Let me say that I am on record as indicating my view that it is premature to think about changing the flag. Nevertheless, a flag is simply a material representation, if you like, of what Australia is all about. If at some stage in the future the Australian people take the view that the flag in its existing style no longer reflects adequately what they believe Australia is all about, no doubt at some stage in the future the flag will be changed, as flags have been changed in many countries during their history. I reiterate that my view is that it is premature to go down that road at this time, but certainly the public debate engendered on this subject is to be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Citizenship Act did not exist prior to 1949. Many speakers, in the comments they have made here today, have assumed that there has been some long history of people having a fixed attitude to the requirements of Australian citizenship. That is simply incorrect. Australian citizenship was allowed to British subjects and also to Australian residents but we also had another ugly category of 'aliens'. It seems to me that the perception of that category has really continued as an implicit part of what some members of the Opposition parties have put to us today. The attitude to those aliens-we call them ethnic Australians or Australians of ethnic origin-seems to be something that is implicit in a whole range of policy areas and I think the history of the attitude of the coalition parties which are now in Opposition is such that it really cannot be held up in this House as being one of care for ethnic Australians. The subject of the treatment of Aboriginals was raised here earlier by my colleague from Tasmania the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom). I hope he has dissociated himself from the current activities of the Tasmanian Government with respect to the burial of Aboriginal remains. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect to the Deputy Speaker, I have not been asked to withdraw. I shall but the point was worthy of being made. The Labor Government has taken a whole range of initiatives which I think will go some considerable way towards encouraging the 1.2 million people currently residing in Australia who have lived here for more than the existing three-year period required under the current Act and who have yet to take out citizenship to do so. This range of initiatives will help such people to see themselves as part of the Australian community and will go a considerable way towards encouraging them to take out Australian citizenship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The theme of the Government's involvement in these areas is to break the common nexus between ethnicity and disadvantage. It is a common theme but it had not really been addressed by governments in the post-war period until perhaps the beginning of the 1970s. Certainly, in the short months since March 1983, this Government has taken a number of initiatives to assist ethnic Australians. These initiatives have had a significant impact on the views of people as to whether they ought to participate more fully in our democratic process, and it is a common theme. I represent the electorate of Maribyrnong. It is an electorate which comprises very large numbers of people of ethnic background. A common theme that I have heard in discussions with my constituents is a view that things are happening. It may be that because my seat is part of the western region of Melbourne, an area that hitherto has been relatively neglected by a number of governments, my constituents have a greater perception of government involvement in areas that assist them directly. Through that perception they may come to the conclusion that they want to participate because they are being given a fair go. They are being treated as Australians are on other sides of Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the House a few examples of areas of government involvement which I know have encouraged people to come to my office and inquire about taking out Australian citizenship. For example, in the western region of Melbourne the adult migration education program has had a major impact on people's perception of their standing in our community. They believe that progam is giving them a fair go and it is encouraging them to take out Australian citizenship. Expenditure for this program has increased by 14 per cent in the last year and there are provisions for a significant increase in the number of permanent teachers in that area of education. Another example of the Government's initiatives is the development of a new materials and syllabus centre to increase the effectiveness of English language teaching through better professional support. This goes to the very issues raised by the honourable member for Braddon in regard to the basic English requirements. Funds have been allocated to expand and improve occupational English classes for migrants in the work place. Again, this is a significant step towards addressing the very issues raised by my colleague. </PARA>
<PARA> Priority will be given to needy schools under the Commonwealth education programs. These schools, of course, contain a disproportionately large number of ethnic children and such schools are substantially represented in electorates such as mine. The participation and equity program is designed to improve the number of children completing full secondary education either in school or in the area of technical and further education. I refer also to the review by the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs of post arrival programs. The Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts is conducting an inquiry into a national language policy. Of course, we await with some interest the results of that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Another Labor Government initiative is the develpment of a National Advisory and Co-ordinating Committee on Multicultural Education to advise the Government on the cultural resources available and the changes needed to the education system so that it better reflects the ethnic composition of the Australian community and provides for equality. The Sex Discrimination Act, adverted to by a number of previous speakers, will provide redress for migrant women who suffer discrimination in employment, housing and access to services, or who suffer from sexual harassment in the work place. The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill of course, also encompasses anti-discrimination provisions and is an added incentive for the ethnic communities to participate by taking out citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA> A migrant women's desk has been established in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. That is, hitherto, an area which has been relatively neglected by that Department. Provision has been made for substantial funding for child care facilities in association with English language classes to help ensure that migrant women are able to attend those classes. It is, of course, of the utmost stupidity to provide resources that people cannot utilise because of their own particular circumstances. Funding has been provided for the women's emergency services program to employ ethnic workers in women's refuges. This provision, while not affecting a wide range of people, has had a significant impact in my area. Migrant women, because of their cultural backgrounds, are often in a more vulnerable position than Australian women. Initiatives like this go a long way towards encouraging migrant women to see themselves as full members of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> Migrant women are now represented in the Government's new arrangements for consultation with women's organisations and interest groups. That area, again, has been relatively neglected in the past. I see my colleague, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) nodding his head in agreement. I thank him for that. An immigration policy was introduced in 1973 that does not discriminate between nationality, race or creed. Of course, that was an initiative of the Whitlam Government. The thrust of that policy I must say, in all fairness, was essentially maintained in terms of the current Bill. Of course, we took into account the policy review which was initiated by the now Opposition parties, if my memory serves me correctly, in about June 1983. That review was a significant acknowledgement by the now Opposition that there needed to be change in the context of the Australian Citizenship Act. Of course, we ensured that our own policy commitments have been reflected in the Act in its final form. No one would expect us to do otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall not go through, ad infinitum, initiatives that the Government has taken in respect of ethnic communities. I believe, as I have already indicated, that those initiatives are an integral part of encouraging ethnic individuals or people with ethnic backgrounds to take the step to become Australian citizens. As has been previously indicated, that step should be accorded the utmost respect by anyone taking it because of its important and sensitive nature. However, there are a number of things that I would like to comment on that have only been touched on in passing. The qualifying period for citizenship has now been reduced from three years to two years. I think that is a fundamentally important decision. I have always felt that a real step towards becoming an Australian citizen is the decision to come to Australia and to make Australia one's home. I think that a period of two years, if the applicants accord with the other eligibility requirements, should suffice. However, a particularly important provision of the Bill is the section that allows for appeals on a number of grounds to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In the past there has always been a sneaking suspicion in some immigration cases that political clout is a more important criterion than merit for people seeking a change in their citizenship status either by applying for Australian citizenship or to matters such as deportation or deprivation of Australian citizenship. I think the Government has taken an important step in that regard. It reflects well on the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr West) that, in future, those sorts of decisions will be placed before a proper judicial tribunal and will not be subject to the executive whim of a Minister who may or may not be influenced by criteria other than those of the merits of the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already adverted to the initiatives taken by this Government to improve knowledge of the English language by all new Australians of ethnic backgrounds. Recently a detailed study was conducted in the western region of Melbourne. It showed that a lack of knowledge of English was a significant impediment to young Australians of ethnic backgrounds getting employment even though they had been born in Australia. So, for goodness sake, how we could demand that people, for example, over the age of 50 who have only been here for five years should have a knowledge of English that exceeds that of young Australian born people in their mid-20s is beyond me. I think it is an unjustified demand and, in terms of the number of Australians who have not taken out citizenship, certainly a demand that demonstrably, has not been able to be met by a whole range of people who would consider it a very high honour to take out Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the requirement that an applicant for citizenship should demonstrate an adequate knowledge of the English language. Of course, that excites some passion in people who take that provision at face value and who do not go on to read the other qualifications. For goodness sake, I think that if there was a harsh enough judge had the Queensland Premier arrived from New Zealand today rather than some years ago he would not pass that test. A knowledge of the English language is essential to full participation in the Australian social, cultural and political life. However, the Government does not wish to deny citizenship to those with limited English who have lived in Australia for some time and who would take pride in becoming Australian citizens . </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes that applicants for citizenship must have only a basic knowledge of English. Applicants over 50 years of age will be exempt from the new requirement of a knowledge of basic English recognising the difficulty that many older people have in learning a new language. Everywhere I go in my electorate I talk to older members of the various ethnic communities. They are no less a people than other Australians. In my view they have equal rights. Indeed, many of them, in my subjective view, would make better citizens of this country than many of those who were born with that right. For example, only recently I spoke to the Chief Commissioner of the Victoria Police, Mr Miller. We were talking about the ethnic group which had invited us to a Returned Services League function, of all things. The RSL sub-branch comprised solely Italian returned soldiers. In talking about that community we recalled a number of interesting statistics. The Italian community has the highest rate of home ownership in Australia. It has one of the lowest rates of criminality of any group in Australia and because members of that group happen to be over 50 and have a lack of understanding of English I do not think we should preclude them from becoming Australian citizens. I am mindful that my time is running out. I thank the House for its indulgence and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

However, I question the reasons why there has to be such an extensive change to the Citizenship Act. There is no question that any legislation of this Parliament or any other parliament needs to be constantly reviewed to ensure that it is still appropriate to the Australian community. But why are these extensive changes being made at this time? During their contributions to this debate, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) and the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) suggested that this Bill is part of a much wider plan by the present Government to turn Australia into a republic. I suggest that the honourable member for Braddon and the honourable member for Gippsland were quite correct in their observations. When we debate the Bill I believe we need to look beyond its parameters to find the direction in which this Government is taking Australia. I believe the Bill represents one part of a much more extensive master plan to break down the very social fabric of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague the honourable member for La Trobe, who is a member of the socialist left in Victoria, suggests that that is nonsense. Perhaps I will inform him of a few other facts as I go along in my contribution. There is no doubt that Australia has an Anglo-Saxon background. That is our heritage and our history. That is the very origin of this country and its social fabric. What this Government is about is a very purposeful attempt to break down the Anglo- Saxon origins, traditions and history that have surrounded and built this country into what it is today. I do not believe the Government alone is the perpetrator of this master plan. I believe it is the innocent fool, if I can put it that way, which is being led by others of a more sinister nature. For the benefit of the Minister and the House I will quote from a book entitled Red Over Black, written by an Aboriginal named Geoff McDonald. Perhaps I should inform the House of Mr McDonald's background. For 20 years he was a member of the Communist Party of Australia. He was trained by the Communist Party at its special training camp in Minto New South Wales to be a communist activator within particular organisations in this country. After 20 years in the Communist Party Mr McDonald realised the error of his ways and decided that, for the sake of Australia, he should expose what was happening within the Communist Party and how its activists were operating in various organisations. I quote from Mr McDonald's book:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>However, the history of this century has demonstrated time and time again how Communists have been sucesssful in adopting Lenin's famous teaching of exploiting those whom he described as ''useful idiots''. During my own days in the Communist movement I learned how relatively easy it is for Communists to exploit the idealism and misguided views of non-Communists. Many politicians are , unfortunately, just as easy to mislead as others. The steady global Communist advance over the past sixty years has been achieved primarily by Communists exploiting gullible and mis-informed people. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr McDonald makes it perfectly clear that the Communist Party considers that there are 'useful idiots' in this community. He also makes the point that members of parliament are just as easily exploited, just as much useful idiots, as people who might be involved in various organisations in the community within either the academic world or other spheres of influence. I believe those communist activists are treating the Parliament and members of the Australian Labor Party as 'useful idiots' in bringing this Bill into the House, and also in some of the other actions that are being taken by the Government, to undermine the social fabric of Australia. There is no question that the best way to undermine the economy and the social fabric of Australia is to distort our history and origins and the things we hold dear which we can pass on to successive generations. Mr McDonald earlier in his book stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the issue is largely one of the need for a society to be homogeneous if it is to be stable. </PARA>
<PARA>If one accepts that theory then obviously, by distorting the homogeneous structure of our society, one has the very basis of making a society unstable. I believe that in part, that is what the Bill is all about. It is not an attempt to bring nationalism to Australia. It is an attempt by communist activists to undermine and distort the social fabric of Australia. They are using the Government and members of the Labor Party as useful idiots in achieving that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the Bill's function is to change the oath of allegiance, to take the word 'God' out of the oath of allegiance. Who in this place would suggest that Australia is not a Christian country? Who would suggest that? My friends on the other side of the chamber are notable by their silence. Who would suggest that Australia is not a Christian country? Who would deny people who are Christians the right to make their oath in the name of God? That is what this Government is doing. It is taking away the right of people who come to this country to pursue their Christian belief by swearing an oath to God. At the moment the Act provides that people of various religious backgrounds can make an oath in the name of God or an affirmation, if that is their wish. But by taking the word ' God' out of the oath of allegiance we are giving those people a choice of making an affirmation or an affirmation. There is no choice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I go further in outlining what the Government is trying to do in changing the social fabric of Australia, and these matters were referred to by my colleagues in their contributions. I impress on the House that we need to look at the Bill in the context of what is taking place by action of the Government. For instance, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) used his autocratic decision-making powers to tell Australia that it had a new national anthem. Even Mr Whitlam, in his halcyon days, did not attempt to do that. At least he had the courtesy to Australia to conduct a referendum. But not the present Prime Minister. He did not even show that courtesy to the people of Australia. He simply informed them, by way of a Press release, that suddenly we had a new national anthem. I would have thought that, if the symbols of Australia are to be changed, at least the Australian people should have some say in how those symbols are to be changed or whether they should be changed. That was not the case with the present Prime Minister. He decided that he knew better than the people of Australia and told us that we had a new national anthem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We understand also that plans are afoot to change the style of the Australian flag. I ask why the Government should be considering changing the Australian flag. It is the flag under which this country was brought together in 1901. It is the flag that has held this country together since that time. Yet these people want to change the flag and the symbols that have held this country together. I believe there is a purposeful attempt to break down and distort the very social fabric that has held this country together since its formation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe my colleague the honourable member for Denison is right; they want the hammer and sickle. On the first sitting day of this Parliament we were reminded by the Special Minister of State (Mr Young) that we on this side of the chamber do not have the numbers to do anything. Government members believe that, because they have the numbers, they have the right to change Australia. But why did they not take this to the people as part of their manifesto and see if they could get a mandate to change Australia? Why did they not tell people before the last election that they wanted to change the flag? Why did they not tell people that they wanted to change the oath of allegiance? Why did they not tell people that they wanted to open the doors of Australia for a flood of Asian immigration ? No, they did not mention any of these things. But now it is being exposed that this is what they are on about. This is what the Government is doing and all we on this side of the House can do is to try to expose its actions to the people of Australia to allow them to make a judgment whenever the Government dares to go to the polls on the next occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that what we are witnessing at the moment is a sinister program to undermine completely the social fabric of Australia, to change the very nature of this country, to move away from our Anglo-Saxon background, to remove any history that has held this country together and, in part, to turn it into a country that will be nothing resembling the country we have known in the past. This will be terribly disruptive. I believe it is part of the communist plan to help to bring Marxism into this country. Unless the people of Australia are alerted to what this Government is about, it could very well be successful. I do not claim that I have the numbers over here to stop the Government but what we have got are voices to warn people of what the Government is about. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not just a Bill to change the Citizenship Act. It is far more sinister than taking God out of the oath of allegiance It is a program to break down Australia. I can assure Government members that, while they might consider themselves to be useful idiots who can be used by communists, there is not one honourable member on this side of the House who is a useful idiot. We will not allow ourselves to be used by communists in the way those people have been used. Nor will we allow this sort of thing to be done that will undermine Australia. We will not allow the Government to get away with it without our at least forewarning the people of what the Government is about. </PARA>

<PARA> As an English migrant who has been resident in Australia for 23 years, it gives me a particular pleasure, and indeed a pride, to be a member of a Labor Federal Government which is introducing mush needed amendments to the 1948 Citizenship Act. The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1983 reflects the multicultural nature of today's Australian society and has my overwhelming support. In February 1961 when my wife Joyce and I, with our three children, Stephen, Ivan and Janet, emigrated from England to Australia we had the good fortune to be supported by the assisted migrant program.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DI4">Mr MILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will say something about that in a moment. I notice that there have been comments in the media about whether the term 'Pom' is offensive. I understand that the acronym 'Pom' stands for Prisoner of Mother England and in that sense it certainly is not offensive because many of those early migrants from England were convicts because they had rebelled against a system of harsh and exploitative oppression. Of course, it really depends on the tone of the voice whether being called a 'Pom' is offensive or friendly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was no doubt of the intention of members of the Opposition when they jeered at my accent. They also jeered at my honourable friends and colleagues the honourable members for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) and the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent). The intention of honourable members opposite was to mock us because we had distinct overseas accents. Even the honourable member for Burke ( Dr Theophanous) was mocked, not because he had a foreign accent but because he had a Greek name. This latent and sometimes blatant racism is a hallmark of some members of the Opposition and that is why they are maliciously and irresponsibly attacking the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr West) on the implementation of what previously has been seen as a bipartisan immigration policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I was most surprised to read in the newspapers and listen on the radio to the comments of Professor Geoffrey Blainey on Asian immigration. I was surprised to find that a man who was a one-time colleague of mine at the University of Melbourne, and whom I know to be a man of humane disposition, cannot see that his remarks are inflaming the latent racism of a minority of ignorant and insecure Australians. Professor Blainey has stated quite correctly that in 1983, 40 per cent of our migrant places were filled by Asians. However, what he fails to say is that the present immigration policy is based on humanitarian principles of which genuine refugee status and family reunion are essential ingredients. As the Minister has explained, one of the main reasons for the high percentage of migrants from Asia in 1983 was that other migrant groups were not taking advantage of the family reunion program. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason which I will come to later arises from the large influx of refugees from Vietnam and Kampuchea, many of whom came to Australia as economic refugees and were given easy admittance to Australia by the previous Government. In a period of eight years the Fraser Government was responsible for some 78,000 Indo-Chinese refugees settling in Australia. The greater majority of the refugees were from Vietnam, with about one-fifth from Kampuchea and Laos. </PARA>
<PARA> To say the least, I am appalled at the standard of debate which has been raging in the media about the so-called Asianisation of Australia. Surely we are not going back to the dark days of 1901 when Australians were told by a writer in the Bulletin that the Anglo-Saxon must be preserved in his pure state if he was to retain his position as the best and most intellectual on earth. Apart from anything else, it is ridiculous and ignorant to lump all Asian nationalities together in a campaign which advodates a return to what amounts to a white Australia policy with discrimination against family reunion and refugee status for prospective migrants from our neighbour Asian countries. Sri Lankans, Thais, Malaysians, Vietnamese, Indonesians, Filipinos and Chinese, to name a few of the Asian nationalities involved, are as diverse in colour, culture and racial characteristics as it is possible for the human race to be. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that what the critics of our immigration policy are saying is that, because in the last half of 1983, 40 per cent of total sponsorships under the family reunion program was from Asia, we should discriminate against such applicants. In practical terms this means that one has to say to perhaps a Sri Lankan, who is probably a Tamil and whose family is suffering the racial violence that is going on in that country at this very time: 'No, I am sorry, your brother cannot migrate to Australia because there are too many of your people taking advantage of our migration program'. Is that what the shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Hodgman), who is at the table, wants us to say? If any honourable members of this House have had to sit and listen to these applicants and the human anguish which such a restriction would cause, they would change their minds. If some of the critics could actually become involved and could hear the kinds of human problems that are encountered by these people and the reasons they want their family here, they would change their minds. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the necessity for refugees to flee their country of birth because of religious and political persecution it is essential that we maintain our refugee program. The Fraser Government's refugee program had many defects which are not present in the programs of the present Government. One particular defect was its failure to screen properly the Vietnamese boat people, many of whom landed illegally on Australia's northern shores. A small proportion of these people were thugs and extortionists who had learned their trade in the back streets of Saigon. In contrast to the humanitarian policies of the present Government, honourable members opposite would choose to allow the entry of these criminal types. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of Vietnamese are law-abiding people but I experienced at first hand the menacing behaviour at the hands of these thugs when I attended an anniversary commemoration of the ending of the Vietnam war. I was also involved in helping an Australian, a German migrant, who almost lost his life in the Eastbridge ex-migrant hostel as a result of a machete attack by three men of Vietnamese origin. Local police have been unsuccessful in preferring charges because although one of the assailants was known, the many Vietnamese who witnessed the attack were too frightened to give evidence to the police. The Opposition stands condemned for allowing such people to enter Australia. However , let me make it clear that I consider that media reports which attempt to brand all refugees as latent terrorists are, in my view, slanderous and irresponsible. I want to highlight the fact that the present attitude of the Opposition, which when in government allowed people with criminal backgrounds to enter Australia, is hypocritical in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to Schedule 1 of the new Bill, the pledge of Australian citizenship, which replaces the pledge contained in Schedule 2 of the principal Act. Opposition members, particularly the honourable member for Denison, have been almost hysterical in their condemnation of the proposed change. In the earlier debate some four weeks ago the honourable memer for Moreton accused the honourable member for Lowe of being a humbug and he also made other slanderous comments which he was forced to withdraw. Why did the honourable member for Moreton become so excited? It was because the honourabe member for Lowe referred to the fact that United Kingdom nationals resented, for a variety of reasons, making an oath of allegiance to the Queen. In fact, the honourable member for Lowe was correct. I was one of those United Kingdom nationals who considered it meaningless, as a national of the United Kingdom and an ex-member of the Royal Air Force, to take such an oath. In due course I and my wife both took advantage of the opportunities given by the Whitlam Labor Government to United Kingdom nationals to take up Austraian citizenship without formality in 1974. I can also well understand the resistance of nationals from other royalist countries or from republics to swear allegiance to an English Queen. It is time members opposite realised that we are now close to the twenty-first century and not still in the artistocratic era of the nineteenth century. Similar to their Herbert Spencerian philosophy their ideas on royalty, so obsequiously expressed by the honourable member for Denison, are 150 years out of date. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important amendment is proposed new section 13 which has been substituted for the old section in the principal Act which, amongst other things , reduces the minimum period of residence from three years to two years before a certificate of citizenship can be granted. I applaud this amendment as there is no doubt that two years is quite long enough to establish a relationship with Australia which is deserving of citizenship status. In my own case I experienced a graphic realisation that I had adopted Australia as my permanent home when the 1961 Australia versus England test match was being played. As a Pom I was constantly ribbed when the Australians were winning but when I had to admit to myself that secretly I wanted the Australian team to win I realised that I had well and truly adopted Australia as my country. This was despite the fact that around that time when I was out shopping a shop assistant on the Myer store ground floor sent me up to the horticultural section on the top floor after I had asked where I could buy some light bulbs. Of course, I should have referred to globes. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also involved in another embarrassing incident in the Collins Street accountant's office where I worked when one of the female members of staff who had been talking to a male colleague about a difficult pregnancy ended the conversation by asking whether she could use his Durex. My amazement at the frankness of the conversation was allayed a little later when I found that the term was not the name of a contraceptive in Australia. Of course, one has to remember that this happened 23 years ago and no doubt such conversations are quite commonplace these days. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that a knowledge of the English language is not always the advantage that it appears to be when one newly arrives from England. Even now I sometimes find myself at a loss to understand some 'strine'. I was very glad to note that the proposed new section 13 provides that the English language requirements are to be reduced from an adequate knowledge of English to a basic knowledge. A basic knowledge means that the applicants for citizenship will be required to use only simple English to respond to simple English questions and when taking the pledge. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also pleased to notice that persons over 50 years of age will be exempted from the English language requirement. A recent visit to Latin America convinced me how difficult it is to absorb a new language when one is over 50 years of age . About the only Spanish word I managed to remember without any difficulty was cerveza and I have to admit that the beer compared favourably with Australian beer. The point is that it is difficult enough for older people to adjust to a new way of life without having to struggle with a new language. But a lack of knowledge of English does not mean that a migrant does not appreciate the need for good government or have the desire to cast a vote to achieve that government . The greater majority of migrants voted for the Hawke Labor Government. This basic democratic right should not be denied to our older migrants because they lack a knowledge of the English language. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to recall how we have progressed in the past 83 years. The Barton Government of 1901 prohibited the entry into Australia of:</PARA>
<PARA>any person who, when asked to do so by an officer, fails to write out and sign in the presence of the officer a passage of fifty words in length in the English language by the officer. </PARA>
<PARA>In this way the Government was able to ensure that any undesirable migrant be excluded. The Attorney-General of that time, Alfred Deakin, made it clear during the second reading of the Immigration Restriction Bill on 12 September 1901 exactly who those undesirable people were. He said that Australians wanted to be one people and remain one people without the mixture of races. Other races could not blend with Australians; there must be one race, a united race, which could intermix, intermarry and associate without degradation on either side. He saw no evil in white Australians declaring themselves superior to the many uneducated races of Asia and untutored savages. In those days, unfortunately, the Labor Party was equally as prejudiced against coloured people, if not more so, than the conservatives. Unfortunately, the media debate which has been whipped up by Professor Blainey carries shades of that second reading debate in our first Federal Parliament. I trust that the conservatives on the other side of the House will declare themselves opposed to the strident calls of racist groups in Australia who are calling for discrimination against migrants from Asia and not emulate their predecessors of 83 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, of course, interesting to note that in the debate of so many years ago honourable members had some problems in defining those Asiatic people they wished to exclude. Thus, both Government and Opposition members were at great pains to make it clear that the language test was not intended to cause offence to the Japanese. The Hon. F. E. McLean, the member for Lang, a member of the Liberal association and the last speaker in the debate, gave a good indication of the essence of that early debate. </PARA>

<PARA>Is this the sort of thing that the honourable member for Denison wants to see added to the Bill? Mr McLean went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time I sincerely hope that the administration of this Bill will be effective. I credit the Government with the sincere desire to carry out the intentions of the people of Australia and to exclude coloured aliens from our midst. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Hon. F. E. McLean had to say on 9 October 1901.

I notice that all honourable members opposite are very quiet now. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude my remarks in support of the Bill I would like to say a few words about the citizenship ceremony itself. Over the past 3 1/2 years since I have been the member for La Trobe I have attended a large number of citizenship ceremonies conducted by the Shire of Sherbrooke, the City of Knox and the Shire of Lilydale, the three municipalities which are situated in my electorate. Unfortunately, in recent months the ceremonies have been held on days when I am required to be present in the Parliament. I have, accordingly, written to the municipalities concerned requesting that the ceremonies be scheduled for the weeks when I am not in Canberra as I believe it is most important for Federal members to be present on such an important occasion as the conferring of Australian citizenship. I take this opportunity to express my regret that the Federal Government has not provided funding to support local government in its hosting of these ceremonies. I consider it is most inequitable for local government to have to provide the necessary finance for what is primarily a Federal responsibility. Municipalities are required to pay for the overtime for council officers who are needed to provide services in support of the ceremony and to pay for the refreshments which help to make the occasion friendly and hospitable. Many of the ceremonies I have attended are imaginative and colourful and are a credit to local government. However, if funding were provided by the Federal Government, citizenship ceremonies could be made even more memorable as one of the most important events in the life of Australian migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also been most impressed with the fact that one of the officials of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in my area, Mr George Mohrene, has been prepared to give of his free time to officiate at citizenship ceremonies in the City of Knox and the Shire of Lilydale. I trust that the Minister will look into the funding matter as the amount of necessary finance would not be large and would serve to improve the quality and character of citizenship ceremonies. </PARA>

I do not even like talking about the Asians any more because I think we are all Australians. Both sides of this House will never agree philosophically on certain aspects. But I think we should start to think and talk about everyone in Australia being the same. Is not one of the Commandments: 'Love thy neighbour'? But a lot of the people in Australia are very confused at the moment. We are all not the same and do not treat people the same. We all say nasty things about people and so on. That attitude seems to have intruded into this debate. We seem to think that we can be better, we can run people down, we can hide under a shroud of hypocrisy, we can say things to hurt other people and then back off when it suits us.

They start flashing left, right and centre about causes. All of a sudden they are involved in an argument about which they know very little. Before we knew where we were we had changes in Tasmania that we did not want. To be truthful, I get confused about what happens in the Labor Party. I think that we should do what it does a bit more because if we did we would get more publicity. The Labor Party has the Left, the Right, the Centre and the up and down the middle group, whatever that faction is called. There are factions of the Labor Party everywhere. Members of the Labor Party seem to jump on a bandwagon and confuse the rest of Australia. When we start to say that we love Australia as it is, that there have been problems over the years but we have developed our country in the way we want it, we find all of a sudden one group of honourable members opposite jumping up and saying: 'We do not like the flag'. When asked what is wrong with the flag they say: 'We do not like it. We want a change because somebody said we should change the flag'. Then honourable members opposite start talking about wanting to change the oath of allegiance. They want to take this out and take that out. When one asks who wants to do this they say: 'That is what the feeling is out in the community'. I never get that feeling.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment to the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill moved by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman). I join with my colleagues in opposing many, but not all, of the changes proposed in this Bill. This is a Bill about citizenship and fundamentally my objection to it is that it cheapens Australian citizenship. It makes it quicker, after a two-year residence rule instead of three, to become a citizen. It makes it easier as far as the English language requirement is concerned to become a citizen. It also makes it drabber to become one by the new pledge of allegiance. Quickness, easiness and drabness are not in my view desirable characteristics for Australian citizenship. It may be cut-price citizenship, no-frills citizenship, the cheapest citizenship in the world, but not what we traditionally think of as Australian citizenship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian citizenship has never been very hard to get for those seriously interested in it. Our requirements have been generous and not particularly strict, especially when compared with almost all other countries in the world. The requirements should be generous in a country built on migration from all parts of the world</PARA>
<PARA> But is the three-year rule so onerous, so oppressive, that it should be cut by one year? No other comparable country bestows citizenship after two years. Can anyone seriously believe that a person has a feeling for, or a real loyalty to, a country after two years of living in it? The honourable member who last spoke on the Government side, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton), said that he thought it was sufficient time. In effect, he said the quicker the better. I cannot see why if the honourable member is happy to reduce it to two years he does not reduce it to one year or one week for that matter. I do not believe that two years is an adequate test. If we really value Australian citizenship perhaps we should discuss lengthening the three-year rule rather than shortening it. I am not advocating that, but shortening it seems to me to smack of wanting to enrol people as citizens or as voters willy-nilly without giving due weight to what is a desirable period of residence before someone can seriously assume the privileges and the duties of Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, why dilute the requirement for an adequate knowledge of English to simply a basic knowledge of it? I put to one side the special case of elderly people and willingly go along with the Bill in relation to them. But citizenship surely requires more than a basic knowledge of the common tongue. A basic knowledge is, I suppose, enough to buy food, to find one's way to work and home again; it is enough English to survive. But citizenship is participation in the full life of the country, in its old and deeply established institutions, its political life, and its administration of justice. Even before the new basic English test has been introduced, we have all heard of jury cases where a citizen juror could not understand the evidence yet was trying to pass judgment. Is justice well administered when a juror has only basic English? Surely not! As politicans we have all come across cases of citizen voters who cannot read English well enough to understand the ballot paper instructions or the how-to- vote card and who rely on interpreters. This is surely not what we mean by citizenship, unless we have a contemptuous view of citizens as mere ballot fodder. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the proposed new pledges, they have about them as much solemnity as a landlord and tenant lease or a bill of sale. The 1973 oath says:</PARA>
<PARA> I, . . . renouncing all other allegiance, swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>The affirmation substitutes for 'swear by Almighty God', 'solemnly and sincerely promise and declare'. This oath and this affirmation have some resonance about them. The language is appropriate to a solemn and moving occasion as should be the adoption of Australian citizenship. It places our constitutional monarchy and its associated institutions at the centre of the matter. Now it is proposed that the applicant pledge:</PARA>
<PARA> I . . . renounce any current citizenship and all allegiance to any State other than Australia. I pledge that I will faithfully uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an alternative form of pledge corresponding to the old affirmation. These pledges have as much solemnity as a hire-purchase agreement. I think, incidentally, reference to the Constitution is gratuitous, even devious. I suppose it allows the Government to say that it has deleted explicit reference to the constitutional monarchy but that it is still there really because such reference is in the Constitution. There is an American suggestion about it too. We know that American citizenship is a very serious matter, but the American association here is misleading. The American constitution with its famous amendments, the Bill of Rights and the Supreme Court judgments is a very different thing from our comparatively bread and butter Constitution. Pledging allegiance to one is quite a different matter from swearing allegiance to the other. The legal basis of our freedoms is expressed in different ways. </PARA>
<PARA> A migrant interested in citizenship who on reading the pledge of allegiance looks up the Australian Constitution to find out what it is all about is in for a shock as he reads about everything from lighthouses and fisheries to section 92 and section 96. An ordinary citizen, unlike a High Court judge, does not swear to uphold the Australian Constitution in the way an American might swear to uphold the principles of the American Constitution. If this is really meant as a way of implicitly working in the monarchy, it would be better to do it openly as in the 1973 oath and affirmation. </PARA>
<PARA> Some measures in this Bill have my support. For example, the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the Minister's decision is a worthwhile measure. There are others. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer him to the report in this morning's Age newspaper that the idea of a censorship hotline being established between his Press office and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation was discussed at a meeting between the Prime Minister and the Managing Director of the ABC, Mr Geoffrey Whitehead. I ask: Who raised the idea of such an obnoxious censorship hotline in those talks? How could the Prime Minister even consider by way of discussion an idea clearly directed at censorship of the Press and the management of news and comment on the national broadcasting network? In view of his previous attacks on the ABC and other media , will the Prime Minister give an assurance to the public that he is not proposing to manage news broadcasts on the ABC and thereby threaten the independence of that body?</PARA></TALK.START>

On Friday of last week, at the request of Mr Whitehead, the General Manager of the ABC, I, together with my Minister for Communications, had a discussion with him. At that discussion Mr Whitehead was good enough to set out in very extended form the future plans-financial, administrative and conceptual-as far as the ABC was concerned. We found them very useful. In the context of that discussion the question was raised of certain criticisms that I had expressed, and I outlined to the General Manager some of the points of view I had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This fiction the Leader of the Opposition is raising about some form of censorship is an absolute nonsense. There has been no arrangement, nor would there be any, for the form of hotline that has been talked about. No such arrangement has been made or contemplated, nor will it be made. The situation is quite clear on the record. This Government in its 12 months in office has done more to assist the ABC and its independence than was done in the seven years of the previous Government. We remain totally committed to the independence of the ABC and we will do all we can to improve its capacity to deliver a very worthwhile service to the Australian community, without fear or favour from this Government and, if it was relevant, I would add 'or this Opposition'.</PARA>

<PARA> Government policies will help to worsen unemployment, which will rise significantly during the current financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>What in fact has happened is this: Unemployment, instead of rising significantly , as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said then and as the Opposition hoped would happen, has fallen from 10.4 per cent last September to 9.3 per cent in March. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, expressing the hopes of the Opposition, said on 8 September last year:</PARA>
<PARA> The latest job losses put at risk the Government's Budget objective of increasing employment by about 1.5 per cent over 1983-84.</PARA>
<PARA>The facts are these: A 1.5 per cent increase in employment would be about 90,000 jobs, but between June of last year and the present time we have created 186,000 new jobs, which is more than double the Budget target of 90,000. That is the caper of these people opposite. They do not want to look at the facts or recognise that the people of Australia have benefited from the policies of this Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I want to take the opportunity of putting the Opposition's approach to the Japanese beef market in the appropriate perspective so that even its own members may be able to understand the unbelievable hypocrisy which they are showing in this matter. The fundamental objective of this Government's negotiations with the Japanese authorities has been to maximise Australia's access to the Japanese beef market. That has been our public position; it has been our negotiating stance and all that we have said and done publicly and privately has reflected that concern. That position has been put by me, by Mr Bowen, by Mr Hayden and by Mr Kerin. That position will be maintained by Mr Kerin when further ministerial talks are held in Tokyo on 14 May. It is important to understand that what this Government is doing in negotiations with the Japanese is well understood by the Australian cattle industry, with whom the Government has been in regular contact on this matter. As distinct from this responsible attitude taken by the Government, the Opposition has made every effort to weaken and undermine Australia's negotiating stance and to work against the national interests of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want the Australian public to understand just what was the the achievement of the Opposition parties when they were in government because the problems of this country in regard to the Japanese beef market date back to the Strauss-Ushiba agreement of 1978. That agreement was signed on 13 January 1978.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have the dates wrong; it was 13 January 1978. Under the Strauss-Ushiba agreement Japanese imports of high quality beef were increased by 10,000 tonnes on a global basis, beginning in the Japanese financial year 1978. That increased their quota of 6,800 tonnes by another 10,000 tonnes. It is important to understand that the types of high quality beef specified effectively precluded Australian competition with United States suppliers. That has been disastrous for Australia ever since. What happened in those circumstances when this agreement was negotiated between Strauss of the United States and Ushiba of Japan? What was the attitude of the then Government? Not only did it meekly accept what was negotiated between the United States and Japan but also it applauded it. A Press release of the then National Party Minister for Trade and Resources, dated 14 January-the following day-said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . welcomed indications of a settlement of a number of outstanding trade issues between the United States and Japan.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make it quite clear on behalf of the Government that we are disturbed by any actions in the area which are likely to disturb further the situation in that country and in respect of which, as distinct from the noises made by the Opposition, my Foreign Minister has been actively dedicating himself , in discussions with countries in the region, to trying constructively to bring about a more harmonious situation. We have done that consistently from the time that we have been in government. I must say that the efforts which have been made by the Foreign Minister, Mr Hayden, have met with universal approbation because they have not been concerned with cliches and platitudes but have been concerned with trying to talk constructively with all the countries in the region. Neither the Foreign Minister nor I welcome any offensive action in that area. Mr Hayden will be going to the region in a matter of two or three weeks, where he will inform himself directly through discussions with people in a position to know of the precise nature of the operation, and I am certain that he will say then, and when he comes back, what we have consistently said as a government-that we do not welcome any offensive action by any groups in this area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the implications of yesterday's excellent consumer price index result for wage movements this year and for the prospects of income tax cuts in the August Budget?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1636" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As suggested by the honourable member in his question, it was indeed an outstanding CPI result for the March quarter. The Acting Treasurer made it quite clear in his official statements yesterday that the outstanding result in the March quarter did in part reflect the impact of Medicare. Even if we exclude the impact of Medicare, it should be understood that the rise in the CPI on an annual basis-the annual increase-was the lowest for over a decade. The simple fact is that this Government has reduced the underlying inflation rate in this country from the 11 per cent that it inherited to about 7 1/2 per cent a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Looking to the future in terms of the question that was put to me by the honourable member about the impact of the consumer price index on wage movements , there is still a further impact of the Medicare changes to be reflected in the next quarter. We understand this will be approximately 0.8 per cent. So in the June quarter we are looking at a small increase in the CPI. Quite clearly, the combined result of the March quarter and the June quarter CPI will be minimal. We will probably be looking at no more than about one per cent at the outside. What that means, and I am sure that this was in the mind of the honourable member when he asked the question, is that Australia is looking at a period of 12 months of virtually no wage movement as a result of the operation of the indexation system being related to these movements to which I have referred.</PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that with Australia now looking forward to about 12 months in which wage rises will be minimal, that will provide a very helpful breathing space for business. It will help profits to recover further, it will help new investment plans to go ahead and it will help the creation of even more jobs. Very importantly, and I know this is a matter of interest to the honourable member for Burke with his interest in manufacturing industry, it will mean that in 1984 real unit labour costs, which are a very important element in these considerations, will go back to what they were in the late 1960s and 1970s after having been way out of line in the period intervening. I hope that both sides of the House will welcome the statement made by the Australian Council of Trade Unions yesterday which made it clear that, in line with the accord, the ACTU will not seek compensation for Medicare induced reductions in the CPI. We, on this side of the House, applaud Mr Dolan and the ACTU for the responsible attitude which it has adopted. We will accept our obligation, as a Government, to proceed with income tax cuts in the Budget so that, again in line with the accord, we can ensure that wage restraint continues in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear when one looks at these facts and takes them into account- that is, the wage restraint that has been achieved, the very significant reduction in the inflation rate which has been associated with it, the very high rates of economic growth that have been achieved generally, particularly in the housing industry, and the significant reduction in non-seasonal interest rates in the period that this Government has been in office-with the significant growth in employment to which I have already referred, one will see that, under this Government, there has been a remarkable turnaround in the Australian economy. I suggest that Opposition members put that on the menu when they go to Thredbo. It will give them something to think about and contrast with their own dismal past performance and the hopelessly irrelevant so-called policies that they have for the future.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EV4">Mr YOUNG</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. For the information of the honourable member for Boothby, we did try to get some semblance of sanity in the amount of money which government invests in advertising and market research. As members of the Opposition know, when they left office they were spending something like $24m a year on advertising and market research, and on many special programs such as the 1982 Budget, for which I think it was left to the honourable member for Balaclava to carry the can. He had to go out and suggest that the best way to present that Budget was to spend a couple of million dollars on television and radio advertising. I might add that that occurred during the Flinders by-election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, where departments do have claims for carrying out research, which in most cases we insist upon before any money is spent on advertising, so that the money is spent in the professional way in which other people using advertising and market research would use it, their request goes through a committee, which originally consisted of myself, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism. A ministerial order has been altered, and the Australian Government advertising has now been shifted to the public information section of my Department.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations whether his attention has been drawn to reports that some union officials have stated their intention to campaign for a catch-up of real wage reductions which occurred during the wages pause. Is the Government concerned about the prospects of such a campaign?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1639" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT & INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the statements that have been made by some union officials, particularly Mr Clancy of the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia and Mr Carmichael of the Amalgamated Metals, Foundry and Shipwrights Union. Both of these gentlemen have expressed the view that there is a need to catch up for the real wage reductions during the period of the wage pause and that there is a need for some campaign to that effect. The question asked whether the Government was concerned about these statements. We would be if they were to result in a campaign for wage claims outside the indexation system. Such a campaign would be contrary to Government policy. It would be contrary to the policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It would be contrary to the wage fixation principles of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and it would most certainly be contrary to what is needed to maintain our extraordinarily high rate of economic and employment growth-the highest rate of growth in the Western industrialised world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say emphatically that, for several reasons, I do not expect that such a wages campaign outside indexation will eventuate. Firstly, the prospect of a small national wage rise in October has been well known since the prices and incomes accord was finalised early last year between the then ALP Opposition and the ACTU. It has been known since that time and repeated on many occasions that that would be the case. Mr Dolan's statements yesterday and this morning confirm that it remains the ACTU's position that it accepts that outcome. Secondly, the ACTU has stated many times that catch-up considerations can be pursued in the context of taxation relief rather than by way of wages. That concept is built into the accord. It has been reiterated again by Mr Dolan on behalf of the ACTU since yesterday's consumer price index figures came out. Thirdly, as Mr Carmichael has indicated, it is not his union's position to go outside the accord in pursuing a catch-up and that is the ACTU's position. When the ACTU wages committee meets on Friday week I am quite sure that that position will be confirmed once again on behalf of the whole trade union movement. Fourthly, as the Prime Minister said yesterday in Question Time and again today, the Government will be doing all in its power to give significant tax cuts in the forthcoming Budget. The Government will be discussing the scope for tax cuts with the ACTU in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA> There is every reason to believe that the wages policy of the accord and of the Commission will be maintained and that the wages outcome for the rest of this year will be a very small national wage rise in October which, along with some increases coming through the anomalies aspect of the wage fixation principles, should still result in an overall wage increase in the course of this calendar year of around 5 per cent. It may be slightly more; it may be less. The level of real labour unit costs, as the Prime Minister indicated previously, will be back to the level of a decade ago, for the first time in a decade, by the end of this year. Such an outcome is conducive to a continued decline in our rate of inflation and a continued improvement in our level of international competitiveness and very conducive to the creation of an environment which is highly conducive to an increase in private investment.</PARA>
<PARA> In short, I say to the honourable member for Macquarie that there is no need to be alarmed by the statements which got much prominence in this morning's Press, or, in the case of the Opposition, to be overjoyed by those statements. The fact is that those concerns being expressed by those trade union officials are capable of being resolved without damaging the accord, the wage fixation system or the economy of this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to the media this morning and a telephone report I have had, the Premier of New South Wales has suggested that it was I who designated the various areas of New South Wales which the Commonwealth Government, in accordance with its constitutional powers, will consider for defence purposes. The areas were not designated by me. They were designated for preliminary investigation-I stress preliminary investigation-as a result of consultations between my predecessor, the Minister assisting my predecessor and the Premier. They were then investigated within the context of determining the requirements of the Department of Finance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason there was no release of the Press statement was that I did not accept that they should proceed beyond that preliminary investigation until a number of matters had been concluded, including whether there should be a coincidence of the artillery range with the other facilities required for the purposes of the Department of Defence. I did not accept that the areas, in particular the Bathurst-Orange and the Barraba-Bundarra-Uralla regions should be proceeded with if it would mean that large areas of productive agricultural land would need to be acquired compulsorily. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premier is totally wrong in his assertion that I had designated those large areas of agricultural land.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last two days this Parliament and the Australian public have been treated to the best examples yet of the extent and the degree to which the present Australian Government is prepared to live politically in the short term at a medium and longer term cost to the economic management of Australia. It is worth recalling that a certain political figure in Australia had this to say on 15 February 1983 during the last Federal election campaign: 'Under my government parliaments will run their full time'. They were the words of the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), then the Leader of the Opposition, making it perfectly clear that under governments which he led parliaments would run their full time. Everybody knows how very quickly that particular commitment was thrown by the Prime Minister on to the scrap-heap. Everybody knows that less than a year after that statement was made the Prime Minister was blithely announcing that as far as he was concerned he thought it appropriate that there be an election in Australia some time between December 1984 and March 1985. So in less than a year that particular commitment of the Prime Minister, given unambiguously and unequivocally, was thrown on to the scrap-heap.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one looks at the state of the Australian economy; if one looks at the economic policies of this Government; if one looks at the way in which this Government has manipulated the consumer price index, one is reminded again and again of how short term this particular Government's horizons are. It may be clever politics to claim all of the credit for the improvements which have occurred in the Australian economy over the last year. It may be clever politics for the Prime Minister to come in here, as he did at Question Time, and say that the reduction in the rate of inflation, even if one leaves out the Medicare fiddle, was still a very creditable performance and to lay all the credit for that on the Government's own economic policies. That may be clever politics. It may fool a lot of the people at present but the Prime Minister knows as well as does everybody on this side of the House that the two factors over the last year which have made the greatest contribution to a reduction in the underlying rate of inflation have been the wages pause of the last Government and the natural effects of a recession on prices and costs in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the prices and incomes accord so far has made no contribution at all to the reduction in either the CPI or the underlying rate of inflation that we have experienced in Australia. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis), in defending the prices and incomes accord to the trade union movement, has argued that if it had not been for the accord, wage increases over the last year would not have been as high as in fact they have been. So far from the policies of the Government, far from the prices and incomes accord being the main reason that Australia's rate of inflation has experienced a welcome reduction, that particular element has not played a major part at all. I repeat: It may be clever politics of the Prime Minister to claim that everything that has happened over the last year-including, on occasions when he gets totally expansive, the breaking of the drought-has been due to the policies of the Government. But because those claims are untrue, although it makes perhaps smart political sense in the very short term, in the medium and longer term the Government will rue many of the statements that have been made by the Prime Minister and by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) over the last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister waxed very eloquent today about the question of employment and unemployment. It is very interesting to look at the speeches of the Prime Minister over the last year and see how little he has spoken about unemployment. One remembers when he was the Opposition spokesman on employment matters in this House. One remembers that every day he was talking about the capacity of a Labor government to reduce unemployment in Australia. Every day the then spokesman on industrial relations was saying that if the policies of the Australian Labor Party were allowed to take effect, they would bring about a sharp reduction in unemployment. The fact is that over the last year, and notwithstanding what the Prime Minister has said, there has been a reduction of only 33,000 in the total number of unemployed in Australia, despite what the Prime Minister and his colleagues so euphorically refer to as Australia's greatest ever economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is pushing the issue of unemployment further down the agenda of action so far as its policies are concerned. Its only weapon in fighting unemployment is to pump more and more money into public sector job creation schemes. When a report winds up on the desk of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations pinpointing the problems of youth unemployment and the contribution made to it by high youth wages, what does he do? He pigeonholes the report. He does not even supply copies of it to the Premiers of this country at the Premiers Conference because it does not fit his ideology for dealing with the question of unemployment. Again and again we find that the Government is living for the short term and maximising the political advantage of the fortuitous turnaround in conditions resulting from the breaking of the drought and the wages pause. It is taking all the short term political gains at a very considerable medium and longer term economic cost to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members really want to find a mature, sober and pragmatic judgment on what the investors of this country think about the medium and longer term economic prospects in Australia let me draw their attention to the latest set of forecasts of private sector investment which have been produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Let me remind them in doing this that only 20 minutes ago the Prime Minister of this country said in this House that the March quarter consumer price index increase, even if we leave the Medicare fiddle out of it, is the lowest for almost a decade. I remind him that under his Government private sector investment in the next financial year is forecast by the Bureau of Statistics to be the lowest in Australia for over 10 years. If one looks at those figures one finds a very gloomy and dismal pattern of private sector investment. I remind the Acting Treasurer (Mr Hurford), who is at the table, and the Prime Minister that the Government cannot go on forever creating jobs through the public sector. Sooner or later, if we are to have a lasting economic recovery in Australia and if we are to do other than live completely for the short term the Government will have to bring about a private sector revival. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister at the table and the Government why it is, if their economic policies are so wonderful and are bringing about the economic recovery they speak of and if they are presiding over this wonderful economic miracle in Australia, that the investors of Australia so lack confidence in the medium and longer term economic future of Australia. Why is investment in the mining industry in a parlous condition? Why have the mining industry, the National Farmers Federation, the merchant banks and the building societies all gone to the Government in recent days and said that the outlook for private sector investment is very gloomy? Why are they not bedazzled by what the Prime Minister treated us to at Question Time today? Why are they not enchanted by the latest CPI result? Why are they not absolutely persuaded by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations that his wages policy is the answer to all our problems ? There is a crisis of confidence in the medium and longer term economic future of Australia by its investors. These forecasts demonstrate that more than any other statistic that can be produced on either side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, we have an example of the Government living for the short term. A report in the Hobart Mercury at the weekend states that the Prime Minister has instructed all his Ministers to push aside any difficult or unpopular decisions until after the end of the year. Of course, the Prime Minister wants to create the optimum political situation for the entirely unecessary premature election that he will have at the end of the year. I was very interested to see the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations wriggle a bit at Question Time today when he was taxed with what Mr Clancy of the Building Workers Industrial Union had said on radio this morning. He said that the left wing unions would start a campaign, beginning next October, to bring about catch-up in respect of the wages that they lost during the wages pause. The Minister in answer to a question on that subject said: 'Do not worry about that, listeners. We will give a tax cut that will buy them out of any opposition'. The only problem with that answer is that the tax cut will come in August and Mr Clancy will start his campaign in October. What will the Government do if the campaign starts in defiance of its wishes? Will it cancel the tax cut it gave in August if the campaign starts in October? The Minister knows quite well that his capacity to control Mr Clancy is no greater than the capacity of many other people in the Australian Council of Trade Unions to control that gentleman. </PARA>
<PARA> What this Government has done on every political and economic issue over the last 12 months is maximise its short term political advantage to the medium and longer term cost of Australia. It has put off a decision on the assets test but it has not removed the threat of an assets test over the head of every pensioner in Australia. It has not introduced the legislation to give effect to its lump sum superannuation proposals but it has not removed the threat to the non- taxability of lump sum superannuation payments. It has promised a reform of the Australian taxation system but it has not said that it will not introduce a capital gains tax and the Prime Minister continues to allow senior Ministers to canvass publicly and argue for a capital gains tax. Again and again the Government puts off the difficult decisions, hoping the electorate will not be reminded of them and hoping that they will not be in the mind of the electorate when we go to the polls at the end of the year. It knows all along that if it is successful those difficult, unpalatable decisions will be back on the table, back on the Government's agenda for implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will wager that this Government will go to the election at the end of this year without any policy in the area of taxation. In reply to our questions on where the Government's taxation policy is the Prime Minister says: 'We are having a bit of a discussion with the Economic Planning Advisory Council about it. We will talk to EPAC about it. We will talk to everybody and we will produce a fair and equitable taxation system'. That will not be a tax policy or an answer to people who want to know whether we will have a broad-based indirect tax, a capital gains tax or a wealth tax. That will be no answer to the older people of Australia who want to know exactly what will happen with the assets test. Does the Prime Minister know that the elderly in this nation are living in fear of the assets test he has talked about? Does he realise what uncertainty is being created for that section of our community because of his short term political tactics? It would be far fairer to those people to say now what he will do and to tell them exactly what will happen with their pensions rather than adopt the shameful and politically inspired device of empanelling a group of citizens to give a report to the Government. The Government ought to come clean and say exactly what it will do about the assets test. It ought to come clean about all the other things but, as in all its other economic decisions, the Government is living entirely for the short term. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has claimed credit for every good thing that has happened with the economy over the last year. It has failed to recognise that the two major contributions to the improvement over the last year have been totally beyond its control or encouragement-the breaking of the drought and the beneficial effects of the wages pause. Neither of those things had anything to do with the prices and incomes accord. In no way did the prices and incomes accord contribute to either of those developments. They have contributed, more than anything else, to the improvement over the last 11 months. The Government knows that it must get to the polls before a realisation reaches the Australian community of the problems that it will have in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 the Australian community will be forced to pay the price of so many decisions having been deferred in 1984. In 1985 the lack of private sector investment could have a very drastic effect on unemployment levels. In 1985 the level of unemployment will be no lower than it was in March 1983. By 1985, according to the Government's own forecast, the underlying rate of inflation will be going up again. The Government cannot have another Medicare fiddle in 1985 any more than it can break the drought again in 1985 and the Government will face that problem also. In 1985 the full effects of the worst investment strike that this country has had for over 10 years will be brought home to the Australian community. In the manufacturing industry employment levels are lower than they were in March 1983. The honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous) knows better than anybody else in this House that those grim realities will be brought home to the Australian people. It is no wonder that this Government and this Prime Minister are quite irresponsibly and totally living for the short term political advantage and nothing else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What an appallingly weak matter of public importance this is! The Liberal and National parties failed this country miserably in the seven years of their stewardship. They have egg all over their faces. All the noise of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, does not make up for good argument. Now that the alternative policies of the Hawke Labor Government are working this discredited Liberal- National Party Opposition is retreating into the sort of diatribe we have just suffered in listening to the speech of the shadow Treasurer over the last quarter of an hour. Members of the Opposition are jealous of the fact that this country is on the road to recovery. Let me go briefly through some statistics, which I will later refer to in detail. Gross domestic product is expected to increase by 6 per cent in the 1983-84 financial year. We expected in the Budget only a 3 per cent increase. That was a heck of a lot better than the present Opposition achieved during its seven years of failure in its stewardship of the management of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The employment figures from September 1983 to mid-1984 have improved incredibly . Let me go over those figures. In September 1983 unemployment peaked at 10.4 per cent, whereas in mid-1984 we are now down to an unemployment rate of 9.3 per cent. But that is not nearly as good as the figures for the growth of employment itself. From April 1983 to March 1984 we had an increase in the number of jobs of 210,500. Manufacturing production was up 4 per cent in the December quarter of 1983 compared with the March quarter of 1983. In the three months to February 1984 motor vehicle registrations were up 6.4 per cent on those for the previous quarter. We also find that interest rates are generally down on those of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Having suffered a few years in which we had an adverse balance of trade, we find that in the nine months to March 1984 there was a balance of trade in our favour of $356m compared with an adverse balance of trade of $944m in the nine months to March 1983. No wonder the Opposition is ashamed of its discredited economic policies. No wonder members of the Opposition come in with the sort of speech that we had to listen to in this House today, trying to make up for the fact that the alternative economic policies are working. They are jealous of the fact that we were able to bring this country together at the National Economic Summit Conference and that we have been able to create more consensus and to get people to work together to a greater degree than we had during the last seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a period of confrontation under the Fraser Government. All the people now on the front bench of the Opposition are part of the discredited team which gave rise to that period of confrontation. Members of the Opposition are jealous of the fact that we have been successful in funding the deficit-successful to the extent that interest rates have declined over the year of that high deficit. We have been successful in reducing the effect of the deficit. Government spending has provided a stimulus to the economy. As I mentioned, 210,500 jobs have been created. Honourable members opposite are jealous of the fact that nearly all the statistics that one looks at show that this economy of ours has improved over the period in which this Government has been in office. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go over the speech, if we can give it that title, of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He commenced by talking about being misled in relation to the term of this Parliament. He overlooks completely that it was the Fraser Government, of which he was a leading member, which decided to go to the polls early and left us with a situation in which we have to have a Senate election before May 1985, causing an early Federal election. He overlooks that completely and suggests that we are going to the polls early. He went on to speak about the so-called manipulation of the consumer price index. That, I would say to him quite unashamedly, is an affront to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which has a job to do and which does that job independently. The Government took a conscious decision, following an election promise, to alter the health insurance charges. Of course the CPI has shown the effect of those health insurance alterations. But the Government does not claim credit just for the adjusted figures contained in the announcement yesterday in relation to the CPI. It claims credit in respect of the unadjusted figures for health insurance. I will also come back to that point later. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition then referred to the prices and incomes accord. Is he, in preaching doom and gloom, as he has today, seeking to break down that accord? Is he so lacking in feeling for this country and desire for it to have further economic recovery built onto that for the first year of our Government that he wants, by his preaching, to bring down that accord? Let him come clean and tell this House and the nation whether he wants that to happen. He is not making any constructive contribution whatsoever to the good government of this country in these difficult times which have been created mainly by the Fraser Government. He is merely taking cheap political points in the way I am now illustrating. </PARA>
<PARA> There is only one area in which his claims might be able to be substantiated and that is when it comes to breaking the drought. I plead guilty on occasions, in order to try to bring a little lightness into the affairs of this nation, to giving the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) credit for breaking the drought. If that is misleading the nation, that is the only claim to credibility of the matter of public importance before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to misleading the House, I shall point out how the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in his speech misled this House in relation to the employment figures. He is suggesting that there has been a reduction of only 33,000 in unemployment over the last 12 months and that responsibility for that should be driven home to this Government. That is an absolute piece of arrant nonsense. There is no way that the incoming Government could have been responsible for the unemployment levels of this country until about April of this year. The figures that I have given are credible and show that the growth in employment in this country from April 1983 until the present day has been of the order of 210,500. That is the figure that ought to be focused on. That is the only figure that would have given that part of his speech in this Parliament any credibility whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition even wants to knock the community employment program. I wonder whether he has ever taken the trouble to look at some of the CEP programs in his own electorate and seen the joy that has been given to young kids, particularly disabled kids, who have been out of work for at least six months and others for many years because at last they have been given a chance to show their mettle. The sort of speech that he made today is typical of the attitude of those conservatives with whom he sits inasmuch as they would want to deny these young kids the benefit that they received from the CEP. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to quote the sort of knocking words that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition used in his speech. He talked about an investment strike. Everything that this Government has done has been designed to build up the climate for investment to take place. In view of the legacy we were left, there was no way there could immediately be an investment climate. But now the growth in employment, the growth in confidence that has come out of the National Economic Summit Conference, the reduction in interest rates and the sorts of statistics that I have already outlined to this House relating to growth-gross domestic product is up 10 per cent on the minus 2 per cent applicable at this time last year-the growth in manufacturing production over the last few months, the growth in motor vehicle registrations, and the balance of trade turnaround are all necessary background factors to the increase in private sector investment which we can confidently expect. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bennelong even had the gall to mention that building societies were complaining about the present situation. No Minister in this Parliament has had a more continuous relationship with the building societies than I have. There is no group in the private sector in this nation which is more supportive of the housing policies we have instituted and of the way we have funded the Budget to enable them to lend money. This resolution of the Opposition is a sham. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ought to be absolutely ashamed of himself for bringing it to this Parliament. I will focus on why he, in particular, should be ashamed of himself. It is absolute hypocrisy for this discredited former Treasurer to claim that the Government is misleading the people when his own record is such that in February last year he deliberately misled the Australian people in order to save his Prime Minister's neck. For the purpose of an election he misled the people. He told us that the deficit figure in prospect was $6 billion. We all know that the real deficit inherited by this Government was $9.6 billion; that deficit made all the more difficult the task that we took over. It made our achievements all the more remarkable. </PARA>
<PARA> When the honourable member for Bennelong was Treasurer the inflation rate was 11.5 per cent; that was the figure for the last quarter for which he was responsible. Only a year later the underlying inflation rate is down to 7.6 per cent. Without any alterations or adjustments relating to health insurance the relevant figure for the last year is 7.6 per cent. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer the unemployment figure was 695,300, or 10 per cent. It is now down to 9.3 per cent. I just had the privilege of representing this country at meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The dominant view was that international recovery will strengthen and spread in 1984 . Instead of the doom and gloom we are hearing from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition these are the real facts that are known to people who have some idea of what is going on in the world. The real growth in industrial countries is 3.5 per cent compared with 2.25 per cent last year. The GDP forecast is for a rise of 5 per cent in the United States and 4 per cent in Japan. There is no evidence whatsoever that following from those sorts of results in the rest of the world a real increase in private investment in this country will not take place. The only things that could make that result go wrong are the doom and gloom attitudes which are being spread by this Opposition at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The good news for Australia is that there has been a strong economic pick-up in the first half of 1983-84. That should be translated into private sector investment. Our economic policy is now totally devoted to making sure that the recovery is not just temporary, but sustained. In summary, since the Hawke Labor Government came to office we have achieved much production and employment and proft figures are up. The rate of inflation and real unit labour costs are down and the economic situation is better than it has been for many years. Even blind Freddie can see that things have improved even if genial John fails to do so. There are so many positive factors. Strong private consumption expenditure ran well ahead of inflation over the last three months. As I said before, but it bears repeating, there is a lowering of interest rates at present. The pick-up in profits provides a very good starting point indeed for the recovery in investment. The growth normally strong in the first year of recovery in 1983-84 has been stronger than is usual and certainly stronger than was expected a year ago. I end as I commenced by saying that this is an appalling matter of public importance to bring to this House. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ought to be ashamed of himself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The word appalling is the appropriate word for the contribution of the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Hurford). This Government has spent all of its time since the election campaign and the National Economic Summit Conference, squandering the good fortune which has come this country's way in the last 12 months. I refer to the wage pause, the breaking of the drought and the minor recovery in the world economy. It has squandered the opportunities and continued to try to talk up the economy and to accuse us in the process of talking it down. We have a responsibility to the Australian people to ensure that the facts are known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inescapable facts to come from the Minister's contribution are these: First , there is no need for an early election-the Government could put to the people a referendum for a simultaneous election if it wished and go its full term, something the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has no intention of doing; the second inescapable point is that unemployment is not falling; the third is that there is an investment strike. For all the Government says about having created an environment in which investment can take place it has not created that climate; no one has confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I put some more facts before the Parliament to illustrate why that is so. Although jobs are certainly being created that was also so at various stages of the Fraser Government's term of office. The then Opposition said then that unemployment was not falling. The Opposition is now saying precisely the same: Unemployment is not falling. What is happening is that the creation of jobs is keeping up with the natural growth in the work force but, in fact, in its period of office the Government has reduced unemployment by only 0.7 per cent. At the same time Australian businesses had to absorb a compounded wages increase of 8.6 per cent. As well, there has been a dramatic increase in the on-costs in relation to the employment of people. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday's consumer price index figures really show that the CPI is a most inadequate way of measuring inflation. It is misleading to say, as the Government has said, that our inflation is now under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. In fact, the Prime Minister at least admitted today that it is running at something like 7.5 per cent which is, of course, well above the OECD average of 5.8 per cent. Thus we are still uncompetitive on world markets. Despite what the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) have said today, 17 or 18 unions, led by the Building Workers Industrial Union, are determined to get some catch-up in addition to whatever tax cuts are granted in August. Mr Clancy has said--</PARA>

<PARA> We want tax cuts which were promised in the Accord-</PARA>
<PARA>we have been told today they will be delivered-</PARA>
<PARA>and we want a restoration of the real value of wages which was also promised in the Accord. </PARA>
<PARA>We were told today that the Government hopes the Australian Council of Trade Unions wages committee will get things in order; we were not told that the Government will support employers in resisting the demands that Mr Clancy and the other 17 union leaders want to make outside the arbitration system in breach of their undertakings to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and in breach of the Accord. Government members cannot talk, as the Prime Minister has done, of reducing real labour unit costs when in fact we know that the on-costs are rising so dramatically. The Labor Government in Victoria recently produced what it called an economic blueprint. It was called 'Victoria. The Next Step', and it showed that labour on-costs, as a share of total hourly labour costs, have risen from 22 per cent in 1974 to 34 per cent in 1983. Of course, payroll tax has been increasing at a rate five times that of job creation in the past three years. This Government is sanctioning breaches of the accord while pretending that it is in place. It actually says that it is creating the climate for investment. It says it is funding its deficit, but it is funding it in such a way that it is deterring investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at what is happening on the industrial relations scene. First of all, there has been a protracted dispute at Broken Hill. It is no closer to settlement than it was a month ago. What has the Government said and what has it done with the Australian Council of Trade Unions to try to bring that to a close ? It has cut production down to 3 per cent. There are 2,700 miners currently out of work, and North Broken Hill Ltd has blamed its quarterly loss of $3.38m largely on the industrial disputes. Port Pirie is likely to have its smelter closed by Friday if that dispute is not settled. That means more loss of jobs and more damage to the economy. We have had a national two-week go slow by waterside workers. Yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen) indicated that he was unaware of that go slow, yet it is having a very damaging effect on our trade. Twenty-one ships, with cargoes worth an estimated $200m are tied up around the country. This is an extra claim in breach of the accord, in breach of undertakings that the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia made to the Arbitration Commission when it accepted the wage indexation package. </PARA>
<PARA> In Tasmania seven west coast mines are reported to have closed down over a wages issue. Other local industries dependent on the work and on the consumption of the miners are also being disrupted. There are 2,000 meat workers on strike throughout Victoria. A campaign of picketing and vandalism has delayed the loading of 120,000 sheep at Portland. Again, this is threatening Australia's $ 200m a year live sheep export trade. Mr Curran, the famous Secretary of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union in Victoria, has said that the campaign is aimed at making live sheep exports unprofitable. What will that do to the rural industries which are dependent on those exports?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6I4">Mr MACPHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is misleading the Australian people by trying to tell the public and the investors of this country that the accord is working. It is not working, and the Government is not doing anything to use its relationship with the ACTU in the accord to get those strikes lifted and the breaches of the accord rectified. So much for the self-regulation and the peer group pressure that the Government and the ACTU believe they can exercise. We have had the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association threatening industrial action over a 13 per cent pay claim by public servants. The Government does not appear to have dampened that in any respect, although it is the employer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then we have the infamous Parliament House project, about which more will be said later. What is important is that we recognise now that even in respect of this so-called superannuation claim for the new Parliament House and elsewhere in the country, the big companies are already being forced to pay $10 or $11 over the award. They are paying in breach of undertakings the building unions made to the Arbitration Commission in accordance with the accord. The unions are now being told that perhaps the Commission will not pass on the 4.1 per cent increase because they are in breach. Mr MacDonald, the Building Workers Industrial Union leader, is saying openly that the workers will take industrial action to get the 4.1 per cent increase if the Commission refuses to grant the rise automatically. He is also saying the is is enevitable that the so-called superannuation claim will flow on, and of course it is. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen what has happened with long service leave, which has been granted by State Acts of Parliament. It was meant to be confined to the building industry, but now anyone working on a building site, even if he is simply installing windows, gets long service leave. Of course when he goes back to the factories whence he came, he then has different conditions from other people. It is then a simple matter for the provision to flow through to everybody else. So every maintenance fitter and every electrician on a building site get what the building workers get in superannuation, long service leave or whatever. They go back to their factories and when they are working with their peers they get the same, under the pressures that exist within our structure for comparative wage justice. </PARA>
<PARA> This is all in breach of the accord. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has received a report for the week ending 13 April. Eighty-five industrial disputes were major enough to be notified to his Department. Twenty- one of those are in breach of the accord and in breach of the no extra claims undertaking signed by the unions. That is how much the written undertakings mean to the trade union movement and that is how much the accord means. It is a phoney. That is where the public is being mislead. The accord is not working. Even if it were, wage indexation is not wage restraint. The Government has not used its goodwill, it has not used the National Economic Summit Conference to get across the message that wage restraint means that wages can be increased only in line with productivity improvement. An increase in price does not indicate a capacity to pay wages, especially when so much of the price increase is due to government charges, federal and State, which themselves are in breach of the spirit of the Summit communique. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can there be a greater example of the panic which has seized the discredited Opposition forces than this matter of public importance? At a time when the economy has shown distinct and positive signs of recovery we have attempts by the Opposition deliberately to reduce confidence in business and in the community by creating false alarms. In this matter of public importance the Government is accused of misleading the Australian people in relation to the state of the economy. That was a cheap remark, unworthy of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) . (Quorum formed) Madam Deputy Speaker, I do not know what the Opposition is afraid of that it has to call a quorum to cut my time. I point out again that this Government has been more open, more consultative and more ready to accept advice on the economy and on industrial matters than any government since the war. I know that this is true because I have been involved in many discussions with industry and trade union leaders in which the Government has been very frank about both the achievements and the problems which remain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is completely dishonest for the Opposition to claim that we have in any way tried to mislead the people in relation to the monumental problems we have been facing. The question that arises is this: Who created the monumental problems? In one year 250,000 people became unemployed. This is the record of the people opposite. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition had the cheek to mention the manufacturing industry, in which 100,000 jobs were lost over two years under his stewardship. This is the sort of thing that has been happening. He says: 'Well, manufacturing employment has not gone up as much as it ought to have gone up and investment has been slower than it ought to have been'. In regard to both of those matters the fact is, as he knows, that it takes a long time to create confidence and to turn the situation around from the discredited policies of the previous Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that any honest person must accept that the Government's record in relation to economic recovery is remarkable. Of course there were certain external factors, such as the drought, but the Opposition has refused to give credence to the stimulatory policy of the Government, to the change in economic policy. One would think, from listening to the former Treasurer, that there has been no change in economic policy and that all that happened was that the drought broke and his discredited wages pause came into effect. The fact of the matter is that the Government has put down a completely different philosophy and policy in relation to the economy from that which existed before, and that policy is working. </PARA>
<PARA> Has the Opposition learned any lessons from this? Not at all. I see that the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Macphee) has left the House. Indeed he might , because he is about the only one left in the Opposition who has any reasonable position left. The rest of them have moved to the extreme right. We have a situation where even the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) had to say publicly that it was time for the Liberal Party to look again because it has moved so far to the right that it has fallen off the precipice. That is the situation, and who has led members of the Opposition into it? This gentlemen here, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who is the real power in the Liberal Party at present. He has led them to adopt even more extreme and more discredited policies than the ones which have failed in the past. We ask for a reconsideration by the Deputy Leader. He is not a foolish man. We ask him to do something which socialists are used to doing, that is, to partake in self- criticism. How about a little self-criticism from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition? How about his looking at the suffering which his regime created and asking himself why this happened and whether there is some alternative, instead of giving us this ridiculous Liberal Party policy on the economy document which was described by several editorials as absurd. One said it is an amazing document. Indeed, it is amazing. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Deputy Speaker, can you imagine what a solution it would be for the industry problems of this country to sell off the Australian Industry Development Corporation? This is the Opposition's solution to the problems of manufacturing industry. I particularly ask how the policy got through the National Party of Australia, which has obviously lost its way because at least on one point, in regard to giving some support to the manufacturing industry, the National Party did have some basis for a policy. The fact of the matter is that the AIDC was established by Sir John McEwen in order to help plug gaps in industry where private sector investment was down. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Howard" NAMEID="ZD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that point. The honourable member says that private sector investment in manufacturing is down, so his solution is to get rid of the AIDC so there cannot be any public sector investment, either. That is the kind of solution to the problems of the manufacturing industry that he puts up. If that were to happen, does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition think business confidence would be re-established? The AIDC plays a very positive role in joint ventures with private enterprise and because of that it gives to private enterprise more confidence to invest. The honourable member for Bennelong talks about getting investment confidence back on the rails but he does not have a clue about how to do that. That is his problem. He seems to think that, no matter what the impirical evidence and no matter what the suffering in this country, he knows all the answers. Even if the facts are staring him in the face he refuses to re-analyse and re-examine his philosophical position. Let me say to him that it does not really matter when the election is held; he will be out of power for a long time while he persists with that position. It is about time he realised that we live in a mixed economy . He talks about the huge public sector in this country but it is one of the smallest public sectors in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, so what is he talking about? Why does he want to reduce the public sector even further? Is it nothing more than ideological blinkered nonsense?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This whole policy document is so thin that anyone who objectively reads it would know that any group that pretends to go into an election with it must be the thinnest and most discredited group that has ever tried to put anything before the Australian people. It has nothing in it; all it does is attack the Hawke Government's general philosophical strategy on the economy and make claims which are totally wrong. The fact of the matter is that if there had not been an expansionary Budget we would not have been able to pull out of the recession in the way we have. Even Malcolm Fraser realised that right at the end and overrode the former Treasurer in trying to get something done, but it was too late. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to make two separate amendments to the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981. The Act determines the amount of general purpose payments to the States in the forms of tax sharing grants and identified health grants until 30 June 1985 and provides for the distribution of the total amount of those grants among the States. The two amendments proposed in this Bill are designed, firstly, to give effect to an agreement with the States, made in the context of the negotiation of the Medicare agreements, that general purpose payments to the States after 30 June 1984 would be reduced by amounts in respect of the operation of Commonwealth pathology laboratories not taken over by the States; and, secondly, to make provision for continuing the payment of general purpose assistance to the States after 30 June 1985 pending the enactment of new legislation to replace the existing Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The first amendment corrects an anomaly which goes back to a decision announced by the previous Government at the May 1981 Premiers Conference. At that time the Commonwealth announced its intention to transfer its pathology laboratory operations to the States. As a consequence, an amount was added to the States' tax sharing grants for 1981-82 and subsequent years to compensate them for this additional responsibility. With the exception of Western Australia, however, the States have not taken over the laboratories. The result has been that since 1981 -82 the Commonwealth has effectively funded the operation of the laboratories twice, both by direct funding and indirectly through the tax sharing grants. </PARA>
<PARA> At the June-July 1983 Premiers Conference the Commonwealth indicated its intention to remove the anomaly and it was agreed with the States that an appropriate adjustment would be made to apply from 1 July 1984. The Commonwealth 's original proposal was for the adjustment to be made to the Medicare compensation grants specified under the Medicare agreements with each State. Some States, however, indicated that they considered the adjustment to be a matter separate from the establishment of Medicare. The Commonwealth therefore agreed that the adjustment would be made instead to the identified health grants and Medicare agreements were subsequently concluded with all States on that basis. The amount of the adjustment to be made in 1984-85 comprises the amounts agreed at the Premiers Conference increased in accordance with the increase in the consumer price index in 1984-85. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the second amendment. The States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 requires that before payments under the Act cease on 30 June 1985 the Commonwealth shall consult with the States to review the provisions of the Act. The States have already been involved in the preparation of terms of reference under which the Commonwealth Grants Commission has commenced a review of the distribution of tax sharing grants amongst the States. The Commission's assessments will form an important element in the negotiation of new arrangements. The Commission is due to report by 30 March 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> As consultations with the States on new tax sharing arrangements could not be commenced in detail until after that time, it seems highly unlikely that new legislation to provide for general purpose payments to the States from 1 July 1985 could be introduced into the Parliament until the Budget session of 1985. The amendment now proposed will allow the Treasurer to continue the regular payment of general purpose assistance to the States beyond 30 June 1985 until new legislation comes into force. Payments may be made during the six months from 1 July 1985, with the amount payable being limited to half the amount paid to each State in the previous year. Similar provisions have been made in other legislation involving regular payments to the States including the States (Works and Housing) Assistance Act 1983. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give legislative effect to changes to the income equalisation deposits scheme, first announced in the economic statement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to the Parliament of 19 May 1983. Further ministerial announcements on 16 June 1983 and on 23 August 1983 expanded upon the proposed nature of those changes. The income equalisation deposits scheme, as amended, will have no taxation consequences other than the taxation of interest as income . The Government decided to remove the scheme from the tax system to prevent the possibility of its use for tax avoidance and so as to make the benefits accruing from the scheme more evenly available to all primary producers. The old arrangements had a degree of inequity in that producers on the highest marginal tax rate, that is, on the highest incomes, benefited most. </PARA>
<PARA> As the provisions of the new scheme have been well publicised already and as the details of the Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Amendment Bill 1984 are explained in detail in a memorandum which I have arranged to be circulated, I shall confine my comments to outlining the broad features of the amended scheme. The aim of the scheme is to encourage primary producers to deposit moneys in years when their incomes are high so as to provide funds which can be drawn when incomes are lower. The incentive to make such deposits is an attractive interest rate, set quarterly at two percentage points above the short term Commonwealth Treasury bond rate. The eligibility criteria which determine whether this high rate is received on deposits will be broadly the same as under former arrangements. All primary producers, but only primary producers, are eligible for the higher rate. Deposits can be made up to a limit of a $250,000 deposit stock. Above that, they will not be eligible for the higher rate. In respect of any income year a primary producer may make new deposits which receive the higher rate of interest up to an amount equivalent to the lesser of 60 per cent of gross receipts from primary production in respect of that year and taxable income, other than income derived from property, in respect of that year. A deposit made at the higher rate will continue to receive that rate subject to the Commissioner of Taxation's confirmation of eligibility estimates and as long as the depositor continues in the business of primary production. </PARA>
<PARA> The determination of eligibility will be a two step procedure. The first step will be taken by the primary producer, self-estimating the eligible deposit level for his or her current income year. This allows primary producers to take advantage of a current high income year to make deposits at the attractive interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest payments in respect of new deposits will be based essentially on this self-estimation process. Provision is also being made, however, for the Commissioner of Taxation to provide an accurate assessment of the income of depositors and to provide that assessment to the administrator of the scheme, who is to be known as the authorised person. The authorised person will only need to make an adjustment to the interest entitlement of the depositor if the Commissioner's assessment effectively lowers the depositors' eligibility for interest payments at the high interest rate below the level which would otherwise be payable in respect of deposits actually made. Provision is being included to recoup any overpayments of interest which arise from overestimation by the depositor. Unwitting overestimation of income and deposit amounts will not be penalised, other than by recoupment. Furthermore, deposits made as a result of overestimates by primary producers will be able to be withdrawn without penalty immediately the Commissioner of Taxation's determination is known. However, overestimation and deposit with intent to defraud is an offence under the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for primary producer depositors to retain their ongoing entitlement to the high interest rate if they move in and out of primary production, or change primary production endeavours so long as they are not absent from primary production for a period exceeding 120 days. Of course, new deposits may be made after resumption of primary production beyond that period and they would receive the higher interest rate if the eligibility criteria were then satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment Bill provides that a depositor is required to notify the authorised person of the cessation of primary production business. Withdrawals from the scheme will be possible on a similar basis as in the past. That is, deposits may be withdrawn at any time after 12 months, or within that time on grounds of financial hardship. Hardship will initially be judged by the authorised person. If the depositor who is claiming hardship is dissatisfied with the initial judgment, he or she may approach the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a ruling. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of the new arrangements on the future levels of deposits and withdrawals is very difficult to project with any degree of accuracy. Deposits have been continuing to ease since 1982. There may have been some natural pause in deposit intake towards the end of, and immediately following, the drought and also during the period of transition between the new scheme coming into effect on 1 September 1983 and the application of this amending legislation. It will be necessary to observe the deposit performance over some period before accurate projections can be made about the longer term trend of deposits. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of interest payments will depend on the level of deposits and so they are also very difficult to project accurately. The interest rates applying to the new scheme have been higher than those offered under former arrangements. However unrecouped income tax deductions will be brought to account at the time of conversions and this will offset the cost on the Budget of the higher interest rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the new scheme has none of the characteristics which enabled depositors to avoid tax under former arrangements. The difference in administrative cost caused by the changed arrangements is expected to be small. </PARA>
<PARA> The new IED scheme has been designed to allow primary producers to deposit funds with the Commonwealth at interest rates higher, and conditions more favourable, than those on Commonwealth securities offered to the general public. This subsidy is intended to motivate primary producers to prepare for lean years but does not enable the wealthy to benefit more per dollar deposited, as did the former scheme. As such, this scheme should be particularly welcomed by smaller primary producers and those concerned with equity in our community. I commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is complementary to the Loan (Income Equalization Deposits) Amendment Bill 1984 which I have just introduced. In introducing that Bill I outlined the features of the new income equalization deposits scheme which has been developed by the Government and which will operate with effect from 1 September 1983. The new arrangements are far more equitable than the ones they replace and will better serve to encourage primary producers to make due provision for adverse seasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of this Bill are consequential upon amendments of the Loan ( Income Equalization Deposits) Act 1976 proposed by the earlier Bill. Their main purpose is to amend the income tax law to make changes to the taxation treatment of income equalisation deposits in harmony with the decision to replace the former tax incentive basis of the scheme with one based on the payment of attractive interest rates on deposits. Accordingly, deposits made after 1 September 1983 will carry no special tax consequences. In particular, the income tax deduction previously allowable for eligible deposits made within specified limits is to be terminated. </PARA>
<PARA> In outlining the provisions of the earlier Bill, I made it clear that, under the new arrangements, drought bonds and deposits made before 1 September 1983 may be transferred to the new scheme to enable depositors to take advantage of the special rate of interest payable under that scheme. Consistently with the basis on which income tax deductions were allowed under the former arrangements, where drought bonds or pre-1 September 1983 deposits are converted to the new scheme the amount so converted will be included in the depositor's assessable income of the year of income in which the conversion takes place. </PARA>
<PARA> Depositors who apply to convert to the new arrangements within 60 days after the Bill receives royal assent will, for these purposes, be taken to have done so on 1 September 1983. Of course, no amount will be required to be included in assessable income in respect of drought bonds or income equalisation deposits that did not qualify for deduction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also permit the Commissioner of Taxation and his officers to furnish relevant information contained in tax returns to authorised persons involved in the administration of the new IED scheme. This is necessary because eligibility criteria applying to depositors under the new scheme will continue to be based on tax related factors. A technical explanation of the Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum that is being made available to honourable members. I commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The main purpose of the Bill is to amend the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 to modernise the structure of the constituent banks of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation and to substantially improve the capital position of the Commonwealth Trading Bank. These amendments were decided upon following a major review of the financial structure and organisation of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation which was conducted by the corporation board and management and the Department of the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA> The structure of the Australian financial system has changed markedly since the Corporation banks were established under the Commonwealth banks legislation passed in 1959. The proposed changes are designed to place the Corporation banks in a position where they will be able to compete on a fully comparable basis with the major private banking and non-banking institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The main provisions of the Bill were foreshadowed in the Press release by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on 2 April 1984. A major aspect of the Bill provides for the Commonwealth Savings Bank to become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Commonwealth Trading Bank. At present, the Commonwealth Savings Bank and Commonwealth Trading Bank are separate public statutory bodies. Reorganisation on this basis will establish a structure similar to that of the private banking groups and will allow a more effective organisation of the resources of the two banks. This reorganisation will not change the basic functions of the Commonwealth Savings Bank. However, it should allow for an improvement in the range of the services offered by both the trading and savings banks. </PARA>
<PARA> Following from this reorganisation, the Bill also provides for the name of the restructured Commonwealth Trading Bank to be changed to the 'Commonwealth Bank of Australia'. This re-establishes the original name of the Commonwealth Bank when it commenced operations in 1912. The name of the Commonwealth Savings Bank will not be changed. The Bill also allows for the capital position of the Commonwealth Bank to be bolstered in order to strengthen its competitive ability and profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1983-84 Budget, the Treasurer announced that there would be an injection of $15m in additional capital into the Commonwealth Bank. This will be effected through the Bill. The Bill also provides for the transfer of $75m from the reserves of the Commonwealth Development Bank to the Commonealth Bank. The transfer of reserves from the Commonwealth Development Bank will still leave the Development Bank with a level of capital and reserves equivalent to the very high ratio of about one-quarter of its liabilities. I would emphasise that this transfer of reserves will not affect the current or prospective operations of the Development Bank. In addition to these measures, I would mention that the Board of the Corporation has also decided that the Corporation and its constituent banks will revalue premises to reflect current market valuations. This will have a substantial positive impact on the capital position of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the Government to increase the scope available to it in future to add to the capital of the Commonwealth Bank and the Savings Bank through allowing higher retained earnings. The existing statutory provisions require that half of the after-tax profits of the Commonwealth Trading Bank and half of the net profits of the Savings Bank be paid to the Commonwealth. The new provisions will introduce flexibility into the profit sharing arrangements and allow for dividend arrangements more broadly in line with the private banking groups. They provide for the proportion of net profits to be paid by the Commonwealth Bank to be determined by the Treasurer, with a maximum payment of 45 per cent of the net profits of the Commonwealth Bank and its savings bank subsidiary, the Commonwealth Savings Bank. The Savings Bank will pay a dividend to the Commonwealth Bank, and the amount of that dividend in any year will be determined by the Corporation Board. There will continue to be no dividend requirement on the Commonwealth Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes specific provisions relating to the present financial year, that is, prior to the main provisions of the Bill coming into effect. Those provisions provide that for the year ending 30 June 1984, the dividend payable to the Commonwealth by the Commonwealth Trading Bank and the Commonwealth Savings Bank shall be determined by the Treasurer but shall not represent more than 45 per cent of net profits. Under the present Act, the Commonwealth Savings Bank, the Commonwealth Development Bank and the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, but not the Commonwealth Trading Bank, have been exempt from Commonwealth company income tax. The Bill removes the exemption enjoyed by those banks. However, the Bill does provide for a rebate to be given for any profit sharing payments made by the Commonwealth Savings Bank under the State savings bank amalgamation agreements. Those payments are made on a pre-tax basis and to not provide a rebate would impose an unfair burden on the bank relative to its competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for a more flexible management and board structure for the corporation banks by removing the statutory general manager positions for the Trading Bank, the Savings Bank and the Development Bank and also the statutory executive committees of those banks. The statutory positions of Managing Director and Deputy Managing Director will however remain. The present Act imposes certain restrictions on the Corporation's employment of graduates. The Bill removes the present age limit and the restriction on numbers of graduates, and allows the Corporation to include graduates of colleges of advanced education and other tertiary institutions. I commend the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill 1984 to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>On Budget night I introduced into this House a Bill identical in all respects with this Bill. The Budget-night Bill was a revision of an earlier Bill introduced by my colleague the Minister for Finance (Mr Dawkins). Honourable members will recall that both those Bills were passed by this House but defeated in another place. The Bill I am now introducing is designed, as indeed was the Budget-night Bill, to give effect to this Government's election undertaking to recover personal tax avoided by former owners of companies that were the subject of bottom of the harbour schemes. In addition, the Bill proposes to strengthen and improve in several identified areas the legislation introduced by the Opposition parties in 1982 to recoup company tax that was evaded by the use of those schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, as I have said, the present Bill does not vary from the Budget-night Bill and I think it will suffice if I draw honourable members' attention to my second reading speech on introduction of that earlier Bill for an explanation of the main features of this Bill. In that second reading speech I also referred to an amendment of an evidentiary provision in the recoupment tax law that was being made for reasons connected with a constitutional challenge in the High Court of Australia to the validity of the legislation. The amendment proposed to vary the evidentiary provision so that a certificate by the Commissioner of Taxation specifying the amount of a company's liability to company tax would be prima facie, rather than conclusive, evidence. Honourable members will be aware that the High Court recently held unanimously that the substantive provisions of the recoupment tax legislation are constitutionally valid. All members of the Court, however, expressed views that the existing conclusive evidence provision might, at least in part, be invalid. The proposed amendment will ensure that the evidentiary provision is constitutionally valid in all respects. </PARA>
<PARA> By re-presenting the measures contained in the Budget-night Bill, the Government again demonstrates its determination to make every effort to give effect to its election commitments in relation to bottom of the harbour schemes. I now give notice that the Government is resolved to press this matter before the Senate and intends that the Opposition parties should stand and be counted by the Australian public for their obstructive attitude on anti-tax avoidance legislation. The measures contained in the Bill are estimated to yield $270m in total, and they deserve to be given the approval of the Parliament. As is usual with amendments of the taxation laws, an explanatory memorandum giving technical details of the amendments contained in the Bill is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of a Submarine Warfare Systems Centre, HMAS Watson, South Head, New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposal is for the construction of a new building at HMAS Watson for the Submarine Warfare Systems Centre, which provides operator training for the combat system of the Royal Australian Navy's Oberon class submarine force. HMAS Watson is located on South Head, Sydney, and is a training establishment providing advance courses in tactics, navigation, anti-submarine warfare and training on the fleet's weapons systems. The submarine warfare systems centre is located at HMAS Watson but existing facilities are inadequate and are unable to be extended to overcome present shortcomings and to meet the requirements of the latest weapons systems. Functions to be accommodated in the new facility are tactical development, training including simulators, computer facilities, technical support and administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal involves demolition of an existing structure and construction of a three-level building partly set into the site to minimise its height above ground level and impact on the skyline of South Head. The building will be of concrete construction with external finishes designed to match the colour and texture of the natural rock prominent in this area. The proposal has been discussed with State and local government authorities including the Woollahra Council and the New South Wales Department of Environment and Planning. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $3,340,000 at November 1983 prices. I table plans of the proposed work and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is twofold: First, and as a consequence of the Government's decision to provide departments with more flexibility in financial management, to enable the Minister for Finance to exercise a degree of discretion over expenditures to ensure that the greater flexibility so afforded to departmental heads is translated, as far as possible, into more effective and efficient management; and, secondly, to effect minor amendments to the Act in relation to the provisions related to the appointment of the Auditor-General, act of grace payments, audit fees and some machinery matters.</PARA>
<PARA> In connection with the primary purpose of the Bill, in December 1983 I advised the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations and each Senate Estimates committee of the Government's proposals to consolidate certain administrative appropriations from 1984-85 to permit improved and more flexible financial administration by departments. Those proposals were amplified in the paper I issued on 16 April 1984 entitled 'Budget Reform' and I draw honourable members' attention to Chapter 5-'Financial Management of Government Programs'-of that paper. </PARA>
<PARA> In keeping with the intentions I have foreshadowed, it is proposed that Schedule 2 of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1), 1984-85 will show, for each department, consolidated appropriations for each of 'Salaries and Payments in the nature of Salary' and 'Administrative Expenses'-that is, as a general rule, at the appropriation subdivision level-rather than the sometimes quite fine detail of proposed expenditures by item that has previously appeared. To enable the continued effective parliamentary scrutiny of departmental estimates, information provided to the Estimates committees on these consolidated votes will, for the time being, continue in essentially the same form and at the same level of itemised detail as in explanatory notes previously provided. However, as indicated in paragraph 3.18 of 'Budget Reform', the Government proposes consultations to improve the basis for parliamentary scrutiny of the Estimates, particularly through the provision of more program-oriented information. </PARA>
<PARA> The springboard for consolidating appropriations is the Australian Labor Party' s policy document on 'Labor and Quality of Government'; the impetus for reforms of this kind, however, has come from such authorities as the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure on 'Parliament and Public Expenditure' and the Reid report on the review of Commonwealth Administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The move towards greater consolidation of certain appropriations, bringing with it the capacity for departments to respond more effectively to an environment which is constantly affecting spending priorities, particularly in the area of administration, is an important step towards the goal of departments assuming greater responsibility in their financial management. The Government recognises, however, that this enhanced flexibility will have an impact, if only initially, on the way in which departments have traditionally managed their administrative resources and it is important to ensure that this is translated into more effective and more efficient management. It would, therefore, be sensible to retain, particularly during the transitional stages, the ordinary scope for monitoring the extent to which departments may reallocate expenditures within the consolidated amounts appropriated by Parliament. Thus, it is envisaged that such expenditure reallocations should be subject to the agreement of the Minister for Finance or his delegates. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end, minor amendments to the Audit Act are necessary. These amendments, which are set out in clause 8 of the Bill, will empower the Minister for Finance to direct that the consolidated amounts approved by parliament be divided into items of expenditure-termed notional items-that accord with the previously agreed estimates; and to approve the reallocation of expenditure between notional items within a subdivision of the Appropriation Act. This process will not, of course, permit the amounts appropriated by parliament to be varied. Moreover, the power to direct notional items will be exercised only to the extent and for the period necessary for departments to adjust effectively and efficiently to the new appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the other amendments before the House. The first, being those at clauses 3 to 6 and clause 15, relate to the appointment of the Auditor-General and associated matters. They bring the legislation into line with current appointment practices and drafting policy. The second noteworthy inclusion in these other amendments is that at clause 9 which will permit the attachment of conditions to payments made under section 34A of the Act. Section 34A of the Act deals with act of grace payments, being discretionary payments which may be made by the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the absence of any legal obligation to do so. For example, under the terms of a social welfare enactment, a person's particular circumstances may not qualify him or her for the receipt of benefits, despite the underlying intentions of the statute. In such circumstances, an act of grace payment, or payments, may be considered justified, pending amendments of the enactment. The Government has been advised, however, that, in such a case , if a person had received dual benefits, that is, as an act of grace payment and subsequently in accordance with a new statutory entitlement that, say, had retrospective effect, no power exists to recover the amount of the act of grace payment. Thus, it is proposed that section 34A of the Act be amended to permit the attaching of conditions to such payments, including a condition of repayment where appropriate. In the event of default by the recipient, the Commonwealth will be empowered to recover the payment by court action, if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining clauses of the Bill encompass amendments of a minor nature that would otherwise have been included in a Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill. These clauses are intended to clarify the provisions relating to the transfer of certain moneys from the credit of the Trust Fund, the levying of fees for certain audits conducted by the Auditor-General and definition of ' approved bank' in relation to statutory authorities' operations; to give recognition to the power to recover by instalments amounts owing to the Commonwealth; and to increase to present day values certain amounts struck in 1979 and specified in the Act in relation to act of grace payments and waiver of debts. </PARA>
<PARA> The financial impact of the proposals reflected in this Bill is indirect and not easily quantified. The initial control procedures which are being proposed to apply in the context of consolidated appropriations are not intended to be an end in themselves. Rather, they are to assist and encourage departments to establish quickly the necessary degree of financial management capability to operate within that changed appropriation format. The Government believes that the consolidation of appropriations, especially for departmental administrative expenditures, will promote efficiency and effectiveness in the management and delivery of programs by overcoming the somewhat cumbersome procedures hitherto required to redirect expenditure from one item to another. The new arrangements will also allow departments to respond more rapidly to changing circumstances and priorities in the course of the year. The achievement of these benefits will be accelerated by establishing, from the outset, soundly based control mechanisms that can, progressively, be devolved on departments to administer themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions relating to the appointment of the Auditor-General have no financial implications. The financial impact of the remaining provisions of the Bill should, in practice, prove relatively insignificant. They are primarily supplementary controls included in a piece of legislation-the Audit Act-that is, itself, a controlling statute. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The primary purpose of this Bill is to put into operation the Government's commitment to reactivate the former Curriculum Development Centre within the administrative structure of the Commonwealth Schools Commission. By this means the Commonwealth will have the capacity to provide schools and school systems with curriculum and educational materials, information and expertise. The legislation will also strengthen the integral relationship between curriculum issues, research priorities and the funding and program responsibilities of the Commonwealth Schools Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve its primary purpose the Bill repeals the Curriculum Centre Act 1975 and in doing so abolishes the existing Curriculum Development Centre as a statutory authority. The assets and liabilities of the existing Centre are to be vested in the Commonwealth and will be administered by the Commonwealth Schools Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will establish a new Curriculum Development Council, reporting to the Minister, which will work in close consultation with the Commonwealth Schools Commission. The Chairman of the Commission will have permanent head powers in relation to the staff appointed under the Public Service Act 1922 to assist both the Commission and the new Curriculum Development Council. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the primary purpose of the Bill, the legislation also updates general provisions in the Commonwealth Schools Commission Act 1973 to take account of current legislative practices. The legislation also provides authority for the Commission to inquire into, and to furnish information and advice to the Minister, with respect to matters affecting the education of handicapped children who have not attained school age. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Government's pre-election education policy this Bill will reverse the decision taken by the Fraser Government to abolish Australia's national curriculum body. The earlier decision, arising from a recommendation of the Committee for the Review of Commonwealth Functions-otherwise known as the Lynch Committee-was made despite considerable public debate and a flood of objections from all quarters of the educational community, including the national parent and teacher organisation. It was a pointless decision given the significant achievements of the Curriculum Development Centre in its all too short history. It was a decision that could not have been made on the basis of any rational educational argument and a decision made all the more remarkable given that the then Minister for Education had only six weeks previously officially opened the Centre's premises with a speech praising at considerable length the Centre's achievements. That decision reflected the Fraser Government' s lack of real concern for the education of our children. In contrast, the Hawke Government is committed to an educational program that will ensure that the greater majority of children in our schools are given a worthwhile and rewarding education. Central to such a goal will be the re-establishment of the Commonwealth's national curriculum role as proposed in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the main outcomes to be expected from the proposed new arrangements will be a commitment to forge a closer relationship between national curriculum development and the program activities of the Commonwealth Schools Commission. This link will be instrumental in enabling the Commission to implement fully the Government's national educational priorities, in particular, to promote curriculum initiatives in such areas as Aboriginal education, the education of girls, computer education, secondary education curriculum renewal and those programs concerned with Australia's multicultural character. </PARA>
<PARA> The close links to be forged between the Curriculum Development Council and the Commonwealth Schools Commission will strengthen the capacity of the Commission to bring about long term changes in Australian education. In the immediate future this increased capacity will be evident in the curriculum inputs that will be made to the announced participation and equity and computer education programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of reactivating the Curriculum Development Centre is expected to be between $2.5m and $3m a year, less expected revenue from sales of curriculum publications of $500,000 a year. The transfer of curriculum activities presently conducted by the Department of Education and Youth Affairs to the Curriculum Development Council will involve savings in the order of $1.5m a year which will be an offset against the costs of reactivating the Curriculum Development Centre . </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's participation and equity program is a cornerstone of our strategies for educational improvement and through this program it will be possible to break down the persisting patterns of disadvantage, those patterns which have made educational outcomes dependent to an unacceptable extent on the socio-economic background of the student or the student's sex, ethnic background and geographical location. The immediate emphasis of the program will be to increase the participation of young people in post-compulsory schooling, particularly Aboriginal people, working class youth, some migrant communities, rural youth and the handicapped. However, in the longer term the Government will be seeking to make education a more challenging and rewarding experience for all children. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's computer education program recognises the need for all students to have an understanding of the uses of new technology and of the impact these new technologies will have on the student's social, environmental, industrial and working life. From the teachers' point of view, there will need to be planning for, and guidance in, the ways in which the computer and related technologies are to be introduced into the curriculum and into the professional development programs of both the practising teacher and the teacher trainee. The promotion of these needs, including the professional development needs of parents and community members, will be a major responsibility of the new Curriculum Development Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Achieving these objectives will require the full co-operation of all groups with an interest in education. It will not be an easy task and it is not one that can be left to individual schools or systems. Co-operation, co-ordination and facilitation will be necessary if the initiatives are to have a broad system impact. Central to the process will be the need to give close attention to the school curriculum, in particular, to the curriculum content, structure and organisation. In this demanding task there is a clear need for national initiative and this is being provided for in the provisions of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the initiatives that will need pursuing on the wider national front will be such issues as credentialling and assessment procedures, the analysis of curricula, the consideration of alternative organisational and structural patterns, the retraining of teachers, changes in teacher attitudes, the design and development of new courses and, very importantly, the improvement of school- community relations and community attitudes towards both education and the outcomes of education. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party and Labor governments have traditionally been concerned with justice and equity. We have a commitment to creating a more equal society where each person can achieve their full potential. In education this means we are committed to assist schools to give a positive and effective education to all children, and to make substantial progress towards the more equal distribution of other outcomes of education such as access to paid employment and higher education. We believe there is an urgent need to encourage all children to obtain a full twelve years of education and thereby to increase participation in tertiary education and in the country's capacity to adapt to, and make significant contributions to, technological change. At the present time too many of our children are leaving school without completing an adequate level of education and without developing those skills that will enhance their opportunities for satisfying employment. It is also true that of those children who are leaving early a disproportionate number are coming from working class and disadvantaged groups. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to this situation the Hawke Labor Government has a long term goal to ensure that most young people complete a full secondary education, either in a school or in a technical and further education institution, or in some combination of work and education. Achieving this goal will require far reaching initiatives paramount among which will be the curriculum reforms I have already mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The interest of the Minister for Education and Youth Affairs (Senator Ryan) in the education of girls and of Aboriginals is well known and the re-activation of the former Curriculum Development Centre will be a vital element in the Government's policies in these areas. It is only recently that there has been a widespread recognition that schooling was not preparing girls for the economic and social realities of adult life. We do not yet have a comprehensive history of schooling for girls in Australia and that is significant in itself. We know that over the greater part of our history there have been major differentiations between the schooling offered to girls and boys, except for that minority of girls who followed an academic path traditionally designed for privileged males. In Aboriginal education the situation is no better. It is only recently that Aboriginal history and culture has been considered a legitimate study in our schools. Virtually all of us here were treated to the history of the world and of Australia from a British perspective. This Bill will enable the Government to take positive steps to set about redressing these imblances. In the same way that Aboriginals and girls have been limited in the benefits that they may derive from education and in the contributions they may make to the development of our country so too have several other groups including other ethnic groups and the handicapped. The multicultural nature of Australian society and the rights of all persons is still not adequately understood nor reflected in current educational practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government acknowledges the diversity of the contributing cultures in Australia and it will be expecting the new Curriculum Development Council to contribute to the development and dissemination of curricula that acknowledges this diversity and provides a perspective of Australia as a nation in the Asia- Pacific region. The challenge ahead of us is to turn schools, and the formal education system, into places and experiences which young people will really enjoy and find value in. We need to reaffirm the traditional and positive concern of schooling with the development of the individual, and to place less stress on the function of school as a social sorting system. It is a debasement of the purposes of education to use schools as a weeding out device. They should not be places where for many students their main experience is one of frustration and inadequacy. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not to downplay academic achievement and high educational standards and , indeed, the Government fully recognises the need to improve the education and preparation of those who are moving into higher levels of education. However, this must not be done at the expense of the many students for whom schooling is the route to gainful employment and a satisfying adult life. The objective must be to provide a satisfying and demanding education for all students. The Hawke Government believes that this objective will be achieved if the Commonwealth supports school curriculum and practice in a positive and direct way. Such support should build upon the intellectual and social resources of students and their school communities and give to students the confidence and understanding necessary to shape individually and collectively the circumstances of their own lives. </PARA>
<PARA> In the curriculum context the emphasis will be on the Commonwealth, through the Curriculum Development Council, taking a positive stance in co-ordinating, facilitating and in broad terms supporting the development of curriculum strategies in association with existing curriculum groups throughout the country . The aim will be to achieve increased co-operation and understanding between the Commonwealth and the States, to extend the involvement of teachers and parents in the curriculum process and to expand co-operation between all sectors of the educational fabric. </PARA>
<PARA> Through such endeavours the Government is confident that all Australian children whatever their economic, social, ethnic or geographical background will be able to enjoy as near as practicable an equal and worthwhile educational opportunity. In proposing that the Commonwealth play a positive role in this process the Government fully recognises that State governments have the prime responsibility for education. However, the Government believes it is possible, and indeed highly desirable, for the Commonwealth to participate and for the Curriculum Development Council to work in partnership with the States in building on the work now being done in the States and to seek ways of co- operatively developing new approaches to traditional subject matter as well as new subjects, new organisational and structural patterns, and forms of teaching and learning that will make school a more interesting and constructive experience for all students.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Customs Tariff (Stand-by Duties) Bill 1984 which is now before the House is to permit the Government to impose, in certain circumstances , a Customs duty on imported light crude oils. Last year, the Government took steps to ensure that the maximum practicable level of indigenous crude oil is absorbed by the Australian refining industry. In this context, the Government announced its intention to prepare the legislation now before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides that two requirements be met by the Minister for Resources and Energy before a Customs duty on certain imported oils may be imposed. The first requirement is that the Minister for Resources and Energy has published a gazette notice informing the public that, in the national interest, the rate of absorption of Australian crude oils during a year or other period should not be less than the amount specified in the notice. The second requirement is that the Minister for Resources and Energy forms the opinion that the rate at which Australian crude oil is being absorbed is, because of factors under the control of oil refinery owners, less than the rate specified in the gazette notice. In this circumstance, the Minister for Resources and Energy may convey his opinion in writing to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Bill provides, however , that such correspondence will not occur earlier than two months after the commencement date specified in the notice. </PARA>
<PARA> If the requirements I have just outlined are satisfied, the Minister for Industry and Commerce may make a declaration by gazette notice, thus enabling the imposition of an additional duty on certain imported oils. The Bill also specifies that any additional duty shall not exceed a rate of 3c per litre or approximately $5 per barrel; cannot be applied to certain exempt oils; may be varied or revoked by the Minister for Industry and Commerce by a declaration published by gazette notice. I might also add that declarations imposing or varying the additional duty must be tabled in both Houses of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a long history of government policy in relation to the absorption of crude oil. Since oil was first produced in Australia in the late 1960s, governments of both political persuasions have adopted policies aimed at ensuring that all available Australian crude oil is absorbed in Australian refineries. Traditionally the refining industry has imported crude oil to make up the rest of its requirements. In 1983, however, for the first time Australian crude oil appeared to be in a state of 'technically' surplus in that available production was being shut in while imports were continuing at relatively high levels. This situation arose as a result of a variety of pressures, including the price of available spot market crudes. In the context of the parlous economic situation which confronted this Government in 1983 it was decided that it was essential to maximise the production of Australian crude oil and hence its contribution to government revenues. This was achieved through two complementary policies-exports of surplus production have been allowed on a spot basis during 1983-84 and a minimum absorption level for Australian refiners has been nominated. The success of this policy is clear. Production levels of Gippsland crude oil have been at record levels in recent months. Aggregate production over the financial year to date is currently some 60,000 barrels a day higher than in 1982-83. Most of this increase has resulted from increased levels of absorption by Australian refiners although exports have made a significant contribution. All available production from other fields has been absorbed by Australian refiners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides a standby measure. Whether or not an import duty is imposed will depend largely on the efforts of refiners to maintain liftings of domestic crude at satisfactory levels. The Government will refrain from implementing the legislation as long as Australian oil refiners continue to lift domestic crude oil at an acceptable rate. Details of the guidelines which the Government will use to assess whether the target will be met have been prepared and distributed to the refiners. An assessment that the import duty may be necessary would require two conditions to be met. First, aggregate domestic liftings would need to be below the target rate in two consecutive months and, secondly, the Minister for Resources and Energy considered that the minimum target rate for the specified period is unlikely to be attained. If the performance of the refiners continues to reflect the Government's target the imposition of additional duties will not be needed. In the event that the standby duty is required, its financial impact will depend on the circumstances and the performance of the refinery industry against the nominated target. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for topped crudes and the other heavy refinery feedstocks suitable for the production of lubricating oil, bitumen and fuel oil to be exempt from the duty as these products cannot be obtained from the light Australian crude oils. Imports of naphtha, a feedstock for the petrochemical industry, are also exempt. Imports of refined products which require no further processing before final sale are also exempt in order to ensure that extra costs are not added to the northern and north-western regions of Australia which are solely dependent on imported refined products. However, it would be a matter of concern to the Government if this exemption for refined products were to lead to an increase in imports of refined products, prejudicing the absorption of Australian crude oil. Should the legislation be invoked, this matter will be kept under review. The Minister for Resources and Energy will determine whether the level of liftings is consistent with the achievement of the absorption target. After imposition of the penalty duty the Bill provides for variation in the rate of duty as well as for its revocation. This would occur when the level of liftings had improved to a level consistent with achieving the nominated absorption target. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes to amend the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Grants) Act 1980 to extend the operation of the liquefied petroleum gas subsidy scheme to 31 March 1987 in a modifed form. During the extended period, eligibility for the subsidy will remain unaltered but the subsidy rate will be based upon a wholesale price for LPG as determined by the Minister for Resources and Energy. Proposed section 6A(4) in clause 5 of the Bill sets out the factors to be taken into account in the determination of this wholesale price. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of LPG in automotive, petrochemical, mining of oil and gas or the refining of petroleum remains ineligible for the subsidy. Users who converted to LPG after 25 September 1981 will continue to have their eligibility for subsidised LPG restricted to 1,000 tonnes per annum unless they have been issued with a determination under section 7A of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new arrangements the subsidised wholesale price for LPG will be linked to movements in the fuel and light component of the consumer price index. From now on the rate of the subsidy will be calculated by subtracting from the determined wholesale price per tonne of LPG the amount that was the subsidised price for the preceding six monthly period adjusted in accordance with movements in the fuel and light component of the CPI. The related formula is set out in clause 5 of the Bill. For the period from 29 March 1984 to 30 September 1984 the determined wholesale price will be $244.75 per tonne and the subsidised price per tonne will be $224.44. This means that the rate of subsidy will be $20.31 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> These new arrangements which have been determined as a result of a review of LPG pricing and subsidy should result in many consumers paying less and no consumers paying more for their LPG and reticulated gas requirements. Under the Government's pricing policy which determines the wholesale price of LPG the wholesale price was reduced from $304.44 per tonne to $244.75 per tonne on and from 29 March 1984. This is a reduction of about 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the review some 200 submissions and representations were received from State and local governments, from industry and from consumers. The revised LPG pricing and subsidy arrangements decided upon by the Government are designed to meet the principal concern raised in many submissions-that is, that the price of LPG should be stabilised and price movements made more predictable. It is intended that a further review of the subsidy be conducted early in 1987. A number of submissions proposed that the subsidy should be continued at $80 per tonne. Because future movements in LPG prices will be more in line with movements in prices of other forms of energy such as electricity and natural gas the Government is of the view that it would be inequitable to subsidise LPG to this extent. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the subsidy was introduced in 1980, the subsidised wholesale price has risen by 80 per cent compared with an increase in average retail electricity and natural gas prices of roughly equal magnitude. The cost of energy in all its forms has significantly increased in recent years and the Government believes that it would be unreasonable to exempt one set of consumers from the general movements in prices by a large subsidy financed from govenment revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> The continuation of the modified subsidy scheme for a further three years will alleviate future sharp increases in the price of LPG which would be faced by consumers if the subsidy were withdrawn. Administrative arrangements for payments of the subsidy will not vary to any great extent. Claimants will however be advised by the Department of Industry and Commerce of any revised procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The cost of extending the subsidy is expected to be $1.2m for the 1983-84 financial year, and about $7.2m for 1984-85. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Under section 4A of the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976, the Commissioner of Taxation is required by the end of July each year, to make a determination as to the amount of personal income tax collections which is used as the basis for local government tax sharing arrangements. Prior to the introduction of the prescribed payments system, which operates under Division 3A of Part VI of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Regulations, collections of tax payable on income to which that system now applies, were reflected in the amount of provisional tax and balances of tax payable that were collected in a particular year of income, and which are specifically included in the definition of personal income tax in the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to make amendments consequential upon the introduction of the prescribed payments system to allow payments made under that system to be taken into account in the personal income tax which forms the basis of local government tax sharing. Without these amendments to include specifically the appropriate part of collections of prescribed payments system deductions, that is, collections from individuals in the year in which they are received, the amount of net personal income tax collections forming the basis of local government tax sharing arrangements would in future be permanently reduced by the amount of those prescribed payments system deductions. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for this is that, in the year following their receipt, prescribed payments system deductions will reduce both the amount of tax otherwise to be collected on an assessment of the income of the preceding year, and the amount of provisional tax to be levied in respect of the then current year. Such a result would not only be contrary to the intended basis for local government tax sharing arrangements, but it would also be inconsistent with the tax sharing arrangements with the States which include prescribed payments system deductions in the base on which the tax sharing amount is calculated. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments are essentially technical amendments designed to maintain the original intention of the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976; to ensure consistency with the provisions of the tax sharing arrangements and to allow the Commissioner of Taxation to include receipts received in 1983- 84 in the base figure for calculation of the 1984-85 grants to local government.</PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying when the debate was adjourned before lunch, there are some worthwhile measures in this Bill, such as that allowing for the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the decision of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The principal drive of the Bill is not to make Australian citizenship more important or more valued but to make it quicker, easier, duller and cheaper. The Minister and the Government are taking steps which the Australian public does not want to see taken. I think that has come out in the last few days in the controversy aroused by Professor Geoffrey Blainey, a controversy which I am sure has caused Professor Blainey some distress. I think that the Minister was right to point out that total Asian migration is very small. I am sure also that the Asian migrants will be either good citizens or decent workers. But it is foolish for the Minister to speak of Australia as being Asianised when Australia is and must be a European civilisation, with traditions, customs and institutions which are European, with its main sources being Britain, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The people value these deep and historic traditions and institutions and are alarmed when they hear Ministers of the Crown dismissing them and talking as if they did not exist. They rightly see in the Minister and in the Government a prejudice against Britain, Eastern Europe and Southern Europe. I think Professor Blainey is to be congratulated for having broken an unnecessary taboo and for having raised the issue and opening it for discussion instead of it remaining under an unnecessary taboo. It is plain that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in effect agrees with Professor Blainey. In the speech he made a week or so ago to the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils he agreed that the change in pattern is as a result of the application of the current Government's family reunion program. I think Professor Blainey should be congratulated, rather than have criticism poured on him, for opening this subject up for discussion and for breaking the unnecessary taboo. </PARA>
<PARA> The same situation applies with Australian citizenship, which Australians take seriously, just as they take their European traditions seriously. They are alarmed when the Minister treats Australian citizenship lightly, as obviously he does. They do not see merit in making Australian citizenship quick and easy. They do not want cut-price citizenship. They do not want no-frills Australian citizenship, yet that is what the Minister and this Government are offering them . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply -I am concerned about the way the Opposition has conducted itself in this debate . It has missed the fact that the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill gives effect to the Government's commitment to ensure that the Australian Citizenship Act reflects the common national identity of all Australians and that it does not discriminate between persons on the basis of their sex, marital status and present or previous nationality. We are concerned that the Act should provide for reviews of decisions to deny or deprive persons of citizenship. We want to amend the Act to ensure that it is thoroughly Australian in character.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill has had regard to the review of citizenship by the Human Rights Commission in 1981 and the national consultations on the Act undertaken by the previous Administration in 1982. As a result, we included measures to eliminate various anomalies, reduce subjectivity in criteria of assessment for eligibility for citizenship, and sought to clarify and simplify administrative requirements and to remove redundancy provisions. We are doing all this to assist the 1.1 million people in Australia who as permanent residents are eligible for citizenship but who have not yet applied to take it out. We are doing quite well . For most of the year the Hawke Labor Government has been in power the applications went up by 20 per cent. We hope that this legislation will assist that trend to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset of my reply to this debate I should comment on the abysmally poor quality of the Opposition's argument against the major measures in this Bill. It is the most significant piece of amending citizenship legislation since 1949. The Opposition has absolutely refused to debate the major measures in the Bill. It has reneged on its responsibility to debate the real issues involved with citizenship applications and it has reneged on its responsibility to a multicultural Australia. Virtually all of the speakers from the Opposition concentrated on the alleged bias in the proposed changes to the oath of allegiance. The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), made a number of allegations. He said that we had no mandate to effect these changes. I draw his attention again to the consultations that were conducted by the former Government. Many of those recommendations have been picked up in this Bill. Virtually all the major changes in this Bill, including the changes to the oath of allegiance and the removal of the British subject status as a criteria for Australian citizenship, were flagged in our policy commitments before the last election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, they were not.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ4">Mr WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were, and I invite the honourable member to look at the information that was published at the time. I took great note of what the shadow Minister was saying in his speech on the second reading debate. It was only in the last eight minutes of a half-hour speech that he attempted to address the real issues in this Bill, and then he mentioned only two. With eight minutes to go he mentioned the fact that we were going to reduce the qualifying time and reduce the English language requirement, including exempting people who are over 50 years of age from the English language requirement. It was only in the last three minutes that he said that he supported most of the major changes being made in this Bill. So it was only in the last three minutes that the House finally discovered that the Opposition was in favour of virtually everything in the Bill, except the oath of allegiance and the British subject status, on which members of the Opposition saw fit to concentrate for the whole of their speaking time. I am sorry to say that with few exceptions the large number of speakers from the Opposition exhibited a very lamentable degree of political opportunism towards this very serious subject which concerns multicultural Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me address some of the few points that were made by the Opposition speakers . The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) actually called for Australian citizenship to be made a great deal harder to obtain. He said that we ought to see that greater benefits go to naturalised Australians than to permanent residents. I wonder how well that will be received by the virtually millions of people who are in Australia as permanent residents. Some 1.1 million are already eligible for citizenship but there are many more who are not yet eligible. Perhaps the low point in the debate, as far as the Opposition's abysmal performance was concerned, was when the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) said that, as 81 per cent of Australian people believed in God, he must rise to his feet to protest at my decision to make the reference to God optional . I must say that I do not profess to have the divine power to make God optional but obviously what he meant was that I and the Government were introducing in this Bill something which was not previously in operation. Of course that is not true. In the current legislation applicants for citizenship have the right to make either an affirmation or an oath. This Bill removes the necessity to swear allegiance to the monarchy but we have not removed the right to make a pledge in line with a person's religious beliefs. The position will be exactly the same as it is now. So I assure the migrants of Australia that the honourable member for Wakefield is wrong and that I am not attempting to make God optional. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the contributions of members of the National Party of Australia were the worst of all. They showed that they were prepared to ignore this nation's own political and social history, because we really are a nation of immigrants whether the National Party likes it or not. The propensity that they showed during the debate to hark back to the so-called benefits of anglophilism simply does not go over at all well with the many non-English speaking migrants who have come to join us from other lands. Members of the National Party just refuse to accept the fact that we have seen successive great waves of immigrants join us, particularly since the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> Only two honourable members from the Opposition attempted to address the major measures in the Bill, for at least part of their addresses. At least that showed they had taken the trouble to read the Bill. Apart from the shadow Minister, who I think did know something about it-he chose not to exhibit that knowledge, by speaking for 27 minutes about the oath of allegiance and 3 minutes on the major parts of the Bill-only the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) and the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman), the last speaker, showed that they had any knowledge of the Bill, thus exhibiting the fact that they had taken the trouble to read it. I certainly do not agree with the closing comments of the honourable member for Wentworth because the Government is not, and I have never said it is, attempting to Asianise Australia. I have said that Professor Blainey is wrong when he says that we are anti-British and pro-Asian. We are simply practising non-discriminatory assessment policies on a global level according to our family reunion, business migration and skilled labour programs. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ4">Mr WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not. What the honourable member really means if he is saying that is that he agrees with Blainey, that if those programs provide a result that he does not like, he would have us alter the programs themselves; that is to say, in his view the family reunion program provides too many Asians, we will have to alter that program because there is something inherently bad about Asians. We say the family reunion program is worth while in its own right and that all permanent residents of Australia have rights under that program, regardless of whether they come from Asia or Britain. That is the crux of the argument. We do not see a need to change our humanitarian policies simply because they might be providing just a few more Asian people. If honourable members really want to do their sums on the matter, this whole stupid and trite debate is a misrepresentative one as it is about whether we take 7,000 or 8,000 more people from Asia in a program each year of, say, 70,000 to 80,000 people.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would like to know how we could say to all the Asian nations, from Japan through to, say, Indonesia, that we do not really want their people coming to Australia but we are quite happy to get as much trade from them as it is possible to get.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other hand, I was pleased to see that a large number of speakers from the Government ranks were prepared to debate the real issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Kalgoorlie would have been quite welcome to speak but unfortunately he probably did not realise the debate was resuming exactly when it did. No one at all was gagged. Let me quickly repeat some of the major measures in this Bill which members of the Opposition failed to debate. They refused to take up the challenge and concentrated on two matters, the first of which was the oath of allegiance. I do not apologise to the Opposition for this measure. This is one of the most striking features of a Bill which now makes the Australian Citizenship Act thoroughly Australian in character. The declaration of allegiance made at the time that Australian citizenship is granted is quite properly regarded as being of singular importance to many people. The present renunciation of allegiance is ambiguous and does not make it clear whether people are being asked to renounce their previous nationality, their previous language or their culture, or all three. Further, wording of the renunciation should make it clear that it is only allegiance as a citizen to one 's former state or nation that is being renounced. The two proposed forms of the pledge of citizenship will allow all people to make a full commitment of allegiance to Australia, whatever their views on religion. Neither form differentiates between Australians on the basis of their attitude to the monarchy. The monarchy should not be a matter of division. Although I believe the Opposition is making some progress in its attitude to this so-called Asianisation debate and is moving more towards a correct bipartisan position, there is no question that its attitude on the oath of allegiance is directly aimed at causing division in the community when all that the Government is trying to do is provide a pledge of allegiance to the nation and the Constitution of Australia that will be non-divisive and equally attractive to all people who may wish to take out citizenship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Similarly, the Opposition has tried to make political capital out of the very necessary move to repeal the British subject criterion as a basis of defining Australian citizenship from the Act. As I have said, the fact is that no other Commonwealth nation still describes its citizens as being British subjects; why should Australia? Even the British themselves do not do that now. We will give the States, and Commonwealth departments too, for that mater, time to make any consequential amendments, such as will be necessary now to the Public Service Act. No doubt some State legislation will need to be amended in line with this decision to remove the British subject definition of Australian citizenship. We do not propose to proclaim this section of the Act until the States and the Commonwealth, have their acts together, so to speak. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ4">Mr WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There will be a number. I will come to the attitude of the States in a moment. In regard to both of these matters, the pledge of allegiance as it is now and the removal of British subject status from the Act, there is absolutely no intention at all to discriminate against or attack British settlers. Its purpose is simply to provide equality under the law to all migrants from any land. So it is not a matter of discriminating against the British; it is a matter of removing discrimination against migrants who are non-British.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Very little was said, although there was some mild criticism, of the residence requirement. The fact is that the Bill reduces the qualification period for citizenship by grant from three years to two years. It also proposes to relax the continuous residence requirement from 12 months immediately preceding the application to 12 months in the previous two years. This change recognises the increasing difficulty which the current requirement can cause to people in a world which is increasingly mobile. I might also say that the effect is to compress the time required to be spent in Australia over a more recent period, because previously it was three years out of eight. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter very briefly addressed by some Opposition speakers was the English language requirement. We accept that knowledge of English is essential to full participation in Australia's social, cultural and political life. This Bill seeks to strike a balance between a desirable knowledge of English and giving an opportunity to those who have lived in Australia for some time and who cannot speak English very well but would take pride in becoming citizens. We therefore propose that applicants for citizenship should have a basic knowledge of English rather than an adequate knowledge, which is currently required under the Act. It is not all that much different in practice. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been asked by certain members of this House and the Senate to spell out what is meant by 'basic English'. We will be very pleased to put down exactly the policy guidelines on what 'basic English' means. I think I can say that applicants will need to be able to discuss verbally the rights and privileges of Australian citizenship, but they will not be required to be able to read or write English. To ensure a consistency of interpretation of meaning, my Department is already developing guidelines. These guidelines will be published and made available to the public, as with other guidelines, in the citizenship handbook. I hope that the Opposition will give us its support on the exemption of those who are now over 50 years of age. (Extension of time granted) One of the most progressive aspects of the Bill is the provision for review of decisions to deny or deprive citizenship. There was virtually no reference to this matter from members of the Opposition, so I expect they all support it. It is consistent with the Government's support for external review. Clause 36 of the Bill proposes to insert new section 52A, which will give the Administrative Appeals Tribunal power to review on merit certain citizenship decisions. A whole range of decisions can be reviewed. </PARA>

It may be of some interest to such a determined States' righter as the honourable member for Denison. At the Federal-State Ministers conference last June, the States were informed of the basic thrusts of this Bill. I told the Ministers then that we would introduce it and await their comment. I introduced the Bill in December 1983 and sent all the relevant material to all State Ministers responsible for immigration and ethnic affairs matters. I received written communications from all the States. In early April 1984 at a Federal- State Ministers conference held in Brisbane I discussed their replies. The only substantial dissent on anything came from the Queensland and Tasmanian governments, which raised the matter of the alteration to the pledge of allegiance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Queensland raised a very moderate degree of opposition to the reduction in the qualifying time from three years to two years. No other problems of any consequence were raised by any of the States at the Federal-State conference to show that the Ministers were not satisfied with my explanations. I reiterated that they would be given time to effect any consequential amendments in their State legislation before we would proclaim the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that this Bill, which contains the greatest and widest amendments of a far-reaching nature to the Chifley Government's 1948 Australian Citizenship Act, which created Australian citizenship for the first time, is passed unaltered by this House and the Senate and comes into law as quickly as possible. I am certainly quite proud to be the Federal Labor Minister who has had the honour of introducing these changes. I am pleased at least to note that, although the Opposition does not support everything in the Bill, it has indicated that it supports approximately 90 per cent of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Professor Geoffrey Blainey was completely correct when he described the present Hawke socialist Government as the most anti- British government in Australia's history. If ever we have seen it clearly and positively identified, we see it in relation to clause 7 of the Bill whereby the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr West), urged on by his socialist republican colleagues, has completely taken out Part II of the principal Act. Part II of the principal Act deals with British subjects. I refer to that part of the Act briefly to indicate once again the paranoia and the hatred that the Hawke socialist Government has for anything British or anything relating to Britain from the Queen down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Government members are the most extraordinary bunch of hypocrites one could ever meet in one's life. They are royalists when they are in England. They put their arms around the Queen Mother and they play with Prince William. But when they come back to Australia they want to stab the knife deep into the back of the Queen. Each and every one of them stands condemned for their double standards and duplicity because not one of them can take a seat in this Parliament without taking an oath of allegiance or an affirmation of allegiance. In a few minutes they will vote to stab the Queen of Australia in the back. Before they do that they will vote to discriminate against every British migrant in Australia today. By taking Part II out of the principal Act, the Minister will achieve one of his main objectives. He is the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. He seems to forget that the largest ethnic groups in Australia today are the British, Commonwealth and New Zealand migrants. I have never heard this Minister utter one word of approval or support for British, Commonwealth or New Zealand migrants. Quite frankly, the trouble with the Minister is that he is well and truly under the thumb of a small and totally unrepresentative group. I have had the opportunity of meeting Miss Franca Arena. She might be a charming person but she is dangerous. She has this Minister under her thumb. Regarding Part II of the Act, the removal of which the Minister has been dreaming about ever since he got the position, he has declared war on every British migrant in Australia today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know what the loyalties of the honourable member for La Trobe were when he was in Britain, but after what he said in this chamber today I would not like to go into battle alongside him. I could not be sure on which side he would finish up. I put it to him quite bluntly: It is extraordinary that some of those who are quickest to stab the Queen in the back came from some parts of the United Kingdom. Now the status of the British subject is to be ripped out of the Act. Prime Minister Whitlam was no Anglophile. Prime Minister Whitlam did not move to drag out of the Australian Citizenship Act the provisions relating to British subjects, but this Government has. What is more, it has led the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) by the nose through this maze. At the moment he probably thinks it is good to let the socialist Left get a win on one or two issues. I predict that this immigration policy will be one of the major issues in the next Federal election and that it has already cost the Government unknown tens of thousands of votes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn specifically to clause 7 of the Bill. In that clause this anti-British, anti-European Government, has its great moment of victory because it will rip out the provisions concerning British subjects. Let me inform the Committee what else the Government has done. Late last year the Minister said-on behalf of the Opposition I supported him-that we wished to encourage a removal of the dichotomy between British and non-British residents in Australia. When the Government brought an amendment to the Migration Act before the Parliament we supported that amendment to take away that dichotomy. When the Government said that it wanted people to become Australia citizens we supported it but what did it do to the British subjects in Australia, many of whom have been in this country for up to 40 years but have not yet taken out Australian citizenship? The Government said to those people: 'Unless you put your name on the roll by six o'clock on 25 January 1984 you will lose forever your right to cast a vote in the country you have chosen as your home and in which you pay your taxes. That will occur unless you become an Australian citizen'. </PARA>
<PARA> Having done that, what did the Government do then? It did not even advertise in all the British and Commonwealth publications in Australia. I cite a good example. The Government did not even advertise in the Maltese Herald. The Maltese, believe it or not, are proud of the fact that they are British subjects . They are proud of the fact that their island was awarded the George Cross. They are proud of the fact that they have had the opportunity to come to this country. The Government advertised selectively, and I suggest that it probably disenfranchised a quarter of a million Australians by what it did. Those people are already resenting it. I cannot believe that any British migrant in this country will ever vote for the Australian Labor Party again after what it has done to them today. </PARA>
<PARA> The other relevant point concerning Part II is that, in dealing with the status of British subjects, the Government is not only taking away what they had and bringing them back to square one, it is also positively discriminating against them. It is a positive disadvantage to be a British subject if one wants to migrate to Australia. Let me give an example. Only six months ago the Minister expelled from this country a young British journalist who was in Australia working on a visa. He wanted to apply for permanent resident status. He was told that despite the fact that the newspaper wanted him and he wanted to work for it , he had to go all the way back to England and make an application. That young man has now been told that he will have to wait 12 months before his application will be considered. Why is the Government discriminating against European migration? The Government has cut it by 22 per cent. If the Government believes that that is not upsetting Italian and Greek constituents in every part of Australia it is not doing its homework. </PARA>
<PARA> The plain fact of the matter is that this Minister heads a Government whose policy is deliberately discriminatory and positively biased against British and European migration. He has now declared war on behalf of the Hawke socialist Government against every British migrant. I place on record, on behalf of Her Majesty's loyal Opposition-and we are-that we will be demonstrating right throughout the electorate over the next few months. The Government might think it is safe, that its actions will not come to the notice of the people in the electorates, but they will. Every British migrant in this country will know that today, 2 May, one day after May Day, the Hawke socialist republican Government declared war on every British migrant living in this country. The Hawke Government will take tax from those people but it will give them nothing in return. Shame on the Government. This is a black day for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join briefly in the consideration of the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill. Some of the rantings of the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), who has just spoken, were far from the truth of this legislation. The present Government is not anti anyone. Indeed , the present Government is attempting to ensure that some equity is put back into the immigration laws in Australia. We all know that the honourable member for Denison is a terrible lawyer. In the debate on this legislation a few weeks ago he demonstrated his inability to understand what is in the Australian Constitution. We now find that he did not even receive any attention in his own Party room when his Government, under the previous Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, proposed amendments to the Migration Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the honourable member for Denison had been awake and had taken any interest in the immigration debate in this Parliament over the years he has been a member , prior to becoming the Opposition shadow Minister, he would have known that previous governments deported many migrants who came to Australia on a visitors' visas and applied for permanent residence. In my electorate of Grayndler, which has one of the highest proportions of migrants of any electorate in the country, I would have had at least two or three cases a week under the previous regime where the Minister was refusing permanent residence to people who had come to Australia on visitors' visas. The honourable member for Denison knows that that is a fact. The honourable member knows that that was the policy of the previous Government and that what this Government has done is continue that policy. For the honourable member to stand up in this chamber and say that that is not so is a massive misrepresentation of the truth. It is a slur on the people of my electorate, who have borne the brunt of the very unfair immigration policies of the previous Government. The previous Government was not pro-British or pro anyone, but it was certainly anti many people. It was anti people from the Middle East. It was anti people from parts of Asia and it was anti many other ethnic groups. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague says, Greeks and Yugoslavs, and people from the Pacific islands, our nearest neighbours. The honourable member for Denison said that the Government has tried to stop people coming here from Britain. He should have tried to come here from Fiji when his colleague, the previous Minister, was administering the immigration program. People just did not get here. A person from the Middle East would never receive a permit, even if his wife was here, because he was not the sort of person the previous Government wanted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I address myself to another remark the previous speaker made about how terrible it was that the Government was changing the Australian Citizenship Act as it pertains to British migrants and their chance to become permanent residents. I would have thought that this provision, which has been in the Act for over 30 years, would have allowed any British migrant who had come to Australia and decided that he or she wanted to be an Australian citizen to make that decision. Surely the honourable member for Denison is not telling the Committee this evening that it has taken people 30 years of living here to make up their minds whether they wish to become Australian citizens. It is like saying that if one cannot make up one's mind after 30 years one is obviously not going to do so. That is really taking 'try before you buy' to the nth degree, to suggest that people could be here for 30 years and be not quite sure whether they like Australia. The honourable member for Denison is probably not quite sure whether he likes Australia and he has been here for a little bit longer. He might understand what is in those people's minds. But any rational person would be able to make a decision after 30 years about whether he or she wishes to become a citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government is saying is that that section of the immigration Act gave a positive discrimination to one group. For instance, it said that people who are Greeks from Cyprus should have different rights from people who are Greeks from Greece. It said that people who are Turks from Cyprus should have different rights from people who are Turks from Turkey. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do not need remarks from the honourable member. He would not know where those places are. The point is that the same rights should apply to everyone in this country; not some special rights for some special group, not some special right because a person happens to have been born in one part of the Aegean, one part of the English Channel or one part of Europe and not another part. The Government has quite rightly said that it will do away with this discrimination and will make all people who emigrate to Australia equal before the law in this country. That is the right and proper thing to do. It removes an anomaly that causes some problems to people who come here from other lands. The Minister should be commended for this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us once and for all put behind us this bogy raised by the inane pandering of the honourable member for Denison this evening about this Government being anti-British. This Government is not anti-British. In fact the only two British migrants at present in the House, the only two members who migrated here from England in recent years, are on this side of the chamber. They are supporting this legislation because they know it is equitable, just and proper. I commend the clause to the Committee. I am sure it will be carried with an overwhelming majority and that there will be rejoicing in all parts of the Australian community, not just in the one part for which the honourable member for Denison exercised some special pleading this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> We are hearing the last bleatings of the vestiges of the British Empire here tonight. Most of the rest of the people of Australia have grown up and realised that we are an independent country in this part of the world. Unfortunately some people in the Opposition have not realised that. Surely the Leader of the Opposition should realise that the types of outlandish statements that have been made publicly by the Opposition spokesman on immigration can cause only division in the Australian community. In fact until the honourable member for Denison became the Opposition spokesman on immigration, there was a fair degree of agreement between the Opposition and the government on where the Australian immigration system was going. But since this lunatic has taken over the spokesman's position we have had division and we will have more of it. I hope the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) will look to the best interests of Australia and remove him from the position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members on the other side of the chamber seem to forget that the great expansion in immigration policies in this country was the result of programs mapped out by their Party, the Australian Labor Party, when in power in the 1940s. The tags which have been flung from the other side of the chamber to this side of the chamber, that the Opposition is supposed to be racially motivated, are quite unfair and unfounded. If one were to go back to the Labor Party Cabinet which existed at that time and say 'What caused you to lean heavily on Great Britain as a source for the growth of this country?', the reply would be something like: 'Well, we had to ensure that when we increased the numbers in Australia we did it in a way which enabled people to blend in in terms of culture and traditions without causing any giant hiccups'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one were to apply the theories of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay), one could stretch a point and say that he was advocating that in the last few years we should have brought in, say, five million or six million people from Turkey, Afghanistan and India. I suggest that if that had been done the racial mix in this country would be one of total chaos . There would be friction in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous Government adopted a policy of ensuring that people who came to this country had backgrounds and abilities to blend in. Many an ethnic spokesman has said that Australia is probably one of the greatest, most tolerant countries in the entire world in terms of the changes which have taken place here since the late 1940s. Honourable members opposite should remember that during the last 35 years this country has been in the hands of a Liberal-National Party Administration for 30 of those years. People from all countries across the world have been allowed to settle in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I truly believe that the Government is being anti-British and anti-European in its emphasis in this day and age. Whether it is being done intentionally is a matter of debate; that it is being done is not a matter of debate. One has only to cite the Big Brother movement. Within 19 days of coming to office, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr West) wiped it off the board-an organisation which had existed in this country since 1925 and which had had on its board between 1942 and 1947 people such as Ben Chifley. Yet the Minister could not get rid of that British oriented organisation quickly enough. What is more, I am aware of the fact that that organisation has been asking to see him for well over a year but he has just refused even to let representatives of it into his office. That organisation represents probably a quarter of a million people who have either been brought out here in the past from Great Britain or are members of families of people who have been helped and assisted to settle in this country. That is just one example. I notice that Government members have gone silent. I believe many of them would not be aware of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> I have friends in the ethnic communities. When I was the member for Griffith I was known as Cameronopulis, so much was I part of the Greek community. So many members of the community say to me today: 'There is no point in our trying to sponsor members of our family to come to this country because the Government completely wipes them'. Italian people tell me exactly the same. They feel they are being squeezed out, that this Minister and this Government have adopted the attitude that if one is from Europe one is almost relegated to the status of second class. </PARA>
<PARA> Government members have almost turned the phrase of 'go home Yank' to 'buzz off Brit'. I think that is a fair assessment and analysis of how current policy is being implemented. The Government cannot get rid of everything to do with Great Britain quickly enough. It has removed the oath and reference to the monarchy. It has hoyed out of the window the national anthem. It is racing around this country pulling the photo of the Queen off every government building. It tried to get rid of the Queen's Medal last year which was an Army medal for the best shooter in the Commonwealth of Australia. It is ready to get rid of the flag. The reason it wants to get rid of the flag is that it has a Union Jack on it. All this points to the fact that the Government cannot strip away quickly enough all traces of our ancestry. </PARA>
<PARA> I was saying to a group of people only the other day at the QE II Hospital-that stands for Queen Elizabeth II-that under the Government in Canberra very shortly the hospital will be forced to change its name. The Government is so consistent with its whole approach. I love some of the more right wing members of the Australian Labor Party who jump up in this place and say: 'No, this is not being done. We are being misunderstood. We are being misrepresented.' I admire the lefties who sit silently, recognising the truth and who are prepared to say: ' Yes, I believe in what is being done.' But there are the cowards of the Right who sit silently in Caucus watching the traditions of this country being streamrolled week after week. I say to people in the electorate that it is up to them to become aware of what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Wells) is scratching his back. He has 16, 000 people of United Kingdom and Irish ancestry or background in his electorate. The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Beddall) who seems to have disappeared has 22,000 people from Great Britain in that electorate. The honourable member for Bowman (Mr Keogh)-he is not here at the moment-has about 18,000 such people in his electorate. Come the next election those honourable members can be sure that these people will have noted the way they have handled the reins of government since they have been elected to power. People will not stand idly by and watch the Australian Labor Party completely wipe off decades and decades of tradition in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I submit that one of the great problems of Labor in power is that it seeks to make vast changes to try to Australianise everything because it suffers from a huge inferiority complex. Labor Party members feel that they can run around in the pouch of a kangaroo and say: 'We are Australians'. But if we are associated with some other country they feel that it makes us inferior and less than respectable. Only the other day in Libya when that great creature of morality, Gaddafi, was moving in on all people from Great Britain, it was the British Government which offered protection and services to the Australians working in that country. In so many parts of the world this is the case. Whilst we are not in the lap of Great Britain, she has always regarded Australia as a country with which to have ties and with which to work. This remote island in the Pacific has been privileged in the past to have connections with Great Britain and yet this Government cannot bundle out Britain quickly enough. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I join with other members on this side of the House in expressing not only displeasure but also disappointment at the indecent haste which the current Government uses to destroy the history of this country. I say that as someone with a Scottish background, not as a Pom as I have heard one or two on the other side refer to British people. When one looks back in history one sees that the Scots have no reason to love the English. But we have the English language and parliamentary and legal systems from Great Britain. I submit most seriously that everything from England should not be destroyed as this Government is endeavouring to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is good. I thank the honourable member very much. I am happy to be here. I have an electorate with a high migrant population dating back to after World War II. The first influx of people were known as refugees. They were largely of European origin. The electorate of Werriwa, being on the edge of Sydney, has absorbed succeeding generations of people in the general migrant policy area and also it has absorbed a proportion of refugees under the programs of various governments. The Opposition is trying to build up racist, opportunist , prejudicial views because it thinks there are a few votes in it. The last people to talk about Asian migration and Asian refugees should be members of the Liberal Party, after their involvement in South East Asia. There are no votes for us in supporting South East Asian immigration. We do it because of the principle. We do it because of the truth. We do it because we have a refugee program. The Vietnamese in my electorate hand out how to vote cards for the Liberal Party except for one chap who used to be in the Central Intelligence Agency but who has now joined the Australian Labor Party.

It is his choice. But why should he pick on Asians particularly? I turn back to my electorate. There are lots of Italians and Greeks in my electorate who come to me wanting to get their remaining relatives out to Australia-cousins, uncles and all sorts of people. They go through the usual process. Some win, some lose. Some criteria have to be laid down and many principles are contained in the criteria laid down by my friend the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. We had to get some rigour into the system. In my electorate the first influx of refugees was from South America . I have Argentinians, Chileans and Uruguayans. They came here to escape political persecution by the facist regimes in that country with which the honourable member for Denison would feel quite happy, I am sure. They came in as refugees. There are now over 3,000 people from the South American countries in my electorate and they too are applying to bring their relatives into the country. The next wave were the Lebanese people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me get back to that point. The clauses we are debating relate to the situation of British subjects. I make this point in particular because of the statements made by the honourable member for Denison. He knows that the kinds of misleading comments which he keeps making in the House in relation to these matters are widely disseminated in the ethnic media and are creating concern. This is not the first time that this sort of situation has arisen. It has arisen on several occasions. I have received correspondence and expressions of concern from a wide number of people in the ethnic communities in relation to the activities of the honourable member for Denison in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will produce them-the honourable member should not worry about that. Let me now make a couple of further points in relation to British subjects who have failed to take up citizenship. We have set down a particular date which will affect people in the future and not people who already have the right to vote. Those people do not need to go through any citizenship ceremony at all in order to continue to vote. That is not the position. Our legislation simply concerns people in the future. No one who has the right to vote at present is going to have that right taken away. I want to make that point because of the misleading remarks that have been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question arises whether this is an anti-British measure. In what conceivable sense could it be seen to be anti-British? People who are classed as British subjects are not only people from Britain but also people from other Comonwealth countries. Previously, anyone who came from anywhere in the British Commonwealth could vote and participate in Australian elections even though he was not a citizen. Yet persons from other countries could not do so. For example , Greek people who came from Cyprus were entitled to vote after six months; but Greek people who came from the Greek mainland had to wait for three years and become citizens before they could vote. What is happening in this provision, like the many positive provisions in this legislation which the honourable member for Denison has failed to recognise, is that that anomaly is being taken out of the legislation once and for all. How can this part of the legislation be seen to be some kind of attack on the British Queen? The honourable member for Denison somehow thinks it is very significant to come into the Committee and even when talking to specific clauses to refer to the Australian Labor Party stabbing the Queen and using rhetoric of that kind. The fact of the matter is that this clause, as I mentioned, irons out a provision in relation to citizenship arrangements which should have been ironed out a long time ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Denison has also failed in his duty to encourage citizens from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries to become Australian citizens. Is he suggesting that anyone who puts down legislation that encourages this objective is somehow doing this country a disservice? These new clauses are designed to encourage that process. It is time that we took this step. The latest statistics that I have available indicate that as many as 800, 000 British citizens have not taken out citizenship. As I mentioned before, many of them are entitled to vote because of a previous provision. Nevertheless, we should be encouraging everyone who resides in this country to become part of this nation. We should be proud of this nation. We should get together and form one total community out of the various groups in our multicultural society. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the honourable member for Denison and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) to rethink the course of action that has been taken in relation to the clause, the Australian Citizenship Act and immigration matters generally because the bipartisan position which has existed on these matters is starting to break down as a result of the cheap political point scoring of the honourable member for Denison. The fact of the matter is that difficult decisions have to be made in the immigration area. However, we ought not to be pandering to the racists; we ought not be pandering to those people who want to destroy the immigration program. We ought in fact to get together in a positive way and recognise that the economic, social and demographic demands of this nation require a continuing , fair and balanced immigration program, to which the Labor Party is committed. </PARA>

The attitude is one of: Stab the Queen in the back; we must get rid of the Queen; get her out of the oath and affirmation of allegiance. But what will happen next year when the Queen comes to Australia? Loyal Liberal Party and National Party members will not get within cooee of her because of Labor socialist members, including the honourable member for Burke, wanting to touch her.

He has about a dozen notices of motion on the Notice Paper all hammering this tedious theme that somehow we are introducing creeping republicanism. He knows that there is no way that Australia can become a republic without a referendum. He knows that to suggest otherwise is contrary to our Constitution. He knows that Labor governments, including this one, have always abided by constitutional processes. He knows that even when people like Sir John Kerr breached the soundest traditions of the British parliamentary system we abided by the letter of the Constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If anybody is anti-Constitution it is the honourable member for Denison with his false propaganda. He knows that when we swear an oath of allegiance or undertake an affirmation of allegiance to the Queen we do so to her as the head of our Parliament under that same Constitution. He knows that she is a constitutional monarch and not a tyrant or a dictator. He knows that she even declined to intervene when Sir John Kerr took that same reprehensible action. She said it was a matter for the Governor-General of Australia appointed by this Parliament and would not intervene. Yet he still says that we are anti-British. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us suppose that Australia did become a republic. It is highly likely; most of the nations of the Commonwealth are republics. Would the Queen thereby be any less welcome in this country? She is welcome in every republic of the Commonwealth. I do not know whether the heads of those countries cuddle the Queen or bounce Prince William on their knees, but I am sure they would be quite happy to. Not one of them has yet stabbed any of the Royal Family in the back, even though a few Britishers did chop off the head of one of their monarchs in years gone by when they were not constitutional monarchies. The honourable member is talking a lot of rot and creating needless anxiety about anti-royalism . Even if we were a republic, if there were creeping republicanism, if any number of Acts and a referendum of the people finally made us a republic, we are not anti-royalist. The Queen is still the head of the Commonwealth-in India, in Pakistan, in every Commonwealth nation, even in Tonga, which is way ahead of us. It has its own royal family and head of state, yet it still regards the Queen as head of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member has accused us of being anti-Christian but, on this argument about the special status of Britishers he wants to introduce a provision of preference for Christians, preference for whites, and preference for Britishers. On what grounds? Only because he is a racist and a bigot. And he calls us anti-Christian! We are treating all creeds and all colours equally, and he objects to that. He is breaking a law of the Christian church, one of the Ten Commandments, which states: 'Thou shalt not bear false witness'. He is bearing false witness against every one of us on this side of the House. Besides being anti-constitutional, anti-royalist and anti-Christian he is also anti-Australian , because he denies the right of Australians ever to change their flag, although the British flag has been changed three times in its history. Even when Captain Cook came here Britain had a different flag from the one it has today. The honourable member objects to Australians ever wanting to change their flag. He says that is anti-royalist, it is stabbing the Queen in the back. He is the one who is schizophrenic, and I am willing to sign the second certificate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Capricornia was trying to make the point that the removal of reference to the Queen by the insidious processes being adopted by this Government means nothing. In fact it means a whole lot of things . This process removes the protection of the citizen against any government that happens to occupy the other side of the House. The Government is removing the constitutional position of the Queen, which is important to the citizen. In the process of removing reference to the Queen from the oath, the Government has denied the protection of the citizen. Look at the American oath of allegiance. Look at the Greek oath of allegiance. Look at the Maltese oath of allegiance. Look at the oath of any country. Honourable members will see the protection for the citizen against the state.

He must be content with his administration of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs because, after countless representations to him, I find the average waiting time for an individual seeking entry to Australia is eight or nine months. Panels of review go to panels of review. Time and again matters go backwards and forwards. The immigration program of Australia is in chaos.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indeed dealing with those clauses because I am looking at the terms of residence for people in Australia. If honourable members refer to clause 11 and to proposed section 13 (1) (d), they will see that the Government has discounted the process of citizenship to the extent where a person has to be a legal resident, and that is a legal term, for two years, but during that two- year period he need spend in Australia an aggregate of only 12 months. We would get shonky businessmen, drug runners and all sorts of individuals using Australia as a base over those two years. They would be no more than token citizens, token residents. Under the current citizenship provisions such people would not be eligible to gain citizenship. Under the present provisions people must spend a total of 12 months continuously in Australia. Under these new provisions an aggregate of only 12 months need be spent in Australia. Is that what honourable members want for citizens of Australia? The Minister has not explained these points to the Committee. I think this is an absolute denigration of the meaning of the word 'citizenship'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What sort of commitment can we draw from an individual who spends an aggregate of only 12 months out of two years in Australia? How do we know that he is not spending the other 12 months making a total of two years in his country of origin and is a de facto Australian citizen and a de facto citizen of his country of origin? How can we think this person is fair dinkum? What is the Minister saying to those wonderful citizens who have come from Greece, Italy, Malta and all of the European areas, to those marvellous citizens who have come from South East Asia and are committing themselves to Australia? The Minister is saying to them: 'This is what we are prepared to give people who come from this day forward. We are prepared to give them an easy entry process to citizenship'. The Government will devalue citizenship to such an extent that it will not be worth the paper it is written on. No other country would write a pledge of allegiance in such weak and paltry terms as this Minister and this Government are prepared to do. It is a terrible thing that the Minister is doing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has discounted the value of Australian citizenship. He cannot hold up his head in international circles. If he mixes with other immigration Ministers, no matter from what country, he will have to admit that a person wishing to become an Australian citizen need spend only part of a two- year period in Australia, in bunches of two or three weeks, while he runs his business from some international external port. What sort of citizenship is that ? All this Government is doing is creating a circumstance whereby all the shonkies of this earth who want to do so can use Australia as a safe base from which to operate their shonky businesses, denigrating Australia in the process. What would honourable members think about having as Australian citizens some of the characters who have been mentioned by Mr Costigan in his report? there will be more of them under these provisions. They will be here saying: 'We have the protection of Australian citizenship'. They will be wandering through South East Asia claiming Australian citizenship. They will be moving through the Americas. They will be operating internationally with this discounted and highly insignificant Australian brand of what we will be calling citizenship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Minister wishes to be specific on this legislation, I refer him to proposed new section 13 (1) (k), and request that he inform the Committee what he means by 'adequate knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship'. He is not applying any test of language that is worth the stamp. What other questions will he ask individuals seeking Australian citizenship? He has not specified that in this chamber in any way whatsoever. We should look first of all at the oaths of other nations and the provisions that are required of individuals before they can accept citizenship. If a person is to be a citizen of any proud nation he needs to fulfil certain provisions that indicate that he understands truly the processes of law and the commitment that he needs to have as a character, as an individual, to that nation. What will the Minister do? Will he say that if people can speak a bit of English, that is good enough? I guarantee that no questions will be asked about knowledge of the parliamentary system or knowledge of commitments of a citizen in regard to the fulfilling of the democratic processes of this nation. What sorts of provisions will be made so that an applicant for citizenship can display that he has adequate knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship?</PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought a young, free nation-one of the 18 free member nations of the United Nations-would be proud of some of its traditions and standards. These traditions and standards have been fought for and they are precious to us. Can you tell me, Madam Chairman, that the early settlers in Australia did not value the freedom that they were gaining as a young colony through the processes that gained complete self-management and self-government and the federation of Australia? They were proud of those achievements, and there were people in the Australian Labor Party who used to be proud of those things as well. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen demonstrated in this House today by the Minister and by the Government the fact that they are not proud to run a worthwile immigration program, they are not proud to operate a system of citizenship in Australia which will stand up in international circles. In fact, the commitment by way of pledge is worthless. Not only that, but the detail of citizenship will not stand any scrutiny on two insignificant clauses of a total Bill of many clauses. The Government has not done its homework. The Minister has brought great shame to his office and to this country. </PARA>

It ought to be possible for people of properly liberal instincts, who are concerned about the decency of the welfare of this country and its citizens, from whatever country they come or whether they are Australian born, to have a legitimate difference of opinion with what the Government is doing without being accused of being racists.

He said that it is miserable and disgusting, that it is terrible and that I am an opportunist. He does not know what I am going to say, he does not have the faintest idea; but because one is against the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, ergo one is being disgusting and terrible. I want to express a concern that there has intruded into this debate this new McCarthyism, brought forward by some members of the Government, whereby if we disagree with the Government, we are everything under the sun; we are racists and miserable creatures, we are discredited, terrible, mean-minded and opportunistic. It is a very illiberal approach, but of course we have long suspected that there is a deep streak of authoritarianism in the left wing of the Labor Party, and if we scratch that we find that they are the most illiberal , authoritarian group of people in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Anyway, we will pass that over. I want to say a couple of things about citizenship and about national symbols. It is obvious from this debate that they are things that arouse considerable passions. Let me say to those more balanced members of the Government on this subject that they cannot have a totally static view about national symbols and traditions. I warn them that these are issues about which people feel very strongly and they should not lightly tamper with people's feelings about the traditions of this country. I cannot imagine anything more divisive for Australia at present than for this Government to promote a debate upon, for example, the status of the Australian flag. If honourble members opposite really want to divide Australia, if they really want to deny what they claim to be the basis of their mandate of March last year, they should perpetuate this debate about the Australian flag. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I happen to think that it very accurately reflects the aspirations of the citizenship of the Australian community and I see no point in its being changed. The most important thing is that if we think things such as citizenship , flags and allegiance are unifying factors, we have to have some sensitivity for the feelings of people on these subjects. For almost 10 years I have been the member for the electorate of Bennelong which, whilst it contains large amounts of what is generally called the north shore of Sydney, also contains a number of areas of multiracial character-areas from which I have always drawn very strong support. I have not had one complaint in that 10 years from a citizen of my electorate about the nature of the oath to be taken at a citizenship ceremony. Maybe I am an exception, but I have been re-elected on each occasion and I will be re-elected with an increased majority at the next election, so I am not out of touch with what people in my electorate are saying. I have not had one complaint. If ever, therefore, there was a phoney issue, it is this question of changing the nature of the oath. This oath is being changed not in response to popular demand but because the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr West) has a hang-up over the oath having some reference to the head of state of Australia. That is the reason the oath is being changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frankly, I accept completely what the Government has done recently in regard to our national anthem. I do not approve of the way in which it was done but I accept that Advance Australia Fair ought to be the national anthem of this country. The reason I accept it is that the majority of the Australian people indicated a preference for it when the former Government held a vote on that issue. That is why I accept it. I do not accept it because the Prime Minister decided that it ought to be our national anthem; I accept it for the reason I have given. I am not particularly attracted to it. </PARA>

This country has problems enough at present and is likely to have problems enough for years into the future without stirring up unnecessary fights and arguments about our national symbols.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much for your advice, Madam Chair. No doubt for the rest of the Committee stage of the so-called debate on this Bill the members of the Opposition will be asked not to be so wide-ranging in the nature of their remarks. With regard to the removal of the British status as a criterion for Australian citizenship, there was no Australian citizenship per se until the Chifley Australian Citizenship Act of 1949. It was then that all the British subjects in Australia-that includes people born outside and inside Australia- were given Australian citizenship. There were transition arrangements which for many years allowed British subjects who were here prior to 1949 to become Australian citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position is that no Commonwealth nation, including the United Kingdom, any longer regards its citizens as British subjects. That includes the British Government. That definition has been struck from the statutes of the United Kingdom and struck from the statutes of every other Commonwealth nation. Although we are the last nation to remove British subject status as a definition of Australian citizenship-that is virtually all it means-and although we will give the States in the Commonwealth time to tidy up their consequential legislation, honourable members opposite have spent the last hour and a half trying to prevent the passage of this eminently sensible proposition with which incidentally all of the State governments agree absolutely and totally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tasmania and Queensland do not agree with the oath change, but they agree totally with what we are doing with regard to the removal of British subject status. Every State government in Australia agrees totally with what we are doing here and is co-operating with us. Yet the Opposition has used the last one and a half hours of the Committee stage of the debate to try to present what we are doing here to tidy up the Act as an example of anti-British behaviour. The Opposition is trying to prevent Australia from being the last Commonwealth nation to remove the British subject definition. I became very angry with the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) and the honourable member for Bennelong because I knew the attitude of their State colleagues. I knew how misrepresentative and divisive the honourable members actually were. This Labor Government is trying to do something in the name of all Australians, from wherever they may come, and in the interests of Australia generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course we need to remove the remaining discrimination from the Australian Citizenship Act. That is what the removal of the British subject definition will do. I am sure that the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender), as a fair minded person, would not agree that we should continue to allow British subjects who are not citizens to walk straight into permanent jobs in the Public Service and still require non-English speaking migrants to become citizens and then automatically get British subject status before they can become permanently employed in the Public Service. That is discrimination. We are not discriminating against the British; we are removing discrimination against the non-British. There is a very great difference, as honourable members well know. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks on this point: There is no self-respect or national pride in the coalition-none at all. The remarks of coalition members this afternoon indicate that they would be prepared forever to see this generation and future generations of Australia regarded as the subjects of a government elsewhere. We are no longer British subjects; we are citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia . Honourable members opposite have spent the last hour and a half of the time of this Parliament in arguing for the retention of British subject status as a definition of Australian citizenship. If we accept that argument we will be the only Commonwealth country to do so. Not even the British Government does that any longer. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will take this clause to a division because, of all the clauses in the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill, there is none more repugnant to Her Majesty's loyal Opposition and to the overwhelming majority of Australians than clause 12 which is the clause under which the oath and the affirmation of allegiance are made. The requirement to swear an oath or make an affirmation of allegiance, introduced by Prime Minister Whitlam, are in the Australian Citizenship Act. The oath and affirmation now go out and are replaced by the requirement to make a pledge in a form which is totally unacceptable to the overwhelming majority of Australians. Pledges are for pawnbrokers. We are talking about the citizenship of the greatest country in the world. As the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) said, the Government is debasing, devaluing and discounting Australian citizenship when it denies the right of Australians to swear or affirm allegiance to the Queen of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the Government talks about misrep- resentation let me say on behalf of the people of Australia that we are disgusted at the way that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr West), one of the leaders of the fascist Left in the Hawke socialist government, has gone around this country claiming that it is an oath of allegiance to a foreign monarch. He stood in Sydney in front of 25 ,000 people on Greek independence day and said that we were about to change the law so that, to become an Australian citizen, they would not be required in the future to swear an oath of allegiance to a foreign monarch living in a foreign country. That was a gross misrepresentation of the truth because the oath of allegiance is not made to a foreign monarch. The oath of allegiance is made to the Queen of Australia. That was introduced by Prime Minister Whitlam and accepted by the majority of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the atheist, socialist republicanism of the Hawke Government now coming to light. Government members might laugh about that but I assure them that the division list for the vote on this clause will go right around Australia. People who have claimed in the past to be loyal to the Queen, people who have claimed in the past--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BV4">Mr HODGMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To affirm allegiance to the Queen, people like the father of the Minister for Aviation (Mr Beazley) who affirmed and honoured it, will look through that list. I can assure honourable members that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is so out of touch with public opinion that it does not make any difference. Unfortunately, the Minister, in indicating the ideologies of the fascist Left, has misrepresented the position in this Parliament. He has claimed in this debate that the two former Ministers recommended changes to the oath of allegiance by deleting reference to the Queen . That statement is simply not true. One former Minister recommended a change concerning whether the renunciation should be before or after the oath of allegiance. But neither former Minister, the former member for Petrie, Mr Hodges , nor the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), ever advocated that reference to the Queen be taken out of the oath or the affirmation of allegiance .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to repeat what I said in the second reading debate. I point to the hypocrisy, the double standards and the dishonesty of this sham Hawke socialist Government. It is prepared to deny the right of Australians to swear allegiance to the Queen of Australia. When a person becomes a member of the Commonwealth Parliament or a member of any State parliament, he or she has to take an oath or an affirmation. The Government is not prepared to go to the people of Australia with a referendum. It would get thrashed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Braddon made the point that that is the test. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said that we will have a referendum at the end of this year in conjunction with the election on simultaneous elections and on one other matter. What about putting to the people of Australia whether we should delete the schedule from the Constitution? What does the schedule provide? It provides for an oath or affirmation of allegiance which each and every honourable member took before he or she could take a seat in Parliament. The Ministers took one or the other in the presence of the Queen's representative, the Governor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to the Government that if it wants to see what the people think about this matter it should take it to the people. The Government has no mandate to do what it is doing. It is going against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of Australians. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said, it is indulging in divisive and disruptive tactics. The Government displays itself as not being loyal to the Queen of Australia and for that it will be condemned. On this issue alone it will lose so many votes in the next election that it will find itself in a position which is not the position it thinks it will be in at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again we have had the usual parade of name calling and attempts to label people from the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman). I certainly will not do that in return. It is our belief that it is the overwhelming desire of the people who expect to seek to acquire Australian citizenship that this Bill be passed. Over three million of the six million people in this country who were either born overseas or who have a parent who was born overseas come from non- English speaking countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us be frank, honest and non-divisive about this matter. We are not saying that this is the first step towards an Australian republic. We are not saying that the Queen is no longer the Queen of Australia. We are saying that, for some migrants who join us from non-English speaking countries, it is a divisive provocation to require them to swear allegiance to the Queen who is resident elsewhere before they can obtain Australian citizenship. Let us look at what the report commissioned by the former Government and brought down by Professor Zubrzycki had to say. I will conclude my remarks with a quote from the report on the National Consultations on Multiculturalism and Citizenship. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The strongly-held and predominant view emerging from the consultations was that swearing allegiance to a sovereign, and especially to a named sovereign resident elsewhere, was inappropriate in Australia at its present stage of history. This view was shared by persons from a variety of backgrounds, including holders of Imperial awards and persons who maintained that they were not republicans. No hostility was expressed towards Her Majesty, though one speaker did pose the conundrum as to where her own allegiance would lie if Britain came into conflict with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>She was a very forward-looking woman. She was looking at maybe 100 years down the track. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Few speakers were in favour of retaining a mention of the Queen in the Oath of Allegiance, and spoke mainly to register their support, rather than to advance a reasoned case for its retention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 38 has the effect of removing from the statute books forever the Schedules to the Australian Citizenship Act which were brought into this Parliament and which passed through this Parliament when Mr Whitlam was Prime Minister. I have to say to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr West) that this is the last chance that he and the Hawke socialist Government have to pull back from removing from the Schedule set out in the Australian Citizenship Act 1948-1973, firstly, the oath of allegiance and , secondly, the affirmation of allegiance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The oath of allegiance is in simple and beautiful terms and is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>I . . . renouncing all other allegiance, swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia,-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise those words-</PARA>
<PARA>Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>The affirmation of allegiance is in similar terms except that the words ' solemnly and sincerely promise and declare' are inserted in lieu of the words ' swear by Almighty God'. These are to be replaced by a pledge of allegiance which , as the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) has said, is an insult to this nation, an insult to all Australians past and present. As I said a few minutes ago, pledges are for pawnbrokers; they are not for citizenship. This is what the people of Australia are being confronted with in this Bill. Firstly, the pledge of Australian citizenship will be in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>I . . . renounce any current citizenship and all allegiance to any State other than Australia. I pledge that I will faithfully uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>That is placed as the first option. Mr Whitlam, in his Bill, had the decency to place as the first option the oath of allegiance. It so happens that 81 per cent of Australians happen to believe in a God. This arrogant, ignorant Minister, this outrageous socialist republican Government says: 'Your first option is a pledge but, if you want to, as a second option we will give you the opportunity of swearing allegiance. That is the second form of the pledge'. In so doing the Government is insulting four out of five Australians who believe in God or christianity or who are members of a church. Secondly, the Government is refusing them the right to swear allegiance or affirm allegiance to the Queen. Yet those hypocrites opposite do it when they come into this Parliament because if they do not swear or affirm allegiance to the Queen, they cannot take their seats and cannot collect their money. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, if we look at the latest gallup poll, Government members are so far out of touch with public opinion on this matter that it just does not count. Power and the public opinion polls have gone to the head of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke). He now regards himself as more important than the Queen and half as good as God. I tell honourable members that this vote is an historic vote because on this vote Government members are demonstrating beyond any shadow of doubt that the allegiance which they swore or affirmed to the Queen was shallow. I put it to them that they are putting in jeopardy their own seats. They can hardly argue that their oaths are worth the paper on which they were written when, less than 12 months afterwards, they are in this Parliament putting the knife into the Queen. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister ought to resign before he is sacked. He has become a symbol of disunity amongst Australians old and new. He thinks he is pleasing the ethnic groups with this amendment. I can assure him that, following his speech in Sydney on Greek Independence Day, the number of people who came up to me wearing an Australian flag and who said 'We believe in the Queen' would have put him to shame. He has listened to the wrong people. The Prime Minister has been sucked in by the socialist Left. The Minister is now about to destroy the right of Australians to swear allegiance to the Queen of Australia. Shame on him. It is a black day. I know my voice is going but my heart is in this because the people of Australia will know Government members for what they are-hypocrites, liars and cheats and disloyal, one and all, to the Queen of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 38 refers to the regulations attached to the Bill. I will not be as viciously or as stupidly repetitive as the shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs , the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), on this matter of the changes to the oath; I will merely refute once again two points. The removal of reference to the Queen from the oath of allegiance is not an indication of a rush to republicanism. I wish Opposition members would get that through their heads, nor is it an indication of anti-British feeling; nor does it indicate any resentment against the Queen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer again to the stupid remarks of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) during the second reading debate when he actually said that I was out to make God optional. As I said, I do not claim such divine powers. It was always an option to make an affirmation or an oath. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make it clear to the honourable member for Dundas, who I might say, to be charitable, made one of the few reasonable contributions from the Opposition during the second reading debate-I am sure he will be able to understand what I am saying although the honourable member for Denison will not learn-that reference to the Queen is in the current affirmation and the oath. But, of course, an affirmation does not refer to religion or God whereas an oath does. So I am afraid God was always optional in this Act. Now we will give the would-be citizens of Australia a choice between two forms of pledge, one which swears by Almighty God and one which does not. The important point is that it is truly national in character. All people will be asked to do is to swear allegiance to the magnificent country of Australia and to the Australian Constitution.

I am one of those people present who , as a former shire president and local government person, has participated over the years in assisting people to take out citizenship in Australia by taking an oath and, in many cases, an affirmation. I am deeply concerned, in the first instance, that we should break a longstanding tradition by not including the Queen of England as the Queen of Australia in the oath of allegiance. The change is absolutely unnecessary. People have always recognised that the Queen is an institution as well a as a person. The monarchy is certainly an institution and, as such, we have included it in our traditions. It is certainly part of our history. Other nations also have backgrounds emanating from the British Isles. The fact that when the Queen visits those places people turn out in their thousands to greet her is evidence that those people have great respect for that tradition. I would not mind if I could see some benefit to Australians in taking the Queen out of the oath. It is a tradition. She is declared as the Queen of Australia and I believe that she should not be removed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the Labor Government is paranoid in its desire to remove the Queen, a desire previously pursued by the Whitlam Government. In that period the Prime Minister of the day tried to replace that institution with his own. He had his photograph hanging on walls as we well know. I see this move as taking away from Australians something that stands up for us to recognise as a higher institution . It is exactly the same thing as we find in some communist nations which demand that everybody dresses the same and looks the same. We are taking away something that people can look up to. More importantly, I see a great problem in the downgrading of God. There is no other way to describe it. This act must be deliberate. Draftsmen do not by accident turn around the position of affirmation and oath. They do it by instruction. That instruction clearly came from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a little astounded by that. I have a good memory and I take notice of things that happen. I have had the opportunity to watch the swearing in ceremony of members of this place on two occasions and I thought that maybe the Australian Labor Party had decided to upgrade God a little bit because when I observed the 1981 swearing in of members I saw the honourable member for Wills ( Mr Hawke) make an affirmation but when I watched the swearing in ceremony after the 1983 elections I saw the honourable member who was, of course, Prime Minister-elect, take the oath. It is amazing to me that the Bible did not catch fire in his hands when he did it because we know very well some of the statements that he has made. Let us hope that his father, the Reverend Clem Hawke, got to him and that he does not have an ambition to walk on water. I think that is what he is planning to do in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I think what the Government is doing is disgraceful. It is just another example of the hypocrisy of a government which throws crumbs to its left wing to keep it pacified while it carries out other things which, of course, its left wing is not so pleased about but in respect of which it is not prepared to roll the Government. We know what those issues are. If the left wing is prepared to survive on these crumbs, good luck to it. I think, of course, that members of the left wing are completely destroying their principles when they take the crumbs instead of standing up for the issues in which they truly believe. I have admiration for people who stick by their principles, but I have no admiration for people who do things such as I have just mentioned. I have no admiration for people who find that they can forgo God when it is interesting to be amongst the boys and make an affirmation but who turn around and rediscover God when they believe respectability is required for their new position. Many people rediscover God but they rediscover Him for good reasons and not for pure and blind ambition. I think it is time that honourable members opposite went back to their Prime Minister and said: 'As you have been able to upgrade God, at least let us upgrade Him and put him on top of the Schedule which is referred to in section 38'. That is where He was; that is where most people wanted Him. It is quite simple to do this. What honourable members opposite have done is quite sinister and they have done it for a definite purpose. I think that this is most unfortunate and regrettable. If any honourable member opposite wants publicly to stand up and say that he is prepared to downgrade God I hope he never wants to be Prime Minister because if he is he will be put in the position of having to upgrade Him again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the Minister has not. However, he has certainly put God in a position where He might be missed. God should have been on top of the list. The Government took a deliberate decision to change the positions around. The Minister cannot deny that because I know his draftsman would not have changed the basic order of words on his own. This was done on the instructions of the Government and the Minister. It is not really funny because we are a Christian nation, even though some of us see God in slightly different ways. Quite a lot of other religions still recognise a God. It is a great pity that this change has been proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am saying is that members of the left wing have a crumb. God has been downgraded and the Queen has been wiped out. However, they were rolled on uranium and they have been rolled on everything else in which they believe. That does not make them very effective members of parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the dying stages of this debate I have the opportunity to speak briefly. I want to say two things to the Government. I say them across party lines and in all sincerity. Because of the highly contentious, extremely divisive and extraordinarily emotional issues that have been raised by this legislation, I ask the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr West ) to go back to Cabinet and re- commend to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that this Bill progress no further for a period of, say, three months during which time community reaction to it can be further gauged and assessed. In the utmost good faith, I ask the Minister to stop now before he does irreparable damage to the fabric and framework of this great nation of ours. The Minister's decision to downgrade God and wipe out the Queen will be regretted very strongly by the overwhelming majority of Australians. I appeal to the Minister to hold the matter and take it no further. If the Minister is not prepared to respond favourably to that request put to him and to the Hawke socialist Government by Her Majesty's loyal Opposition, my concluding comment is a message to the other place. I hope that when this Bill reaches the other place those who have the honour to serve in the Senate will more accurately represent the views of the people of Australia about loyalty to our Queen. This is the Commonwealth of Australia and the Constitution guarantees a constitutional monarchy. We are not some republic and the Prime Minister is not President. If it were possible to transmit a message from this House to the Senate I would hope the message would be that in the other place, under divine providence, wiser counsel should prevail. I for one am proud, along with millions of other Australians, to say the words 'God save the Queen'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main purpose of the Pig Meat Legislation Amendment Bill is to give the Pork Promotion Committee control of its own funds. The change of name from the Pig Meat Promotion Committee to the Pork Promotion Committee is also provided for. The outline of the legislation states that the following changes are to be made:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> to appoint the second producer member on the Committee as Deputy Chairman ( other producer member is Chairman). </PARA>
<PARA> to provide for Ministerial approval of deputies prior to their appointment by a member. </PARA>
<PARA> to provide for a quorum of three (member or deputy) at Committee meetings. </PARA>
<PARA>I am making this speech for the shadow Minister for Primary Industry, the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr McVeigh), who is away from Parliament at the moment. He wanted certain definite points to be made during this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills continue the legislative policies of the Hawke Labor Government over the period of the 13 months it has occupied the treasury bench. Those policies indicate that as far as primary industry is concerned the Government is more interested in the shadow of administrative fine-tuning than in the substance of developing policies and fulfilling pre-election commitments. There has not been one substantive piece of legislation which has sought to translate its 'me too' pre-election promises into statute. One can understand that that is only to be expected. The Government has never shown any interest in primary industry. We all remember Senator Walsh's comments on millionaire farmers and the comments of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade (Mr Lionel Bowen), that we would be better off without Australian wheat and sugar producers . </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Government has been very strong on rhetoric. It has been superb in extending sympathy and agreement with primary producer organisations which have come in with their legitimate concerns. The stock reply of the Government has been to blame the previous Government for all its inability to offer help and fulfil its promises. It cannot deliver and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin) is rapidly gaining a reputation as a man who always loses in the Ministry or in Cabinet and as one who has failed to translate that sympathy into reality. The only legislation he has brought in deals with administrative change or imposes additional charges, such as increased inspection charges on industries or applies them to a wider area of primary production than was the case under the Fraser-Anthony coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately for Australian primary producers, the Minister has had to face the complete ignominy of having this legislation held up in the Senate. He is one of the few Labor Ministers who has had this fate befall him. It is interesting to note that following the comments made by the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Darling Downs, in a recent House of Representatives debate on inspection charges and the failure of the Government to have in place practical policies and enthusiasm to charge for something that was unknown, two Bills were not proceeded with in the House of Representatives and four Bills in the Senate are not even to be debated this week. The Minister, in his enthusiasm to put further charges on Australian primary producers, in his second reading speech indicated that the passage of these Bills was urgent as the increased and new charges-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the point of order raised by the Minister verifies the point I was making, namely, that the Government and the Minister have failed to do anything other than increase charges for farmers in the primary industry area. With respect to the Pig Meat Legislation Amendment Bill the Opposition supports the deletion of the promotion account and the payment of promotion moneys to the Committee. With the necessary safeguards provided by the Auditor-General it will allow for a more business-like arrangement than that which was possible through departmental procedures. It seems unnecessary for the Department of Primary Industry to be involved to the degree it was involved under the 1975 legislation when we are not here dealing with dollar for dollar government and industry money. We are dealing with industry money alone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a need for promotion. Pork promotion will be supported to the level of $1.75m this year. Of this amount $1.4m will be spent on promoting all cuts of pork and $250,000 will be spent on ham promotion. The people associated with the promotion deserve applause for their modern approach in convening a joint policy of advertisements in all capital city newspapers and 14 major provincial newspapers, 33 radio stations and in a 16 page colour recipe lift-out in the Women's Weekly. This follows the successful campaign which they launched in mid- 1983 and the previous success of the 'Quick and Easy' cooking theme they developed. The cooking theme will be further developed by a new series of television commercials. Ham has traditionally been used for snacks, salads or Christmas dinner. The tactic now will be to promote ham as an everyday family dinner at a cost of $250,000 through advertisements in the Australian Women's Weekly, Woman's Day, New Idea and Family Circle. An advisory committee comprising a nutritionist, a dietitian, a food scientist, a food technologist and home economist has been set up. </PARA>
<PARA> The pork promotion scene has been gratified by a massive swing in interest towards health, diet and nutrition and by the endorsement pork has from Weight Watchers. The pork industry is a major Australian agricultural industry and a significant industry in world terms. Presently there are about 330,000 sows producing about 4.2 million slaughtering pigs with a total carcass weight of about 240,000 tonnes of fresh pork, 50,000 tonnes of ham and bacon and 40,000 tonnes of can product a year. We readily appreciate the multiplier effect of such a large number of intensively housed animals to the secondary industry such as meat processors, feed millers and grain growers. As with the red meat industry there has been a reduction in prices to pig farmers this year compared with last year and for the pig industry in isolation there has been a significant reduction over the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA> Following discussions that the shadow Minister for Primary Industry has had with pig industry people from all over Australia he sees that the greatest difficulty faced by pig and pork producers is in the export area. Australia has many factors in its favour which could lead it to becoming a world leader in pork exports. Australia has big areas with ideal climate for intensive livestock production. Australia is an exporter of natural gas and coal which should provide a relatively cheap supply of energy and land costs for intensive production are low by world standards. This cheap land, dry climate and low population density makes effluent disposal in Australia easy compared with some of the enormous difficulties of some of our overseas competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> Due to the sound quarantine proposals of previous governments we are relatively free from livestock diseases. If we adopt adequate promotion techniques and spending on this industry there is an enormous market for pork meat in the general Asian sub-continent area. Japan is a major importer and Singapore could be developed. Australia should be a major supplier to these markets. There is no inherent reason why we cannot usurp the position of Canada which has been the major supplier of pork as it has many disadvantages compared with Australia. However, the lack of a plant variety rights scheme in Australia has discouraged private firms from developing better feed grain varieties and improving the yields of feed grains. Grower supported research funds through the wheat industry have been concentrated on wheat development. Therefore, pig producers have been inhibited in their export potential by this lack of development of a feed grain industry. We need also to overcome our bad reputation as a supplier to world markets because of our industrial relations record. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1690" SPEAKER="Brown The Hon J.J." NAMEID="OD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="MOORE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OD4">Mr John Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I understand that a vehicle specifically designed for disabled persons is now available from British-Leyland in the United Kingdom, under the name of the Elswick Envoy.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) None of the local vehicle manufacturers produces a vehicle specifically designed for use by the handicapped. However a variety of locally produced vehicles are capable of being modified for this purpose and each of the local producers provides an advisory service to assist handicapped users in the design of modifications necessary for their individual purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) For tariff purposes an Elswick Envoy would be classified as a passenger motor vehicle, and therefore be subject to a duty of 57 1/2 per cent. As imports of motor vehicles are subject to quota limits a prospective importer would also require access to quota in order to be able to import the vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as sales tax is concerned I am advised that the rate of tax applicable on importation would be the general rate of 20 per cent unless it is covered by an exemption provision in the sales tax law. The only provision which calls for comment is item 123 in the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. Item 123 exempts goods designed and manufactured expressly for use by disabled persons provided that they are not of a kind ordinarily used by persons who are not suffering from disablement.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a question of fact for the Commissioner of Taxation to decide whether a particular item of goods is exempt under item 123 or excluded from exemption because it is in the nature of general-purpose goods ordinarily used by persons other than the disabled. The Commission is not aware of any instance where a road vehicle designed or modified to be used and operated by a disabled person has qualified for sales tax exemption under the item. On face value, such a road vehicle would be unlikely to qualify for exemption, because, although it may be specially designed in certain respects, it would still retain the basic character of a road vehicle for the transport of persons. The Commissioner would need to be supplied full details of specifications, etc. of the vehicle to enable a proper determination to be made. He will arrange for this to be done if such details are supplied.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the sales tax position would be the same for similar vehicles produced in Australia as for the imported vehicle in question. There is, however , a limited exemption in item 42C, First Schedule, for goods to be used in the modification of a motor vehicle solely for the purposes of adapting it for driving by a person who is suffering from physical impairment. The exemption would apply to goods used in Australia to modify imported or locally produced standard vehicles. Exemption, of course, would not apply to goods which are used in the modification overseas of a motor vehicle and which form an intergral part of an imported vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA> Items 135 and 135A in the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act contain limited sales tax exemptions for motor vehicles for use by disabled persons. Item 135 provides exemption for a motor vehicle for use in the transportation of an ex-serviceman who as a result of war service has lost a leg or both arms or receives a special Repatriation pension for blindness , tuberculosis or in respect of total and permanent incapacity. Item 135A provides exemption for a motor vehicle for use in the transportation to and from gainful employment of a person who has lost the use of a leg to such an extent that he is permanently unable to use public transport.</PARA>
<PARA> On the basis that the vehicle would not qualify for exemption, sales tax would be calculated at 20 per cent on the following value on importation into Australia-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) value for customs duty; plus</PARA>
<PARA> (b) customs duty; plus</PARA>
<PARA> (c) 20 per cent of the sum of (a) and (b)</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government of course is very conscious of the particular mobility problems that can face disabled people. Assistance to help the disabled in meeting those problems is provided through various avenues.</PARA>
<PARA> As noted above, provision exists for exemption of sales tax in certain instances. In 1981-82 the cost to revenue of sales tax exemptions on motor vehicles owned and used to convey persons with leg disabilities amounted to around $1.2m.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, a special mobility allowance for severely disabled persons was introduced in the 1982-83 Budget. Persons who have not received sales tax relief on the purchase of a motor vehicle qualify for a non-taxable allowance of $10 a week. The cost of this allowance is estimated at $18.3m in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA> The possibility of providing special tariff concessions for imports of vehicles designed for any use by the disabled has also been considered. However examination has shown that this would not be feasible. If concessional entry was provided for these vehicles there would be a real risk that the concession would be used to import vehicles which would end up being marketed for the general user. To safeguard against this risk very specific criteria would need to be written into the tariff. This however would have the effect of negating the practical value of the concession to the genuinely disabled. Even if tariff criteria which avoided this problem could be devised the potential would still remain for vehicles imported under the concession to be subsequently converted for sale in the general market. While conversion would involve costs to the importer these need to be considered against the substantial duty savings which would be involved.</PARA>
<PARA> Abuse of any concession in these ways could have serious effects on production and employment in the local vehicle manufacturing industry. The possibility of side effects of this kind places obvious limits on the extent to which it is feasible to use tariff concessions as an instrument of social welfare policy. These limitations have been recognised by governments of all political persuasions.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The treatment of motor vehicles either during manufacture or subsequently with a suitable and properly applied corrosion inhibition product can assist in preventing rust. It seems however, that at least some rust-proofing currently performed in Australia is below the desired standard. For example, the Annual Report of the South Australian Commissioner for Consumer Affairs for the year ended 30 June 1983 revealed that of 63 cars inspected at random from some of the State's major new car dealers and 3 major car rust-proofing companies only 3 were satisfactorily rust-proofed. Much of the treatment was reported to be, at best, shoddy although I understand the situation was more serious for treatment supplied by the dealers than by the rust-proofing specialists. The Standards Association of Australia has recently prepared a Standard on motor vehicle rust- proofing products and is currently developing Standards for rust-proofing product application and contract conditions for treatment. I am pleased to note that the automotive rust-proofing industry is represented on the relevant SAA Committee and sought the development of the recently published Standard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I follow the practice of successive governments in that the activities of ASIO are neither confirmed nor denied. I can say that the great majority of allegations reported about ASIO's activities are without foundation. ASIO's functions are strictly confined under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 to the collection and evaluation of intelligence relevant to security. It is concerned only with the activities prejudicial to national security.</PARA>
<PARA> It appears from the article in the Age of 30 November 1983 that many people associated with David Syme and Co. Ltd, and the Age newspaper regard Mr Ranald McDonald's claims about ASIO vetting of journalists as lacking foundation. Mr Keith Sinclair, editor of the Age from 1959 to 1966 was reported as describing Mr McDonald's claims about ASIO vetting of journalists as 'absolute nonsense'. Mr W. G. Bland, General Manager of the Age between 1964-1983 was reported as saying that he had no knowledge of any ASIO vetting of journalists. Mr Peter Alston, the personnel manager of the Age from 1961 to 1978 said that he was '' never aware'' of any ASIO involvement in the process of appointing journalists to the paper. The present editor of the Age, Mr Creighton Burns, said that to his knowledge, and certainly since he had become editor, the Age has not sought security checks on staff from ASIO or any other government instrumentality. Mr Burns stated that he had never been approached by ASIO in relation to staff appointments.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In certain prescribed circumstances, ASIO is authorised by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 to provide Commonwealth agencies with security assessments in relation to individuals. The only circumstance in which a reporter would be the subject of such an assessment is where he or she is to have official access to national security classified information or a secure area and is formally submitted for assessment by a Commonwealth agency.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The report referred to by the honourable member is a compendium of descriptive summary sheets and was a supporting document for the US Department of Defense's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) financial estimates for fiscal year 1984. Although the actual date of release is not specified it is most likely that the compendium was submitted to the US Congress in February 1983. The honourable member's copy was provided by the US Department of Commerce National Technical Information Service.</PARA>
<PARA> (1)(a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (1)(b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The 'related work' carried out by Australia is concerned with research into the physics of electromagnetic launchers.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Australia and the United States are involved in a joint collaborative program on electromagnetic launchers. This program is one of a number of programs carried out under the auspices of the Australia-US Memorandum of Understanding on co-operative research and development.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Potential applications of electromagnetic launchers cover any situation where an ultra high velocity of projectile is required, such as for intercept of anti-ship missiles. While not of interest to Australia, they have also been proposed for strategic systems such as defence against ballistic missiles.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) US workers have demonstrated the feasibility of accelerating projectiles of 300 grammes mass to velocities of 4 kilometres per second. Velocities in excess of 30 kilometres per second are considered possible in the future. Scientists in the Department of Defence have designed, built and analysed the performance of small experimental electromagnetic launchers. They have made particular contributions to the overall understanding of the complex physics of these devices.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) A survey conducted by the ABC's audience research department in the month of August, 1983 in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Hobart is the most recent source of information and shows that on a four-city basis:</PARA>
<PARA> 49.3 per cent of people aged 10 years and over have listened to a broadcast of Parliament at some time in their life;</PARA>
<PARA> In demographic terms, these people who have listened to Parliament, are more likely to be male than female and to be aged either 25-44 years or 45+ years. Information on socio-economic groups and residential groupings of listeners is not available.</PARA>
<PARA> 47.5 per cent of those who listen to Parliament do so once or twice per year; 29.3 per cent listen several times per year; 15.6 per cent listen once a week; 7 .6 per cent listen most days.</PARA>
<PARA> Females are slightly more likely to listen to Parliament on an infrequent basis , than males.</PARA>
<PARA> 57.8 per cent of those who have listened to a broadcast of Parliament at some time did so primarily because 'it just comes on'; 22 per cent listen because they 'follow Parliament'; 11.6 per cent listen specifically to 'Question Time'; and 18.3 per cent listen for a range of reasons;</PARA>
<PARA> Females are more likely to listen because 'it just comes on', while males are more likely to have listened because they 'follow Parliament';</PARA>
<PARA> For nearly two-thirds of those who listened (63.3 per cent), the time of listening tended to be variable; for 10 per cent it was in the morning; for 25.3 per cent it was in the afternoon; and for 14 per cent it was at night. Age and sex differences in these listening patterns were not in evidence.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. It is not really possible to state how many people listen to Parliament. However, it is possible to show how many people listen to radio at times when Parliament and/or the normal Radio 1 program is being broadcast. Thus, the following figures relate to time-slots, which sometimes represent listening to Parliament and sometimes represent listening to the normal Radio 1 program. The two cannot be separated; eg Sydney/Melbourne: April-June 1983 Weeks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 Parliament was broadcast. Weeks 2, 7, 8 normal 2BL/3LO program was broadcast.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Final details of the ABC Radio coverage of the 1984 Olympic Games have not yet been decided. Choice of events to be broadcast will be influenced by results, that is, the specific events including finals, in which Australians are competing. Because of Australian time zones, the great difference between Australian time and United States West Coast time and limits on broadcasting capacity using Radio 3, it will not be possible for the ABC to provide the same radio coverage to all Australians. These problems will to some extent be lessened in the State capital cities, Canberra and Newcastle where both ABC Radio 1 and Radio 2 operate.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also significant to note that on 12 March 1984, the ABC announced that Radio Station 2UE had acquired exclusive rights throughout Australia to the ABC' s coverage of the Los Angeles Olympics. Radio station 2UE is seeking to sell coverage to other Australian commercial radio stations.</PARA>
<PARA> The ABC has obtained exclusive radio and television rights for the Edinburgh Commonwealth Games in 1986 and it is anticipated that all Australians will be able to enjoy its coverage. However, details of coverage of this event have not yet been considered.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Does his Department recommend industrial safety proceedures to authorities responsible for enforcing these procedures in the Australian uranium industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Has his attention been drawn to the conclusion of the US Committee on Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (B.E.I.R. III, 1980, page 326) that the evidence is still insufficient to determine whether aggregates of radioactivity that remain localised in specific regions of the lungs give a greater or smaller risk of lung cancer per average lung dose than uniformly deposited radiation and that a small fraction of inhaled insoluble particles may remain in the bronchial epithelial layer for long periods.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is he able to say whether theoretical considerations following the work of Sir Macfarlane Burnet and others suggest that (a) there is no minimum dose of ionizing radiation capable of increasing cell mutation rates, (b) most cancers start from a single cell and (c) present guidelines to 'safe' levels of industrial exposure recommend toleration of total radiation doses to particular vulnerable tissue sites several orders of magnitude less than the recommended tolerable total body dose.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Will he review existing guidelines for uranium mining and publish maximum and minimum estimates of increased malignant disease arising from uranium mining in Australia with (a) 40 hours' work without filtering of inspired air and (b) 40 hours' work with total efficient filtering of inspired air in (i) worst case conditions with deep cut dry mining in still air and (ii) best case conditions with efficient exhaust ventilation of the work site.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Has he evidence that (a) miners and other workers in hot humid conditions prefer to dispense with respirators because the discomfort and impediment to breathing they create exceeds the discomfort of breathing slightly dusty unfiltered air and (b) employers and health authorities do not efficiently enforce use of respirators in mines.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Has he information based on the use of alternatives to respirators such as air conditioned helmets or cabins for uranium miners.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1706" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CAPRICORNIA" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr Blewett</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Formally, radiation safety procedures are recommended as guidelines to the Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores (1980). The Australian Radiation Laboratory of my Department provides major input in the development of these guidelines which are published by the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. In addition the Laboratory publishes, from time to time, handbooks of good practice. The State authorities make use of these codes, guidelines and handbooks in determining safety procedures to be followed in the uranium industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. The 'hot particle' thesis first advanced by Tamplin and Cochran has been rejected by a number of radiation experts (including the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council). There has been little serious discussion of this problem since about 1975.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Australia's current radiation protection standards are based on the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection which assume that there is no threshold for radiation induced effects and that the effect of a radiation dose is in simple proportion to its size and is independent of the rate at which the dose is given (generally referred to as the linear hypothesis). They also take into account the varying sensitivity of different organs to ionising radiation.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a minority scientific opinion which holds that radiation is much more serious than is generally believed but there is also a minority scientific opinion which believes that radiation damage in man is greatly overestimated. The majority scientific opinion is that the linear hypothesis allows the upper limit of the radiation risk to be defined. Its use may lead to over-estimation of risk but is unlikely to under-estimate it.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Australian Radiation Laboratory has recently circulated widely a review paper on the present code of practice. The paper addresses many questions, including the need to re-examine exposure standards in the light of new information and improved understanding of radiation effects. These will be taken into account when the code of practice is revised.</PARA>
<PARA> Up to the present, monitoring of mine employees and of their working environment has demonstrated that exposure to ionising radiation, both external and internal, has in practice been very low and no significant increase in radiation induced malignancies is likely to result.</PARA>
<PARA> The following guidelines, which discuss aspects of the inhalation of radioactive materials, have been published to supplement the code of practice.</PARA>
<PARA> Background to radiation protection criteria embodied in the Radiation Protection Code</PARA>
<PARA> Personal respiratory protection</PARA>
<PARA> Radiation monitoring programs</PARA>
<PARA> Appointment, qualifications and responsibilities of ventilation officers</PARA>
<PARA> Radiation protection aspects of ventilation practice (in final stages of preparation).</PARA>
<PARA>The following handbooks have also been published.</PARA>
<PARA> Monitoring employee exposure to radon and its daughters in uranium mines</PARA>
<PARA> Radiation protection in the mining and milling of radioactive ores.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) In general the preferred regulatory practice is to ensure that working conditions do not require the use of respirators rather than to depend on respirators whose effectiveness is always difficult to control. Respirators are regarded as emergency aids to cover unforeseen circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Individual filtered-air-flow helmets and mining equipment with air- conditioned driver's cabins have both been made available in Northern Territory mines. Air-conditioned cabins are in regular use by workers involved in mining operations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Telecommunications Commission, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is assumed that the honourable member's question refers to the telegram sent by the Prime Minister to the honourable member for Flinders indicating that I would review telephone call charges from the Flinders electorate to the Melbourne metropolitan area.</PARA>
<PARA> Following representations to me from the honourable member for Flinders, such a review was completed by Telecom in June 1983.

<PARA> The honourable member will be aware that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure is currently enquiring into Telecom's zonal charging policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Under Section 56 of the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 the Commission is required to use commercial methods to fund any loss it incurs over and above its budget appropriation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) I am advised that the decision to ease permit fees for road cartage of superphosphate was made by the Tasmanian Government in the light of backlogs of unfilled orders at 8 March 1984 amounting to 6,000 tonnes for rail and 3,000 tonnes allocated to road. Easement of permit fees was applicable only to the 3, 000 tonnes backlog for road, and was subject to review at the end of March 1984. At 27 March 1984 the road component of the backlog was 2,500 tonnes and the permit-free period was extended to 14 April 1984, subject to further review at that date.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) See 2 (a) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The unfilled rail orders were brought on by a seasonal rush and were accentuated by less than optimum wagon utilisation due to: (i) slow discharge of loaded wagons by some consignees, (ii) limitations in maximum gross train loads brought on by industrial bans on locomotive servicing.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no anticipated reduction in revenue. No cancellations or reductions in loading for rail have been evident to date.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The unfilled rail orders of 6,000 tonnes at 8 March 1984 have so far been reduced by 1,500 tonnes in addition to the normal loading commitment of 500 tonnes per day.</PARA>
<PARA> The situation is being rectified by (i) removal of locomotive servicing bans, allowing greater gross tonnage on trains, (ii) constant liaison with consignees to ensure prompt discharging of wagons, (iii) supply of wagons for weekend loading.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) The Government's immigration policy contains generous concessions which allow for the migration of close family. The policy is based on the concept of the nuclear family (parents, children and siblings) which reflects the Australian norm. If the policy were to include nieces and nephews it would imply a commitment to the extended family concept and carry with it an obligation to include other relatives in eligible categories. Our capacity to absorb migrants would be severely tested if eligibility categories were to be widened as the honourable member suggests.</PARA>
