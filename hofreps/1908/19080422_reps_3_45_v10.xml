                    <para>. - It is with the greatest reluctance that I interpose at this stage'.. Although the occurrence of calamities in any part of Australia is certain to be sympathetically noted in this House, yet the disaster which occurred on Monday night is so grave and appalling that it is at least incumbent upon us to indicate our deep sorrow and regret, while extending our condolence to the numerous shattered victims. A .few days previously a similar accident, though happily on  a less serious scale, occurred in ' New South Wales, but so ' many' of our citizens have just been killed or maimed so near the spot where we. are now meeting that it might be regarded  as an indication of indifference if we were not to pause for a moment in our arduous and important labours to express, in the simplest and sincerest fashion, our sympathy with the many who are suffering. Considering the circumstances of the country and the rapidity of its development, our railways have a record of which we are properly proud, and it is therefore the more unfortunate that there should now be written on the pages of their history a misfortune so' deplorable. Accidents of this kind happen in all countries, especially in the New World, whose general conditions resemble ours most closely. They appear capable only of reduction, since they have never been provided against, even in the more closely settled countries of Europe. None the less we cannot refrain from expressing, however imperfectly, the unanimous sympathy of the House with the victims of the disaster, and those associated with it. </para>

                    <para>. - The Prime Minister did right in asking us to pause for a moment in the discharge of our ordinary business to express the deep sorrow which we feel at the calamity which has befallen us. In spite of our civilization and our material advancement, there is always the incalculable element of human error which creeps into our best laid schemes, and, by upsetting them now and again, plunges the community into mourning, and causes the dark shadow of sadness to hover over our homes. This is such an occasion, and I join cordially with the Prime Minister in his expression of sorrow and regret for those who have been the victims of this unhappy occurrence. As he has said, these accidents take no account of locality. It was the State of New South Wales yesterday, it is Victoria to-day, and who shall tell what State will furnish the next victims? We can onlystandd dumbfounded at the sight of these visitations, and do our best to assuage the grief which has come to the homes of so many. </para>

                    <para>.- May I also express my regret that such an appalling disaster should be possible. I cannot add anything to the words of the Prime Minister, except to say that we must feel some sort of satisfaction in the fact that nearly every one who was able to render assistance to the wounded did so ungrudgingly, actuated by fellow feeling and sympathy. It is one of the characteristics of our race that we need no law or prescribed rule to compel us to go to the assistance of our. fellow men or sister women when in distress, and the redeeming feature of this deplorable disaster is the exemplary courage of those who suffered, and the heroic services performed by those who rendered assistance. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Minister of Defence whether his attention has been directed to a statement published in the Sydney newspapers - and I dare say in the Melbourne journals also - to the effect that in connexion with the Easter encampment in New South Wales thirty-one hours had been occupied in transporting a battery of field artillery from Albury to Heathcote? Will he inquire into the matter, and if the statement should prove to be correct, will he take steps to enable men in future to reach the Easter encampment with much less loss of time? </para>

                        <para>- In the first place, I wish to say that I have "no feeling whatever ' in this matter. As a matter of fact, many of the. requests made by the Senate for increases of duty meet with my personal" approval. My sole object is to raise the constitutional issue, and to obtain a ruling from you, sir, in regard to the power of the Senate under the Constitution to make suggestions to this House for increases of duties. I contend that the action of that Chamber in requesting this House to increase duties is a proposal to increase the burdens upon the people, and that the power to increase " any charge or burden on the people " is denied to the Senate under section 53, paragraph 3, of the  Constitution. I submit, too, that the words of paragraph 4 of that section, " omission or amendment," do not confer power upon that Chamber to request this House to increase duties, which would be increases of "any charge or burden on the people." If the Senate can, under the Constitution, request this House to increase a duty, it possesses a greater power than it would have possessed had it been granted the power to amend a Bill, such as this, imposing taxation, because in the latter case it would not have had power to increase, or to request this House to increase, Customs or Excise duties. When the Senate was empowered to make requests in Money and Taxation Bills - which it was forbidden to amend - by the framers of the Constitution, it was intended that it should be a lesser Power than that of amendment. That being so, I contend that, under this lesser power, it cannot do what it could not have done if it had been granted the greater power of amendment. I also contend that if the Senate has the power to request this House to increase duties, thereby, in effect, increasing the burdens on the people, it has a greater power than this House possesses; because this House cannot increase any duty unless the increase is proposed by a Minister of the Crown. </para>

                        <para>-  In this House a Minister of the Crown alone can move for the increase of any item in a Bill imposing 'taxation. I contend, therefore, that the Senate has a greater power than this House possesses if it can make suggestions to increase duties, since we cannot even make a suggestion to that effect. It may be argued that the proposals of the Senate are only " requests " to this House. But I contend that a great principle is involved. This action of the Senate might result in a deadlock between the two Houses of the Legislature. If it means anything at all it is a declaration by the Senate that it has practically the right of compelling this House to increase the burdens on the people, notwithstanding that such right is specially denied it by the Constitution. It may be said that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have already decided this question by a ruling given some years ago. But I submit that the question which I have now raised has not been previously raised in the form in which I now bring it before this House. I therefore beg to submit, for your consideration and ruling, whether the Senate, under the power conferred by section 53, paragraph 4, of the Constitution, has power to make " requests " to increase Customs and Excise duties, and thereby to increase the charges or burdens on the people. </para>

                        <para>-  This is not quite an abstract question. It is concrete enough, as the honorable member will observe if he looks at the schedule of requests that have come from the Senate. My right honorable friend is, I think, following the practice of the House of Commons with regard to the relations existing between the Commons and the Lords. But in Great Britain they have no written Constitution, and,- I submit that that makes a very radical difference between their attitude in regard to such questions and ours. All the powers possessed by the Senate are contained in our Constitution. Neither our Standing Orders nor, I submit with great respect, anything that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, can</inline> say regarding those powers, can alter this Constitution in any way whatever. I know of nothing in the Constitution which imposes upon you the obligation to interpret for us what the powers of the two Houses are. I should think that if the right honorable member for Swan proposes to proceed further in this matter, he ought to proceed by resolution rather than upon a point of order such as he has now raised. Regarding the merits of the question' itself, I do not now propose to say anything. </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable member for Swan was good enough, two weeks ago or thereabouts, to wait upon me and inform me that he intended to raise the question which he .has raised this afternoon. The notice which the right honorable member was kind enough to give me has enabled me to go quietly through the matter relating to it, before it was actually raised in, the House, with a view of determining what my ruling ought to be. I am therefore prepared to give a ruling at once, which may be of service to the House. First, in regard to the point raised by the honorable member for Parramatta, it -is true that the obligation does not rest upon me to interpret the Constitution. I have ever striven,  as far' as possible, to avoid doing anything of that nature. I recognise that the only body fully entitled to interpret the Constitution is the High Court ; arid I should be sorry even to seem to assume any of the functions which pertain peculiarly to it. Not even this House has the power finally to interpret the terms of the Constitution. Further, on three or four occasions I -have been asked, before to-day, to rule as to what the privileges of this House are in regard to certain messages which have come before us - as to whether such messages ought to be received, and as to whether we ought to consider them. To. rule on such points is surely part of my duty ; and, hitherto, I have striven to perform' that duty with a sense of the responsibility which rests upon me. In the same way to-day, I am asked whether a message which is about to be remitted for the consideration of the Committee is one that ought to be received by this House, or whether our privileges are in any way entrenched upon by suggestions for raising certain Customs duties. I propose to "deal with the questions raised by the right honorable member for Swan in the reverse order from that in which he has raised them. He has pointed out that if some o.f the suggestions made by the Senate were allowed, one result would be that the Senate would prove to be possessed of powers that are not possessed by this House. He has pointed out that this House has not  the power, except on the motion of a Minister of ' the Crown, to raise duties proposed by any measure before the House. I suppose that the right honorable member was "referring to standing order 171, which reads as follows - </para>

                <para class="block">If we were, at any time, in Committee on any Bill it would be impossible then to receive or make any proposal for the increase of any " tax rate or duty," unless that increase were moved by a Minister of the Crown.- But on the earlier stage of a </para>
                <para>Bill - on the motion for its initiation, when the House is not in Committee on the Bill, but is dealing with preliminary resolutions relating to the imposition of duties - it would be competent for any honorable member to move for any increase which he might desire, at that stage. So that the contention that the practice which is sought to be followed by another branch of the Legislature to-day, would give that branch of the Legislature larger powers than this House possesses, is not quite correct. We are only estopped from taking such action as would increase a "tax rate or duty " at one stage - that is, when the House is in Committee on the Bill. The next point raised by the right honorable member for Swan - I am' still taking his points in the reverse order - was as to the intentions of the framers of the Constitution itself - whether it was intended to give to the Senate such powers as it claims. That is a matter as to which my ruling can be asked, but not a matter upon which I should be prepared' to rule. Whether the practice which has been adopted does or does not confer upon that branch of the Legislature larger powers than the authors of the Constitution intended is not, I think, a question upon which my ruling is really sought. Then comes the next point to which the right honorable member has referred, and concerning which he has kindly given me, in writing, a statement of his contention. The right honorable member submits that - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>It is not competent for the Senate to make a. suggestion under section 53, paragraph 3, of the Constitution, that any item in the Tariff Bill, as sent to it bv the House of Representatives, be increased. </para>

                <para class="block">In this case the Senate has not made any amendment. It has simply sent to this House a message inviting us to amend it if we think fit. The Constitution clearly provides that in the case of measures for certain specified purposes, the Senate may not make -any amendment ; . it may merely make suggestions or requests for amendments. If the Senate had power to amend the Customs Tariff Bill, an amendment made by it would be obeyed by the Department of Trade and Customs, precisely as it instantly obey any amendment made by this House whilst the schedule is under consideration.' </para>
                <para class="block">It is, therefore, clear that the Senate makes nothing in the nature of an amendment by making a request to this House. The making of a request by another place is not followed by action on the part of the Department of Trade and Customs until that request has been considered by this House and agreed to. Unless this House makes the amendment requested the Department takes no notice of the decision of another place, and that decision has no operative value. It is simply a request to us to make a certain amendment. The next point arising under section 53 of the Constitution relates to the paragraph immediately following that which I have just read - </para>

                <para class="block">Those words contain no limitation precluding the Senate from making a request for an amendment which may mean an increase of taxation. This question has not previously been directly ruled upon by me, but it has come before the House on two or three occasions. On turning to volume 1 page 385, of the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Papers</inline> for 1905, Honorable members will find a detailed reference to all the cases in connexion with which points similar to this have arisen. When the first Tariff Bill was before the Senate, certain requests were made, including one that the Excise duty on tobacco should be increased. A message from another place, embodying those requests, came before this House, and was considered. No point of order was raised; the request for the increased duty was considered, together with others, and a vote of the House was taken. The point raised to-day by the right honorable member for Swan was nearly touched later on, when the Sugar Bounty Bill of 1903 was before Parliament. In. connexion with that Bill, the Senate made a number of amendments - not requests - amongst those amendments being one which clearly involved an increased burden upon the people. When the Senate message was called on in the same way as that now before us was called on to-day, I stated that, in my opinion, the Senate had gone too far. I took the view that we ought not to consider an amendment of the Senate which clearly involved an increased burden upon the people I concluded by stating that if the Senate had desired that this amendment should be made, its proper course, under paragraph 4 of section 53 of the Constitution would have been not to make it but to send to this House a request that it should be made here. The present Prime Minister, as Attorney-General, moved that the Bill be returned to the Senate with a statement that the amendment could hot be received in the form sent, since it was not competent for another place to make it, but that, if it desired, it could make a request to this House in respect to it. The Senate forthwith sent a message to this House requesting that the amendment should be made; the House proceeded to debate the matter, and" the incident was closed by this House making the amendment desired with a modification. If honorable members examine the debates on the Sugar Bounty Bill of 1903 they will see that the point now raised by the right honorable member for Swan was then practically ruled upon. We come now to the next point raised by the right honorable member, that the words " omission or amendment," in paragraph 4 of section 53 of the Constitution, give no authority to the Senate to suggest an increase of any proposed charge or burden on the people. It seems to me that, there being no limitation <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> that paragraph precluding the consideration of a request for an increase of taxation, we have no right to refuse to consider such a. request. Such requests may be considered entirely on their merits, . and we have power to reject, modify, or accept them. Honorable members will find reference to this question in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 1902, pages 14885, 14892, 14918, and 15676. I rule, finally, that the message which we have received from the Senate is one which it is within the power of the Senate to send, and one which, following the precedents we have laid down on two or three occasions, we may well consider and deal with upon its merits. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose, with the concurrence of honorable members, to make a short statement indicating the requests which the Government propose to ask the Committee to accept, and those which we shall ask honorable members to reject or modify. I desire at the outset to say that, like other honorable members, I have noted the keen interest displayed by. another place in dealing with the schedule to the Customs Tariff Bill as it left this House'. I do not think  that greater interest has been displayed by the Senate in any other measure which has been transmitted to it, and I feel sure that in making certain requests to us it has not been actuated by any desire to interfere with the proper functions of this Chamber. The Senate commenced its consideration of the Tariff on. the 22nd January, and completed it only on ' the 2nd April. Iri the interval, every item was considered in detail from the point of view of honorable senators, and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports of the debates on the various items in the Senate contain a great deal of information which may possibly be of use to honorable  members.  Out of a total of 238 requests, it is the intention of the Government to propose the rejection of 51, and the acceptance of 187. I propose now to state, for the information of honorable members, the requests which the Government propose to accept, and also those which we propose to reject or modify, in order that before each is dealt with they may know what course the Government intend to take. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to do so. I hope to have the lists printed by to-morrow, but I wish to guard myself to this extent : It is possible that, in a few cases, we may not find it advisable to follow the lists in every particular, and I therefore reserve to myself the right to make certain alterations in the case of items in connexion with which I am still making inquiries. So far as I can at the present moment give definite information as to the intention of the Government, I shall do so. It is proposed to accept the Senate's request No. 2. </para>

I intend to make the incidence of the Tariff as nearly as possible what I tried to make it when the schedule was in this Chamber ; of course, leaving myself free to vote for what I deem to be improvements. What has occurred in the Senate makes it necessary for the Committee to strictly scrutinize the requests now submitted for our consideration. Many of the requests affecting important items were carried by only small majorities. </para>

Senator Walker</inline> left Australia under the impression that he had secured an effective pair; but it has now turned out that he had not done so. The closeness of many of the divisions in the Senate make it necessary to strictly scrutinize the requests, so that effect may be given to the mind of the country in the final fixing of the Tariff. There were also the cases alluded to by the honorable member for Grey, in which Ministers voted for increases on the rates agreed to by their colleagues in this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- It is an admission which has been made from time immemorial. Every man, when he enters a Cabinet, surrenders something of his- personal views. He may make his own mental reservations, and, of course, it is open to him to leave the Cabinet the moment that he thinks he is called upon to sacrifice' his opinions too far. But he does not bind himself beforehand that under any given circumstances he will vote as the majority of his colleagues may determine. </para>

                        <para>- To come back to the point which I was making when I was induced to digress by the  disorderly interjections of the honorable member, I repeat that the Treasurer agreed to certain compromises in this Chamber - as he himself has informed us - with the mental reservation that, in another (place, he would endeavour to destroy those compromises. That is a fine admission for a Cabinet Minister to. make'. I venture to say that no Cabinet Minister has ever before made such an admission upon the floor of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- He might at least have told us that he was not making a compromise at all, but that he was merely playing upon the House a positive piece of deception. We. have waited all these months to learn that he made those compromises only until he could secure their alteration in another place, through the mouths of his colleagues. But coming to a very much more important matter, I wish to say that one need for a very careful revision of this Tariff, as it has been returned from another place, is to be found in the abundant revenue which it is yielding. I wish it to be distinctly understood that I am not suggesting necessity for scrutiny in the way of prolonged discussion - of long drawn-out arguments. I think that the sooner we can end the debate upon this Tariff, consistent with thoroughness, the better it will be for all concerned. But there are one or two matters of which we ought to take cognizance at the very outset of this debate, and one of these is the abundant revenue which has been flowing in during the current financial year. </para>

I admit that owing to the relations existing between the States and the Commonwealth nowadays, we have long since thrown overboard those old notions of thrift and economy as applied to national Government, which ought to be in the very forefront of politicians' programmes. </para>

                        <para>- Did the honorable member ever know of a State which did not want revenue, when it had not to raise it? The sooner that position is altered the better will it be for the thrifty development and government of Australia. As soon as possible, 'we ought to resort to the simple rule that those who spend the money shall be saddled with the responsibility and difficulty of raising it-. During the current financial year we shall collect at least £2,000,000 more than we collected last year. In other words, our revenue will have increased by about 23 per cent. ; and that in spite of the fact that we are supposed to have been engaged in framing a scientific Tariff, with the object of keeping out importations and of decreasing revenue. What does this prove? It proves that the Tariff which was expected to have the effect of stimulating local production throughout Australia has done nothing of the kind. It proves that we have merely added so much to the prices of commodities - an addition which has been paid by the consumers. I admit that we might have expected nothing else. The. presence of the honorable member for Batman reminds me of a simple incident which will illustrate the point that I am putting. Upon one occasion, I recollect the . honorable member exhibiting, for our enlightenment, five or six pairs of babies' " booties " in this chamber, and telling us that in Victoria five men were engaged in their manufacture. To accommodate those five men, we taxed babies' "booties" all over Australia to the tune of 35 per cent. I should like to know what percentage of those " booties " are now being manufactured in the Commonwealth in consequence of the imposition of that duty. That is merely one of a number of instances in which - in order to keep a few men employed in one part of the Commonwealth - we levied high duties' upon articles of general consump- . tion. As time goes on, we shall recognise more 'and more the utter futility of shaping for the whole of Australia a Tariff which might be good enough if shaped for a small, compact' State like  that of Victoria. When we began our Tariff legislation, it would have been a good corrective for this sort of thing if we had kept a map of Australia alongside of us. Of course, I am simply arguing in favour of what is reasonable as applied to the whole of the Commonwealth, without regard to any particular portion of it. While it may be very well, from a protectionist point of view, to protect those individuals in Victoria who are engaged in manufacturing articles of necessity, such  as that which the honorable member for Batman so earnestly champions, I ask whether it is wise to impose these enormous duties throughout the Commonwealth, when there is no possibility of such articles being manufactured in the various States ? Thus it comes about that this year our revenue will exceed the amount collected last year by 23 per cent., despite the scientific Tariff 'which we are supposed to have framed, and despite the heavier duties that we have levied. . These are facts which we ought to take into consideration in discussing the requests which have been forwarded to us by the Senate. During the current financial year our revenue will total about £11,750,000 as against £9,500,000 collected last year. </para>

                        <para>- It is obvious that this large revenue will not continue. There must be a shrinkage; but I doubt whether that shrinkage will be as large as some honorable, members forecast. The one outstanding feature in connexion with our Commonwealth finance has been that our revenue has not decreased to the extent that has been predicted. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner was out in his forecast as- to the shrinkage which would take place in the revenue in consequence of the protective incidence of the duties levied under the Tariff of 1901-2. Then, a little while ago, the honorable member for Flinders - himself an ex-Treasurer of this State - in endeavouring to forecast the future financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, declared that when matters had adjusted themselves, we might expect to receive a revenue of a little over £0.000.000 annually. </para>

                        <para>- Then let me put it in this way : There is not likely to be an  increase in our revenue. The revenue is, therefore, shown to be so much over that of last year, on account of other ca.uses than the' seasons. I do , not think the increase is due to the good' seasons. I believe .that the Tariff had much to do. with it, both in respect of its incidence and the circumstances attending its imposition. No doubt there has been a great deal of loading up in anticipation ot the Tariff, but, on the other hand, there has been a great deal of bonding since the Tariff- has been going through Parliament ; and I question whether those operations do not balance themselves in the course of a year. But, allowing for some shrinkage, if honorable members like, it is still practically certain that we are going to get £1,500,000 of additional revenue of a permanent character from the new Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- I am not talking about that at present. We did not frame the Tariff to make money. We were supposed to frame it for the purpose of rescuing industries which - were being strangled, and to prevent importations of goods affecting those industries. Here is the net result of our efforts to prevent those importations - that they have enormously increased during the year, and1 that we shall have an increased yield of revenue of over £2,000,000 sterling above that of last year. It seems to me that our Customs revenue will not shrink, if our seasons keep as they are, very much below £1 1,000,000. The Vice-President of the Executive Council in the other Chamber thought that the revenue would settle down at £10,250,000. But all these forecasts, made bv Victorian politicians, are, I am afraid, based on their experience as State Treasurers- and State Ministers of Customs; and .it seems 'to me that Victorian experience affords no very reliable guide in relation to our experience of Australia as a whole.' A very good judge estimates that the Tariff will work' out, at the end of the present' year, as follows: The yield in New South Wales is estimated to be 12s. per head more than that of last year; in </para>

                        <para>- It is the opinion ' of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash,</inline> the financial editor of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph;</inline> and there are few better judges than he. The outstanding fact is that, while we have been piling on these duties with the intention to increase local production and to kill revenue, the revenue itself seems to laugh at all our puny efforts, and maintains itself in this increasing ratio through every month in the year. This is the best possible proof that to frame this Tariff on a basis derived from the experience of one or two large cities of Australia is to place it upon a false basis altogether. When we come to consider the needs of Australia as a whole, and especially the needs of its great primary industries, our efforts ought to be in the direction of a moderate Tariff, and, therefore, in the direction of moderating these duties which have come from the Senate where they transgress the rule which I have just laid down. It will be our duty, therefore, while not doing anything to prolong debate upon the Tariff, to search this schedule with the greatest possible care, with a view of moderating those duties in which increases have been requested by honorable members of another place in pursuance of their rights. I shall do nothing which will add to the burdens of the people of Australia. I believe that in taking that stand I shall be doing that which will eventually be best in the interests of Australian enterprise and of the country as a whole. </para>

                    <para>'. - We ought to hear from the Minister whether sago or tapioca are being grown in Australia at present, or whether there is any prospect of their being produced in saleable quantities. If there is evidence that they can be grown in quantities, or that some one is willing to embark on the industry of producing them, there may be a reason for a duty ; but otherwise I can see no reason for dissenting from the request of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer admits that this is a revenue duty, and to support his contention that it should be retained he falls back on the general statement that the States are anxious to secure as much revenue as possible. That argument would apply to every proposal to amend the Tariff. It seems to me that the point we have specially to consider in this connexion is that tapioca and sago are not- produced in Australia, and that this is therefore a purely revenue impost on articles of food. The Treasurer has said that there has been no outcry against it, but I would remind him that, speaking generally, the consumers of tapioca and sago do not own newspapers, and have no means of making vigorous protest against the duty. Sago and tapioca are wholesome foods for children, and in the circumstances I think that the Treasurer would be well advised in asking the Committee to agree to the request made by another place. </para>

                    <para>.- When the Treasurer was speaking I interjected that it was to be regretted that he had not given the Committee an indication of the effect which the acceptance of the requests made by the Senate would have upon the revenue. We should have no difficulty in determining what stand we ought to take in respect to proposals of this kind if we knew what would be the effect on the revenue of the acceptance of the requests made by the Senate, and what would be the effect of the increased duties requested and likely to be agreed to. That the Minister thought that such information ought to be given is suggested by the fact that it was pointed out in the Senate that the amendments made by the House of Representatives in the schedule as introduced would involve a loss of revenue amounting to about £440,000 per annum. </para>

                <para class="block">We ought not to hesitate to accept this request on 'the ground that it would involve a surrender of revenue amounting to £13,000 per annum in respect of articles of such wide consumption as tapioca and sago, having in view the fact that on three items alone - wire netting, timber, and galvanized iron - we struck off duties involving a loss of revenue amounting to £170,000 per annum. If I remember rightly, the Treasurer, in submitting his Budget statement, said that this Tariff would yield £900,000 in excess of the amount derived last year under the first Federal Tariff, but that as against that increase we should have to make provision this year for an increased expenditure of nearly £1,000,000. It will be impossible to incur even half of that increased expenditure during the present financial year. The bulk of the votes which are to absorb the increased revenue will lapse by the 30th June, so that we shall have a much bigger balance than was anticipated. </para>

                        <para>- Surely the expenditure proposed by the Government in respect of immigration, defence, and many other items which I could mention will not be incurred this year. So far then as we are to consider these items from the point of view of this year's revenue we ought not to hesitate to make this item free, since the freeing of it can have very little effect upon the large surplus we are likely to have at the end of the present financial year. </para>

                    <para>-- Honorable members have stated that sago and tapioca are produced in Queensland. I do not think that they are produced to any extent there, but it cannot be denied that they can be, and I dare say that they will be produced in larger quantities. I think that the request should be agreed to. Sago is a most nutritious substance. It is the principal food' of the natives of New Guinea, and by making it free we shall give those who are producing it in our Northern Possession - Papua - a convenient market. A great deal of sago is produced in Papua, and the fact that it is not of the best quality is due simply to defective treatment. The Treasurer would be making a great concession by agreeing to the request. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Angas has raised a very important question to which the Government should make a definite reply. He has pointed out that this is the first item which raises distinctly the question of what is likely to be the effect upon the revenue of the acceptance of these requests. We are told that we shall suffer a loss of £13,000 per annum if this item be made free, but in order to be in a position to effectively discharge our duty in dealing with these requests we should have from the Government a statement as to what will be the effect on the revenue generally if the requests made by the Senate be accepted. I presume that the Treasurer has the information before him. The Government, in order to determine what requests the House should be asked to accept and what it should be asked to reject, must have had before them the figures for which I ask, and the statement which is to be published should give an indication of how the revenue will .be affected by the acceptance of , the requests. </para>

                        <para>- That is not sufficient. I believe we all desire, if possible, to make this item free ; the only question is whether it is wise to agree to a request involving a considerable loss of revenue before we know how the revenue from the Tariff generally will be affected by the other requests that we are to deal with. I am in favour of accepting the request providing that the amendment can be made without adopting a principle that, may seriously diminish the revenue from Customs and Excise. The honorable member for Laanecoorie interjected a few minutes ago that honorable members on this side were in favour of revenue duties, and should therefore be in favour of this impost. That statement' involves a misconception of the position. I am in favour of revenue duties in the sense that I believe that for a very large number of years we must derive the great bulk of our revenue from. Customs and Excise duties, and that therefore we must always regard" the duties imposed from the point' of view of their returning a large revenue. In that sense we look upon all imposts as revenue duties. I should like to see the Commonwealth obtaining revenue as far as possible from duties which will also have a protective incidence, where such duties can be fairly imposed. We are asked to remove a revenue duty, which will return- only £13,000 a year - a duty which I am assured is equal to 30 per cent, or 40 per cent, upon article's of food used largely by the poorer classes'. </para>

Although sago might be grown in Queensland, it is not grown there, or, at all events, to an extent which would warrant us in imposing a duty upon it equal to 40 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> I feel, with the honorable member for Flinders, that in the absence of any urgent necessity from the Treasury point of view, we should not impose a duty on this article, and I should, therefore, like to see the request of the Senate agreed to. But I must express mv surprise at hearing honorable members opposite, almost unanimously, condemning a revenue duty, when we know that some of them posed before the country at the last election as revenue tariffists </para>

                        <para>- I am going' to ask the Government to agree to the Senate's request. The estimated loss of revenue by the adoption of such a course is £13,000 That is but a small amount, and it has been pointed out that we are dealing with an article of food, which by. reason of its portability, is largely used in the interior. I do not agree with the honorable member for Nepean that it is used as a substitute for fruit ; but sago and tapioca are valuable  foods in health or in sickness, and in the circumstances, I hope that the Government will see the advisability of accepting the Senate's request. The honorable member for Herbert advanced an argument, which should have weight with the Committee. He pointed out that since we have taken over the control of New Guinea, we' cannot better assist the development of that territory than by helping settlers there to. grow those products which the country is best adapted to produce. At this time last year, I visited portions - of the Malay Archipelago, where' both sago and tapioca are grown, and the country and climate .is similar to New Guinea. By adopting the request of the.' Senate we shall do something to assist the development of New Guinea, and, though it may mean a loss of £13,000 of revenue, there are other ways of raising revenue than the imposition of taxation upon an article- of food. </para>

                        <para>- We are dealing with a duty imposed by the first Federal Parliament. I admit that articles of food should be made as cheap as possible, but the first Parliament decided to impose a duty of½d. per lb. on this article, and there was no great outcry as the result of that decision. I can see no real reason for the abolition of that duty. I should like to repeat the request made by the honorable members for Angas and Flinders, that the Minister should submit some statement showing the financial result of accepting or rejecting the requests made by the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the honorable gentleman estimates that the result of the adoption of the Senate's request in this case would be a loss of revenue to the extent of £13,000. I should not describe that as immaterial. If honorable members endeavoured to induce the House to agree to an expenditure of £13,000 for any purpose, they would find that the amount would not be regarded as immaterial. It is an amount which, in my opinion, is well worth considering. The duty has not been objected to in the past, and the people who have used sago have not noticed any increase in the price of the article due to the duty. </para>

                        <para>- I take a revision of the Tariff to mean an increase or reduction of duties as the circumstances warrant. It would be a fine thing if we were to appoint a Royal Commission to investigate the Tariff with an understanding that we should give attention to its recommendations if they involved increases of duties, and not reductions of duties. The honorable member has given us a new reading of the mandate of the electors, and I have not heard anything like it before in this House. Honorable members who were absent from the Chamber when I first addressed myself to the question, have since asked the Minister to submit a statement such as I asked for before. When I made the request the Minister's reply was that the requests made by the Senate would, it adopted, make very little difference in the amount of revenue to be derived under the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- In the absence of the information, I wish to make my position clear. For nine months of the current financial year we have already received £1,750,000 in excess of the revenue  received for the whole of last year. Allowing for some slackness which is usual in the last quarter of the year, it is certain that by the end of the current financial year we shall have received £2,200,000 more revenue than was received last year, and, with such an increase of revenue, to suggest that we cannot afford to lose £13,000 from taxation on invalids' and children's foods seems to me to be absurd. </para>

                    <para>. - Before giving a vote as a protectionist upon this question, I wished to know whether this article was grown, or was likely, in the near future, to be grown, in the Commonwealth. I find that practically it is not grown at all in the Commonwealth. Although I am here as a high protectionist, I cannot agree with the honorable member for Fawkner that this House was returned to vote all-round increases in Tariff duties. If that be so, some of the honorable member's colleagues in the Opposition corner will have some difficulty in explaining some of their votes to their constituents. From what I have heard, I am quite satisfied that this is purely a revenue duty, and, as I stated in discussing the Tariff "before, I am opposed to revenue duties. Seeing that there has been a substantial increase in the revenue under the new Tariff, the Minister might well give way to the Senate in this particular matter. </para>

                <para>Mr.watson.  -  It would be better to specify in regard to each item the date from which the alteration shall operate. If a general clause, such as the Minister suggests, is put in, then, in the event of a case being brought before the High Court, it will be necessary for the Judge to look up the records of the House to find out when the alteration was made. That seems rather a complicated method of doing things. It would be much wiser, when an alteration has been agreed to for the Minister to move an addition to it to the effect that it should operate on and after such and such a date. Each item would then be clear and distinct. The item of sago and tapioca could be recommitted, by consent, afterwards, or even immediately, in order to add the necessary words. </para>

                        <para>-  There appears to be a doubt as to whether our acceptance or rejection of a request really constitutes at this stage an amendment of the Bill. We are not considering the schedule of the Bill which we sent to the Senate, but are considering requests made by the Senate. It would, therefore, be quite possible to come' to a decision one way or the other on these requests, and then put through formally in Committee the requests which we have agreed to, as amendments. </para>

                        <para>-  I find that on a previous occasion the same question arose. The course adopted  then may well be adopted now. It is stated on page  503  of the records for August,  1902,  that the Committee agreed that " the date of any of these amendments shall be the date of its being made in the Bill." On that occasion that direction was acted upon by the  Chairman,  and the necessary alterations were made in detail. </para>

                        <para>- My point is that in Committee we are asked to pass a motion which will bring into force certain duties. The fact that it is done in response to requests from the Senate has nothing to do with the matter. If it be proposed to fix in the schedule the dates when certain duties shall come into force it is really importing a condition or a fact which was not previously before the Senate, and it might properly claim that any requests for amendments from this House should be unlimited by condition or time. </para>

                        <para>-The whole procedure is of very great importance to the Committee. It is a matter which, so far as I understand it, should not be treated lightly. It is not a question of my ruling, but a question of the proper method by which the duties should be collected. A question of law may be involved. The Treasurer is trying to secure some method which he thinks is the best one for protecting the revenue. There could be no objection to the. motion which has been carried, and, under the circumstances, I hope that the honorable and learned member will treat the matter seriously. </para>

                <para>I do not propose to address the Committee at any length, because we had a long debate on this item on a previous occasion  1  noticed that certain statements were made in the Senate. When this duty was carried here, I made a promise to one gentleman in Tasmania that I would try to see that he was not injured through not being able to get supplies of this wax. A firm here agreed to let him have any quantity of the article at - cost price. A statement has been made, I understand, by that gentleman to the effect that he applied to the firm, and that they refused to allow him to have what he required. I am told that several votes were influenced by that fact. I spoke to the  chairman  of the company. </para>

                        <para>- I did not say that he applied for it. I stated that he said that he could not get any wax ; I think he did say that he applied for it, too, but I forget that part of his statement. However, I made a definite promise. I took a great deal of trouble to see that the man was not injured. I got a promise from the makers here a week or two ago, and,  very fortunately, the reply came to me in the presence of the Prime Minister. I spoke to the  chairman  of the company, who is the acting-mayor. I told him that it was not fair to me, or to the man himself, if his statements were correct. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The  chairman  of the board of directors was highly indignant that such a statement as that to which I have referred should have been made. I wish the Committee to understand that, because I felt annoyed that I should have made a promise to this particular individual which was not carried out. But, as the honorable member for South Sydney has said, New South Wales is now manufacturing paraffine wax, and will do so to a considerable extent before very long. I hope that the request of the Senate will not be agreed to. </para>

                    <para>. - The explanation made by the Treasurer is rather an extraordinary one. That he, as a Minister of the Crown, should have interested himself in negotiations between firms regarding the purchase and sale of material, is, I hope, without precedent. Such a course of action is highly improper, especially when it is undertaken with a view to influencing the rates of duty fixed by this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I do not understand what other reason there could be for the Treasurer's action. An interference by a Minister of the Crown in the sale or purchase of goods between traders is .altogether improper. On the strength of  some arrangement that the Treasurer has succeeded in making, this Committee is now asked to accept his statement that, for a number of years, a certain firm will supply an article that' it produces at cost price. The simplicity of such a proposal is without a parallel. In the first place, I do not see how any firm could give such an undertaking, and, in the second, I do not know how anybody could arrive at what was their "cost price" of production. I am in favour of the reduction requested by the Senate, but I am opposed to that class of argument being brought to bear in this Parliament for the purpose of influencing the votes of honorable members. I say again that it is highly undesirable that Ministers should interfere in negotiations between traders for the purchase and sale of material. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot allow the statement of the honorable member for North Sydney to pass without challenge, because it embodies an absolute misrepresentation of the facts of the case. Honorable members in this chamber had urged as an argument in favour of a reduction of the duty on paraffine wax that a particular individual was unable to purchase supplies elsewhere, and that the firm to which allusion has been made, refused to supply it. I stated at the time that they would supply it both in New South Wales and Victoria. Until after the vote had been taken in this House, I had no negotiations with that firm whatever. It was only after a division had been taken that they made an arrangement to give effect to a promise I had made when the matter was under consideration in this chamber. Surely there is no harm in a Minister doing a thing of that sort. It was only last week that I challenged the manager of the company with not having carried out that arrangement. </para>

                    <para>.- It sounds very horrifying to be told that the Treasurer has been engaged in bargaining between traders; but there is really no thing to worry about, seeing that the statement that he could not obtain a supply of paraffine wax in Australia was definitely made by the only person whom I know to be concerned in this matter. Apart altogether from the Treasurer's investigation, I believe, as the result of inquiry, that that person can be supplied from New South Wales if he so desires. </para>

The intrusion of the Minister into this transaction I conceive to be quite in harmony with the policy of this Parliament, which is in favour of what is termed the new protection; and that is most em,phatically an interference by the State in the business of the capitalist, the consumer, and the employe. Whether it be a right or a wrong thing to do, that is emphatically the policy of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- It is not sufficient to say that  the manufacturers will  sell at a certain price. It is not sufficient to say that they are going to make the article in Australia. We want an undertaking that they will engage to sell to any person who wishes to buy. I understand . that the agents of one of these, firms are prepared to give an undertaking - whether it be a  good thing or a bad one is for the Committee to say - that they will sell as much paraffine wax as the users of it wish to buy, at the price that the Standard Oil people are charging, for paraffine wax, whatever that price happens to be at any particular time, less the duty.. They undertake to give a three years' guarantee .to do that. That appears to me-, on the surface, to be a perfectly fair proposal'. ' The only weak point in. it is that there may be such a thing as a combination between the Rockefeller Trust and this Australian Corporation. The representative of the firm here says that nothing is more unlikely. I do not share his opinion to quite the extent that some people appear to do. It is quite possible that there may be a combination. Therefore I fancy that if an agreement were arrived at, that the local firm would, during three years, sell at  4d.,  or at .the price for which the Rockefeller Trust was selling, whichever price was lower, that would be a sufficient- guarantee. I suggest to the Minister that such a guarantee might be obtained, to sell as much paraffine wax as any person wishes to buy at a price equal to that at which the imported article is being sold less the. duty, or at  4d.,  whichever is the lower price, during a period of three years. If that arrangement could be made, I could not see my way to vote against an industry  that might be of some service to New South Wales, a State which has been overlooked in many respects in connexion with this Tariff. As this is a <inline font-style="italic">bond</inline><inline font-style="italic">fide</inline> enterprise, and no person is going to be placed at a disadvantage by reason of the proposal of the Government, I shall support it. </para>

In the course of - some observations made by the Treasurer for the purpose of justifying his proposal that we should resist the. request of the Senate, the honorable gentleman ' told us of certain interviews that he had had with an individual manufacturer, followed by interviews, with the directors of a particular company who had this commodity to sell. I quite agree with the honorable member for North Sydney that it is a very irregular tiling for a Minister of the Crown of a great country like Australia to be having private interviews with individual manufacturers and with the directors of companies who happen to have the commodity which some particular manufacturers want, and then to make those <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> and interested statements the basis for legislative action. The Treasurer has asked the Committee to fake a .certain course upon the strength of information which he professes to have gathered from these unrecorded and unauthorized interviews. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister either was, or pretended to be, very angry with the honorable member for North Sydney, because he seemed to suggest that  these interviews took place before the matter went to a vote on the farmer occasion, whereas, it appears that the interviews were held after this House passed the duty. But it must not be forgotten that the interviews took place before the vote which we are now asked to give. We are asked to resist the request of the Senate on the ground of these conversations. We have it from the honorable member for South Sydney that the firm concerned is perfectly willing to sell the commodity in question to certain manufacturers. But we also have it from the honorable member for Franklin, that the firm is not only not willing, but not able to sell the commodity at all. So that the Committee is left in this extraordinary position - that we are asked to increase the duty beyond the rate proposed by the Senate by 100 per cent., on the strength of a conversation which the Minister has had with a private individual, a manufacturer, and, afterwards, with the directors of a certain interested company. </para>

                        <para>- I assure the honorable member that it is. As the honorable member for West Sydney has pointed out, there is no legal obligation whatever upon the people concerned to sell at any particular price. They may be perfectly willing to sell their commodity to a particular manufacturer until the duty is passed, and may then turn round and say " We were willing to sell at that price then, but we cannot do it now. ' ' The manufacturers of this particular commodity may express their willingness now <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> sell any quantity to manufacturers who wish to buy. But the moment the duty is through, they may turn round and say, "We shall no longer sell under those conditions." Parliament really has nothing to do with these private transactions; and what has happened shows the irregularity and impropriety of the Committee being asked to deal with matters of this sort upon the strength of private conversations. How was the Tariff Commission treated ? That Commission not only had conversations with interested people, but placed them on their oath and examined them in regard to their statements, endeavouring to sift the truth from the falsehood. But this House has snapped its fingers at the Tariff Commission, and the Minister took no notice of its evidence and recommendations when he wished to take the protectionist side. If that be the case, what weight ought we to attach to private and untested conversations, which the Minister has had with individuals? We do not know what motives prompted them. If the Committee looks at this matter from a serious point of view, it will not be guided by these desultory conversations, because, while as the honorable member for South Sydney has observed, these people may now be perfectly willing to sell ; according to the" honorable member for Franklin, they not only will not, but cannot, sell. Therefore, we are left in this humiliating position - that we have no data to go upon. </para>

                    <para>. - It is quite true, as the honorable member for Parkes has said, that it is possible for the firm in question to say that they will supply paraffine wax until the Tariff is disposed of, or for some time afterwards, and then' shut down on those manufacturers who wish to buy. But the question which we have to consider is this : Suppose that the local manufacturers did refuse to sell paraffine wax to a particular maker of candles. The result would be, or might be, to put a very small body of the employes of one manufacturer out of employment. I do not think that that will happen, but that is the worst that could happen. On the other hand, if we were to accept the request of the Senate, we should interfere with large firms who have expended in one case over £60,000. </para>

                        <para>- I am looking after the interests of the little man as well. We have to consider the matter from the point of view of those engaged in the industry, and of Australia generally. If we have to do some harm - and I am not saying that any harm whatever will be done - to any manufacturer, we certainly should not injure 4,000 employes in order to protect about twenty. I do. not think that the honorable member for Bass would desire to do that. But if we were to adopt the request of the Senate, the result would be to allow a vast quantity of paraffine wax to come into this country, to the injury of an industry in which hundreds of employes are engaged. We should simply admit a commodity produced by coloured labour at very cheap rates. A very important consideration in relation to this subject is connected with the different by-products that are obtained. I understand that oleine and glycerine are being manufactured.  oleine is being used, and is. likely to be used, in large quantities in connexion with the Broken Hill mines. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. . I have not the slightest fear in relation to the small business with which the honorable member for Bass is concerned. It is a business connected with the moulding of candles ; that requires very little labour. For the sake of this industry we are asked to penalize the manufacturers of stearine and the by-products, which involve the employment of a great quantity of labour and the use of a considerable amount of machinery. For these reasons, I am glad that the Minister is going to stand fast, and not to accept the request of the Senate. </para>

But after all that was said on a former occasion in support of the claims put forward for the large company interested in the manufacture of paraffine wax, the result in this House was that the duty was carried by twenty-five to twenty-one - showing a majority of only four. The Senate carried its request by twenty-three votes to five, showing that the opinion on the question in that Chamber was very strong. I think it fortunate for . the Commonwealth of Australia that we have a House in which the interests of the States are considered as against those of a few* interested persons who happen to have a large sum of money invested in a great business. When the matter was being discussed before, the Treasurer thought it right to say that a certain manufacturer of candles, who happened to be in the gallery, was looking after his own interests; the honorable gentleman made no mention of the fact that lie knew the representative of another wealthy company to be within the precincts at the time.  His  remarks were not calculated to uphold the dignity of his high and important office. A great deal has been said, about the amount of capital requisite for the manufacture of stearine. At the present time there are only four manufacturers in Australia, and if the duty is fixed at the rate they ask for, they will enter into a combine. It may be said that I, as  a  protectionist, should vote for the higher rate, but, as I told the people of Tasmania when I first offered myself as a candidate for a seat in this Chamber, I am  not a  protectionist of .the Victorian, that is,  of  the high prohibitive, school, because, in  my  opinion, a prohibitive Tariff would lead  to the  establishment' of monopolies, to  which  I am opposed. </para>

The records show that I  have  never voted for the protection of an  industry  merely because it was established  in  any particular State. I voted for the  protection  of the Queensland sugar industry  as  readily as I have voted for the protection of Tasmanian industries. The manufacture which employs only twenty or thirty hands is as important to those dependent  upon it  as is a large industry. The honorable member for South Sydney stated that  only  one manufacturer in Tasmania is interested in the making of candles from paraffine wax, but there are two. </para>

                        <para>- When Federation  was  inaugurated there were four, two of  whom  have since gone under, whereas, if  the rate  of duty supported by the Treasurer is agreed to, the others will also disappear, and Tasmania will have still further cause to regret having entered the Union. When she did so, her people thought- that  the  small industries, as well as the large, would be considered. My view has always been that the poor man and the small  company  should be studied rather than the  rich  man and the large companies, which  can  look after themselves. Unfortunately, some honorable members seem likely to  go  back on their former votes. The honorable member for West Sydney, on the  last  occasion, voted for a duty of Jd. per  lb.,  and is now going to vote for a duty of id. Some very strange statements have been made in connexion with this duty. For  instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kitchen,</inline> in the circular which he has sent out, states that - </para>

                    <para>It has been contended that in the conversion of tallow into stearine, a good deal of labour is employed, but this is not correct. Two or three men and boys, under the control of the technical head, are all that is needed, but the real expense for manual labour comes in afterwards in the moulding-room, where cutting, polishing, packing, labelling, box-making, &amp;c., &amp;c., is carried on. While the cost of converting tallow into stearine will benefit the labourer to the extent of10s. per ton, the moulding into candles will cost £310s. per ton, and, of course, this labour is the same whether paraffine or stearine is used. </para>

If I know an industry to exist, I do what I can for its preservation; just as I voted for the protection of the Brisbane glass industry. As the population of Tasmania increases, the number of hands employed in her industries will increase. Every industry must have a beginning. We should not allow a local company to be destroyed by firms having their head-quarters in London, and remitting there any profits that they may make. I hope that the' Committee will deal fairly with the industries of Tasmania, and make the amendment requested by the Senate, reducing the duty to½d. per lb. </para>

                    <para>.- I regret that some honorable members should desire to deal with this duty on a wholly different basis from that on which we have approached the consideration of other items. In determining what should be the duty imposed on any article. I am not concerned with the relations between the firms engaged in its manufacture. My contention is, as it was when the Tariff was first under consideration, that stearine and paraffine represent the chief labour involved in the manufacture of candles, and that we should not be justified in imposing a heavy duty solely to protect those engaged in the moulding branch of the industry. The greater part of the labour involved in the making of candles relates really to the production of stearine and its byproducts, on the one hand, and to paraffine as a by-product of oil production on the other. The stearine and paraffine having been manufactured and made available, only a few boys are necessary to mould all the candles required to supply any one State. If this request be agreed to, we shall have the anomaly of a duty of1½d. per lb. on candles, and of only½d. per lb. on the stearine and paraffine used in their manufacture. In other words, those engaged in the manufacture of stearine and paraffine will be protected to the extent only of½d. per lb., whilst a protection of 1d. per lb. will be given to those engaged in moulding. </para>

                        <para>- If I am wrong, the honorable member may correct me. Between 3,000 and 4,000 are employed directly and indirectly in the manufacture of stearine and its by-products. We have to remember the men engaged in producing the machinery used in the. industry, the miners employed in getting out the coal consumed by it, and the fact that only Australian materials are used in it. I should not allow paraffine wax to be used in the manufacture of candles intended for use in mines on the mainland, and X think that the same rule might also be applied with advantage to Tasmania. Plants which were previously producing stearine are now lying idle. I desire the duties to be so arranged that we shall have genuine stearine candles placed on the market: Certain firms are importing paraffine wax and employing 75 per cent. of it in the manufacture of candles, only 25 per cent. of stearine being used. Candles so made are purchased by people who imagine that they are obtaining a really good article, when, as a matter of fact, they are purchasing that which is absolutely dear at any price. </para>

In this State there are men working 4,000 feet below the surface, under conditions that are bad from almost every stand-point. The miners find that paraffine wax candles give off a disagreeable odour, and they are loud in their demand for a better article. I find, on looking at the schedule, that the duty on candles made wholly or partly of paraffine wax is1½d. per lb. </para>

If we are to place this duty on an equitable basis, we must take care to give the larger measure of protection to those engaged in the manufacture of stearine and wax, since the labour involved in that branch of manufacture is far in excess of that required for the moulding of candles. We should refuse the Senate's request, and so compel our own manufacturers to put a good stearine candle on the market. </para>

                        <para>- So far as one can judge, there does not appear to be ground for the allegation that a monopoly exists, having in view the fact that candles are imported into Victoria from New South Wales and South Australia, and that Victorian and South Australian candles are also used in New South Wales. I do not deny that paraffine wax is used in the manufacture of composite candles here, because the Customs statistics show that, as the local production of candles has increased, our imports of paraffine wax have also increased. . I desire to do away with that importation. It is difficult, by looking at them, to distinguish between a pure stearine candle and one made chiefly of paraffine wax, but as soon as one of the latter is placed in a buggy lamp or in a mine, and subjected to any heat, it bends, and may be tied in a knot. Many people buy composite candles, believing that they are made of stearine. I should like to see stearine more generally used. Tallow, even in its raw state, will furnish a good light for the miner ; converted into stearine, it makes the best candles of which I know. By adopting a policy which will lead to the general manufacture of. stearine candles in Australia, we shall benefit, not only those employed in the stearine industry, but pastoralists and farmers engaged in raising cattle, as well as the consumers generally. </para>

                        <para>- Some are made in my own electorate. If we reject this request, we shall not place the industry in Tasmania in a worse position than it occupied before this Tariff was introduced. Those engaged there in moulding wax into candles then had the protection of a duty of½d. per lb., and if we reject this request they will continue to enjoy the same measure of protection. ' Listening to the speeches of some of the representatives of Tasmania, one would imagine that it was proposed to do an injury to the industry in that State. We have no desire to do anything of the kind ; but those who favour this request are really seeking to destroy a big industry in Australia by granting a protection of1d. per lb. to those engaged in moulding candles, whilst allowing a protection of only½d. per lb. on the production of stearine. The official statistics show that our imports of paraffine wax have largely increased since 1902. In 1904 we imported £13,648 worth; in 1905, £42,269 worth; and in 1906, £76,345 worth. </para>

                        <para>- The figures I have quoted support my contention that stearine candles are not being made here as largely as they ought to be. I hope that this request will be refused. The Committee should see that the duty is fixed with some regard for the labour employed in the industry. If the duty of1d. is imposed the Tasmanian moulders referred to will still be employed. We know that after the moulds are arranged a few boys could look after the moulding of all the candles required in any State. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not propose to debate the merits of the question, but only to say that honorable members are urging that the use of paraffine wax candles in mines is deleterious to health, and that that is a complaint which in my opinion might be more properly addressed to the State Legislatures, who are vested with power to prevent the use of such candles in mines. Unless honorable members can prove that the use of these candles in any connexion is deleterious to health, they will forgive me for saying that I think it is idle for them to address the Committee on this question. Whilst the honorable member for Franklin was speaking, I understood the Treasurer to interject that he intended to ring up Messrs. Kitchen and Son. </para>

Honorable members' are here as the trustees of the general public, dealing with a Tariff matter of extreme importance to manufacturers, importers, workers, and consumers. Although the consumers include all classes, we have here a Minister of the Crown prepared privately to consult one manufacturer, a unit of one section in the community, who is, of course, not on oath, as to .whether he should not penalize the whole of the consumers in Australia. The Treasurer, apparently, is prepared to learn over a telephone wire, or in some other secret way, information on which to take action to penalize the general public. I can only regard that circumstance as very unfortunate. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to correct a statement made by the honorable member for Newcastle, to the effect that there are not more than five adults engaged in the candle-moulding industry. If the Senate's request be not agreed to it will involve a loss of work for thirty hands, the majority of whom are adults, in Tasmania alone. The statement of the honorable member fox Newcastle would imply that the whole of the. bad candles, to which he has referred, were made in Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member said that to retain the old duty would only throw out of employment a few men working in Tasmania. He then went on to speak of the injurious effects of the use of these candles in mines. When I spoke on the question, I said I knew what was being done in Tasmania, but that I" did not know what was being done in other parts of Australia. It may be assumed that the effect of reducing this duty would be to throw out of employment a number of hands in other parts of Australia where the candles referred to are made, since the candles made in Tasmania are not sent to the mainland, and are not used in any mines. I hope the Committee will consider that aspect of the matter. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Committee will consider very carefully before they accept the proposal of the Treasurer. The interests of the confectionery industry would be very well protected by means of a duty of 2½d. per lb., especially when we remember that the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 2d., whilst the old duty was only1d. The decision of the Senate was arrived at after much thought and debate; and all the arguments in the contrary direction are rather for prohibition than for adequate protection. This is not a case of a strangled industry, because manufactories and employes are multiplying, while there is exported annually nearly 400.000 lbs. of confectionery. Under all the circumstances, we ought to accede to the request of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- This motion has been submitted very quietly, as though there was some intention to smuggle it through, but I desire that the facts should be known. Glucose, I understand, is in America made from old boots and things of that sort, and is used, amongst other purposes, for fortifying champagne. Paraffine wax is extracted from shale and refined petroleum; and I ask whether that is a proper ingredient for confectionery ?. Then, I do not like to think of the public chewing plaster of Paris. This material is bad enough in Italian statuary as an apology for art, and is still worse as an apology for food. I ask the Committee to indorse the request of the Senate, and, if possible, to go further and prohibit the importation of any such confectionery. It has been said that this is not a strangled industry, though it would appear that the ingredients used are well calculated to choke those who consume such confectionery. </para>

There seems to be a difference of opinion as to whether or not glucose is injurious; but I am quite willing to allow that commodity to be used , in the manufacture of sweetmeats. Doubtless the Minister will promise, if we agree to the duty of4d., that he will exercise his powers of prohibition, if he finds that ingredients so injurious as paraffine wax and plaster of Paris are still being used. </para>

                        <para>- Precisely ; but we have power in this connexion to deal only with goods that come oversea. The Commerce Act, the virtues of which the honorable member for Hindmarsh extols, and which he assisted in passing, cannot apply to any commodity produced locally, however injurious it may be. The suggestion of the honorable member means that foreign makers shall be prevented from sending here confectionery containing plaster of Paris or paraffine wax, while local manufacturers shall be allowed to use those ingredients without restriction. This request originated in the Senate, with an idea of following up the import duty with an Excise duty of a similar amount on locally-produced confectionery. </para>

We only penalize the importation of this stuff ; we do not prohibit it. If the importers can get through the fourpenny Tariff, they can poison all Australia so far as this provision is concerned. If we think this kind of thing ought not to come in, the proper course to take would be to prohibit it altogether. I believe the Minister has that power. </para>

                        <para>- Therefore, the Victorian State authorities have already taken action to protect the people from that kind of thing. We may agree to the Minister's motion on account of the fact that the. request only partly carries out the Senate's intention. Had they completed their work, as they intended  to do, they would have proposed to penalize the local manufacture, as well as the importation, of these substances. That would be fair. If any proposal is made to leave out glucose, and to adopt tha remainder of the requested amendment, I shall be compelled to vote for it. </para>

                        <para>- The stage for imposing an Excise duty has passed. The idea in the Senate, when this request was agreed to, was to impose an Excise duty also, so as to reach the local manufacturer. The Minister has all the power necessary to prohibit importations, but I do not want him or the Committee to fall into the trap of preventing the importation of certain goods because they contain ingredients the use of which is allowed in Australia. That- would be placing a dangerous weapon in the hands of a keen protectionist, such as the Treasurer is, but I do. not think that he would use his .power to that extent. The Minister's motion should be agreed to. The State authorities can if they like deal with the sale, not only of locally-made, but of imported confectionery containing these substances. Victoria has done so, and other States can do the same. </para>

                    <para>.- At the present stage of the manufacture of sweets, glucose is absolutely necessary in many of them. Chocolate creams and confections of that kind could not be made as a commercial commodity without it. It prevents them from getting hard. We are all at one in not wanting ourselves or our children to be poisoned with plaster ' of Paris or paraffine wax. But the difficulty is that a fourpenny duty will not prohibit the importation of confectionery containing those substances. It will not prohibit the importation of those light ornaments used on wedding cakes. But if we agree  to the requested amendment, while the articles could still be imported the Minister of Trade and Customs would not be able to exercise his power of prohibition under the Commerce Act, because there would be this express enactment in the Customs Tariff Act allowing them to be imported at a certain rate of duty. If we do not make this provision in the Customs Tariff Act, the Minister of Trade and Customs, if convinced that the articles are deleterious, can prohibit their importation under the Commerce Act. Therefore the course advocated by the honorable member for Dalley may be the very means of allowing these things to be imported. It will be better to leave the matter to the discretion of the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- It is very undesirable that these distinctions should be made, such as having one rate of duty below a certain invoice price, and another rate of duty above it, more especially in an article which is not of large consumption or of very large importation. It only creates confusion to have the difference between the duty on an article which costs1s. and on an article which costs1s.0¼d., not merely one of amount, as under an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, but the difference between a fixed rate and an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate. It only complicates the Tariff and makes the difficulties greater for the Department and the importers. The Minister should adopt either an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> or a fixed rate throughout. ' I am not suggesting to him what that rate should be. </para>

                        <para>- There are very few instances of the kind now proposed. A duty of 3d.per lb. oh the cheaper grades of liquorice is very much more per cent. than is a duty of 25 per cent. on the dearer grades. Is that desirable? In the interests of the Department, as well as of the importers, the Minister should consider the advisability of either preserving the old duty, or imposing an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty all round. I think that all kinds of liquorice should be subjected to a similar duty, whether it be <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> or per lb. </para>

                        <para>- If the Minister wishes to bring liquorice under the same rate of duty as confectionery, it should be made dutiable at 3d. per lb. all round. Some descriptions of confectionery cost much mare than1s. per lb., and are dutiable at 3d. per lb. But in the case of liquorice,' a different method is adopted, and what is a comparatively small item as compared with confectionery, is divided into two classes, one class being subjected to a fixed duty, and the other to an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. No necessity has been found to deal in that way with the much larger item of confectionery. The Minister is seeking to make a difference, which, I assure him, will prove very often inconvenient to the Department, and often puzzling to the importers. He says that he desires to put liquorice on the same footing as confectionery, but the Senate has put it ora quite a different footing. I ask him to carry out his own intention. </para>

                    <para>.- It is very difficult, indeed, to hear exactly what view the Minister expresses when the discussion is carried on in an undertone. So far as I understand the position, he wants the Committee to disagree with .the Senate's request that liquorice should bear a duty of 2d. per lb. I entirely agree with the last speaker that a composite  duty on a small item of this kind is highly objectionable. If the Minister would agree to impose a specific duty of 2½d. per lb. on all kinds of liquorice, the trade would know better how they stood. But to differentiate between grades of liquorice, and to levy a duty of 25 per cent, on liquorice invoiced at more that is. per lb., is to introduce a complication, for which I fail to see any justification. I trust that the Committee will resist the attempt to impose a composite duty, because it would be against the interests of the trade. The manufacture of pure liquorice of proper weight is being undertaken by a leading firm here, and deserves support at the hands of the Committee. The Minister has not made a sufficient explanation to enable us to understand properly the attitude of the Government on this item. I think that we are entitled to know' the reasons which are actuating them. . </para>

                    <para>. - I am asking the Committee to disagree with the Senate's request to reduce the duty on certain grades of liquorice from 3d. to 2d. per lb. The request to impose a duty of 25 per cent, on liquorice invoiced at more than is. per lb. was agreed to by the Ministers in the Senate, and for fairly good reasons, I believe. I do not feel quite justified in repudiating what they did. on that occasion. </para>

Surely he must know that some grades of confectionery are invoiced at more than is. per lb. ! I really' cannot understand his objection to a pro'posal which if adopted would be to the advantage of the Department. I' intend to ask the Committee to make the duty iri the general Tariff 3d. per lb. </para>

Since the Tariff was passed by this House it has been found that importers have been importing, in tins or bottles, fish preserved in salt and brine, and have been demanding its admission under paragraph  d  of this item at 5s. per cwt. The Department has had no option but to admit the goods at that rate. The proposed modification of the Senate's request will remove all possible doubt as to what was our intention in regard to the duty chargeable upon goods covered by this paragraph. I, therefore, move - </para>

                    <para>. - This is one of the items to which the Treasurer assented when it was previously under consideration in this Chamber. I then raised the question as to why a duty of 4d. per lb. should be imposed upon dried herbs, seeing that dried vegetables were dutiable only at 20 per cent. A duty of 4d. per lb. upon dried herbs is an enormous one, and I fail to see why we should differentiate between the rate levied upon those herbs and that imposed upon dried vegetables. The Treasurer agreed to make the duty 20 per cent. I have before me the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the debate when that proposal was accepted by him. The only difference between dried vegetables and dried herbs is that dried vegetables go direct to the consumer, whilst dried herbs are used by manufacturers. This duty is therefore a tax upon them. Surely if a duty of 20 per cent. on dried vegetables is sufficient, that rate should also be sufficient for dried herbs. </para>

                        <para>- In the drying of such vegetables as cabbages, carrots, and potatoes, the loss is greater than in drying herbs. Honorable members have received many protests from manufacturers who use dried herbs, and who do not see why they should be called upon to pay 4d. per lb., which in many cases is over 100 per cent., whereas the users of dried vegetables are only charged 20 per cent. I am rather surprised that the Treasurer should speak of not desiring to depart from anything that his colleague has agreed to in another place, whilst he allows his colleague elsewhere to depart from the arrangement made in this House. </para>

                        <para>- The suggestion is worthy of the honorable member. The Treasurer ought to be consistent and agree to the duty of 20 per cent. I think that the two questions involved in the item should be dealt with separately. </para>

                    <para>.-I have a distinct recollection of the somewhat protracted debate which took place on this rather small item when the Tariff was last before us. The Treasurer then accepted the suggestion for a 20 per cent. duty. As the honorable member for North Sydney has pointed out, dried herbs are the raw material of various industries. Surely, therefore, it must commend itself  to protectionists that the duty should not be as high as that on the finished article. The makers of sauces and chutneys, and butchers who make sausages, have to use dried herbs. It is inconsistent in honorable members to contend for a duty of 4d. per lb. on a raw material whilst they support a duty of 20 per cent. on a finished article. The Treasurer has given us no reason for accepting the suggestion, and unless the honorable member for New England has some sage reasons to advance I shall not support it. </para>

                    <para>.- I  wish the Government and the Committee to accept the Senate's request with a modification. I intend to propose the addition of the words " not to come into force until 31st October, 1908." That would be practically six months from the present date. My reason for proposing this modification of the Senate's request is that, in the northern part of Victoria and the southwestern part of New  South  Wales, stock are dying in thousands consequence of the existence of a drought . In some districts it is impossible for stock-owners to obtain fodder for their stock at any price. In other districts, I was informed no later than yesterday, that  £8  per ton is being paid for bad chaff, which is purchased by stock-owners to keep their sheep, dairy cattle, and working horses alive. Whilst I am always prepared to protect native industries, I believe  I  can assume that people in more favoured districts, who have a little surplus of fodder at the present time, have no wish to take advantage of persons in less favoured districts, who are being ruined day after day in consequence of the lack of fodder for their stock. </para>
