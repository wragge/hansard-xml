                        <para>Speaking with a thorough knowledge of the present position of affairs in Papua, the Bishop, in the course of conversation yesterday, remarked that it was unfortunately the fact that the white population there is practically divided into two camps, and the aspirants for the important position shortly to be filled are the acknowledged heads of these camps. Should either succeed in getting the appointment the cleavage of parties would most probably become still more marked, and however unjust it might be there would always be the suspicion of partisanship in the decision of. matters in which the two camps were deeply interested. What is wanted, therefore, is a strong man who would have no local prejudices, and who would not from the start of his administration have to overcome the feeling that he was a partisan, but who might by tact and firmness be able to reconcile the differences which now exist, and which, if not removed, might easily operate to the detriment of the Commonwealth possession. </para>

                        <para>- It is difficult to understand. His Lordship's allusion, because the names most frequently mentioned in the press of late are not those of the head's of opposing camps. There were, formerly, two camps in Papua, but one of them has practically disappeared from the Administration. In my opinion, it is necessary that the charges which have been made shall be finally dealt with before any appointment is decided upon. </para>

I hope to lay on the table at an early date a letter from the Premier of Victoria, in which the lands available and about to be made available are set out in detail. Under the circumstances, I invite the honorable member to accept this as a sufficient reply for the time being to the first two questions. The third will be answered by letters from the Premiers of the other States. In reply to No. 4, the whole of the steps proposed to be taken to secure immigration will be dealt with in connexion with the next Estimates. </para>

                        <para>- It is stated in the press that Messrs. Harris, Scarfe and Company have been punished for eight contraventions of the Customs Act, there being four complaints of omission of charges from entry, and misdescription of goods, two of understatement of quantity for duty, and one of undervaluation of goods. The fines imposed total£25. Are these contraventions part of the seventeen charges which it was understood would be placed before the Law Courts ? Does the Minister of Trade and Customs not think it a travesty of justice to impose a penalty of£25 for offences of such enormity, and so many ? </para>

                        <para>- The matter relates to the Treasury. The reason no provision is made in the Additional Estimates for the claims of other candidates is that when they were framed I had not received full and complete statements of claim in respect of them. No detailed application had been received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy.</inline> This morning, however, I received three applications, including one from that gentleman, and after consultation with the Prime Minister I have decided to bring in a short Bill covering these claims immediately after the Additional Estimates have been disposed of. I am obtaining the particulars as rapidly as possible. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment which has been moved will enable my remarks to take a wider range than would otherwise have been open to me. The item relates to the permanent head of the Post and Telegraph Department, and we know that a great deal depends upon the manner in which his duties are discharged. I have considered very seriously the proposals which the Government have made in order to bring this Department into a better state of efficiency, and the selection of a Committee composed of three Ministers seems to me a very extraordinary method of endeavouring to elicit the truth. In the first place, this Committee will sit in judgment, either upon the. present Postmaster-General, who is a member of the Committee, or the late Postmaster-General. Both of these honorable gentlemen have been in charge of the Department for two or three years, to say nothing of previous periods ; and it seems to me extraordinary that an inquiry, which is intended to be thorough and impartial, should be conducted by gentlemen who will have to sit in judgment on their colleagues. How can we expect, under these circumstances, a thorough investigation of abuses in the Department ? </para>

                        <para>-But it is in regard to the organization that complaint arises. No one would impute to any Postmaster-General any desire but to do the best for the Department. I am happy to say of all Ministers who have occupied office in the Commonwealth Government, that there is not one who has not been possessed by the most honorable desire to discharge his duties to the best of his ability. No personal question, I am sure, can arise in connexion with either the late Postmaster-General, the present Postmaster-General, or any preceding Postmaster-General ; but the public require something more than honorable intentions. What is desired is efficient administration; and there is not a Department, whether in the State or the Federal sphere, which is in a state of greater chaos, or which is giving less satisfaction to the public, than the Department of the Postmaster-General. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to impute blame to any one, nor do I think the honorable member has any such desire ; but the House and the public look for a proper inquiry in order to ascertain who is really at fault: There is no desire to prejudge ; we begin with the feeling that the Department is ina grossly disorganized condition ; and, without imputing any blame, we desire to know the cause of the disorganization. As I have already said, it seems to me an extraordinary way of probing these matters, to appoint, as a Committee, three members of the Cabinet, who cannot be expected, in the course of human nature - without any imputation against their integrity - to investigate in the same fearless way that some disinterested person would be able to do. The Postmaster-General is just as much involved in this inquiry as any officer in the Department. He is the head-centre of the whole; and his conduct is just as much a subject of inquiry as is the conduct of the humblest officer. What would be said, for instance, if any member of the Committee were in close relationship to the Secretary to the Department? We find, however, that the highest officer of all, on whom the whole burden of responsibility rests, is to be judged in a sort of Cabinet council by his own colleagues. The very Minister who is at the head of the Department, and whose conduct must be the subject of inquiry, is one of the persons chosen to make the investigation ; and in that respect we have a comicality that we should not expect to find outside the pages of Gilbert and Sullivan. There are complaints about the management of the Postmaster-General ; and yet that honorable gentleman is deputed to inquire into the complaints ; the person who is himself accused of mismanagement - nothing worse than errors of judgment, or, perhaps, want of capacity - is to be one of the judges ; and how can we expect the public to be satisfied with such an inquiry? I cannot, at the present stage, refer to the Additional Estimates in detail ; but everything that has been said about sweating in the Department, and about the miserable salaries paid, is justified by these Estimates. An enormous number of new officers are found to be necessary. </para>

And, further, in spite of the fact that this large number of new officers are to be appointed, thousands of pounds are placed on the Additional Estimates to provide temporary assistance. What does that mean ? It means that the Department is escaping the necessity of properly manning and equipping the branches, by engaging a number of employés who are not on the regular staff. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know by whom any votes were struck off the main Estimates ; the fact that the money is provided on the Additional Estimates shows that it has to be spent in the three months. If we multiply this£20,000 by four, we have£80,000 which ought to have been spent in New South Wales alone in carrying on this service in a state of efficiency without overworking the men or cutting down salaries. This proposed vote is in itself a revelation, and the most damning proof of all that has been said about the disorganization in the Department. Can we expect Ministers to conduct a fearless inquiry into their own conduct and their own responsibilities? Personally, I have no such expectation. Just consider the magnitude of the responsibility that rests on the Postmaster- General. In my opinion, that Minister has greater pressure on him, in the way of actual work and responsibility, than any other member of the Government. Of course, when a Tariff is under consideration, the Minister of Trade and Customs has to bear an enormous strain ; but that can be regarded as a mere passing emergency. Taking the Departments in their normal state, there is not  one in which the Minister has more to do than has the Postmaster-General. Indeed, there is. work in the Post and Telegraph Department for, perhaps, two Ministers ; and how is it possible for the Postmaster-General to act on this inquiry, which will involve enormous labour and research, and, probably, visits to other parts of the Commonwealth. How can' he properly perform his departmental duties while he is engaged in a roving commission ? If the Postmaster-General were the ablest and most industrious man in the world, and giving him credit for all the diligence and ability he may possess, it would be physically and. intellectually impossible for him to carry on the every-day work of this enormous Department all over Australia, and at the same time act as a capable and efficient  president  of the proposed' inquiry. .Surely in these matters we must act with some dim perception of business commonsense? The mere fact that we are a Parliament surely ought not to divorce us from considerations of ordinary prudence. What man who had an enormous business concern on his shoulders would dream of taking on some '.other enormous business, when his own concerns were more than enough to absorb all his energies and abilities? The head of a business, if anything was wrong, and he himself could not leave the helm, would not leave it to undertake inquiries in various branches. He would prefer to exercise his own judgment upon investigations made by others, and he would desire to have them made as thoroughly and as fearlessly as possible. Suppose a report from the Committee comes before this House. The Postmaster-General cannot be expected to sit in judgment on his own report. What we want from the Postmaster-General is that - when a report is presented to the Government, and to Parliament, the honorable gentleman should have his head clear and free from' any concern but the investigation itself,  and should be able to give the Government the 'best advice on the report which has come before him. ' But with the preparation of it he should have nothing whatever to do. &gt;  His-  function is a much higher one. The function of the Minister and that of the Government is a much higher one than that of investigation, of going from one place to another, investigating alleged abuses, and examining clerks, and hearing what the officers of the Department have to say. That is a most important duty it is true ; but what will be the position of a clerk In the presence of the Minister? Does the honorable gentleman put an officer of his Department in a fair position when that officer has his Minister sitting over him? If his evidence is unpleasant to the Minister, if instead of saying smooth .and pleasant things, he has to say, in the course of his duty, strong and rough things about the way the Department is administered, ana about injustices which have occurred, how can he be expected to do so before the Minister, who is sitting in judgment over him ? How can he give his evidence in the way in which we should like him to give it ? Every word said in commendation of the Department is a tribute to the Minister, every word of criticism is a criticism of Ministers who have had charge of the Department. ' Is it not enough to ask an officer to criticise his superiors," without having the Minister sitting in judgment upon him? Is not that enough, I ask? I wish to enter, on behalf of the Post and Telegraph officers, and the telephone attendants, of all ranks, high and low, my most indignant protest against putting them in the hands of a Ministerial coterie. They should be placed in the hands of some independent, fearless tribunal, which would have nothing to do with the Department. Instead of that, they are to be brought in touch with the Minister, at a time when they should be most fearless, and when they should have some protection behind them in directing attention to. things which point to inefficiency of administration and to neglect. I do not anticipate any good whatever from an inquiry so conducted. I quite agree that the Ministry are in a difficulty in this matter. Any Ministry is in such a position when there are imputations against the efficiency of a Department. Every Ministry is necessarily put in a position of difficulty then. If the power were proposed to be taken out of the hands of a Minister to deal with a Department - say by a Committee of this House - I could quite understand the Ministry saying, " We are responsible to Parliament ; if you want to set up a Committee an judgment upon us in the person of our Postmaster-General, we decline to occupy such a position." But in this case that has not been done. The House has not asked the Government to accept any position of indignity in any  shape or form. The Government  themselves have clone this. They have themselves considered it necessary to institute some authoritative inquiry. I say that if the Government came to the conclusion that an inquiry was necessary - that there were things that required to be probed and examined and reported upon - the next duty of the Ministry was to appoint some competent, disinterested, and impartial body to inquire into those matters, and to report upon them. But instead of the legitimate demands of the public being satisfied, instead of this House being guided in the way that it wanted guiding in dealing with these matters, we have had a Committee appointed which is bound to fail, because there is not the root idea of confidence and impartiality in the tribunal before whom the men upon whose testimony we rely will appear. Every one of these officers who appears, voicing the dissatisfaction and discontent of the Service, complaining of injustice, complaining of wrong, complaining of neglect, complaining of miserable administration in this business of the Post Office, will be himself sat in judgment upon by the Minister who conducts that Department. That is a very awkward position to put any man in. Instead of encouraging men to come and give us the benefit of their real honest knowledge and experience, the Ministry have appointed a Committee which will destroy the possibility of our obtaining the testimony we wish to obtain. </para>

                        <para>- No; I was not there. I had a softer billet than any billet in the Post and Telegraph Department seems to be. In fact, it was so soft that. I could not stick to it; I had to leave it. What I say about bringing members of the Public Service before a Committee such as this is, that if they are expected to make the freest and fullest exposure of any irregularities in their Department, and of any shortcomings in their superiors, the Ministry should have had to examine them a Commission which would protect them in every possible way. They should not be called upon to criticise the man who sits in judgment upon them. That is a monstrous position to put any public servant in. But that is the position these public servants will occupy. I do not expect a frank and fearless disclosure before such a Committee. It is no reflection on these public servants at all to say that one of the drawbacks to life in a business like theirs is this : I do not care how honorable you are, I do not care how fearless you are, and I do not care how able you are - you have always a row of men above you who have a tremendous influence over your future career. It is one of the painful incidents of the Public Service that the members of it have joined themselves to an occupation, during the whole course of which they must be under some one - under a number of superiors - probably each one of whom can have an unfavorable influence upon their career and advancement. That is in itself a sufficiently hard position for these officers of all ranks to be put in. I enter my emphatic protest against the nature of this Committee, and I wish to say that whatever they may do, I am satisfied that the inquiry cannot be a thorough and fearless one. </para>

The figures are somewhat remarkable. I find that during the last year or two the expenditure has been increasing by leaps and bounds; not consistently with the natural expansion which takes place in the administration of a great Department like this, but to a very much greater degree than can be properly attributed to that cause. I wish to direct the attention of honorable members to a few of the figures, and to ask the Postmaster-General if he can give the Committee some explanation of what they show. If I am wrong no doubt the honorable gentleman will set me right, but to put the matter shortly, what I find is that the revenue this year is estimated to have been increased by £178,000, which represents an increase of 5.6 per cent. But whilst that is so, the expenditure of this Department as shown by the general Estimates, and without taking into account the Additional Estimates at all- </para>

                        <para>- I am just going to tell the honorable member. I find, further, adopting the same rule and taking into account the statements placed before us by the Treasurer as to the Additional Estimates, which will involve the Committee voting £107,000 more, that, whilst the revenue will have been increased by 5.6 per cent., the expenditure will have been increased by no less than 11.5 per cent. in the one year. </para>

                        <para>-  Yes, there must be. The honorable member for Flinders has quoted figures based upon the Additional Estimates, and it will be necessary for me, in following him, to quote my own figures, which I intended to quote only when submitting the Additional Estimates. The speech which the honorable member is making, if permitted to continue, must lead to a general debate on the Additional Estimates at this stage, as well as when those Estimates are immediately before the Committee. </para>

I understand that there is no vote  in  the Additional Estimates affecting the Secretary and the administrative branch of the Department. </para>

                        <para>- I point out that on the first vote in these Estimates for the Secretary and Assistant Secretary, we have taken the general discussion and review of the whole Department. That being so, I feel that when we come to discuss the Additional Estimates, it will be my duty to  confine the remarks of honorable members to the special items contained in those Estimates. In the circumstances, I think it would be more convenient for the Committee to continue the general discussion now. </para>

                        <para>- The position I desire to establish is that whilst the revenue has increased only by the comparatively small amount of 5.6 per cent. over lastyear's figures, and whilst we might naturally expect the expenditure also to increase in the same reasonable proportion, I find that if we take the Additional Estimates into account, the expenditure has increased by the very extraordinary amount of 1 1. 5 per cent. in one year. The honorable member for Grey asked me what I have included in expenditure, and the question is a very pertinent one. The difficulty in which we all find ourselves in discussing the Estimates of the Post and Telegraph Department is that the accounts of the Department - and I am not blaming the Government in this matter, because they are only following the rule - are not presented to the Committee in such a way as to enable honorable members to form an intelligible idea of the working of the Department from a financial point of view, as they certainly would be able to do if they were dealing with the accounts of any ordinary business concern. I join with the honorable member for Fawkner and other honorable members who have preceded me in urging the necessity of as soon as possible endeavouring to present the figures of the Post and Telegraph Department as the accounts of a going concern, so that we might be able to see what is properly attributable to expenditure, and what to revenue. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad to hear it, and I shall be glad to hear some details as to the steps which have been taken. At present we are in the dark, and must make the best conjecture we can. The great difficulty is that in addition to the total expenditure of the Department which is shown on page 44 of the Budget papers, a very large sum appears under the heading of " New Works and Additions." Parliament in its wisdom has adopted the policy that these should be paid for out of revenue - a very wise policy in which I think we should all concur as far as it can practicably be done - but paying them out of revenue does not in the least mean that they ought to be debited to revenue in a capital account. To order to see whether the Post Office is really working as a business concern ought to work, it is essential that there should be something like a capital and revenue account - some means by which we should be able to see how much is attributable to revenue and how much ought to be put down to capital. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is quite right in the abstract, but although you may not have a sinking fund, you ought to debit expenditure of that kind to capital. This year a sum of £434,000 is paid out of the revenue of this year towards this expenditure of the Department. The House has declared that it should be paid out of revenue, and I think I should be quite justified in asserting that the House, in saying that it ought to be debited to the annual expenditure, has also expressed the opinion that it ought to be paid out of the annual revenue, but I do not think it would be quite fair to do so in dealing with the accounts of the Post Office as a business concern, because a good deal of the money which is expended out of revenue is expenditure which is ordinarily met by payment out of moneys borrowed. </para>

                        <para>- I think so. But whether it has in fact been paid out of borrowed money or not is not the question to which I am asking the attention of the Committee. If a business firm builds a house out of revenue, or sets up machinery pf a comparatively enduring character, it would not be proper to debit that as part of the ordinary annual expenditure. It ought to be spread over a number of years. I am making this allowance, which diminishes the strength of my case, but I think it is a fair one to make. </para>

                        <para>- 1 am glad that the Minister agrees with that statement. There will be found on page 45 of the Budget papers what is called a comparison  of the years 1901 to 1908, and under the head of Postmaster-General appear on that page the various sums which in each of those years was expended out of revenue towards " New Works and Additions," commencing with a moderate sum in 1901-2, and reaching a very large amount this year. In the first year the total was ,£37,000 ; in 1:902-3 it was £i35&gt;°°°; in i9°3-4 £187,000; in 1904-5, £131,000; m 1905-6, £146,000; and in 1906-7, £276,000, while this year it is £434,000. I am quite prepared to admit that instead of attributing the whole of the ,£434,000 to this year- </para>

                        <para>- True. I have given the Minister the benefit of the smaller expenditures in previous years, and instead of taking the average of the last three or four years, have gone back to the beginning, taking the weak as well as the strong years. Upon that basis, and assuming that we are justified in saying that these expenditures are of a kind that ought to be spread over ten years, the expenditure this year, instead of being £434,000, comes to £134,000 - I arrive at that sum by adding up all those expenditures and taking one-tenth of them - and not £52,000 as suggested by the Minister. If that is not a fair mode of trying to reduce this to a business proposition, I should like to have some other suggestion from those who are responsible for carrying on the Department. I am glad that the Minister agrees with me in the. estimate which  1,  quite independently, arrived at, of what ought to be attributed to each year. </para>

                        <para>-I should regard it as a very feeble combination if I had not the Minister's concurrence. That amount has then to be added to the expenditure of this year. In order to make a fair comparison you must also add to the expenditure of last year its- proper share of the additions which had been paid for in that year and in the preceding years, and so on back to the beginning. By so doing, you will arrive at a proper account. Without wearying honorable members by going into the actual calculation, which every one can make for himself from pages 44 and 45 of the Budget papers, I find the result to be as I have stated - that the expenditure has been increased by £219,000 this year. Last year's expenditure, as appears from page 44 of the Budget papers, was £2,689,000. I have to add to that year its tenth of the various payments for preceding years. </para>

                        <para>- The amount of one-tenth, which ought to be attributed to expenditure each year includes the tenth of each preceding year. I have added up the various tenths which ought to have been attributed to last year - the figures are all to be found in the Budget- papers - and I find that they amount to £91,000. That sum, added to the £2,689,000, would produce £2,780,000. During the present financial year, adding the £134,000 - which represents its proportion - to the £2,865,000, gives us a total of £2,999,000. I find, therefore, that these Estimates - without touching the Additional Estimates at all - represent an increased expenditure of £219,000, which is equal to 7.8 per cent. So that in respect of these Estimates alone, without taking into account one penny of the £100,000 additional which is being expended, we find that whilst the revenue has increased by only 5.6, the expenditure has increased by 7.8 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt. When we come to the Additional Estimates, we find that they provide for an increase in the ordinary expenditure of the Department of £107,000, in addition to an expenditure of £63,000 upon new works, without one single farthing being added to the revenue. But I put aside for the moment the £63,000 provided for additional works - the whole of which ought not to be contributed by this year, but only one-tenth of it - as immaterial. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I am quite prepared to admit that in a great Department like the Post Office, and in a progressive country like Australia, there must be a continual, steady increase of expenditure in proportion to the revenue received. But I think it has always been the endeavour of every Department, and of every Minister, to see that, as far as possible, the increased expenditure shall bear a reasonable ratio to the increased revenue - that it shall, if anything, be somewhat less. </para>

                        <para>- If they have not been paid, they ought to be. Everybody is quite prepared to see justice done in that direction. But the Postmaster-General ought to tell us exactly why this additional bill is presented to us. As yet, we have had no really satisfactory information upon the subject. No one will welcome such information more than I shall, but I thought it necessary to put these plain figures before the Committee, in order to elicit information. </para>

                    <para>. - The discussion of the Additional Estimates this afternoon has taken me somewhat by surprise. Probably, sir, your ruling is correct, but I did not anticipate that the Additional Estimates would be discussed before the consideration of the Estimates-in-Chief had been concluded. If I interpret your decision aright, it is that at this period a discussion may take place upon the Additional Estimates, as well as upon the Estimates-in-Chief? </para>

                        <para>-Perhaps I cannot satisfy honorable members in that regard. I am not going to be placed in a false position because, as honorable members know, the Treasurer has practically no control over the administration of any Department. I am not blaming the Postmaster-General at all for the increased expenditure proposed, because I know what a huge Department he has to administer. But for my own protection I desire to place upon record the reasons why I have been compelled to submit these Additional Estimates. With your permission, sir, I wish to trace, as briefly as I can, the history of the growth of the increased expenditure of this Department up to the present stage. These Additional Estimates provide for a total expenditure of£571,028. </para>

                        <para>-  I rise to order, sir, because it appears to me that the Treasurer is attempting to depart from your ruling. He has mentioned that " these " Estimates provide the sum of  £571,028.  That is the total amount of the Additional Estimates, and I draw your attention to the fact that the Estimates for the Postmaster-General's Department provide  £107,000  and  £63,000,  making a total of£170,000 in round figures. Suppose that the honorable gentleman goes outside the proposed appropriation of  £170,000,  the other items are included in the Estimates for Departments which have already been passed, and we should be unable to discuss the matter. </para>

                        <para>- The provision for this Department includes£107,000 and a lot more. On the Additional Estimates there is provided for the Post and Telegraph Department£107,720 under ordinary votes,£975 under the head of Home Affairs for maintenance,£63,410 under the control of the PostmasterGenralfor new works and buildings, and £27,211 for the erection of post offices, &amp;c., making a total of £199,316 for the Department. I have here a statement which shows the increase of revenue and expenditure. I am sorry that I did not know that the discussion was likely to take this trend, otherwise I would have referred to these items before the honorable member for Flinders spoke, as I could have given him a good deal of detailed information concerning the matters on which he spoke generally. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I shall state the revenue presently, because I have had a return prepared up to date. Honorable members are aware, through the press, that some attacks have been made upon me because I would not and could not provide money enough to supply the requirements of this Department during the last seven or eight months. I propose to quote some figures in order to show how the departmental expenditure has grown since 1900-1, when it was£2, 595,860. In 1901-2 it was £2, 383,815; in 1902-3, £2,568,846; in 1903-4, £2,697,454; in 1904-5, £2,699,667; in 1905-6,£2,784,664; in 1906-7, £2,965,773;while in 1907-8 it is estimated at £3,498,503, showing an increase of£532,730, in 1907-8, as compared with the previousyear. </para>

The appointments made recently, however, have been chiefly to the lower grades of the service. When making my Budget statement, I said that I had been asked to sanction the appointment of 1,000 new hands, to which I demurred ; but I found myself compelled to make provision for the appointment of 669, apportioned among the States as follows: - New South Wales, 267; Victoria, 222; Queensland, 103 ; South Australia, 17 ; Western Australia, 25 ; and Tasmania, 35. During the year, I have been repeatedly applied to by the Postal Department to sanction further expenditure, and the advances which I made over and above the provision on the Estimates practically exhausted my account.

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General will be able to supply those details. I asked the Public Service Commissioner to inquire into the ground for every recommendation made to me, and allowed provision to 'be made only on his certificate; but I found the money for every appointment which he certified to be necessary. I therefore provided for 183 new officers out of the Treasurer's Advance. The Additional Estimates provide for 905 officers, including the 183. These officers are distributed among the States as follows :  - In New South Wales, 480 ; in Victoria, 315; in Queensland, 40; in South Australia, 43 ; in Western Australia, 5; and in Tasmania, 22. Adding these to the number provided in the Estimates-in-Chief, provision in the total Estimates for the current year has been made for 1,574 new permanent appointments. Of these, New South Wales has 747, Victoria 537, Queensland 143, South Australia 60, Western Australia 30, and Tasmania 57. Other appointments to the service do not exceed 60. </para>

                        <para>- When the draft Additional Estimates were sent to me from the Department, although the Postmaster-General was very desirous of obtaining additional expenditure, I found it necessary to reduce his estimates by £73,000. I did that, making what I deemed to be a safe calculation as to the revenue which I should receive, and the amount I should have to expend out of the Commonwealth one-fourth. I gave the Postmaster- General credit for £17,000 in connexion with transfers from London, which he has paid into the revenue, though I declined to do so at first. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so; I have had these matters too much under consideration to get mixed. In conclusion of my remarks upon this particular question, I desire to say that the large increase of permanent employés is to me a source of great concern, and I have agreed to the proposal only in consequence of the continued assertion that the Post and Telegraph Department cannot be efficiently carried on without those extra appointments, and that the employment of so many temporary hands is not conducive to economical working. </para>

                        <para>- I have, because I desire it to be kept as a record. I do not wish it to be possible for the right honorable member for East Sydney, or any other honorable member, five or six years hence, if I live so long, to point to me as the Treasurer who was responsible for this increase of expenditure. I have known such a thing done ; and, therefore, I protect myself on this occasion. I think it is quite true that the employment of so many temporary hands is not conducive to economical working. Permanent hands doubtless work better ; and, if they do not fully know their duties at first, they very soon learn them, and in many respects are preferable to temporary officers. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and I may say that, as Treasurer, I have had to find, I think, £25,000 more than was voted on that score. When I asked why the increased number was necessary, I was told, in addition to the reasons I have already given, that the volume of business was so great as to necessitate the, appointments; and, as I could not provide for the full increase of permanent employés, temporary appointments were made in the meantime. My contention is that, after the number of permanent employes appointed, the number of temporary employes ought to be reduced very considerably. It must not be forgotten that the last year or two have been boom years, and, if bad seasons come, a large army of permanent employés may prove embarrassing. I think that the right honorable member for East </para>

                <para class="block">Sydney has had some experience of similar conditions arising in New South Wales, when the number of public servants had to be reduced. It is asserted that in the past the Departments have been starved in employes, and thus there arises the demand for such a large increase this year. But it must not be forgotten that the demand for works expenditure has been very large, and, in my opinion, we ought not to force too much expenditure into one year, but, if possible, let each year bear a fair share of the increase. I cannot resist giving a warning that the rushing up of expenditure may prove the high road to a very strong retrenchment agitation. </para>

                        <para>- In the last half-minute or so I have read what I have myself written. The works expenditure in the Post and Telegraph Department in 1902-3 was £135,699; in 1903-4, it was £187,809; in 1904-5, it was£131,829; in 1905-6 it was £146,575; in 1906-7 it was £275,783; and in 1907-8 it was £524,699, the last mentioned sum being made up of original Estimates £434,078, and Additional Estimates £90,621. This shows an increase over last year of about £250,000. </para>

                        <para>- In order to arrive at the position as to the increase over last year, there must be deducted £275,000 odd. I should have liked to deal with the Defence Estimates now, so as to have placed the whole financial position before honorable members, but that is not possible at the present stage. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but, as I say, I cannot do it at the present stage. As Treasurer, I feel that, in the face of increasing expenditure, without corresponding increase of revenue, as we had last year and one or two years before, we must be very careful what is done regarding these Estimates. I admit that the Post and Telegraph Department is perhaps the most difficult to manage, not only by the Minister, but by the heads of the branches. The services of the Department are so far-reaching throughout the continent, that it requires very close organization in order to secure efficiency and success. </para>

I have been blamed for doing this by those who did not know the financial position of the Commonwealth, It is very hard, indeed, to meet such a large increase of expenditure in one year, unless there is a very elastic revenue ; and had it not been for the elastic revenue obtained since the imposition of the present so-called terrible Tariff, I do not know how we  should have dealt with the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department. There has been a great clamour for works in this Department, and my reference to the honorable member for Maranoa applies to almost every other honorable member. The desire amongst us_ is that our constituents shall be properly looked after in the way of Post and Telegraph facilities. </para>

                        <para>- Quite true, and the honorable member's constituents are part of the public. I hope I have put the position clearly before honorable members, and shown that I have restrained, in part at any rate, excessive expenditure in connexion with this great Department. But I do urge on that Department - I have urged it many times privately upon my colleague the Postmaster-General ; and he is taking the right course now - to see whether there is not some fault in connexion with, the details of its . work. That is where is seems to me that there is some fault. I am anxious to see the Department give satisfaction to the public, and equally anxious to see an expansion of conveniences, as far as it is possible to extend them, from one end of the continent to the other. But we cannot expect that to be done without finding the money. It is thus that- I have had to find more money than was anticipated by any- one during the present year, and have had to bring down these Additional Estimates. The Committee now know the whole position in which the Department stands. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not propose to deal with the figures which have been given to the Committee by the honorable member for Flinders and by the Treasurer. My honorable, friends have given the increases in lump sums. I propose to give them in percentages, both in regard to revenue and expenditure. The revenue for 1902-3 showed an increase -of 1.34 per cent, over the revenue for 1901-2 ; of 4.39 per cent, in 1903-4, over the previous year; of 4.87 per cent, in 1904-5; of 7.29 per cent, in i905r6; and of 10.79 Per cent- m 1906-7. This year it is estimated that the increase will be approximately 5.38 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- It certainly is not by any means an inflated service, especially when honorable members bear in mind that in the year 1904-5 we had practically no increase of expenditure at all. That is where the trouble has arisen. 'During the last three years the sum asked for by the Post and Telegraph Department has been continually reduced; and last year we found that the abnormal increase of business and the shortage of officers brought us close to a condition of things that could not continue. There were complaints all round the House. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend has asked me the reason, and I have told him plainly. Some of the reasons for this increased expenditure date back to preFederal days. Just previous to Federation quite a number of telegraph and telephone lines were starved. Some of the poles are now rotten. We have to face an abnormal expenditure to put these works into an efficient condition. We have had to face an abnormal expenditure in regard to works in New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria. </para>

In the appropriation for 1907-8, salaries and contingencies, &amp;c., amount to £2,865,109, and Additional Estimates amount to £107,720. Ten per cent. on new works - appropriation for 1907-8, £434,078; and Additional Estimates, £90,621 - would be£52,470. Add that to the £2,865,109 and the£107,720, and the total is£3,025,299. That calculation would give us an excess of revenue for the present year, over the expenditure, of £272,113; the estimated revenue being £3,297,412. I fully agree with the honorable member for Flinders in regard to the necessity for the preparation of an annual report. But such a report must, of course, be based upon reliable data. </para>

                        <para>- I make the statement from my knowledge of the Department. A statement regarding the various branches of the Department must, 'however, under the best of conditions, be approximate. Even in the central office, officers are continually dividing their time between the various branches of the Department ; and that remark applies particularly to the larger country offices. </para>

                        <para>- No; but it has to be remembered that we have had to amalgamate the post and telegraph affairs of six States, and that we . have had to do our work in the face of shortage of money, whilst we have paid for the whole of our new works out of revenue. That is a very great accomplishment in itself, and could not be done without very great difficulty. But I fully agree with the business  principles  laid down by the honorable member for Flinders. Already we have taken steps to take a tally during the coming year of the work done by the officers of the various branches, and to debit each Department with the cost of the work done for it. </para>

I admit that I have not included the 10 per cent, for the previous years. If that were included it would reduce the balance. </para>

                        <para>- We have made provision for temporary hands, and are providing for the necessary increase in the number of permanent hands, so that honorable members must either be prepared to face an increased expenditure on the part of the Department or to allow officers to continue to do work allotted to higher grades without receiving a proportionate increase in their remuneration, and to allow time off to accumulate. In other words, if we are to properly staff the Department, Parliament must provide the necessary means for paying for that staffing. I received . this morning a deputation which urged that we should continue country mail services at a loss. Owing to the increased price of fodder, these services are costing us this year nearly £11,000 in excess of the cost for last year. In respect of a very large number of them we are losing as much as 50 per cent. over and above receipts. </para>

                        <para>- If we are to pay contractors on the basis which the. honorable member, by his interjection, seems to suggest, a still further expenditure will be incurred. It is useless for honorable members, on the one hand, to oppose sweating, and to demand increased postal facilities if, on the other, they insist upon the expenditure being kept down. The Department is faced with the difficulties with which every Government post and telegraphic service in the world is confronted. It has to pay reasonable wages, provide for holidays and sick leave, and grant many facilities which would not be forthcoming if the Department were a private enterprise. We have also to provide for heavy losses on country extensions, and these must be met by increased expenditure. A statement of receipts and expenditure, as suggested, would show exactly in what respect losses were incurred by the Department. If the Department is to be conducted on business principles, Parliament should vote a sum to meet the extraordinary demands made upon it to provide services which in no way relate to it. In respect of our oversea mail service alone, we have to pay something like£15,000 per annum more than we should otherwise have to do, because of a provision in the contract relating to the export of butter. What has the carriage of butter to do with the conveyance of mails? Yet we find that that increased cost is charged to the Post and Telegraph Department. We are paving heavy subsidies for. mail steamers to carry passengers and cargo. </para>

                        <para>- The Commissioner has agreed that there is need for the increased number of hands in New South Wales for which I have asked. I should like to say in passing that very often fears of the probable effects of a drought are not realized. It is a remarkable fact that during the last drought the business of the Department in New South Wales - where it was most keenly felt - increased in respect of every branch. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know how long the inquiry will take. After all, much of the trouble that has taken place has been due to the fact that the several Departments of the Commonwealth are passing through evolutionary stages. We have taken over services from six different States, and it is only by experience that we can determine how the work of each of the Departments should be so allotted as to enable them to fit in with each other. A great deal of trouble can be removed by clearly defining the relations of the several Departments and by avoiding centralization. </para>

                    <para>.- We must thank the two Ministers for their explanations. Taken together they unfortunately have the effect of making the position more confused than it was ; but we may be able to obtain some information from them. Since we are dealing with a question of finance, I think it right to say that it is rather surprising that Ministers have not availed themselves of the opportunity to point out how unfair it is to debit the Post and Telegraph Department in any one year with expenditure on works the utility of which may last perhaps for thirty years. The Treasurer has given us details of increased expenditure in a given year on public works relating to the Department ; but that is a. grossly unfair way of making a comparison of receipts and expenditure. This expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds will be incurred on works and services the utility of which may last for twenty or thirty years. </para>

                        <para>- Then let us say ten years. But we should begin by making that adjustment of the figures which have been put before us. Given plenty of money we cannot have a better system of finance than that under which we put our revenue into permanent and reproductive works. But when we have either to starve the public services or adopt some more rational system of expenditure, we must decide upon debiting permanent works on an annual basis - on the basis of one year's expenditure on one year's services. </para>

                        <para>- Absolutely. I ventured to introduce that system in New South Wales. In that State, as well as in others, loans were dealt with under a very rotten system, although the country was rich enough to stand it; but I established the principle to which I have referred in connexion with expenditure on buildings or works, the utility of which might extend over any given period. I decided upon a system under which each year's revenue contributed its share to the expenditure on such works. The result was that the expenditure on a given work, having a life of ten or twenty years, was paid for proportionately out of the revenue of those ten or twenty years. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that it was dropped after I went out of office. I suggest to the Committee that the time must come when we must cease to cripple the Federation and starve its services by insisting on debiting the revenue of any one year with the expenditure on buildings which may last for thirty or forty years. We shall have to revise our principles of finance when we have not the money to enable us to continue the present system, but as long as we have the money available we cannot do better than put it into reproductive services. </para>

                        <para>- Although it may not always be visible, anything in the direction of economy is to be commended, and we should constantly endeavour to secure it. But what surprises me most in connexion with the condition of affairs in the Post and Telegraph Department is, the absolute lack of foresight, or some greater defect, in estimating the number of hands required to carry on the work of the Department. The density of ignorance which prevails in some financial quarters in the Commonwealth service - I do not know where - is to be seen on a reference to the following figures :  - In the year  1906-7  the Government actually spent  £1 2,600  on temporary assistance for carrying on the Department in New South Wales, and for  1907-8  they actually propose to spend, not. more, but  £3,600  less than was found necessary in the previous year. Is not that a monstrous state of things? Instead of providing  £12,600  again, or something more, to meet the expansion of the Department, and the increasing demands for assistance, they have actually submitted an estimate of  £9,000  for  1907-8,  or  £3,600  less than was actually spent on temporary assistance in the year before. </para>

                        <para>- The amount set down in the Estimates-in-Chief is quite apart from the vote for  £20,500  in the Additional Estimates. It was necessary to spend  £12,600  in  1906-7,  and, instead of the Government recognising that fact, and the tremendous pressure there must be for the employment of more hands, we were asked to vote the sum of  £9,000  instead of  £12,600,  for the current year, with the result that Additional Estimates are brought down, including a sum of  £20,500  for temporary assistance, over and above the  £9,000  submitted in the Estimates-in-Chief. </para>

                <para>Mr.REID. - I suppose so. I should say that in the smallest town in Australia people have better ideas of business than these Estimates disclose. Ministers must Save had this pressure for more hands staring them in the face for years and years, and yet they deliberately put down a smaller amount for temporary assistance this year than they had actually to spend in the year before, with the result that now, when we are within three months of the end of the financial year, we are called upon to vote another  £20,500.  In other States, this has not been so glaring. In Victoria,  £7,400  was spent on temporary assistance in  1906-7,  and the Government submitted a vote on the Estimates-in-Chief for  1907-8  of  £7,000  for this purpose, or  £400  less than was spent in the previous year, whilst in the Additional Estimates, a vote of  £8,566  is asked for this purpose. I do not wish to labour the point, but I do wish to show that honorable members are left to the most extraordinary sort of guidance in connexion with matters which must have obtruded themselves upon the Department during the last three or four years. Surely, during the last three or four years, the Postmaster-General must have known the strain upon the Department, and the enormous increase in the volume of its business? Yet, in spite of that, and with the result of past experience pressing upon the Minister, the Government and the officials, we are deliberately asked to vote money on the Estimates-in-Chief, apparently on the assumption that the temporary emergency has passed away, and that the amount required for temporary assistance should be less than it was in the previous year. There is another reproach which can be made in connexion with these votes for temporary assistance. They mean that men, who should be regularly placed on the permanent staff in this Department, are left at the mercy of the rule under which their services may be dispensed with after about six months. </para>

                        <para>- Somebody is responsible for its continuance, and it is not the members of this Committee. They cannot possibly administer the Departments; but they are entitled to some consideration from the Ministry, who, in making provision for carrying on the work of these great Departments, should submit to Parliament a proper scheme of expenditure, which will provide for the employment of a sufficient number of officers at a proper salary. This is what we have a right to expect from the Government of the country. </para>

                        <para>- I should think so, and it is certainly the least excusable way. Honorable members are prepared to vote any money that is needed for the proper conduct of these Departments. They do not wish to see this practice of largely employing temporary and casual assistants continued. How can we establish a departmental staff on proper lines, or expect efficiency, if a large proportion of the persons employed in a Department go out of the service every few months? The thing is impossible. . I wish to refer to only one or two of these matters, because the work of the Department has been very fully dealt with. With reference to the wail about the want of money, I should like to say that there is no excuse on that score at all. The revenue of the Commonwealth is more than £1,000,000 in excess of the Treasurer's estimate. The honorable gentleman estimated that it would be £850,000 more than the revenue for last year, but our revenue for this year has increased by nearly £2,000,000; and, in view of that fact, of what use is it to talk about a scarcity in the money chest? </para>

                        <para>- I should like to see as much given to the States as possible. But our first duty in connexion with these Departments is to see that they are put in a proper position. We should do that, not only in the interests of the officers of the Department. There is a larger interest at stake. These huge public services involve the convenience of every man, woman, and child in the community, and for that reason should be placed on a proper business footing. The expenditure has gone up by £1,500,000over that of last year, and the £1,800,000 of excess revenue has practically been mopped up already by these Estimates of Expenditure. I do not object to expenditure which may be necessary to pay the officers employed in the Public Service proper salaries. It is not a question of how much we can afford. There is no doubt as to the power and the ability of the State as an employer to pay the people it employs proper wages. The country does not grudge fair and honest wages being paid in any of the public Departments of the State. The Estimates-in-Chief include a vote for additions and new works of £340,000, and yet we have in the Additional Estimates a vote of £411,000set down for this purpose. What sort of finance is this - that we should have Additional Estimates involving an expenditure of £70,000 more than is provided for in the Estimates-in-Chief for the whole year? What sort of finance is it when the votes appearing in our Additional Estimates are larger than those which appear in our Estimates-in-Chief? It shows a dislocation of management in some of these Departments which is deplorable. How can we ever have our finances in a proper state unless the Government are able to forecast, I do not say absolutely, but with a certain approach to accuracy, what the expenditure in a given year will be as against that year's revenue ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what sergeant it was who said it, but it appeared in the newspapers. The honorable member ought to apply to the man that wrote it and get his authority. But the honorable member has occasionally in this debate made remarks, and the Treasurer has also made remarks, which are utterly foreign to the idea of Cabinet responsibility. . The honorable member is responsible for the actions of his predecessor just as implicitly as if he were his predecessor himself, if such a thing could be. I must ask the Government to do better with this Department in the future than they have done in the past. What is the use of talking -about the state in which these works were handed over to us in the year 1901 ? Seven years have elapsed since then. Surely," in seven years, men could put telegraph wires and telephones into a better state. Surely,, in seven years, that Department should have been put in proper order. My great objection to this scheme of the Minister is that it will multiply his difficulties. If he were the ablest man in the world he would have enough to do .in the ordinary management of that gigantic Department without proposing himself as the head of a Committee to inquire into his own administration. It is one of the most comical things in the history of official life. The honorable member has appointed himself as  Chairman  of a Committee to report upon his own administration by means of evidence to be given to him by his own subordinates. The honorable member says, "I am sure these officers will do their duty fearlessly, and will say everything they have got to say in the way of complaint." What I have to say is that there may be a lot of officers who will not, and the men who do .not will have a better chance than the men who do. That is my experience, and I' say it without imputing anything wrong to any one. There are two methods of getting on in any, service. One is by fearless, open independence, and the other by currying favour with superiors. It is not always the man of integrity and ability that succeeds. . It is sometimes the man of integrity and ability that goes to the. wall, and the man who curries favour that succeeds. That is an evil great enough in any service, but this is offering a premium to public officers to act in that way. I feel sure that most of them will scorn' it. I believe that the public officers, as a body, will act fearlessly, but I do ask, " What is there between them and this Minister; what is there between them and this Government, if their evidence, being fearless, exposes incapacity and bad administration?" It is a thankless task. To go to the highest stages of the Department, I will just conceive the Secretary to the Post Office taking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> the Minister, to task, and saying, " Lookhere, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger,</inline> you have invited me to express my opinions on this Department. In my opinion, you have managed it in the most shocking way. You have no capacity for your office. In this particular case you acted foolishly. In that particular case you acted still more foolishly, and the whole of the blame for this state of things rests with you." I should like to see where the gentleman would be who said that. I believe it would not be true, to begin with. </para>

Having plenty of time on his hands, he will, of course, take full notes of all the evidence, and draw up the report, which will, at least, show one fact : that since the Honorable Samuel Mauger became Postmaster-General, the Department has entered upon a new and majestic phase of improvement and development. It is sure to show that. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member - because, like every other man who is worth anything, he believes in himself - would naturally say, " This evidence discloses a giant conspiracy to discredit me. These are all free-traders, or men who do not believe in teetotalism. My views on the liquor traffic and on protection have poisoned the minds of the public servants who have spoken in this way of me." That would be my honorable friend's view upon their even well-merited criticism. But these are all matters of conjecture. What I do emphasize is that if Ministers choose to have an inquiry, they ought to make it a proper, thorough, and independent inquiry. This is not that. I think they will find, before the matter is done with, that they have made a great mistake, and that instead of bringing peace, contentment, and efficiency to the Department, they have made, and will make, things worse than they were. </para>

                <para>Mr.CHANTER (Riverina) [5.43].- A good deal has been charged against the Minister during this debate, to a great extent, on account of the want of revenue. I propose to point to one case where the Minister has deliberately thrown away revenue without sufficient justification for his action. I approach this matter with great regret. I am sorry that I should have to deal with a question of this kind, and to blame the Minister for what I consider very injudicious action on his part in the exercise of the enormous power which Parliament has given to him to place an embargo upon the correspondence of any man or firm. </para>

                        <para>- If I allowed the honorable member to go into the merits or demerits of this particular firm, some other honorable member would probably rise to point out in reply that the firm was very  respectable, or otherwise. A discussion would then ensue, not on the Estimates now  before the Committee, but on the question of the merits of .the firm. Last week the honorable member for Wentworth attempted to discuss the merits or demerits of a certain report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> ordered by the Government to be printed. I prevented him from doing so, as it did not come within the purview of the Estimates then before the Chair. There is an Act of Parliament which gives the Minister certain powers. Supposing that those powers were exercised in the case of Tattersalls sweeps, and honorable members rose to discuss the merits or demerits of sweeps, then the discussion that would ensue would be on the question of sweeps, and not on the question of the administration of the Department. I must ask the honorable  member not to follow that course. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot learn the opinion of Parliament unless a definite statement is made by the Postmaster-General. In the next place, I ask the honorable gentleman from whom he derived the information upon which he acted ? Was not that information founded upon a case which occurred in Victoria nearly two years ago? That case was submitted to the Crown law authorities of this State, and the Attorney-General advised that no ground for a prosecution existed. Subsequently the Minister allowed himself to be used to inflict an injury upon this particular firm, although the State had declined to take action against it. </para>

                        <para>- I would remind the honorable member for Flinders that there is a great difference between affording a man an opportunity to establish his innocence and denying him that opportunity. The. Australian Industries Preservation Bill affords an accused person an opportunity of proving his innocence, but in the case to which I am referring, the Postmaster-General denied Messrs. Freeman and Wallace that opportunity. As Britishers, and the descendants of Britishers, we are proud to boast that it is the right of the humblest individual to be heard in his defence before punishment is inflicted upon him. That is all for which I am contending. Messrs. Freeman and Wallace were denied an opportunity of being heard in their defence before the terrible weapon which has been placed in the hands of the Postmaster-General was used against them. They were branded as frauds and swindlers without being afforded the slightest chance of defending themselves. </para>

But every one of their appeals was disregarded. Surely honorable members cannot approve of that? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member himself "quacks" a good deal oftener than I do. Surely honorable members - without being in possession of the facts of the case - are not going to deny the right of an inquiry where a grievance is alleged to exist ! The Chief Justice of the High Court has clearly laid it down that the Postmaster-General may do the most grievous wrong of which we can conceive, without any redress being obtainable, except at the hands of Parliament. No appeal can be made to a Court, because Parliament has, unwisely I think, placed the Minister above all Courts in that regard. It was denied just now that in a previous case the High Court did not rule in favour of Messrs. Freeman and Wallace. When an embargo was laid upon their letters, they appealed to the High Court, because then they possessed that privilege, and it was removed. </para>

                        <para>- I am in a position to say that they did say something of the kind; and, therefore, an inquiry is necessary. There is some one behind the Minister in this matter. The Postmaster-General has not acted on his own initiative; and, in my opinion, a very serious injustice has been done. What possible objection can there be to an inquiry ? Why cannot the embargo be removed under certain conditions, and an investigation entered upon fairly and squarely ? If these people have done wrong, let them be charged, and, if guilty, punished.

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wren</inline> runs racehorses, and so does the honorable member for Balaclava, but why is the correspondence of the former, and not of the latter, stopped? An embargo has been placed on correspondence in connexion with Tattersall's sweeps, and yet there are members of this House who participate in the profits of such sweeps, and their correspondence is not stopped. If the Postmaster-General is going to set himself up as the censor of the morals of the community, then, for God's sake, let the censorship be applied all round, and not to one or two individuals ! Throughout the States of the Commonwealth, I can find dozens of cases in which similar firms advertise and receive correspondence ; and yet, because of certain antagonistic forces, the particular firm whose case I am presenting is treated in this drastic and cruel manner. </para>

Department placed before them for consideration. I had pointed out that a certain action taken by the Minister amounted practically to maladministration, or, to describe it in less severe terms, that it had been taken without that full consideration which should have been given to the subject to which it related. </para>

                        <para>-  Will the right honorable member permit me to proceed ? This is the first occasion on which I have heard it declared that a charge brought against a Minister cannot be fully referred to on the Estimates relating to his Department. I accepted the ruling of the  Chairman  that I would not be in order in discussing the merits or demerits of the Ministerial action of which I complained, and was proceeding to quote an extract from a newspaper article, which I pointed out did not deal with the merits or demerits of the case, when you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> interposed. The extract which I was reading merely points out the course citizens have to take - having regard to certain decisions given by the High Court - to obtain redress, and I feel that I should be in order in reading it. I am bound to respect your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> but, if it is permitted to stand, it will mean that it will be impossible for us in Committee of Supply to criticise the action of a Minister when the Estimates relating to his Department are under consideration, or to read newspaper articles in  favour of a certain line of action. If that procedure is to be adopted, then we shall be hobbled. I hold that I was .perfectly within ray rights and privileges, and that there is no standing order to prevent me from reading the extract in question. </para>

The ruling which he attributes to me is his, not mine. In this connexion I am practically the sole judge of relevancy. Honorable members have always possessed the right to discuss grievances, and are entitled to avail themselves - to the fullest extent of 'their privileges in that regard. The position I have taken up is that, whilst the honorable member would be in order in discussing in a general way the attitude of the Minister, he would not be in order in going into the full details of the case which he was discussing, <inline font-style="italic">if</inline> I were to allow the honorable member to go into minute details as to the decisions of the High Court, and in regard to various proceedings prior to the action taken by the Postmaster-General- </para>

                        <para>- If I were to allow the honorable member to do that, other honorable members would be entitled to claim a like privilege, with the result that we should have a debate bearing solely upon the treatment of the persons to whom the honorable member has referred, and the Estimates themselves would be entirely lost sight of. There is already in existence an Act of Parliament which gives the Postmaster-General the power to take certain action, and my opinion is that,' if the Minister has exceeded his powers under that Act - if, as the honorable member suggests, he has been guilty of maladministration - he is deserving of censure, and that the question should not merely be brought forward in connexion with the Estimates of his Department. When the Estimates are under consideration, a discussion may take place regarding the general administration of the Department to which they relate, but an honorable member is. not in order in discussing some general grievance, as the honorable member has been endeavouring to do. If I were to allow such a procedure, we should have an almost endless discussion on many matters that could not be legitimately classed as coming within the Estimates. I have allowed the honorable member ample latitude to ventilate his grievance, but it would appear that he now desires to obtain further information beyond that for which I think he is entitled to ask while these Estimates are under consideration. The honorable member is quite in order in disagreeing with my ruling, but not on the grounds which he has stated. </para>

I give you my assurance that no part ' of the article does that. However, if you say that you have not ruled that, I will withdraw my motion. I merely wish to put the case before the Committee, so that justice may be done. </para>

                        <para>- In all these matters we must be guided by rules which have no reference to the merits of the subject under consideration. Without associating myself with the views which the honorable member for Riverina has expressed, I wish to point out that there is a principle involved, which, with all due respect, I ' say the Chair has not quite recognised. The convenience or inconvenience of the Committee, as affected by the length to which a subject may be discussed, is beside the question, of a member's rights. . There could be no principle to guide our procedure if we were to try to decide as to the length at which an honorable member could discuss a particular subject. . From time immemorial, as you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonald,</inline> have been the first to recognise, honorable members, on the first item of a Department, have had the . right to discuss everything connected with its administration. If the honorable member for Riverina is doing that, he is within his rights, and no power can deprive him of them on the ground that he is speaking at an inconvenient length, or because of a dislike to the subject which is being brought before us. We must be careful not to allow our rules to be influenced by such considerations; because the ruling of to-day is the law of to-morrow. A large number of honorable members may be absolutely out of sympathy with the honorable member for Riverina; but in these cases we must be most zealous in safeguarding the rights of the individual. A majority has always power to enforce its own rights; but one of the glories of our parliamentary institutions has been that a member can assert his rights against the whole House. One of our most important rights is the right to discuss the actions of Ministers in regard to their Departments, and who is to place a limit on the length of such criticism, or say in what manner it shall be made ? How is it possible to criticise the actions of a Minister without going into the merits of the case concerned? It is contrary to reason to assert that an honorable member can criticise the action of a Minister in regard to a particular transaction, if he has not the right to explain why, in his opinion, the Minister has acted improperly, and that he cannot do without going into the merits of the case. If the merits of the case are with the Minister, instead of being open to censure he may be entitled to the support and confidence of other honorable members. I suggest, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonald,</inline> that the honorable member should be allowed to go into the merits of the case.  His  whole address must be idle if he is not allowed to do so. </para>

I, therefore, suggest to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that if the honorable member for Riverina is in order in canvassing the conduct of the Minister, he cannot be precluded from discussing the merits of the case. If he has a right to do that, no one can shut his mouth ; if he has not, his mouth should have been closed long ago. </para>

                        <para>- I very much regret the position in which I have been placed to-night, and am sorry that I have been called upon to say anything against one  with whom I have been on most friendly terms, both privately and politically. The case appears to me of very great moment, and I ask the Committee to give me an opportunity to place it before honorable members. Those who are aware of my loyalty to party know that it is a strain upon me to have to say anything against a Minister to whose Government I have given loyal allegiance. But I should be recreant to my trust if, knowing that the Minister had made a mistake which was inflicting grave injury on a private individual, I were coward enough to say nothing. I am not alone in the opinion that the Minister's action has been ill-advised, and I hope that he will retrace his steps. A considerable time prior to taking this action I approached the Minister by letter. I pleaded with him to grant an inquiry of some kind. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to speak of the hundreds who have written to the Minister in opposition to inquiry. I am going to show that my action is not promoted by pique. In support of my statements I have received opinions from three of the most eminent men of the city, who believe that the action taken by the Minister is not justified by the evidence placed before him. . Without any derogation of . dignity on his part, he could well concede what this firm asks for. They have been punished without trial. They ask for a trial in some form. First they ask the Minister to give them an opportunity of being brought face to face with their traducers, and enabled to rebut the evidence. Failing that, they ask the Minister to consent to the appointment of a Select Committee of this House to inquire into the whole of the circumstances of the case. Failing that again, to show their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides,</inline> they ask the Minister to make a deliberate charge against them, and to give them an opportunity to defend themselves in a court of their country. Are they right in making these demands? I think they are. The leading journals in Melbourne and in other parts of the Commonwealth have said that they are right. </para>

                        <para>- It is a position in which Parliament never intended the Minister to be put. I was one of those members who supported the Post and Telegraph Act, and am now very sorry that I did. It was never intended that one member of the Cabinet should act alone. Parliament intended that in the case of an alleged offence, where such a grievous punishment was to be meted out, there would be Cabinet consideration and approval before action was taken. </para>

                        <para>- Could he not? If is a fact that if the Minister chooses to stop the correspondence of any man or woman in the Commonwealth he can do so to-morrow without giving any reasons for his action. What I am challenging is the exercise of that power without the right being given to the individual punished of hearing the evidence against him and defending himself. The Minister takes up. the position - " I have done this, believing I am in the right, and I do not care a snap of the finger what your interests or your sufferings are." I cannot believe that this Parliament ever intended to put such power in the hands of any Minister. </para>

                        <para>- And my word ought to be taken. I know that I should be out of order in referring at greater length to this Association, but I shall take another opportunity of dealing with it, and of proving my statements concerning it. I am one of those who . have known the persecution of this particular Association, and am well aware that they will stop at nothing. If they did not approach the Minister directly, they are ingenious enough to adopt other means to bring about the result which they want. We have in power now a Postmaster- General who is a protectionist and a Liberal. Most men who know him will be aware that he is pretty firm in regard to his principles. Every man is more or less biased, however. Suppose that in the course of time - I do not know when or how - the honorable gentleman were deposed, and we had a Conservative or Tory Postmaster-General at the head of the Department. What chance would the labour unions of Australia have against him if he chose to use his power to stop all their correspondence ? He could do it. </para>

                        <para>- I know it from the honorable member's surroundings. What I am demanding is justice. The meanest individual in the community has a right to justice. The parties in this matter demand that before they are punished, they shall be tried. But the Minister's principle is, kill first and try afterwards. I again repeat that a trial was refused before punishment was meted out. If the parties were really guilty of the things charged against them, it is not likely that they would desire the evidence to be brought up on an inquiry. That is not the act of a guilty person. The act of such a. person would be to hide his head and get away as soon as possible, not to come forward and demand investigation with a view of securing justice. </para>

I do not want to be on any Committee that may be appointed, t have no wish to be connected with the inquiry in any way. I have no objection to the Minister selecting any person he thinks proper to conduct it. What is wanted is an inquiry in connexion with which the people who make these charges will be put upon oath, and be liable, if they do not speak the truth, to the' punishment provided for persons who swear falsely against their neighbour. </para>

                        <para>- I do not ask that it should be appointed in any other way. I repeat that all that the persons concerned ask for is some kind of inquiry, whether a departmental inquiry, an inquiry by a Select Committee, or an inquiry by any of the Courts of the country, based upon a definite charge laid against them, which would give them an opportunity to defend their honour and their business. Is that an unreasonable request to make? It might be granted even at this late stage, three months after the injury done these people. It would not hurt the Minister or lower his dignity in any form, bub, on the contrary, it would vastly strengthen the position he has taken up should the result of the inquiry be to justify the course he has adopted. Should that be the result of an open and fair inquiry, the public, and every one concerned, would be satisfied. </para>

It is not the duty either of this Parliament or of the Minister to inquire into fraud. The Courts of the country are established for 'that purpose. If fraud is alleged against any one, a charge should be made against the persons concerned, and should be inquired into by the Courts. </para>

But when, in the light of experience of its operation, we see that we did wrong to pass it, are we going to be so recreant to our duty as to say that we shall continue the injustice it permits? Surely not? Surely a special appeal of this kind should have some weight with honorable members? If you, sir. will permit me to read an extract from a paper I have here, I am sure that you will see that it cannot be considered to be out of order. </para>

                    <para>How very great are the discretionary powers vested in the Postmaster-General under the Post Office Act was clearly shown by a judgment of the High Court, delivered yesterday. He is authorized to refuse to deliver mail matter addressed to any person or persons carrying on a fraudulent or immoral business, and he alone, it would seem, is the judge of the fraudulence or immorality.  His  action is not examinable by any Court either on an application for a mandamus or on a proceeding by writ of certiorari, mandamus can issue because the delivery of letters is not a Ministerial act which the Postmaster-General is bound in virtue of his office to perform. Nor is the refusal a judicial act, since the party against whom the order is made is not heard, so there, is no ground for a writ of certiorari. As an executive or administrative act there is no apparent means of bringing the Postmaster-General's determination under judicial review. Without attempting to discuss the merits of the Postmaster-General's decision in the particular case before the Court, it may be remarked that individual PostmasterGenerals may differ widely in the meaning they attach to the term " immoral," and yet a firm so labelled by any one of them will have no chance of refuting the charge. Of course, in the last resort the Postmaster-General is responsible to Parliament, but Parliament, save in the event of what appeared to be a glaring error, would be. most unlikely to challenge his opinion. Seeing that the Post Office is a monopoly, and that its political, chief is armed with such great personal authority, it is to be hoped that in all instances of refusal to convey correspondence the utmost care and most scrupulous impartiality will ever be exercised. </para>

                        <para>- It is from a paper to which I have already referred. I might read other extracts, but I have no wish to do anything which might bring me into conflict with the Chair. I repeat that the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Australasian,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> and other newspapers published in different parts of the Commonwealth, have dealt with this matter on the same lines and have contended that the power exercised by the Postmaster-General is too great. In one newspaper it is broadly stated that in this case the power intrusted to the Minister has been improperly exercised on the ground, which I have urged, that it is absolutely improper and unjust, and against the intention of Parliament in passing the Act, to lay this ban or bar upon any persons without giving them an opportunity to defend themselves. The Minister has asked why they did not take action against certain persons for conspiracy. How could they do so ? The Minister knows that they could not do so. The persons to whom he alludes, and who I will not name, though I could name them, doubtless entered into a conspiracy. Their conspiracy did not succeed, and the heads of the State to whom they had to go, and to whom they submitted the results of the conspiracy, instead of laying a charge of fraud against . these people, said there was no <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence of fraud, and would not go on with the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I have read sworn statements to the effect that the Attorney-General said he had never seen the papers six months after they were transmitted to the Federal authorities. The State authorities desired to take certain action. They tried their best by improper and underhand means to make a case against this firm and failed to do so. Having failed, they or some one in their behalf moved the Postmaster-General, who is behind the hedge and cannot be touched except by Parliament, to do that which they dared not attempt to do themselves. That is the position, and there is no getting away from it, This firm is charged with being a firm of quacks. That is a statement which has been made here, and which has-been made on several occasions. In answer to that charge I Have only to say that on their staff there are <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Kempster,</inline> who comes from England, and whose professional titles are L.R.C.P., London, and M.S. A., London. That is a. pretty good title. </para>

                        <para>- I know how far some of them will go when it suits their purpose. But that is quite beside this question. We have to deal with a case in which certain action has been taken which I wish to have reviewed. Is the Minister afraid to review it? Are honorable members afraid to have it reviewed? Would it strengthen or weaken the position they take up if the matter were fully inquired into? The leader of the Opposition, from his large experience in the Law Courts, is aware that they will have no evidence which cannot be fully substantiated. Hearsay evidence will not be taken in a Court of law. They must have something definite and absolute upon which to act. In this case, there is nothing of the kind. In a Court of law, there is some redress, because an individual who makes a wilfully false statement on oath is punishable. In the Minister's Star Chamber, however, anybody, or any number of nobodies, can pour into his sympathetic ear something which lie thinks is right. The Minister then says, " All right, the case is tried; down you go to execution at once." </para>

I wish to see them treated alike and fairly. Although the Minister may assure me that he has not received a direct visit from the particular association to which I refer, will he say that he has not received visits from others ? Will he say that he acted entirely upon those papers without any other influence behind them? </para>

                        <para>- Nor did I interfere in Tattersall's case. I am not declaiming against the Minister's opinion that a wrong is being done in regard to betting or gambling, or the publication of these matters. What I am declaiming against is that any Minister should take action against one firm and leave dozens of others in the same line of business untouched. The Minister cannot deny that that is the case. Does he think he has stopped gambling by prohibiting Tattersall's sweep correspondence? Is there not any amount of gambling going on in this city ? Why does not the Minister go to the Stock Exchange and the various clubs and touch them? He picks out one. There is no justice in his action. </para>

He may to a certain extent control things that he considers improper, but he will never stop gambling by legislation, because it is a weakness of human nature that will go on for ever. </para>

                        <para>- Then he should try to stop it altogether. He should not pick out one case only. Within 200 or 300 yards of this building, one can see glaring instances. If the Minister has time to attend to his Department - I doubt if he has, because his time is apparently taken up in attending to the morals of the community - he can find plenty of scope for the exercise of his powers. He thinks he has stopped indecent literature from going through the post, but I, and several other honorable members, recently saw passing through the post, two post-cards that would not be allowed in any decent household. I do not know how the honorable member came to overlook them. I do not pretend to be a great purist, but I can place my three score years of life against those of most ordinary men, and thank God that I do not feel ashamed of any act of mine during that time. If a man is going to use a Department like this in order to establish himself as the censor of everything, he should clean out the whole stable, and not one little corner of it. Is the honorable member afraid to do it? Are there influences behind that personally or politically he fears? Why is he not courageous enough, if he takes action in one case, to take it in others? Why does he not prove himself right in this case by granting some form of inquiry by which fair play will be given? </para>

If I had done any one an injury, or had any suspicion that I had done so, I should at once grant the freest and fullest inquiry, in order that I might stand justified or condemned - I would not care which. </para>

                        <para>- That is all I am contending for. If men like the Right Honorable George Houstoun Reid, leader of His Majesty's Opposition in the Parliament of Australia, say that it is possible for a Minister to do wrong, will the Postmaster-General, or any other Minister, still maintain that it is not possible? Any man might unintentionally do wrong. The Minister in this case has shut his eyes deliberately to supreme justice. He acted upon what he believed to be a <inline font-style="italic">primâ facie</inline> case made out to him, but which was rejected by the State authorities. He did not act fairly or judicially, although, of course, he acted within his powers. He did not act within the intentions of Parliament or in accordance with the British principle that no man shall be punished without trial. </para>

                        <para>- There is a vast difference between charging a man with an offence whilst affording him an opportunity to establish his innocence, and punishing him without affording him that opportunity. But it is about time that I heard what the Postmaster-General has to say with regard to this matter. I shall be very glad if he can see his way clear - even at this late hour of the day - to remove the embargo which has been placed upon the correspondence of the firm to which I allude, or if, as an alternative, he will grant some form of inquiry into his action. He need have no fear of his conduct being inquired into. If he has erred, he is not the first Minister who has done so. </para>

                        <para>- When doctors differ the patient dies. In this case the doctors differ. Doctors quite as eminent as is the Postmaster-General differ from the view which he holds. If an inquiry be granted nobody will be more pleased than myself to learn that the Postmaster-General has justified his action. If, on the contrary, his action should not be justified by the evidence forthcoming, he is not the man that I take him for, if he will not admit his error, and extend relief to those who are at present suffering as the result of his action. </para>

                        <para>- One or two statements have been made by the honorable member for Riverina which I feel it my duty to answer. In the first place I have not in any way discriminated. This particular case was sent on to me by the Victorian police, with an intimation that, in the opinion of the Crown Prosecutor, a <inline font-style="italic">primâ facie</inline> case had been made out against the firm in question, and that a prosecution would have followed had the State authorities been able to take action against the firm, instead of being impelled by the evidence to take action against  an individual. They thought the case was so strong that it should be considered by the Federal authorities. I went through the papers very carefully and sent them' on to the Crown Solicitor and the Crown Law authorities, and the Attorney-General gave his opinion upon them. I considered that opinion, reconsidered the papers, and took the action which has resulted in the prohibition imposed upon the correspondence of this firm. The moment that I imposed that prohibition I was asked to grant* an inquiry. Naturally I declined to do so. I took the step which I,did deliberately, and I had consulted the Crown Law officers upon the matter. </para>

                        <para>- They had been heard before. If honorable members will take the trouble to read the papers which were laid upon the table of the Senate more than six weeks ago, I am confident that they will indorse my action. The Prime Minister stated publicly that he would offer no opposition to a Select Committee being appointed by' the Senate. I declared that I would take the earliest opportunity of laying the whole of the papers before Parliament. As the Senate met before this House, the whole of the papers were laid upon the table of that Chamber. Honor- ' able senators had access to them. For months past they have had an opportunity to appoint a Select Committee to inquire into this case, and they have not done so. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. The action which' I took was fully warranted by the papers to which I have referred, and was backed, up by the Crown Law authorities. But the Prime Minister held that, however strong my case might be, and however decided my view upon the matter, Parliament had a perfect right to review it. The papers which are now upon the table of the Senate were forwarded to me through the Victorian police. The honorable member for Riverina says that I was prompted to take action by the Medical Association. In reply, I repeat what I said by way of interjection, namely, that neither the Medical Association nor any other association, nor any individual, approached me in the matter, either directly or indirectly, until after my decision had been made public. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not propose to traverse the very interesting case which has been referred to by the honorable member for Riverina. The consideration of that matter had better be left until another occasion, when it can be dealt with upon its merits. I wish to direct the attention of the Committee to the report of the Public Service Commissioner, and to. certain matters which he deems to be of sufficient importance to justify him in dealing with them at considerable length. The first one relates to the question of the retirement of public servants upon attaining a certain age, namely, from sixty to sixty-five years. The Commissioner deals with this question on pages 12 and 13 of his report. He points out that during 1906 some 35 officers were obliged to retire on account of having attained the age limit, and that during 1907-8 181 officers will be due to retire. He also directs attention to. the particular action of the Postal Department in retaining the services of an officer who has passed the maximum '.age limit, namely, sixty-five years.. He regards this matter as of so. much importance - so far as it affects the efficiency of the service - that he has forwarded a long communication to the Department in regard to it. He points out the evil of allowing officers - no matter how efficient or how expert they may have been - to occupy an important position in the service, after attaining the age limit, and the reasons which actuated Parliament in fixing that limit. Just one quotation from his letter will set out his position. He writes - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <quote>
                    <para>If the promotion of officers to the highest positions is delayed until they are nearing the statutory age, no marked improvement can be expected in the Service. When they get to the highest  positions  they have only a few years to serve, and naturally make little effort to effect reforms or improve things, their main object being, with few exceptions, to make matters comfortable for themselves for the few years  they  have to remain. This must be bad for the public interest : but if officers go to " the top " in the earlier years of .their lives, they naturally set out to improve matters, and so build up an official reputation. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is the effect which it has upon the rank and file. But the effect, which it has upon the officer primarily concerned, and upon the service through him, is set out in the following paragraph - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>In a Service where officers are kept on beyond the term of sixty-five years, it must inevitably follow that their successors are likely to be men who -have- been accustomed to an antiquated <inline font-style="italic">régime,</inline> especially when the head  posi-tions  have been filled for a series of years by men nearing the retiring age, because when an officer is approaching the time for his severance from the Service, he makes little effort to change things; his mind, as a rule, is not so receptive as a younger man's, and, as a consequence, his conservatism becomes accentuated. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Those are the positions which the Commissioner sets out. He lays down very clearly what will be the effect upon the service if there is any departure from the law, and' he draws special attention to the case of a leading officer in the Postmaster-General's Department being retained over the age limit, and the demoralizing effect which it has upon the whole service. Take the cases of men, some of whom do not hold very high positions or receive large salaries, out of which they can provide for their old age, and whose superannuation allowance, if any, is very small. As soon as these men reach the age limit, they are required to go. Their cases cannot be given special consideration. They are told, "That is the law and the policy of the Commonwealth," . and their appeals are passed over without result. In this particular case, however, the Postmaster-General makes a departure in favour of his right-hand man - a gentleman against whom I am not prepared to say a "word; who has administered the Department with very considerable capacity, and who has command of his faculties despite his increasing years. It is not from the point of the individual, as the Commissioner points out, that this matter has to be looked at ; we have to consider the effect which it will have on the whole Department. If the Minister can make a departure from the practice on behalf of his leading officer, where is the line to be drawn ? Why not allow the humble man in the back country, who is,' perhaps, supervising the construction of telegraphs or telephones, or any man in the lower. grades of the service, the same privilege as is . extended to this leading officer? If that were permitted, it would produce the effect which the Commissioner has pointed out.  He says that the state of affairs under the Commonwealth would drift back to what it was under the States, and that for years officers would be kept out. of their well'-earned promotion. It must be borne in mind that the legitimate expectations of all the younger officers is a matter of no less consideration than the pecuniary circumstances of officers who have reached the retiring age. I understand that .the honorable member for Kalgoorlie has taken this matter in hand, and proposes to test the feeling of the Committee on the policy which .the Postmaster-General has initiated of practically breaking down the spirit of the "law in the interests of a particular officer in his Department. </para>

                        <para>- That is what the Commissioner is contending for. In his report, he says that the law should be honorably observed, and applied not merely to the officers in the lower grades, but right through the service. I can well understand the demoralizing effect which this departure will have. Men who have devoted their lives to the Public Service, just as completely as this particular officer has done, and given the country the benefit of their abilities, are informed, when they reach the age of sixty-five years, that they must retire in the terms of the Act. They naturally say, " If we were only placed alongside the Ministerial chair; if we were fortunate enough to hold the position which his leading officer occupies, how different would our treatment be." This departure on the part of the Postmaster-General is not justified, and must tend to. restore the state of affairs which obtained in the preFederal days, and which the House set out to reform when it framed the Public Service Act. I think that this initial move of the Postmaster-General should not be allowed to pass by without a protest, and certainly the PublicService Commissioner has done his duty to the Public Service and to this House in calling attention to a breach of the spirit of the law by the Postmaster-General. Another matter is dealt with by the Commissioner on page 23 of his report. Under the head of " Evasions of the Law," he deals with the case of another officer in the Postmaster-General's Department. A very able and courteous officer, who ranks next to the Secretary, is suddenly promoted from the clerical to the administrative staff, and we have, as the Commissioner points out, the anomaly of two administrators in one Department. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, to investigate their own work. I do not desire to weary the Committee by reading the whole of the correspondence about this case, as it is in print. I believe that if honorable members will peruse it carefully they will see that there has been a very sharp conflict between the Commissioner and the head of this Department with respect to this appointment, and that an officer, without his duties having been increased, has been raised from the clerical to the administrative staff, and thus given an increased salary which the Act does hot allow to him as a clerical officer. As the Commissioner very properly asks, if the Postmaster-General wishes to give to this officer an increased salary for the services that he renders, why not raise the salaries of all clerical officers who are performing equally important work? </para>

                        <para>- The Central Office should concern itself chiefly with matters of policy. If honorable members wish to find out how much the working of the Department is clogged by the system of centralization, they have only to look up the Commissioner's report. He shows the need for greater decentralization, and quotes a pertinent paragraph from the report of a Commission which recently investigated the tendency to centralization in Great Britain. That report strongly supports his policy. If, as the Minister says, there is other correspondence on the subject, he should put it be-  fore us, so that we may be fully informed. Then I believe it to be unwise to make fish of one and flesh of another in the Service - to retain, after he has reached the age of sixty-five years, a man at the top of the tree, and to compel all others to retire in accordance with the provisions of the Act. </para>

                    <para>.- I protest again, as I did some years ago, against what appears to be a distinct act of favoritism. The provision of the Act requiring public servants to retire at the age of sixty-five years should be enforced throughout the service, without regard to the position of the officers affected. Officers in the lower branches of the service when approaching the age of sixty-five years, are treated with contemptible meanness. Instead of being allowed to remain until that age is reached, and then being given the six months' leave to which they are entitled, they are made to retire at the age of sixty four and a-half years, no matter how capable they may be. I protested against the retention of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Todd, as a bad precedent. Under the present system, officers who have been at the head of Departments have ex-Ministers pleading for them, as has happened tonight. I remember when the honorable member for Coolgardie protested against the retention of the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Todd. </para>

                        <para>- When officers are turned out of the service before they have reached the age of sixty-five, the rights which are supposed to be preserved to them by the Constitution are violated. Under the State Act there was no question as to the retiring age. Officers taken over from the South Australian service have fared very badly not only in respect to the retiring age, but in regard to salaries and many conditions which obtained under the State law. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there is in South Australia a Commonwealth officer' who would not say that his treatment to-day is considerably worse than it was under the State Public Service Act. Hundreds of them have not received from the Commonwealth an increase of even 6d. per annum, although under the State law they were entitled to annual increments. The " Federal Ten," who issued a manifesto in favour of Federation in South Australia, addressed meetings of public servants in that State with a view of securing their influence to carry the Constitution Bill, and they promised them that under clause 84 of that Bill their rights would be absolutely preserved to them. Section 84 of the Constitution was embodied in the Public Service Act, in order to protect them, yet they have been robbed of hundreds of pounds to which they were entitled under the State law. I was amazed to hear this evening of the great increase in the number of hands employed by the Department. In South Australia, the services of the Department, more particularly in country districts,  are far worse than they were prior to Federation. Even on the recommendation of the Deputy Postmaster- General in South Australia we cannot obtain the services of an additional letter carrier in any place where there is a daily delivery. </para>

Ministers and heads of Departments always discover that the services of such men are of special value, whereas those in the lower grades are turned adrift, on reaching not the retiring age - sixty -five years - but sixty-four and a-half years. </para>

                        <para>- These men are told that they must take their six months' furlough before instead of after they reach sixty-five years of age. I regard as utter meanness such treatment of well-tried, honest servants. We should be loud in our protests if a private employer were guilty Of it. Many of the men whose services are retained after they reach the retiring age earn as much in one week as others do in three months. </para>

                        <para>- The highly-paid officers are alone receiving consideration in that respect. I desire once more to protest against the starving of country services. Hundreds of small mail contracts of vast importance to rural districts - although they may appear unimportant to those residing in large cities, where mails are delivered several times a day - have been cut off. The whole trend of the service to-day is in the direction of centralization. The Estimate's bear out' my contention. I know of cases in which the recommendation of the  Deputy  Postmaster-General of South Australia, that additional letter carriers or messengers should be employed, has been vetoed by some one in the central administration. I hope that the representatives of Western Australia will not think that I am taking exception to the treatment of officers of the Department in that State in pointing out that, whilst in certain cases they are entitled, under a regulation, to receive 5 per cent. more than is paid to men doing similar work in other parts of the State, that regulation has not been applied to South Australia. I have fairly good authority for the statement that Commonwealth line repairers in South Australia, working between Point Lincoln and Eucla, receive no such allowance, although they have to work side by side with men in the Western Australian branch of the service who do. I venture to say that the same conditions prevail in the northern parts of Queensland and New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- I do hot exactly' know; but I think the allowances were fairly uniform. The allowances in the case of South Australia were fixed under the State law, and were considerably cut down under the Commonwealth ; but, on representations being made, a new rate was established, which, I think, is fair, and is, I understand, observed throughout. The class of men of whom I am speaking are kept moving about, and lead a most unpleasant kind of life, some of them having a range of 300 or 400 miles, in which they have to attend to the telegraph lines and keep them in repair. T think it necessary to mention these matters, so that no anomalies may be permitted. When speaking last on this subject, I referred to what I termed a bungle in the calling of tenders for' the mail service to Spencer's Gulf. I said then that, in my opinion, the only parties to benefit would be the Adelaide Steamship Company; and I am still qf that opinion. I pointed out then that the tenders were called in such a way as to enable this company to obtain a contract which has resulted in inconveniencing a number of settlers in the Franklin Harbor district. Under the State law, there was, for over twenty year's, a mail service twice a week direct from Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Port Lincoln and Wallaroo ; and this gave a great advantage to the settlers in the way of obtaining supplies.  Under the new system, there was a service twice a 'week, but the mails were landed at Arno Bay. </para>

The Adelaide Steamship Company have been trying to get out  of this contract for years ; and the Department gave the company the alternative of tendering by way of Arno Bay or Wallaroo Bay ; and any business or commonsense man would have known that only one tender could be put in. </para>

                        <para>- The result was this tender for two mails to Arno Bay. After that there was some protest. However, the Government then called for fresh tenders; and the Adelaide Steam-ship Company, having got the price they required - in fact', I think they got £200 more than they had under the previous contract - they asked for £500 more for the service once a week across to Wallaroo. </para>

                        <para>- As to the report, if I were asked to express an opinion, I should say that it was inspired by the Adelaide Steam-ship Company. Paragraph 3 states that the settlers do not send their produce by mail' steamer, but engage ketches, and, consequently, that the trade is not -a lucrative one to the company. How was that information obtained? I venture to say that the paragraph was inspired by the shipping company, who desired to get out of the contract. What has it to do with the Department whether or not produce be sent by boat ? As a matter of fact, there are. thousands of tons of produce sent by boat from Adelaide to Franklin Harbor. It may be true that wheat is not sent, but the reason is that the boats of the company charge considerably more than do the ordinary ketches, and, further, very little consideration is shown for cargoes of wheat carried by mail steamer. It is said that bags of wheat and so forth do not receive half the care in handling on board the steamer that they do on board the ketches. That has nothing to do with the Department ; but, singularly enough, we are told that it' is one of the reasons why the boat service was cut off. Everything in the report goes to confirm my deliberate  and repeated statement, that this service is solely in the interests of the Adelaide Steam-ship Company ; and there is no one in the Franklin Harbor district, where there are over 1,000 settlers, who will not support that statement. Either knowingly or unknowingly, the Adelaide Steam-ship Company have been considered, while the settlers have been deprived of a service to which they have been accustomed for the last twenty years. The thing is done now, and of course the Adelaide Steam-ship Company is in a position . to charge what they like. When they were first asked to undertake this service they asked for £600. When requested to tender a second time they asked for£500. I venture to say that if the Minister or the Deputy Postmaster-General had insisted upon the carriage of the mails from Wallaroo, the Department would not have bad this sum to pay, and they would have had a service for practically the same price as they had been paying, whilst at the same time one of the large wheat-growing districts in South Australia is placed at a great disadvantage. I also wish to protest against the meanness of the Department in connexion with payments for services rendered by certain postmasters and postmistresses in country places. Some of them have to be at their posts 365 days in the year. For these services they receive the enormous payment of£6 a year. Who is responsible for that ? </para>

                        <para>- No; the offices are fixed where it is most convenient for the mail coach to change horses. It is unfair that the Department should pay a paltry pittance for such work. Another matter of which I have to complain is that if any postal facility is wanted in a country district the Department demands a guarantee. But there is no question of a guarantee being demanded in connexion with any large work for one of the big cities. The Department did not demand a 10 per cent. guarantee in connexion with the new telephone line between Melbourne and Sydney, but on a country telephone service a guarantee of10 per cent. plus the cost of attendance at the other end is required. </para>

                        <para>- It is something to get these admissions. They show at least that I have not talked in vain. After a good many years' political experience, I know that it is best to leave well alone, and I thank the Minister for what he has promised. I trust that the Committee of Inquiry will see that 10 per cent. is unnecessary, and that 5 per cent., plus the cost of the attendant, will be ample to protect the Department against the cost of renewals and everything else. There is no other matter to which I wish to refer at present. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly they will. Only to-day, when the Treasurer was giving the Committee some information, we heard from two or three quarters that the honorable gentleman was running the expenses up pretty high. If we are to carry out certain works we must pay for them, and it is not becoming of honorable members who are always harassing the Postmaster-General, in urging upon him the construction of works which involve expenditure, to complain when the Committee is asked to pay for them. I agree with the right honorable member for East Sydney that, in dealing with the Post and Telegraph service, which requires continually the expenditure of a great amount of money upon new buildings, and the erection of new telegraph and telephone lines, it is impossible to finance the Department out of revenue. It seems to me ridiculous to hope to do so, vet we are endeavouring to do so. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. We have done it, but the way in which we have done it has given great dissatisfaction. I have always been a cautious individual, and I do not wish to tell the Postmaster-General or the Treasurer that they might alter their system. I know that they would not take my advice if I offered it. But I do think that greater consideration should be given to this phase of the question than it has received in the past. We should realize that in connexion with this Department particularly there is every year a great expansion of business, and the money required to meet the demands for new expenditure must be obtained somewhere. We cannot hope to obtain all that is required from revenue, and it is not business-like to expect to get in one year sufficient revenue from a particular work to cover the expenditure upon it. </para>

In common with most other members of the Committee, I wish to see the post-offices in my division made fit for the work which has to be carried on there. The Minister, and even the honorable member for Coolgardie, will doubtless admit that from the manufacturing standpoint my division is the most important in the whole of Australia, and it is fair on that account that some consideration should be given to it. There is this difference, however, between myself and other honorable members, that if the Government undertake to carry out the works required, I am willing to give my assistance to find the wherewithal for the purpose. </para>

                        <para>- For the whole of Australia. I do not look at these matters in the narrow way in which the honorable member for Barrier does. In view of the enormous expenditure which is necessary if the work of this Department is to be properly carried on, it is essential that we should assist the Treasurer, instead of obstructing him, in finding the money. I do not wish to labour the question, but I have a few words to say with respect to the work of the Public Service Commissioner. I may be thought unfair in taking the stand </para>

                <para class="block">I do, but I do not blame the Commissioner. I believe that while it was necessary to put a stop to political favoritism in our public Departments, we have created something worse than existed there before. It was necessary that something should be done, but though Parliament no doubt meant well, I think it did not do what was right in this matter. Our public servants are worthy of consideration, and, as I said earlier, in discussing the Estimates, if we expect anything from them, we should endeavour to make their position as satisfactory as possible. But what do we find? In the Post and Telegraph Department, men who have for years applied themselves faithfully to the performance of their duties, times without number find officers appointed over their heads, and they have no redress. I am reminded by the position of the head of a Department of the story that a little boy once asked his father, What is a great man? and the father said, " A great man, my son, is a man who has a lot of assistants around him, who take the blame for all his mistakes, whilst he takes credit for all their good ideas." The heads of Departments occupy just that position. Men below them get credit for nothing. Unfortunately, it happens in a great number of cases that if a man is a horticulturist, and makes presents of nice flowers occasionally, or of a pet bull dog, or, in other words, if he is lickspittle, it is possible for him to secure promotion over men who would not stoop to that sort of thing. It is possible in these Departments for a man to have an officer put over his head who is by many years his junior, and he is unable to prevent it. </para>

                        <para>- No, but I propose to show how it might be prevented. I am not blaming the Public Service Commissioner for what occurs. He can only make use of the machinery with which he is provided. He has to take his advice from heads of Departments, who, being human, are influenced by human likes and dislikes, and as a result the most capable man does not always secure promotion. We are told that he is the best judge. But I say that in our Public Service instead of an appointment being made before a man who is entitled to look for it becomes aware of what is being done, every appointment should be made as from some future date. The man who feels aggrieved should be able to apply for the post, and have his claims considered, and should be able to show that he is capable of carrying out the duties of the position to which another has been appointed. That is not asking too much. </para>

                        <para>- No. The first the man knows of it is when the appointment is gazetted. I knew a case in the Melbourne General Post Office, where a man of exceptional ability was overlooked. Another man was placed over his head, and he knew nothing of it until the appointment was gazetted. He complained to the Commissioner, who admitted that he believed that he had not been fairly dealt with, but added that the appointment had been made, and that there could be no redress. That sort of thing is not fair, and men treated in that way cannot be expected to apply themselves to their work with the same zeal as before. Again I say I do not blame the Commissioner. He may make mistakes, and in any case he could not please everybody. But I blame the present system. The law should be altered so that a man who feels aggrieved might be allowed to prove his fitness for the position beforehand.  His  claim could be easily tested by examination. If he does prove his fitness, and is the senior, he should undoubtedly get the reward of his seniority and fitness. I believe that, under the present system, this sort of injustice is more rampant in the Post and Telegraph Department than in any other, and that is why I am applying myself so strongly to it now. The Minister must have had cases of the sort brought under his notice. Undoubtedly, the Commissioner has, and something should be done to stop the unrest and discontent which is being caused in the Department by the influence which is retarding the promotion of some men, and selecting others to fill posts which they should not obtain. </para>

                        <para>- He has positively no redress under the present system. Is that better than the old system of political influence? The head of the Department selects his favourite for a vacancy, and the others have no redress. Will this House tolerate that sort of thing? We have heard on all hands .condemnation of the unfortunate Commissioner, who- is not to blame. The fault lies with the system which the Commissioner has to handle. It is impossible for him to know the fitness of ' every man in the service. -He has to take 'the- advice of the heads of Departments, and if  he gets bad advice, there is no remedy. We should bring into effect .some other system which will prevent the recurrence of what has happened' in the past.  I am one- of those who believe that the -people in the country should get assistance from the more closely inhabited centres, and that when a postal or telephone service is needed in distant parts, the question of expense should not always be considered.  One should pay for the facilities given to others. That applies, not only to postal services, but to schools and railways. But, unfortunately, the- people in the country are the first to cry out if there is any Socialism that does not suit themselves. This is a form of Socialism that I believe in, and that will have to be brought about. The people in sparsely populated districts should have the same facilities as those in .thickly settled parts enjoy. </para>

I do not believe that the people in the towns object to the people in the country getting every facility from the Post and Telegraph Department. I am sure that they will agree to pay their share ; but when any loss is made, it is from the country that the howl comes that it was a socialistic idea which should not have been countenanced. In- spite of all the grumbling about the administration of the Department, and in spite of many features in connexion with it- that none of us like to see, we should never forget that it is all a question of money, and that -it is foolish to endeavour to finance the Department entirely from each year's revenue. The Minister should bring about some other system whereby the expenditure could be charged over a larger number of years, instead of to the current year. </para>

Some months' ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oxenham's</inline> designation was at the request and on the recommendation of the permanent head, altered to that of "Assistant Secretary." This having been effected, the permanent head subsequently submitted a recommendation that the position of Assistant Secretary be placed in the Administrative Division. After giving full consideration to the representations made, I could not see my way to accede to the request, and the Secretary was informed accordingly. Thereafter followed a series of communications between this office and the Department on the subject, the contents of which I consider should be set out <inline font-style="italic">verbatim,</inline> so that Parliament may be cognizant of all the circumstances of the case; as I note that, despite my refusal to comply with the departmental request, the position of Assistant Secretary appears in the current Estimates as an administrative position, with a salary of£700 assigned to it. </para>

                    <para>There is one matter, however, which, to my mind, savours of an attempt to circumvent the salary limitations prescribed by the Act, and which, owing to its special importance as affecting the proper administration of the Service, calls for special attention. </para>

                <para class="block">The only additional communication is one dated 10th January of the present year, containing a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> on the whole position, in which practically the Minister undertakes the serious responsibility of overriding the decision of the Commissioner. I do not see that this communication touches in one iota the position set out by that officer. It practically bears out all that he contended for. First of all, the request for an assistant secretary was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott,</inline> without any reference to the transfer of that position to another classification, and it was only when the request came some months later to place the position in the administrative branch, where an increased salary could be allotted, that the objection was raised. The Commissioner has stood by his objection from that point up to the present time, and the Minister has been compelled to take the extreme step of setting aside the advice of the Commissioner and practically becoming a law unto himself. That is what I object to. The Parliament placed these various powers in the hands of the Commissioner ; and if the Minister is to override his decisions and recommendations, practically his ceases to be an office of any considerable importance, and the sooner, under these conditions, it is wiped out and the Minister made sole arbiter the better. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that is a correct statement. My experience of Ministerial administration of the Public Service in New South Wales was of such a character that I hope it will not be adopted by the Commonwealth. The present system, with all its flaws, is a very great improvement upon the Ministerial system, and we shall be very wise to mark with jealous care the attempts of any Minister to make an inroad upon the principles laid down in the Public Service Act. I contend that the extracts I have read do not detract one iota from the position taken up by the Commissioner. He set himself to oppose the transfer of this officer to the administrative division for the reasons he gave, and the Committee is now asked to vote a salary for an administrative officer, not with the approval of the Commissioner, but in direct opposition to him. My desire has been to state the real position so that if the Committee in its wisdom should decide to support the Minister and belittle the section of the Act which appoints the Commissioner to deal with the Public Service, it will do so with its eyes open. </para>

It was required in 'the main for administrative purposes, and therefore it should carry with it a salary 'commensurate with the responsibility pertaining thereto. The Government approved of the proposal, and in order to 'test the" justice of it put a sum on the Estimates. I am quite confident that the Committee will be acting rightly if it agrees to the increased salary.' That is the whole case in a nutshell. No one has been overridden. The appointment was in accordance 'with the spirit of the Act, and brings our administration into line with that of New Zealand, where there are two officers. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not wish to re-open a matter which was put before the Committee at such length by the honorable  member for Riverina, or to say anything of what has been done in the past ; I merely desire to express the opinion that the Postmaster-General, in exercising the very arbitrary power given to him by the Postal Act, which, makes him a judge without appeal, should allow those affected an opportunity to be heard. The- exercise of this power is very different from an ordinary administrative act, in regard to which he may take the advice of his colleagues. In the exercise pf what is a judicial function, although he may consult his colleagues or any one else, the law requires him to form an opinion of his own before taking action against an individual. If all his colleagues had one opinion, and he the contrary, it would be his duty to act on his opinion; but it will strengthen his position with Parliament and with the public if he follows the time-honoured rule of giving those affected the opportunity to make any explanation they like in reply to the charges brought against them. In fulfilling a judicial obligation, the Minister should act judicially, and no man can be said to do so who does not, before pronouncing judgment, hear the person charged. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for East Sydney. While I have no sympathy with those who are following improper callings, I think that the Minister should hear their explanations. I understand that the effect of his action is to prevent the delivery of correspondence at a proscribed address, even to members of the family not personally concerned, so that the innocent have to suffer. I do not know the merits of this case, but it is contrary to my ideas of justice to give a decision without hearing both sides. There should, too,, be the possibility of appeal. The honorable member for Calare has brought forward a glaring instance of the attempts of the ex-Postmaster-General to circumvent the Public Service Commissioner, in order to bring his friends to the front, and to increase, their salaries. This is. a scandal, and is about the third instance of the kind which has come under my notice. The officer concerned matters little; but in this case he happens to be one who travelled' to Rome with the honorable member for Eden-Monaro. </para>

                        <para>- The report of the Public Service Commissioner is in print, and it contains the correspondence on the subject. He saw no need for the appointment. When the present Postmaster-General accepted office, he thought that he should be loyal to his predecessor, showing himself to be a mere sapling, capable of being bent in any direction. At last pressure seems to have been brought to bear on the Public Service Commissioner, and, to suit the honorable member for Maribyrnong, things have been made to read pleasantly. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. It  is  a scandal. I have brought under notice several other cases in which the same Minister has placed juniors over the heads of seniors. I have shown that after the last general election he placed over the heads of seniors postal officials who were engaged at the chief polling places in his electorate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page.</inline> - Who is this? </para>

That was the arrangement when we left on Friday for our homes, but, for some reason, an honorable member opposite deemed' it wise that the further consideration of these Estimates should be postponed until today. From the same quarter, this afternoon, we have had a lengthy debate respecting a certain case. </para>

                        <para>- So I should imagine. It has lately been guilty of some very erratic acts, and I propose to make a few observations about one, to which allusion has just been made by the honorable member for Robertson. A very unwise attitude has been adopted by the Postmaster-General, as well as by his predecessor, towards the Public Service Commissioner. I venture to say that if names were excluded from the correspondence which has been laid before us, and honorable members did not know who had written the memoranda, they would come to the conclusion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> was the Public Service Commissioner, and that the Commissioner himself was really a subordinate officer in the Department. The militant and patronising tone adopted by Mr. Scott in this correspondence is entirely misplaced. It conveys the impression that he has been trying to bully the Commissioner to do what the Commissioner thinks ought not to be done. That tone should not be adopted by an officer who is supposed to be under the absolute control of the Public Service Commissioner. If the Public Service Act does not apply to the highly-placed officers of the service - if it breaks down when it is applied to the heads of Departments - it breaks down when it is put to the only real test that can be applied to it. If the Commissioner is to be subjected to such an indignity in relation to highly-placed officials, how can we expect loyal service on the part of the lower-grade officers? </para>

                            distinctly says that he is authorized by the Minister so to write. The Minister should not have given a direction for such correspondence to be addressed to the Commissioner.. I can conceive of nothing more destructive of the discipline of the Department than that officers in subordinate positions should be able to read that the Minister had directed that the Commissioner should be treated in this way. And for what? Simply because, acting on proper grounds, he said that in his judgment there ought not to be two heads in the one Department. That is an unassailable position to take up.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan</inline>
                            says that trouble will ensue if there be two administrative heads in the one Department. In other words, he stands up for full and clear responsibility on the part of the man at the head of the Department, and it is possible to fasten him to that responsibility only when he is made solely responsible for his own Department. In that respect, the Commissioner has adopted an attitude which will commend itself to every' business man outside the Department, as well as to every well-balanced officer in it. If we have at the head of the Department two men adopting different attitudes with respect to different questions - if we put
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oxenham</inline>
                            on the same administrative plane as

                        <para>- Because he was disgusted with the service, and he left for the same reason that many of the strong men  are  leaving. The moment they reach the age limit, or get near to it, they are glad to go, find it is one of my chief complaints that the best men are being driven out. In New South Wales, at the present moment, there is one man taking his six months' leave preparatory to retiring, who is  as  strong a  man  and  as  able to serve his country as any one  in the  service. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Russell</inline> - a hardy independents-minded man, who is leaving the moment he is entitled to do so, because he will not tolerate the humbug of the central administration. </para>

                        <para>- We have the statement that since Federation the Post and Telegraph Department has earned 30 per cent. more revenue and spent 20 per cent. in earning it. We have had a few boom years since Federation, and, with a rising revenue, there cannot be said to be much starvation in face of the figures I have quoted. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; and I assume that the conditions were normal, as, indeed, they were at the time of Federation. We are told that there is an accumulation of requirements, which necessitates special provision and so we find now that there is a revenue 5 per cent. higher, an expenditure 11 per cent. higher, new appointments 14 per cent. of the total ; and that, in spite of the booming returns, there is a deficit of£352,000. </para>

                        <para>- That is the statement made; and may I ask the Postmaster-General how he accounts for it. We have had placed before us a statement of the benefits which the officers have enjoyed since Federation in the shape of longer furloughs, more holidays, and more overtime. According to the statement everything seems to be " as right as right can be." If this be correct, we have the curious position that the better the condition of the men the more the discontent. </para>

                        <para>- I can conceive of no graver reflection upon the  Deputy  Postmasters-General than that the PostmasterGeneralshould have said such a thing about them. Had I been here I should have challenged the remark instantly. I venture to say that the deputies are striving their very utmost to do their duty, and so far as my knowledge of them goes, they have any thing but a rosy time of it. I know an officer in Sydney who acted as temporary  Deputy  Postmaster-General for some months. He is a man of ability and loyalty, as the Minister knows. When a selection had to be made of a  Deputy  Postmaster-General for that State this man would not put in an application for the position. He had had quite enough of it. He was only there six months and did not want to occupy the position any longer. When we see this kind of thing going on through all the ranks of the service from the bottom to the top we must recognise that there is a want of tone and effective control. At the same time there must be a want of sympathetic treatment somewhere or other from the head of the Department. I do not. pretend to say where the trouble is, except that I believe it to be at the head. I will not mention names. It is not a nice thing to do at all. But I do say that we ought to stop blaming those at a distance. It is very cheap and easy to do it, but these men are doing their best to grapple with a serious position in the States, whilst at headquarters the red tape is being lengthened by the mile. It is time that some protest was made when we find Minister after Minister bespattering the central authorities with praise for all that they do, whilst superior officers in other parts of the Continent are blamed. I do not believe in that kind of thing. I do not think that such treatment is just or is deserved. Honorable members have only to look at the correspondence which has been laid upon the table to see the source of the trouble in this Department. I draw attention to this opening sentence in the minute of the Secretary of the Department - </para>

                    <para>It has been evident for some considerable time past that the number of senior and responsible officers in the central office of this Department has not been sufficient to cope with the work. It was anticipated that after a time the volume of work would diminish, in which event the difficulties under which the staff, including myself, have laboured would have been lessened or removed. This anticipation has not only not been realized, but the work has been increasing in volume and importance from year to year, until with the few senior officers available it has become unmanageable. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">If honorable members will think over that for a moment they will see that the beginning of the trouble is undue centralization. There it is, and it unconsciously comes out at the very beginning of this correspondence. If honorable members will read the correspondence through they will see that the same note dominates the whole Department. I therefore say to the Minister that if he wishes the service to be satisfactory and efficient he will remedy this state of things. I am only saying now what I have said for the last seven years.I feel inclined to turn up some of the debates of former years to show how completely I forecasted what has exactly come about. The Minister can appoint what Committees he likes, but unless he insists upon a thorough devolution of power no better results will be shown in the future than have been shown in the past. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member's experience has. been a happy one. I admit that his electorate is peculiarly placed, and I have no doubt that he has not suffered from some disabilities which have attached to honorable members in other instances. I wish him joy in his efforts, and am glad that he is succeeding. In my judgment this Cabinet Committee can do no good. I believe that it has been simply appointed to stall off inquiry for a little while. It is a political movement and nothing else. Something had to be done, and so the Government said,  ' We will do this in the Cabinet and then, perhaps, we shall satisfy those people outside. ". But when a Cabinet appoints a Committee to inquire into the working of a Department over which a Minister presides it is time for that Minister to consider his own position. Instead of taking the Chairmanship of the Committee thus appointed he ought to realize his own responsibility. I hope that my honorable friend will not think that there is anything personal in these remarks. But it is time for the Minister in charge of his Department to consider where he stands in relation to the Cabinet and the country. The Government may have their Committee, who may go all over Australia, but they "will not bring about content in the service. They will not obtain the requisite evidence to enable them to arrive at a just decision. They will not find that many subordinate officers will be prepared to stand up to the Minister and the Secretary, who may happen to be there. Not many of the underpaid men in the service will be prepared to tell the Minister to his face that he is not treating them properly. </para>

                        <para>- A few of them may do so. But that is not the way to get the best results. This inquiry will come to nought, as in my judgment it is intended to do. It is meant to stave off pressure. But the public will not be satisfied with anything short of a thorough investigation, and that, in my judgment, they are entitled to have. My idea would be to get a few of the best business men in this House. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see why we should not appoint one or two first-class business men from outside, with one or two who might be selected from this House and from the Senate. Much, in my opinion everything, would depend upon the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Committee, and, we should have a Committee of independent men, who would be able to bring their business acumen to bear upon the methods and procedure adopted in this Department, and see whether they could not unravel the tangled skein which is at present causing so much trouble right through it. I sincerely hope that that will be done. If there is to be a division upon these Estimates, I shall be compelled to vote in such a way as will express my view of what the Government have done in regard to the appointment of this Committee of the Cabinet, and to emphasize the necessity, in my judgment, of a thorough investigation of the working of this Department. </para>

                        <para>- If Ministers have so arranged the business of Parliament that there is nothing for the Senate to do, that is not the. fault of honorable members. It is not unreasonable to ask that we should now report progress. The Estimates of the Post and Telegraph Department are very important, and this is only the second day on which they have been under debate. Does the Minister propose to report progress ? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta, who was "at one time Postmaster-General of New South Wales, says that  it was the practice there, and we know it is the practice in the House of Commons, because we have a case in point where, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CampbellBannerman</inline> was Minister of War, a reduction of £1  was moved in his salary, which led to the defeat of the Liberal Party. I think it would be an admirable thing to adopt that practice here, because, if honorable members were dissatisfied with the management of a particular Department, it would be possible to deal with the matter effectively by moving a reduction of <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> in the salary of the Minister in charge of it. I take it that the motion for a reduction of  £1  in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott's</inline> salary is intended as a vote of want of confidence in the working of the Post and Telegraph -Department. </para>

                        <para>- I am unable to say, as I am not acquainted with the circumstances in their cases. Compulsory retirement of an officer after he has reached a certain age is a very good provision as a general rule, and I should like to see its application extended even to the High Court; but where there are special reasons for retaining the services of a particular officer, the Minister should have the power to retain them. I have said that I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott's</inline> services have been retained,. We have heard from the honorable member for Parramatta a strong defence of the  Deputy  Postmaster-General of New South Wales, and of the staff generally in the head-office at Sydney. We have heard that they -are unduly interfered with by the Central Office of the Department. I have only to say that since I- became a member of the Federal Parliament, and even before that, </para>

                <para class="block">I- have not been very favorably impressed by the way in which the authorities of the head-office in Sydney treated the constituency I represent, which is as much a part of New South Wales as is Parramatta, or any other constituency in that State. Since the establishment of the Federal Parliament, and after bringing grievances existing in my constituency under the notice of the Central Office, I have been blocked in my efforts -to obtain justice and fair play. I might instance a number of cases, but I shall mention one in particular. It has been said that the Central Office of the Department deals unfairly with the staff at the head-office in Sydney ; but this is the way in which the head-office in Sydney treats subordinates in the back-blocks of New. South Wales: Some time since, a young fellow was engaged as a temporary hand at Broken Hill, and was paid 25s. a week. He was entitled, after a time, to a holiday of four weeks. He went up for . his examination, asked for four weeks' holiday, and obtained it. Whilst  on  holiday lie discovered that he had failed in the examination, and consequently was unable to go on to the permanent staff. But in the midst of his holiday' he was asked by then Department to go into the office and do certain work. He did so, and when he found that he could, not 'become a permanent hand, and his time was up, he asked to be paid for the time that he had put in at the request of the Department during his holidays. That seemed to be a fair and just demand. The postmaster at Broken Hill sent the claim on, but the  Deputy  Postmaster-General in Sydney refused to pay the lad for the two or three weeks for which he had worked during the holiday to which he was entitled. I brought the case before the Central Office in Melbourne, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> said he' must have a report, although from the way in which I put it he admitted that it appeared unjust that the lad should not be paid. He added,, however, that "'there were always two sides to a question,- and he must hear the other side. I am. glad to know that the boy was eventually treated justly, and received the amount that he claimed. ' That case does not show any very great fair play on the part of the head .office in Sydney towards those in subordinate positions. In order to show how 'things are conducted from the' head office in Sydney,  I may state that this lad, when acting temporarily in the hope of getting a permanent position, was paid 25s. a week. It was thought that some one else could be got to take his place, but he was asked to go on for a few weeks. The postmaster at Broken Hill was quite prepared, and, in fact, wished, to employ him. The head office in Sydney said it would employ him, but could pay him only 20s. a week. The young fellow refused the offer, and as a compromise they offered him 22s. 6d., but, he was able, as the Hill was booming at the time, to get some other employment, and so left the Department. That business was conducted, not through the Central Office in Melbourne, but through the great and mighty head office in Sydney. My opinion is that the Sydney office ought to be bustled, and I shall be very glad if the central or some other office does bustle it. </para>

I did not intend to say anything with regard to that matter until I heard the honorable member for Parramatta's remarks. I wish to know whether the Postmaster- General intends to make the toll system universal throughout Australia. At present, every new subscriber must come under it, but those who had telephones previous to a certain date are allowed to continue on the flat rate. The time has come for the Minister to extend the toll system throughout Australia. Either the flat rate is better than the toll System, or the toll system is better than the flat rate. If we are not prepared to make the toll system universal, then we should do away with it, and allow those who are now compelled to come under it to have the flat rate. I believe I was the first in this House to advocate the toll system. I have always believed in it. One argument which had great weight with me was that the people with large businesses received under the flat rate a great deal more service from the Department than they were paying for. The very fact that a large number of people are coming under the toll system confers added benefits on those who remain under the flat rate. Whilst the telephone service is not as good as it ought to be, because of the great pressure that exists - and sometimes I believe we are a little unreasonable when we want an answer immediately we go to the telephone - we must remember that it has gone ahead by leaps and bounds, and that the Department, not being able to get the wire or the instruments, has not been able to cope with the demand for new telephones. Those under the toll system do not use the telephone as often as they would if under the flat rate, because they will naturally be more careful, and that means that those who still remain under the flat rate are reaping a large advantage from the very fact that so many come under the toll system. If that is so, the time has come when we may reasonably expect those who are deriving great advantages under the flat rate to be brought under the toll system. I should like some official pronouncement from the Minister, before the vote is taken on the amendment, as to whether he proposes to bring under the new system those who are now receiving much greater services than they pay for. </para>

                        <para>- That raises quite another question. The Government are charging too much for the toll system. The telephone should go into a person's home for .about a guinea as a retaining fee, and a certain amount should be charged from the very first conversation. I know that my proposal to make the toll system universal will touch the well-to:do. Unfortunately,, we are prepared, even in this House, elected as we are by adult suffrage, to touch the poor a great deal more readily than we are prepared to touch the rich. The people who are under the flat rate system at the present time are no doubt business, and wealthy persons. ' I hope that before the item is passed, the Minister will be good' enough to state whether he purposes to adopt the toll system.. I should like that system to be introduced generally, and the Department to provide a neat little box into which any person could drop a penny who desired to use the telephone, even in private houses. It would make no difference to the Government so long as the toll telephone was used, because they would be paid, but under the flat-rate system the Government naturally objected to the telephone being used by any one except the subscriber. I believe that if the toll system were introduced generally, it would help, the telephone branch, because a great deal more revenue would be obtained than is now received. The service could be extended, and the charges reduced. I understand that some reference has been made to the possibility of separating the telegraph and telephone branches. I desire to know if the Minister intends to take any step in that direction, and- if so, when it is likely to be taken. I also wish to know when he intends to lay upon the table a report showing the expenditure and income in connexion with each post-office throughout the Commonwealth. It is only fair that honorable members should be furnished with that detailed information instead of being told, as at present, that the Department earns and spends so much per year. I should like the Minister to tell the Committee when a Commonwealth postage stamp is likely to be introduced. It is seven years since .the Commonwealth was established, and, in my opinion, the time has arrived when we should have a Commonwealth stamp, which could be used in any State. In the first session of the first Parliament, when a Post and Telegraph Rates Bill was under consideration, I moved the insertion of a clause providing that a Commonwealth stamp should be brought into use within two or three months from the passing of that measure. The Prime Minister asked me not to press my proposal because, he said, that what I desired would be done as early as possible. He certainly gave us the impression that it would not be long before it was done, but he did not want the exact time to be prescribed in the Bill.- On that understanding, my amendment was withdrawn. Years have passed since then, and it appears to me that nothing has been done. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth stamp has not yet arrived. Those who travel from State to State have to carry postage stamps of the various States. It was only, last evening that a stranger asked me on the railway station at Murray Bridge whether I would .be good enough to post in Melbourne two letters which he had forgotten to post at. Adelaide.. I replied that I would gladly oblige him, but it was possible that I might forget to post his letters on the day I arrived. He said he. was quite willing to take the risk. As lie  handed the letters to .me, I observed that each bore a South Australian stamp, and so I told him that it would be of no use for me to post them in Melbourne. Whatever has been done in the matter of providing a Commonwealth stamp has been done in the dark. It is hot known generally that one can obtain a Commonwealth stamp. Perhaps the Minister will explain what has been done. </para>

                        <para>- I said that nothing had ' been done in the matter, but the Postmaster-General replied that something had been done. At any rate, I have not vet seen a Commonwealth stamp, and I am very anxious to learn when it is likely to be introduced. I wish to know also what has been done in regard to the inspectors. This is another matter which I presume has been fixed up by the head office in Sydney, though, no doubt, the Central Office has had to agree to it. The' Secretary to the Department desired at first that  New South Wales should be divided into districts as Queensland was, with an inspector in charge of each. I thought the idea a capital one ; though the inspectors, who lived in Sydney, and the head office there, opposed it. But after the matter had come before Parliament several times, the Honorable Sydney Smith, when Post-  master-General, agreed' that the division should be made. It is not, however, quite satisfactory. . My . own electorate, for instance, has been divided very badly, and forms part of the districts of two inspectors, one of whom goes as far as Wilcannia, and the other as far as White Cliffs. Therefore, if anything has to be done at Wilcannia, it is. necessary to bring an inspector from Wagga, while to do anything  at White Cliffs, an inspector has to be brought from Orange. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately the honorable gentleman- is not. I ask the Committee whether it thinks that it was a brilliant thing for the head office in Sydney to so subdivide New South Wales that two inspectors have to travel all the way round by way of Victoria and South Australis! to get to the district which I represent? We have heard a great deal about the way in which the men in the head office in Sydney have been treated. We have been told that able and distinguished officers are being driven out of the service. It is about time' that some of them were driven out, if they cannot make better arrangements than that of which I am complaining. Another matter upon which 1 wish information has to do with works expenditure. We have been told that there is not sufficient money to carry out necessary works. Now, a telephone has been promised for a long time past for a mining township called the Pinnacle, 9 or 10 miles from Broken Hill. I have received letters from the Department to the effect that reports have been received, and that the work will be commenced as soon as possible. </para>

                    <para>.- At this hour of night, I have no intention of making a long speech ; but there are one or two matters to which I must draw the attention of the Postmaster-General, even if I have to speak until to-morrow morning. We have heard a good deal about the general dissatisfaction with the Post Office administration. No terms could be too strong to use in condemnation of the condition of the service. I do not blame the present POSt.. master-General, although he has had more experience than many would admit, since before receiving his portfolio he acted as sort of relieving Minister. The appointment of a Cabinet Committee of Inquiry is altogether unsatisfactory. Nothing short of a Royal Commission, consisting of business men in and out of Parliament, will be sufficient to make a thorough investigation. </para>

                        <para>- The introduction of a little ability from outside would not be prejudicial to the inquiry. I should like to' know whether the Postmaster-General does not consider that the practice of appointing to post-offices in large provincial towns men who have seen long service in remote country districts is unsatisfactory. Take, for instance, the position in regard to the post-office at West Maitland, where we have had for some time an officer who is practically past all useful work.  His  case may be somewhat exceptional, since he has not enjoyed the best of health. He is approaching the retiring age, and consequently, as he could not hope for any higher salary, could not be blamed, perhaps, if he simply, marked time during the remaining term of his service. He has been granted six months' leave of absence, and his office is now being filled by a younger man, who is receiving a much lower salary, but is doing much better work. I understand that no permanent appointment can be made until the retiring officer's leave has expired.  and that the relieving officer cannot be appointed to the position because he is a junior in the service. It is probable that an officer who has reached the maximum salary in his class will be brought from the back-blocks and placed in charge. I hope that the Postmaster-General will consider this question, and determine whether it is not better to appoint as postmasters in large .provincial towns active officers who have proved themselves capable men, although .they may be receiving comparatively small salaries, rather than officers from back-country offices, on the ground that they have reached a certain age, and the maximum salary of their class. In many counts y districts telephones are needed more urgently than in some of our cities. The people residing iri such districts frequently require to send over long distances urgent messages for medical assistance. Most of them are practically pioneers; they are hard workers, and are willing to assist the Department in making these extensions by- supplying some of the material required, as well as by contributing towards the proposed expenditure; but they have not, and do not, receive the consideration that should be extended to them. Money has been wasted on the construction of a telephone line between Sydney and Melbourne, which is not likely to pay for some years, while country districts have been practically starved. </para>

                        <para>- No; it was a comparatively trifling want ; but I shall make no further reference to it, since I do not want to create friction between Ministers. Complaints are repeatedly made regarding delays in connexion with the trunk line between West Maitland, Newcastle, and Sydney. An expensive line has been constructed, as I have mentioned, between Melbourne and Sydney, but although the charge in respect of the West Maitland-Newcastle-Sydney trunk line is nearly the same, subscribers have often to wait for hours to get connected. I appeal to the Postmaster-General to give special attention to this complaint. He has promised that the service will be improved, but his promises so far have not been fulfilled. I agree with the remarks made by the honorable member for Barrier regarding the postal inspectors. In our country districts, we have two inspectors, where there should probably be six, and consequently 1 they have so much travelling to do that their duties cannot be satisfactorily carried out. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable member think it singular that promises should have been made to him? Year after year, in connexion with the consideration of the Estimates, I have had promises made to me; but have not been able to obtain their fulfilment. As the Treasurer appears to be in a yielding mood, I think it desirable, however, to again bring forward certain grievances, although my experience is that very little is gained by discussing the Estimates. It is true that the Post and Telegraph Department' does not deal hurriedly wilh any question that comes within its purview. If the Ministry imagine that the discontent in the service will be allayed, or the demand for an investigation removed, by the appointment of the Cabinet Committee of Inquiry, <inline font-style="italic">'they</inline> are making a huge mistake. It seems somewhat farcical that members of the Cabinet should be appointed to inquire into their own acts. </para>

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General is very optimistic as to the result of the Cabinet inquiry, but such an inquiry must be more or less an absurdity, unless it is perfectly secret. To come to the proposal immediately before us, I do not care to vote for it, if it is intended as a ."hit" at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott.</inline> Personally, I do not believe in this, system of compulsory retirement at the age of sixty-five. I think that such a rule shows the want of capacity on the part of those who are supposed to gauge the abilities and the remuneration of the officers ; because the mere fact that a man has reached the age of sixty-five does not prove anything as to his fitness. </para>

                        <para>- Further, if we make such a rule as to retirement, it ought not to be departed from. The honorable member for Barrier says that he does not know that any of the other officers who have been compulsorily retired at the age of sixty-five are capable of performing their duties^, but that he does know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> is. I am afraid that the position of the honorable member for Barrier is the position of Ministers, and also of the Public Service Commissioner. These gentlemen know  of those who are immediately around them, and nothing about other officers. Those officers, who have the greatest amount of influence, and can bring it to bear on Ministers or the Commissioners, have a "pull" over others not so favorably circumstanced. </para>

                        <para>- I am not suggesting, corrupt or irregular influence, but merely that people know best those facts and persons with whom they are brought most closely into contact. I suppose the Public Service Commissioner is responsible for reading the Public Service Act, somewhat unfairly, to mean that the retiring age of sixty-five, means actual retirement at sixty-four years and six months, with six months' furlough preparatory to retirement. That seems to me to be rather a mean. way of dealing with an old hand. I am "chock full" of grievances, some of . which have been brought forward on many occasions. Some relate to cases, of injustice to public servants, some to South Australian offices. The Cabinet Committee cannot be expected to rectify many of the errors of administration and of neglect which have occurred. </para>

                        <para>- The alterations suggested by the Minister and his colleagues may, or. may not, receive the support of honorable members. Certainly the Government cannot trust to have their proposals blindly accepted, as many of their measures have been in the past. While I am not satisfied with the appointment of the Cabinet Committee as a means of allaying discontent or restoring public confidence, I admit that it. is very much a matter for Ministers themselves to decide upon. I, at all events, shall do my best to bring about a suitable inquiry with a larger scope, and including members of Parliament of all parties. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with the honorable member for Boothby that we need a public inquiry into the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department. When the Government saw that I had put a notice on the business-paper for the appointment of a Royal Commission of inquiry, I think it was a rather mean trick on their part to avoid full and impartial investigation by appointing a Cabinet Committee. I am satisfied that a number of the matters that require to be looked into relate to Ministerial acts. I do not think that a Committee appointed to judge its own acts will appeal to honorable members. There are one or two matters which I wish to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General, and which require his attention. I have, on several occasions, had to complain of the dilatoriness of the Department in replying to correspondence. Latterly, as the result of complaints made some time ago, communications have been acknowledged on a printed form, but in many instances that is all that one hears about a matter, unless one writes again or interviews the  Deputy  Postmaster-General. I have received correspondence - perhaps from a member of the Council, of the local Progress Association - relating to some postal matter. I have forwarded it to the Department. It has been acknowledged. Perhaps I have lost sight of the matter for some months. But, on receipt of another letter from the persons interested, I have looked into the case again, and found that the Department has done nothing in the meantime. </para>

                        <para>- But not satisfactory ones. For a time there was an improvement, but then the Department fell back into the old state of neglect. Here is a specific instance which has been brought under my notice to-day. It is in connexion with such a simple matter as the erection of a pillar-box. A request was sent in from the Progress Association for the erection of a pillar-box at Wanstead. An inspector was sent out. and reported favorably upon the request. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but I am showing the red-tape method adopted by the Department even in such a simple matter. After a time a notification was received that the matter had been approved, and that a receiver would be erected immediately. Some weeks went by, and then the Department received another reminder that the box had not yet been erected. That necessitated another visit to the Deputy Postmaster-General to ascertain the reason for the delay. Further reports followed from the officers, and later on advice was received that the matter would be attended to immediately. But only to-day I have received a letter which shows that the matter which months ago was to be attended to immediately has not yet been dealt with. The Postmaster-General asked me for a specific instance of the delays to which I referred, and I have given one. It is such cases as this which bring upon the Department deserved public discredit. I hope the Postmaster-General will inquire into the unnecessary delay to which I refer. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and the Committee must recognise the irritation caused by these delays, and the trouble to which honorable members are put, in having to make repeated visits to the authorities, and to write numerous letters about such comparatively trivial things when their time is already fully occupied with other public matters. These small matters, however, are important to the people immediately concerned. Another matter which I have tried time after time, though unsuccessfully, to have dealt with, is the practice followed in retaining the radius from the metropolis fixed for the application of penny postage, so far as New South Wales is concerned. I. have had many applications to deal with the matter from people residing just outside the area to which penny postage is extended. We can quite understand that some time ago it was reasonable to restrict the penny-postage area, but it ought to be understood also that from time to time, as population on the boundaries of the area increases, they should be extended. Under existing conditions, people on one side of a street enjoy the advantage of penny postage, whilst people on the other side of the same street have to pay 2d. for the same service. </para>

                        <para>- There should be a certain discretion left to the heads of Departments to meet cases of this kind. In ;ny constituency, Audley, Lily Pilly, and Port Hacking are just outside the penny-postage boundary, but in the1 last few years a large population has settled in those districts, and there is every indication that here will soon be as large a population just outside the boundary as there is just inside it. Does not the Postmaster-General think that, in order to meet cases of that kind, the time has arrived when there should be an amendment of the Postal Act, if that be necessary, in order to meet the needs of population settled just outside the present limits of the [jenny-postage areas. The only other matter to which I wish to draw attention at present is the question of time in lieu of money for Sunday services. In Victoria and, I think, in South Australia time and a half is given for Sunday work. But that is not done in New South Wales.  .1  propose to quote an extract from a letter which describes very briefly what is done there - </para>

                        <para>- No. That test vote applied to the new contract. I am speaking of the old contract, which is now practically on the same basis as the new contract, to come into operation in 19 10. The interim contract contains practically the same conditions in regard to the carriage of mails on behalf of the Commonwealth, and that being so, the difference in cost during the interregnum ought to be borne by the Commonwealth Government. </para>

                        <para>- I have the, greatest respect for the honorable member's opinion, but after all Queensland is the only State which has to make the payment, although temporarily it applies also to Tasmania. Of course nothing can be done except by the will of Parliament, but  at present the Queensland State Government are paying the extra subsidy, because they could do no better. Any one examining the matter free from prejudice must, see that it is fair that the Commonwealth Government should pay, for the obvious reason that every State should have a share in the mail service, and that the service which is being carried on in the interval has all the restrictions contained in the new contract. I hope that the Postmaster-General and the Treasurer will consider this matter before the final set of Estimates is dealt with. </para>

                    <para>.I regret very much the answer given by the Postmaster-General regarding the installation of the telephone toll system. It seems to me, from his answer, that he has not yet discussed whether any step in that direction is to be taken. It practically means that nothing has been done in the Department, and that its policy is to allow things to drift. I did not expect him to say tonight that he intended to introduce the toll system to-morrow. But I certainly expected him to say whether it was intended to take any step in that direction. </para>

                        <para>- Has' the Minister no idea as to the time when it will be established? For instance, will it be done in six months, or twelve years, or fifty years? Perhaps he will tell us that it cannot be done until the expiration of the Braddon section. I do not intend to support the proposal before the. Committee ; but had the salary of the Minister been under review, the probability is that I should have been prepared to vote for a reduction of it, because I feel that the matter of the toll system has not been discussed by him. </para>

                        <para>- That is something gained, but not much, I do not intend to support the amendment, but it is my intention to bring this question of the toll system before the Chamber again and again, because it is manifestly unjust to compel some persons to come under the toll system and to give the greater advantages of the flat-rate system to others. </para>

                    <para>. - A little time ago I, as leader of the Labour Party, was waited upon by a number of men who had been employed by the Department in dressing telegraph poles, and who, by some act of the Department, or the Public Service Commissioner, had been deprived of work to which they considered they were entitled. I think that they mentioned that, owing to some act of the Minister, they could no longer be employed in that way. I have already mentioned the matter to the honorable gentleman. If I remember aright all these men were tradesmen, who were employed at 10s. a day, until it was discovered by the Commissioner or the Department that they could get younger persons to do the work at a cheaper rate. I should like the Minister to state whether there is any likelihood of these elderly persons being employed again <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the work. </para>

                    <para>. - The men to whom the honorable member has alluded were temporary employésin the pole-yard. After representations were made to various Ministers, that they, ought to be paid the rate of skilled labour, namely, 10s. a day, I made a minute in regard to their payment, and also the payment of temporary telephone fitters. I directed that the ruling rate outside should be paid inside the Department to temporary labourers over whom I had control. That was the order I issued, after the men had importuned me quite a number of times, because I felt that their request was a right one. Afterwards I had a conversation with the Commissioner, who is strongly of opinion that the work is classified too highly at 10s. a day.  His  officers agree with him that 8s. or 8s. 6d. a day is enough. He is doing what he has the right to do under the Public Service Act. He is appointing permanent officers to perform the work at the rate which he has fixed, . and over which I have no control. He considers that the public will be better served by permanent employes, that the rate which he has adopted is ample, and that the people who have been receiving temporary employment have been well treated. </para>

I also wish to enter my protest against the centralization of routine business in the head office in Melbourne, when it could be done more effectually in the capitals of the States, under the direction of the Deputy Postmasters-General. </para>
