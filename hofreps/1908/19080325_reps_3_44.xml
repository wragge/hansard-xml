          <para>- In a telegram from South Australia appearing in to-day&#39;s newspapers, it is stated that the practice followed at Port Adelaide during the last twelve months in regard to Customs entries has been found somewhat unsatisfactory, and a return to the old system is asked for, subject to the modifications necessary to check the possibility of frauds such as were recently discovered being again perpetrated. On the  2nd  October last,Iasked the Minister of Trade and Customs whether entries might not bemade and checked before the reporting of the vessels carrying the goods to which they referred,  and he told me thata trial of that system would be given, and that, if <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> were found to work satisfactorily, it would be made permanent. I now ask him whether any- &#39; thing has been done in the direction of complying with the request which I then voiced for the agents and importers of Port Adelaide. A large deputation had previously waited on the Minister in connexion with the matter. </para>

          <para>- I received at Adelaide a deputation on this subject, and it has since been engaging my attention. When the honorable member asked this question in October last, a trial was being given to the new system, and I deemed it advisable to extend the period of probation. The Department is anxious to give every facility for the passing of entries without the removal of any safeguard against leakage or frauds on the revenue, and I shall be glad to ascertain how the matter stands, and let the honorable and learned member know later the result of my inquiry. </para>

To my mind, the delay is unreasonable. A small work like this should have been put in hand in much shorter time.

In the last instance, it was due to our dependence on the Works Departments of the States, whose officers, when there is pressure, naturally give preference to State undertakings. If the right honorable member will give notice of his question, I shall be glad to obtain a fuller reply. </para>

A number of these Ordinances have already been printed by order of. Parliament, and, so that honorable members may have in their possession a complete and consecutive volume of all the Ordinances of Papua, I moved for the printing of the remainder, to which the House has agreed. </para>

            <para>The truth is - and it is not a pleasant truth - that the Japanese own Thursday Island in everything but name. Practically the whole of the pearling fleet is in their hands. Those boats which are not owned by Japanese are manned by them, and the divers are allowed to keep all the pearls they find, after first of all receiving <inline font-style="italic">&#163;80</inline> a ton for their shell. Twentythree thousand pounds a year is the average value of the pearls obtained, and practically every penny of this goes home to Tokio or Nikko, as well as the &#163;80 per ton for the shell. Australian dealers buy most of the pearls, so that it may be said Australia pays the Japanese over&#163;20,000 per annum for her own pearls. Of the uses to which that&#163;20,000 may be put some of these days there is no need to speak, for every one knows. </para>

The condition of things referred to in the article quoted by the honorable member exists because of the State law in regard to the working of the pearl fisheries. The disposition of the pearls and any advantages gained by the Japanese are not under Commonwealth control. </para>

            <para>- The Treasurer tells me that harvesters are selling in his electorate for&#163;65 each, and we know that there was, in the first instance, a general reduction in price. In October last an investigation was made throughout the States as to prices charged for Australian stripper-harvesters and drills, and it was found that the cash prices charged were in accordance with the Act. No single complaint has reached the Department of any overcharge. It may be mentioned that the Act specially provides for cash prices. Most of the sales are on credit, with various conditions as to the manufacturer keeping the machines in repair, &#38;c, for varying periods. In regard to credit sales, we are advised the Act does not apply. Further investigation is now about to be made in regard to the reduction in prices which the Act provides should become operative from 1st February, 1908. </para>

            <para>- I presume that when the Act in question was passed, the Government had in their minds that the price to be paid for these machines was to be considered as either cash or credit. In other words, they had no intention of asking Parliament to pass a measure, regulating the price of these machines, which would be utterly useless? </para>

            <para>- It will probably be open to the Government to reconsider the whole question of these Excise duties at a comparatively early date, and&#39; to adapt its proposals to what we shall then know ofthe exact constitutional powers of the Parliament. The proposal to fix a credit price is practically impossible, sincethe credit may be for three, six, or twelve months, or for two or three years. The terms are&#39; also coupled in many cases with conditions as to repairing and replacing. There are a variety of  alternatives. I think that the request that a cash price should be stated is perfectly fair, and it can be readily carried out. It is also part of the policy of the Government to provide by law that the price charged to customers, both for stripperharvesters and all other implements or goods to which the new protection can be applied, shall be determined upon a fair basis, and that consumers shall be protected against extortionate charges. That will apply to other things that are brought within the scope of the new protection. </para>

            <para>- Certainly not. The honorable member has misquoted my remarks. In dealing with the question put to meas to the basis of cash price, I read to the House section 4 of the Act. What is the use of the honorable member asking me questions as to what I had in my mind at the time this legislation was before us, when he presumes a knowledge of what I ought to have had in mind at the time? All I can say is that, so far as I can judge, only one construction can be placed upon the words, &#34;If the GovernorGeneral is satisfied that the cash prices &#34; which appear in section 4. </para>

            <para>- Ido not propose to weary the House with a lengthy speech. The Opposition has endeavoured, without success, to minimize some of the very drastic proposals of this measure, but the Government, in this instance, as in many others, have had behind them a majority prepared to impose upon the minority whatever conditions they chose to suggest. In this respect they have succeeded in producing an instrument which, in its penalties, sanctions, and powers, goes far beyond anything that has been attempted in a British community I do not pretend to say that legislation, severe and unusual, is not required to meet the far-reaching evils of industrial trusts ; but the measures should receive the fullest possible consideration, with a desire to make their provisions such as will afford a possibility of administering them as Parliament intended them to be administered. We have not been able to modify any of the drastic provisions in this Bill; but there is the one comfort that, judging by our experience, there is not the slightest danger of those provisions being put into full force. None of the provisions of similar legislation passed by this Chamber have ever been fully operative; and it is just about time for honorable members, in the Labour corner particularly, who are constantly clamouring for legislation, such as we have passed in recent years, to begin to realize that it is simply a political placard, and is intended for nothing more. As shown by the series of questions this afternoon, it is found that the provisions of such measures cannot be enforced in their entirety - that they can be evaded by the easiest of all methods. </para>

              <para>- I venture to say that if the careful consideration that ought to be given were given to such measures, they would leave Parliament in a much more effective form. But where there is a majority who sit tight, and pass anything that the Government propose, and a minority, who can only beat their Reads against a stone wall of unreason and obstinacy, we have not the conditions for achieving the best and most effective legislative results. We are becoming aware of the effects of these measures every day. We are now waiting patiently for the pronouncement of the High Court on the legality of all this class of legislation. </para>

              <para>- I think you are quite right, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> ; the expression was too strong. I desire to say, as emphatically as I am able, that the sooner the people outside, who are particularly interested in this class of legislation, recognise that the effect is to prevent them achieving the expected results, the better it will be for their peace of mind, and for that of everybody concerned. At any rate, we have been turning out legislation of this kind for several years, and there is not one of the measures that the Ministry can, or dare, put into full and effective operation. This, of course, only makes us less careful as to the tremendous powers the Government seek, since we know, from experience, that they are never likely to come into full effect. </para>

            <para>.- It is rather unusual to have a discussion on the third reading of a Bill, but questions have been raised this afternoon, which it would be well to discuss on this motion. I supported the original Act, which failed to attain its purpose, and I have supported the Government in the legislation intended to invest them with further powers. Trusts and combines I regard as a severe and growing disease, and I have strongly supported and voted for giving the Administration the fullest possible powers in order to find a remedy. I believe in the drastic treatment of trusts and combines ; and, like those who support legislation of this character, I desire to see it carried into effect. The honorable member for Parramatta certainly made a strong appeal to those of radical tendencies, to either drop measures of this kind or make them effective.&#39; If we are going beyond our constitutional, powers, the sooner we know the fact the better; because I cannot conceive a more humiliating position than that in which we have been placed during the last two or three years, in regard to measures which have missed fire, either because they were not properly drafted, or because they were unconstitutional. Either those who are responsible for the drafting are not skilful enough, or the Attorney-General is not &#34;up to&#34; the duties of his position. </para>

              <para>- I supported the Commerce Act, and, if offences are being committed in trading operations, the Government ought to put its provisions into force. There is no&#39; doubt that these failures give strength to those who are opposed to all legislation of the kind. The disease inhere, and drastic treatment is required; and I have no desire to escape any responsibility for the ineffectiveness of the means proposed - I desire no &#34;placard&#34;; on the contrary, I desire effective legislation. We are placed in a very humiliating position when, session after session, we have to introduce amending Bills in order to put original Acts into working order. It was thought that when the Federal Parliament was established, it would be an example to the States Parliaments, in that its legislation would be as nearly humanly perfect as possible; it was not anticipated that the Federal Parliament would establish a record for the quantity so much as for the quality of its legislation. I would sooner see the House devote itself to one perfect measure in a session, than to passing four or five others which prove to be unworkable. Those who are bitterly opposed to legislation of the kind, may find some pleasure in the fact that some of the measures have proved inoperative, though I can scarcely think that even they can really be gratified at such results. I admit that the Attorney-General has a very difficult task to perform, but, from the trouble that has arisen, I am inclined to think that he is not sufficiently well supported - that the Crown Law officers and the draftsmen are not up to their work. In the States Parliaments amending Bills  to correct mistakes are not constantly being introduced, as they are in this Parliament. I do not say that the Attorney-General or his officers are responsible in this case, but blame is attachable somewhere. </para>

              <para>- I am not dealing with that aspect of the question; I am merely urging that greater care should be taken to make our legislation effective for the purposes aimed at. I object to the continual passing of legislation which is ineffective. No better weapon could be placed in the hands of our opponents than instances of parliamentary bungling, such as we have seen in connexion with this and other matters, because they give ground for the gibe that Parliament is merely fooling the public. Personally, I have no desire to give the opponents of legislation reasons for ridiculing it, and the Labour Party ought to feel especially humiliated when, time after time, legislation which it has supported breaks down, and requires the introduction of amending Bills. </para>

            <para>- Any honorable member who will not take the responsibility for what he does here is not in his right place; but the best answer to the charges against the Labour Party made by the honorable member for Parramatta was the speech of the honorable member for Dalley. He is in entire accord with the Bill, and so are members of the Labour Party ; not because we think that it will do complete justice between small traders and large combines - we do not consider that possible - but because we regard it as a check on large combines. The main object of the Bill is to prevent the ruin of small traders by large organizations. If we do not pass legislation of this kind, Australia will soon be in the position of other countries in regard to trusts. The honorable members for Parramatta and Dalley, however, spoke as if, in the State Parliament of New South Wales, they had had no experience of amending Bills. I do not think that there has ever been a session of a State Parliament in which an amending Bill has not been introduced. Land legislation was one of the earliest subjects lot parliamentary action, and we know how frequently amending Land Bills have been introduced. </para>

              <para>- It must be remembered that, whereas the State Parliaments, subject to certain qualifications, have practically as much power as the Imperial Parliament, our legislative efforts are &#34;cribbed, cabined, and confined &#34; by a written Constitution which strictly limits our powers. This makes it necessary to walk warily, lest the High Court may tell us that we have exceeded our powers. </para>

              <para>- Yes; though the United States Congress is, to some extent, so far as the conflict of powers goes, in the same position as this Parliament. But we must accept responsibility for out actions, and when we find that the country is likely to be injured, we must take every step possible to prevent it. As for the cheap sneer that the Labour Party has supported the Bill, although believing that it will not do what is desired, my reply is that we are doing the best we can, and that if larger powers can be wielded, I, for one, shall be glad to do more. I cheerfully take responsibility for supporting this or any other measure to deal with an evil which has brought the Government of the largest and most powerful nation in the world almost to its knees. Seeing that the  President  of the United States of America has appealed again and again to Congress&#34;, and to the rightthinking people of the country, to deal with the ruffians in finance and commerce who are a curse to it, it is not too early for this Parliament to take steps to protect this young Federation from similar attacks by avaricious syndicates. </para>

            <para>.- I do not take as much exception as has been taken by other speakers to the action of the Government in introducing an amending Bill to give them further powers, because&#39; this was probably forced upon them by the fact that we have made a legislative departure, the result of which could not be foreseen. Therefore, I stated my readiness to support the second reading, expressing the hope that some of the drastic clauses in the Bill would be altered in Committee. There has been an almost hysterical outcry against combinations said to be opposed to the public interest and in restraint of trade. With some knowledge of the business relations of the Commonwealth, I protest that nothing exists here in the nature of what they have in America. It would have been better had a straightforward statement been made as to the combinations aimed at. </para>

              <para>- There are combinations in the Commonwealth whose operations are of the greatest benefit to the consumers, because they result in the reduction of prices. I have risen to enter, my protest against several of the provisions of the Bill, particularly some in clause 4. In my opinion, such legislation will be disadvantageous to &#34;the prestige of Parliament. The position of affairs in Australia does not justify &#39;the introduction of the un-British principle which underlies some of the procedure provided for, and I should be failing in my duty did not I enter a personal and emphatic protest against it. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member may have made proposals for more effective legislation which may not have received attention. I do say that too oftenhonorable members blindly follow the proposals submitted by the Government instead of considering upon its merits every proposal brought forward. I wish now toalllude to a matter of procedure in connexion with this measure. As honorable members. will recollect, opposition was offered from this side of the chamber to thesuspension pf the Standing Orders yesterday to enable the third reading of the Bill to be taken forthwith. I think I may say for the  deputy  leader of the Opposition that his refusal to assent to that course of procedure was based upon the fact, first, that no object was to be served by at once passing the Bill, as the Senate is not in a position todeal with it, and, secondly, that there hari been none of that courteous consultationwhich should take place between the Government and the Opposition when it is desired to suspend the Standing Orders. Those Orders are intended for the protection of the minority in Parliament, anr! unless there is very good reason for suspending them that protection should be studiously maintained. </para>

              <para>- In the interests of the public and of the minority. The Standing Orders are intended to prevent any Government possessing the requisite numbers from forcing measures throughParliament without affording) honorable members an opportunity for adequatelyconsidering -them. In speaking in this; way I am not speaking merely for the Opposition of to-day. That Opposition will disappear in one -way or another. It mayfade out of existence, or it may occupy theGovernment benches, in which case there would be a new Opposition. But in the best interests of parliamentary government it is desirable that we should be afforded? an opportunity of knowing the reasons why the suspension of the Standing Orders isdemanded, and of urging counter reasons if&#34; we think that their suspension is not justified. I hope that the House will preserve the practice of refusing to suspend  those Orders without adequate reason in the interests, not only of this Parliament, but of future Parliaments, and in the interests, not only of this Opposition, but of future Oppositions. </para>

            <para>. - I rise for the very simple purpose of pointing out that the statements which have been made without reflection and in the heat of debate in regard to this measure are entirely without foundation. The particular illustration cited by the  deputy  leader of the Opposition in connexion with the need for amending legislation was the Customs Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act of 1906, to which reference was made in certain questions put to Ministers prior to the motion for the third reading of this Bill being called upon. The statement directly made by the honorable member, and a number of times implied by him, was that the language of the section which determines the price of stripper-harvesters on the basis of their cash value was not what had been originally proposed, and that it had in fact deceived those honorable members who had supported that Bill. I have made a hasty reference both to the debates- </para>

              <para>- Most undoubtedly the Prime Minister would be out of order if he did what the  deputy  leader of the Opposition suggests that he intends to do. But I did not gather that from the remarks of the Prime Minister. The honorable member for Parramatta distinctly used the Act to which the Prime Minister has referred as an example of legislation enacted which subsequently was not put into operation. I think he said- that the Government did not dare to put it into operation. </para>

              <para>- What I desire to show is that the illustration chosen by the honorable member was an unfortunate one, inasmuch as it is supported in no particular. Lest this House should be misled in dealing with the third reading of the Bill, now under consideration, by relying upon the illustration which he cited, I am entitled to show that tlie facts are not as stated by him. I- find on reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that the first proposal made in connexion with an Excise duty upon stripper harvesters, was made avowedly upon the basis of the cash price charged for those machines, and upon the cash price only. As far as time has permitted me to do so, I have glanced through the debate which took place on that occasion, and I find reference continually made by members of the Opposition, and by other honorable members, to the cash price. T can find no reference to anything else. I have looked at the first draft of the Bill, and I find that it alludes only to the cash price of these machines. Clause 4 pf that Bill, and section 4 of the Act are word for word identical. </para>

              <para>- I am not prepared to admit that it was a blunder until it has been shown that the credit price can be effectually regulated by an Act without the appointment of some persons specially to decide such matters. With regard to the comments of the honorable member for North Sydney in regard to the need which exists for amending the legislation of this Parliament, I would point out to him that in New South Wales, Victoria, and indeed in every other country outside Australia which has attempted to cope with industrial questions, it has been necessary to introduce amending Acts, and further amending Acts, because they were legislatively breaking entirely new ground. We have to adapt old principles to new circumstances, or to old circumstances, to which they have never previously been applied. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member is making a disorderly interjection in regard to one matter, and I am referring to another. I am speaking of the Customs Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, for the passing of which the honorable member shares no guilt whatever. If, as the honorable member for North Sydney declared, the purpose of the discussion which took place upon that occasion had been to assist the Government to make the Act more effective by marking out its sphere more distinctively, I could admit the force of his remarks to-day. But, seeing that the whole of the energies of honorable members opposite- and of their almost inexhaustible speeches - were directed to other purposes, it is rather sarcastic for the honorable member at this stage to point usto alleged omissions in that measure, seeing that it had to be passed in the teeth of furious and unqualified opposition. </para>

But when we are criticising parliamentary methods, which have so many defects, surely it is not fair to impugn the expressions used in an Act which was debated upon the very first occasion that it was brought before the House, and which was never criticised in the manner in which it is being criticised now. </para>

            <para>.- I am not one of those who blame the Government for having introduced the Australian Industries Preservation Act or this amending Bill. As the Prime Minister has said, this class of legislation is practically a leap in the dark. But I have taken considerable objection to two or three clauses  contained in this Bill, to which I have previously referred. As the measure has been drafted on the lines of American procedure, I should like to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the following cable which appears in to-day&#39;s newspapers - </para>

              <para>- An attempt under our Conciliation and Arbitration laws to have some labour combines declared illegal  has failed. There can be no doubt that we shall require to pass legislation to legalize beneficent trusts. If we are going to experiment in this way - if we are going to take leaps in the dark - we must endeavour to reach solid ground. We are at present in a quagmire, and it will be necessary for us to clearly define what are and what are not legal combines. The spirit of modern trade is entirely in the direction of combination. Men find it necessary to engage in business in a large way, and combines are resorted to in order to eliminate that which has hitherto been regarded as a very good thing. I refer to overcompetition. I wish to direct the attention of the Minister to this phase of the question. Our anti-trust legislation has been largely framed on the American Acts, and the honorable member for Wide Bay has drawn attention to the fact that the  President  of the United States is calling to his assistance all the powers granted to him to enable him to deal with evil combines. In the circumstances I thought it necessary to point out that we ought to legislate in the interests of beneficent combines and enable them to carry on operations under the most satisfactory conditions. </para>

It is true that we are obtaining from the Government a good many &#34; skimmed-milk &#34; Bills, but if the Opposition had their way even those measures would be watered down. </para>

              <para>- At present the combines are, but it is the desire of the Labour Party, in supporting this Bill, that the general public shall obtain a fair share of it. Since the Labour Party have not the power to carry such measures as they would like to see enacted, they have to do the next best thing. The charge has been made against us by the Opposition that we make no attempt to improve imperfect measures introduced by the Government. I would remind the House that when the Commerce Bill was under consideration I endeavoured to extend one of the sound principles embodied in it, but, owing to the efforts of the Opposition, was unsuccessful. The Bill as introduced provided that goods entering the Commonwealth should bear a true trade description. I endeavoured to extend that provision to all goods passing from State to State, and to insert in the Bill a further provision that the true trade description should remain on the goods until they reached the consumers. The Opposition, however, voted against my proposition. </para>

              <para>- Some of the present members of the Opposition were not then in the House, and perhaps will not be here when we are trying to perfect measures of the kind in question. The Opposition have asserted that although drastic  legislation is being passed, it will not be enforced. That will not be the fault of the Labour Party. The Opposition have the remedy . in their own hands. We are the strongest party in the House, and I should like to know whether they are prepared to support us. I do not say that if we were in power we should be able to introduce perfect measures, but we should do our best in that direction,&#39; and would not hesitate to seek to amend any Act that had proved ineffective. It has been said that since this measure is imperfect we ought not to agree to it. But we can secure effective legislation only by demonstrating to those who send us here that the existing law is defective. The Opposition have insinuated that the Government have no desire to make this legislation effective. I should not like to prefer such a charge against them, but I do not hesitate to say that a good deal of the legislation introduced bv the Ministry has proved ineffective. I believe that in the near future it will be found necessary to amend this Bill. I agree with the honorable member .for North Sydney that we should not vote for the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable a Bill to be passed through all its stages without delay unless there are substantial reasons for doing so. It is admitted, however, that the principal . Act is defective, and that small traders are suffering from the operations of certain combines. That being so, it is our duty to pass this Bill as soon as possible. </para>

              <para>- Although I do not think that this Bill will be wholly effective, I believe that the sooner it is tr:ec the better. Every year combines in Australia are becoming more powerful, while the number of small traders is being re duced. The Opposition have had a good deal to say about beneficent combines, but when I appealed to the honorable member for Kooyong to name some of them he declined to do so. Beneficent combines will not be prejudicially affected by this Bill, but the sooner we pass legislation that will enable us- to cope with combines that are prejudicial to the public interest the better. </para>

            <para>. - I do not propose to occupy the attention pf the House for more than two or three minutes, since I. consider that a debate ona motion for the third reading of a Bill which has been threshed out in Committee usually results in little or no good. Asthis discussion has been launched, however, I shall very briefly address myself to one aspect of the question. I have said before that I think some measure of this kind is necessary, and that some of the powersgiven by the Bill are desirable. I have supported the Government proposal with regard to the onus of proof, since it only shifts on to the- person accused the onus of proof as to matters which are strictly and entirely within his own knowledge. But as the result of the proposal to vest the Government with extremely inquisitorial powers - with the right to ask a man questions as to anything relating to his business - we shall obtain a &#39; machine some forms of which are open to grave objection. In that respect we are going a great deal further than the existing circumstances in Australia warrant. The honorable member for Hindmarsh has said that the Labour Party would make the Bill effective. Provisions such as those to De found in clause 4 are effective in ohe particular direction. They must thoroughly discourage and render timid a very  large  number of persons who hold capital which would otherwise be devoted to the establishment of industries. What is the position ? At present in Australia a vast amount of money which, in a new country like this, ought to be available for starting industries and giving employment to men out of work, is being hoarded. It is being deposited in banks or invested in safe securities. Arid for what reason? I can give one, although I do not say it is the only reason for this state of affairs. Let any honorable member place himself in the position of a man who has some capital, and thinks of establishing a manufacturing industry. That man, in the first place, says, &#34; If I am allowed to conduct my factory according to ordinary business methods, I  shall be able to make a very fair profit, a profit of perhaps 10, 20, or 25 per cent. I find, however, that, in the first place, I do not know which of some half-dozen tribunals I may have to submit to as to the regulation of wages and conditions, though I should be quite willing to submit to any one of these, tribunals, if I had some security, as to the terms upon which I may conduct my business ; secondly, I find a Government in power who have brought in legislation to fix the prices of the articles I am going to sell, irrespective of the market conditions at the moment; thirdly, the Government propose to introduce legislation limiting the profit which I shall make ; and fourthly, the Government intend to bring in a measure under which, whether I make profits or lose money, and no matter what wages I pay or conditions I observe, every private detail of my business is liable at any moment to be raked up at the will of an irresponsible officer.&#34; </para>

              <para>- What kind of argument is that? I am in favour of proper, reasonable, and effective legislation in this direction, in accordance with our necessities. I am also in favour of experimental legislation in reference to the fixation of wages, under reasonably secure&#34; conditions, so that a -man may have some kind of certainty as to the tribunal he has to obey. </para>

In addition to all this, a man is told that whatever conditions he observes or whatever wages he pays - however well he may treat his workmen - he shall not be able to maintain the reasonable trade secrecy that he ought to be able to observe in regard to his private affairs - that an officer, irresponsible except to his Minister, may at any moment search his books, make the most private inquiries, and even investigate confidential advice he may have obtained. Such legislation may be rendered necessary at some future time, if. we ever approach anything like the state of things existing in the United States of America. </para>

              <para>- Not to nearly the same extent. Besides such inquiries are absolutely essential to collecting money in the form of an income tax; and there is a great distinction between the two cases. The Income Tax Commissioner is entitled to make certain inquiries for a very de: finite and limited purpose; but under the Bill an officer can demand any information from a man, who, it may be, is obeying the law, paying a fair wage, and honestly carrying on his business in his own way. </para>

              <para>- That interjection points my argument. All that the Opposition desire is that these inquisitorial powers should not &#39;be exercised1 until a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case has been made- out that a man has broken the law. Under such a condition, a man might enter on a new enterprise, reasonably -confident that, until a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case was established, he would not be liable to have his most private concerns investigated by an officer under the direction of the Minister. I do not desire to detain honorable members longer, because it is too late now to make any alteration in the Bill. The interjection of the honorable member for Kennedy shows that he and his colleagues do not fully appreciate the lengths to which this legislation goes; and I simply rose to present one aspect, which, I think, mayhave escaped the attention of my honorable friends in the Labour corner. </para>

              <para>- It will be seen, therefore, that it is not these legislative restrictions which prevent investment, and thus cause unemployment. The honorable member elaborated his case by urging that a man desiring to enter upon an industry was not in a position to say what wages he should pay. Here in my opinion, is the crux of the whole position. It is that uncertainty as to wages that hasgiven rise to conciliation and arbitration and other industrial legislation. If a man, in commencing an industry, is able to obtain labour at  5  per cent. or 10 per cent. less than is paid by a rival in the same line of business, the latter is forced to come down to a lower level, or be undersold. </para>

              <para>- I admit that that puts a different complexion on the question. I desire to show, however, that one of the principal causes of unemployment is the competitive system under which our industries are at present carried on. That system has given rise to two classes in the community - one, the employer, who is trying to get the most work for the least money, and the employe, who is trying to get the most wages for the least work. So long as we have the competitive system, we shall have these antagonistic classes ; and the employer will be constantly on the look out for machinery, in order to cheapen production, with the result of throwing thousands of people out of employment from time to time, and driving them from the skilled to the unskilled labour market. </para>

              <para>- That, I admit This Bill is an attempt to regulate these matters; . and I may here straightforwardly say that I have no faith in the ultimate success of the attempt. It is, I believe, an effort on the part of the Government to do something, but, personally, I believe they will fail in their object. There is only one method by which trusts and combines can be successfully controlled, namely, the nationalization of industries. We realize, however, that this Parliament is not prepared to accept the policy of nationalization ; and, in the meantime, we are content to accept whatever legislation may tend in the direction of regulating these matters. </para>

              <para>- I think not, but, if I did, I apologize. What led to the introduction of this Bill ? It is, as I say, an effort to regulate certain persons, who are trying to abolish thatvery competition which has been the means ofbringing about unemployment, and which has had such a detrimental effect on our industrial life. Huge monopolies are formed with the object of crushing out all competition, and securing complete control; the existence of such monopolies proves that competition is the great curse of our commercial system. </para>

              <para>- The trust does away with competition for the sole purpose of obtaining complete control, and plundering the people generally. If that be not so, what is the object of the trust? The Labour Party and those whom it represents, believe that the only legitimate and honest way to successfully deal with this social cancer is to bring about the nationalization of industries and State control, so that the profits now enjoyed by a few individuals may be shared by the whole community. The position of the leader of the Labour Party on the second reading and this afternoon has been this - that he accepts the Bill in the hope that it may save some of the smaller traders from utter annihilation by trusts and combines. </para>

The Labour Party has never cloaked its wish to nationalize industries. Its position in that respect has been reiterated by the honorable member  for South Sydney repeatedly. We know that in America sixty-three legislative measures have been introduced to deal with trusts, and have failed, and, therefore, it is only reasonable to expect that similar action on our part will be attended by a similar result. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Dr</inline>engaged in a combination, to do <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> act in relation to trade or commerce in restraint of trade, should be deemed guilty of an indictable offence. But that provision was altered, and under the law as it stands, trusts are unlawful only where there is an intent to restrain trade or commerce to the detriment of the public, or an intent to destroy . or injure by means of unfair competition any Australian industry, the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth. How could the Bill affect any one who is merely entering upon a business, and who would have no intention of joining a combination in restraint of trade ? Under section 15 of the original Act, a lawful agreement may be lodged with the Attorney-General, and thus secure protection. The inquisitorial powers iri this Bill are less stringent than those given to the Victorian Income Tax Commissioner, who, if he thinks fit, may require any person mentioned, or the public officer of any company, or any person in whose custody or control the same may be -  to produce for examination by the Commissioner or by any person appointed by him for that purpose at such time and place as may be appointed by the Commissioner in that behalf any deeds, instruments, books, accounts, trade-lists, stock-sheets, or documents or writings, that may be deemed necessary for any pf the purposes of this Act. </para>
          <para>The Comptroller-General may call for theproduction of books only when there has been a complaint on oath that an unlawful combination exists, and he is satisfied that that complaint is well founded. Even then, he can ask only for the production of books and documents relating to the subject matter of the complaint. </para>

              <para>- Several complete definitions are to be obtained in the United States judgments; but I shall not at this stage review the cases to which I allude. The honorable member for Dalley suggested that our legislation has been often found invalid or ineffective; but the only provision yet held to be unconstitutional is a section of the Arbitration Act. On the whole, the technical drafting of our measures has been equal to that of any of the States. Our officers are thoroughly competent, and have done their best. It is true that at times they have been subjected to extreme pressure due to the exigencies of their work, but we have recently made one or two additions to the staff. Under all the circumstances, they have performed their duties well. </para>

              <para>- All those authorities with whom I have come into contact admit that upon the whole the drafting of our statutes is quite equal to that of the best State statutes. Of course, it is obvious that amending legislation must be introduced from time to time. As society grows and develops changes in the law must take place. Take, for instance, the English bankruptcy law. A few years ago the English Bankruptcy Act was said to be the very best in existence, but at the present time it is being subjected to revision. It is not to be expected that) any human mind can foresee the whole of the ramifications connected with any particular subject. We can only do our best with the knowledge that is at our disposal. Take&#34;, for instance, the growth of the Factories Act in England. </para>

            <para>.-I do not wish to enter any protest against the very large policy of immigration&#34; suggested by the Government, but I think we ought to endeavour to temper&#34; the fervid enthusiasm with which some honorable members approach this subject by the touch of a few cold facts. I do not know why elaborate reports are prepared upon the subject, and why extensive correspondence should take place between the Premiers of the States and the Prime Minister if whatever guidance may be obtained from such reports and correspondence is to be disregarded, and a new policy is to be entered upon. There is no doubt that as Imperial citizens of Australia we are bound to take an interest in the development or the check of immigration to the Commonwealth from other parts of the Empire. Two or three days ago, in looking up the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of 31st December, 1906, I noticed that a report had been presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> to the New South Wales Government on the subject of emigration. Of course, the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> considered the matter from the Imperial point of view. According to the article in that journal, the report stated that between 1884 and 1904 the total emigration of British subjects and foreigners from British ports had increased from 303,901 to 453,877, but that the proportion directed to Australia and New Zealand had declined from nearly 46,000 to a little over 14,000 - a decline which is somewhat disconcerting from the Imperial point of view. It was further pointed out that during 1904 the actual net emigration to Australia and New Zealand - that means, I take it, the emigration from British . ports - showed an increase of only 5,336. Just about the same period there was some talk of an extensive policy of immigration being entered upon by a concert between the Commonwealth and the various States. Keeping this fact in mind, I noted shortly afterwards that we were cautioned against bringing out certain classes of immigrants. I do not wish to refer to the particular bodies in the United Kingdom who desired to organize emigration of this class, but in one of the reviews it was pointed out that there was a very large number of persons - the emigration of whom was being suggested - who would be utterly useless as new colonists. Take, for instance, the report of the London County Council, which showed that out of 1,212 pupils examined in its schools, 75 per cent. were ineffective and  431  were mentally affected. It does not necessarily follow that because there is a  large  surplus population &#39;in one part of the Empire its introduction into Australia would be of benefit to this country. Of course, Canada has recently been very much favoured by immigrants. I think that last  year&#39;s  record was 250,000. The Dominion Government have spent about&#163;200,000 in assisting those immigrants, and in addition we know that very large inducements are offered to them by the railway companies. . At present a new Canadian Pacific line-I think it is called the Great Northern line - is being constructed. Necessarily these companies have to import a certain class of labour. So  that,  taking these facts into consideration, and also the fact which was pointed out in the report of the Agents-General that during the three years ended 1906 about 13,000,000 acres had been taken up in Canada by about 86,000 settlers, it is no wonder that there should have been a very large increase in the number of immigrants arriving there. I believe that the actual number of emigrants to Canada between 1901 and 1906 was 661,000. We know, too, that there has been a very large development in the western provinces. Within four or five years the wheat production has increased six-fold - that is, from 30,000,000 bushels to over 200,000,000 bushels. This enormous increase in production has led to a &#34; spurt &#34; in connexion with immigration. But we must also recollect that Canada has not been able to retain its natural increase.In 1900 there were 1,200,000 native-born who had passed over the border, and were living in the United States. </para>

              <para>- I can only vouch for the facts which I am stating. When I heard honorable members speaking last night with  all the enthusiasm which this subject inspires, I thought it would be just as well if we fell back on a few cold facts culled from the English press,  and . reports presented during the past three years. Honorable members seem to forget that this matter was discussed between the Prime Minister and the States Premiers two or three years ago. I hold in my hand a parliamentary paper showing that the correspondence commenced with a letter from the Prime Minister on 31st July, 1905. In that letter he asked that the Agents- General might meet monthly in London to discuss matters of common interest to the various Slates - a very proper suggestion. Evidently the Prime Minister thought at that time that .although a High Commissioner had not been appointed - whose position for some years would be chiefly ornamental  - we possessed all the machinery necessary for undertaking this work. The suggestion was made in paragraph 4 of his letter that in a collective capacity the Agents-General might be able to give advice as to the best and most economical means of attracting desirable immigrants to Australia. It is a rather curious fact - I suppose it suggests some peculiar psychological feature - that instead of the Premiers of the States saying, &#34; We like your proposal, and welcome it,&#34; three of them merely said that they could see, and two that there could be, no objection to it. The .Premier of New South Wales, however, in a letter dated the 8th August, 1905, thought that - </para>

            <para>Any action taken by your Government in the direction of encouraging immigration which ignores the State concerned is liable to cause serious trouble, as the States have to provide land and employment for persons arriving therein, a-nd I therefore suggest that no change be made in the present practice of allowing each State to take action on its own behalf. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Prime Minister, however, very properly pressed the matter further, upon the attention of the Premier of New South Wales, and in a letter dated 12th August of that year pointed out that all he proposed was that the Agents-General&#39; should be asked for advice of a general character, and for advice only. He went on to mention, in a subsequent paragraph, that a well-digested plan of operations was necessary, and that he hoped to secure some guiding advice in this connexion. That, I think, is a fair synopsis of a somewhat lengthy correspondence. Th a subsequent letter, the Prime Minister again drew attention to the fact that he desired co-operation through the Agents-General of the States in a well-devised scheme for inducing immigration. Without&#39; amplifying the reference, he expressed at the end of his letter of the 23rd August,. 1905, a desire that, adopting the words used at the Conference of State Premiers of February, 1904, they should have a policy which would be &#34;concerted, consistent, and continuous.&#34; That is a somewhat nebulous pOliCY, graced, however, by an attractive alliteration. The Premier of New South Wales fell in with the suggestion, but apparently having seen a copy of the speech delivered by the then Treasurer, the. right honorable member for Swan - a copy of which, I think, the Prime Minister sent to him for perusal - he took exception to the suggestion contained therein, to quote from his letter of 7th September, 1905 - </para>

I may remark that there is nothing in my_ letter of 17th August to warrant the assumption that such a proposal would be agreeable to this Government, and my subsequent letter of 25th August was written in order to remove any misapprehension on the subject. </para>

On the request of the Prime Minister being transmitted to the Agents- General, through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan,</inline> who then represented,. I think the Commonwealth as well as New South Wales, a memorandum signed by the Agents- General was sent to the Commonwealth Government, and was ordered to be printed on 19th December, 1905. </para>

              <para>- I referred to the memorandum as indicating some official connexion because it was sent to the Commonwealth Government, and was laid on the table of the House. I do not know that the report presented to the Premier of New South Wales, and quoted by the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> appears amongst our printed records. In the memorandum of the Agents-General reference is made to the somewhat deplorable fact that our rate of increase of population is now only11/4 per cent. per annum. At that rate fifty-six years will elapse before we can have a population of 8,000,000. Had we maintained the by no means &#34; swell &#34; rate of increase which occurred during the decade 1881-1890 - an increase of 31/2 per cent. - our population might have doubled in twenty years. I hope the goddess who looks after matrimonial affairs will be a little more watchful over the interests of humanity. Taking the figures quoted by the Agents- General as to the decennial increase, I find that for the decade 1852-61, there was an increase of 520,713. Between 1882 and 1891 there was an increase of 374,097, whilst between 1892 and 1901 there was an increase of only 2,377. For three years, 1902-4, there was an actual loss of 8,104. These statistics are by no means encouraging. What has become of the &#34; concerted action&#34; spoken of by the Prime Minister? What scheme has been formulated as the result of the advice so strongly solicited by him and given with such clearness in the memorandum to which I am referring? In examining the causes of this falling off in the increase of our population and the check evidenced by the decline in the three years referred to, the Agents-General call attention to the enormous stream of population to Australia following on the discovery of gold, as well as at the time when we had a vigorous policy of public works - when Australia, with wonderful light-heartedness, which subsequent events did not justify, was particularly lavish in her expenditure in that direction. </para>

              <para>- We have a very good representation against our national debt in assets, some of which give a fairly good re turn. Against the total debt of the States we have, I think, assets of the value of about&#163;175,000,000, which pay working expenses and interest on outlay. I do not desire, however, to be led into too close an analysis of finances that do not touch the point with which I am now dealing. The Agents-General, in dealing withthe falling off in the rate of our increase of population, mention, for instance, that some of the population that was obtained by assisted immigration, instead of being an advantage to the community, was for a time a burden, because it consisted of a class of men who could be maintained in employment only by the expenditure of public money. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> sets forth some of the reasons affecting immigration to Australia. The distance of Australia from Europe, as compared with that of Canada, the expense of the voyage, the comparative ignorance of European peoples as to the resources of this country, the misrepresentation of Australian affairs indulged in by the press of Great Britain, the prevailing opinion that immigrants are not wanted, the uncertainty whether on arrival immigrants can be accommodated with land - which touches the very substance of the matter - the influence of persons who have already emigrated, are all mentioned as causes for our failure to attract population. The arrangements made by Canada with shipping agents, and the strong and systematic advertising of Canada in other countries, are likewise given as reasons for the falling off. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> calls particular attention to the Immigration Restriction Act, making special reference to the language test and the contract provisions of that measure. The gist of his commentary is that a very unfair interpretation of the scope and operation of that Act was presented to the people of the United Kingdom. Possibly upon that point we are all in agreement. I believe that a similar Act was in operation in Canada, but it did not seem to affect the flow of immigration to that country. </para>

              <para>- That is so. The Agents-General in this memorandum make a very careful examination into the classes of men who ought to be brought out. I do not propose to exhaust the clauses of the memorandum dealing with this phase of the question by even a condensed synopsis of what they contain. Let me mention, however, one or two. In the first place, they refer to a class that we should be most anxious to secure, farmers who have recently disposed of their property and have a capital of from &#163;500 to &#163;1,000 with which to commence life in a new country. Then they refer to a class of men who, as the result of their industry have saved perhaps <inline font-style="italic">&#163;25</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50,</inline> and are anxious to emigrate, and also to a class &#34; which is comparatively numerous &#34; - men with no means, some skilled farm labourer&#39;s, and some without even that qualification, who, in the opinion of the Agents-General should be assisted to wherever they wish to emigrate. This particular class - and especially labourers, whose average wage in England is only about  14s.  per week - has been swelling the tide of immigration to Canada during the last five or six years ; but it is not, on the whole, the class that we should seek to induce to come to Australia. </para>

              <para>- No doubt. Every year, no less than  38,000  emigrants leave Ireland, and a good many of them go to Canada. They are not, I think, assisted immigrants. They either pay their own fare, or their friends who have preceded them assist them to emigrate. Immigrants to. Canada and America have saved money there and helped their friends to join them. Even the hard-working servant girl has often used her savings in assisting her brother or, let us hope, her sweetheart, to join her in Canada or the United States. There are inducements, apart altogether from assisted immigration, for people to go to some countries. The Agents-General, after very carefully considering the whole matter, recommend that a substantial class that can be put upon the land is the class of immigrants that weought to encourage, but they state that the greatest number that the Commonwealth could hope to accommodate in one year is about  2,000.  It is mentioned, at page 6 of the memorandum, that Queensland was making an average concession of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;11</inline> per head to nominated immigrants, whilst Western Australia was making a concession of about&#163;5 per head. That arrangement, however, does not seem to have been very successful. I do hot know what are the figures as to immigration to those two States during the periods when this inducement was held out, but I believe that in ten years not more than  50,000  went there. </para>

Is all this talk about immigration to be simply directed towards the subvention of not more than  2,000  eligible persons per annum? If so, what was the use of all the talk at the Conference in England about the millions that could be settled in Australia under a certain policy. What are the electors to understand from the Prime Minister&#39;s recent estimate of an ultimate total of about  100,000,000  people in Australia ? What are the electors asked to do in view of those rhetorical statements from the platform, and of the coldblooded presentation in the memorandum of the Agents-General of what is possible? </para>

              <para>- No doubt there would be no need for assisted immigration, if there were available areas of land, which would tempt people to come here, notwithstanding the distance. My idea in rising was to divert honorable members attention from mere rhetoric and enthusiasm to the reports submitted to the Prime Minister by the Agents-General for his guidance. </para>

            <para>.- I desire to emphasize some remarks I made on this question a few nights ago, when I urged the necessity for increasing the vote for the purpose of advertising Australia in Great Britain. It seems to me that&#163;20,000 is a very small amount for the purpose. </para>

              <para>- But we have reached the stage, when, with our protective policy, the development of the iron industry, and the commencement of certain public works, we shall inevitably require more people. The question of immigration always impresses me as being the most important that this Parliament has to deal with, seeing that it is the very foundation of a national policy. What is the value of protection, or of our defence proposal, unless we have people here to do the developmental work? Only a glance at the statistics is required to show that our progress in the way of population has, for many years, been too slow. In the ten years from 1851-61 the increase of population in all Australia was 744,988 ; for 1861-71 the increase was 512,237 ; for 1871-81 it was 587,232 ; for 1881-91 it was 923,983 ; for 1891-1901 it was 594,659, and from 1901 to 1905, the increase was 278,769. If we take the increase at the same ratio for the remainder of the ten years up to 191 1, we shall have a total increase of 557,000 odd, which, of course, is a decrease as compared with former decades. </para>

              <para>- That may have had something to do with the decrease. Since the inauguration of Federation, Australian production has increased by 30 per cent.-, whereas our population has increased by only 15 per cent. A comparison between Australia and Canada has been made in connexion with immigration ; and it has been stated that the policy in the latter Dominion has been overdone, with the result that large numbers of people are going to the United States, while others are finding their way back to their own countries. I take that to mean that the resources of Canada are not to be compared with the resources of some other countries. In the United States, the average annual increase in population is 750.000, though last year it was nearly 1,500,000. </para>

              <para>- Yes; and the figures show that when immigrants go to the United States, they find a country with a great variety of resources. This additional population causes those resources to be developed, because it stimulates the Government to undertake public works, and encourages private enterprise to invest in large ventures, all of which tend to general development. The Commonwealth and the States Governments have an annual revenue of about &#163;50,000,000, and yet less than &#163;50,000 per annum is spent on immigration. </para>

              <para>- Canada, of course, has for many years taught us a lesson in immigration, the Dominion Government spending something like , &#163;200,000 a  year. I saw that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mead,</inline> the new  Chairman  of the Water Commission of Victoria, said the other day that the immigrants who found their way to Canada last year, chiefly assisted by the Government, possessed a total capital in cash of something like &#163;12000,000  ; and it appears to me that an immigration policy on the part of the Commonwealth could be justified on purely business principles, as returning a handsome and immediate result. It was estimated by the honorable member for East Sydney, when attending the Hobart Conference as Prime Minister in 1904, that a subsidy of about &#163;8 per head would be sufficient to bring out immigrants. If we spent &#163;400,000 per annum in bringing out 50,000 immigrants, this would mean, on the Canadian basis, additional residents possessing amongst them &#163;2, 000,000 in actual cash. Then, if we calculate ,&#163;200 per head for about one-third of the number, as representing what is generally acknowledged to be the value of an adult man in good health, we have represented an additional value of ,&#163;3,500,000; and, therefore,. 50,000 people would, as soon as they landed, mean an added value to Australia of about -/. 5,000,000, in return for an expenditure of &#163;400,000. </para>

              <para>- That may be, but we must lay down sound principles before we can proceed with practical legislation. The Prime Minister has emphasized the importance of the immigration question on several occasions, and the probability is that he has said all that can reasonably be said. With his keen grasp of political questions and his statesmanship, the Prime Minister, recently at Lilydale, in one of the most pungent, practical addresses he has delivered, emphasized the importance of the question; and Australia is waiting for the Government to introduce some definite, practical measure to give effect to the views which have been so frequently and eloquently expressed. We have had enough talk on this question. &#34; Population is needed, not merely to train as soldiers, which is a secondary consideration, but to develop its resources, and therefore we must, without, further delay, offer encouragement to immigration &#39; by passing such legislation as will tend to bring here in sufficient numbers the proper class of immigrants. If the Prime Minister introduces practical definite proposals such as he has forecast, he will properly interpret, the views of the majority of the people of Australia. </para>

            <para>.- I, like other honorable members,, think that there should be no cheese-paring or niggardliness in advertising the resources of the Commonwealth, because the money will be wasted unless we do things well. I wish to make my position in regard to immigration clear. I shall not be one to keep Britishers out of Australia. I left the Old Country to better my condition,&#39; and I wish to leave the door open here to all who are now in the position which I once occupied. Any man who plucks up courage to emigrate to Australia is sure to better his condition, in life, because there is no country in the world where working men can do so well. </para>

If that statement is not a sufficient advertisement for the country, I do not know what would be. There is no place for the worker like Australia, and particularly Queensland. I have such faith in the country that I believe that if, to-morrow, I had only my swag, I should be top-dog again within twelve or eighteen months. In Queensland there is an immigration system which allows any resident of the State to nominate for&#39; assisted passages persons up to the age of fifty years, on payment of a scale of charges ranging from the price of the kit for female domestics and males up to the age of twentyone, to &#163;10 as a maximum. </para>

              <para>- The arrangements allow persons resident in Queensland to send for their relatives and parents. I came out ns an assisted immigrant. In London I was earning only 18s. a week for twelve hours&#39; work a day, and I had a wife to keep, paying for clothes, food and rent. I have no love for the Old Country, so far as the living I made there is concerned, though 1 cannot forget the land which gave me birth and infant nurture. But Australia is my home, and I am a thorough Australian in every sense of the -word. If the possibilities of this country were made known in the Old Land, emigration would flow towards Australia as strongly as it has flowed towards other lands. We should get many more emigrants than go to Cape Colony and the Transvaal, because the journey from England is not much longer. </para>

          <para class="block">It is our distance from Great Britain that keeps people from coming here. They go to Canada because that country can be reached in a voyage of a few days. Now that there is stagnation in the Canadian immigration policy, Australia should do something to advertise her resources. British people, so long as they are under the British flag, feel that they are still at home. When men land here without anything, they take the first job that offers, to secure a chance to look round. Many of the best colonists in Queensland landed here without a shilling, and their position to-day should be sufficient evidence of the advantages offered in this country. The honorable member for Wimmera told us that only &#163;50,000 has been spent in the whole of Australia in connexion with immigration ; but I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidston</inline> say on the hustings at the last Queensland elections that more than that amount had been spent by the State within the twelve months. Every Orient steamer brings immigrants to Queensland, mostly females. I am sorry that our birth rate is not increasing. It is so small that we are forced to increase our population by importing fresh stock. Sheep or cattle breeders, when they find a strain running out, import stud rams and ewes, or stud bulls and cows&#39;, and we should take similar means to increase the population of the country. </para>

The whole thing was a sad bungle both for the men and the public of this town, on whose charity they were cast. A public subscription was made, but this was insufficient to provide for them until the Government (State) agreed to give them a fortnight&#39;s work at Waranga Basin. Three gentlemen here had in addition to what they did before, to guarantee six or seven publicans the cost of the keep of most of these men for a time, feeling that when the authorities were made aware of their action they would reimburse us for this outlay : indeed, possibly return the public subscription in full, seeing that the fault lay solely with the authorities who sent the men here.

          <para>I have paid the fares of more than halfadozen men who desired to get away from Victoria to Queensland, and that I have been very pleased to do so. The State which I represent can absorb them, and is absorbing them, and, as a result, Victoria is &#34; squealing.&#34; Only the other day I read in one of the Melbourne newspapers the statement that several families at Warracknabeal had crossed the border into New South Wales because they could not procure land in this State. Yet some honorable members desire that we should embark upon a vigorous immigration policy. I shall never be a party to bringing men from the Old Country to dump them down in Melbourne, and thereby flood the labour market. Only to-day, whilst visiting the Commonwealth offices,in Spring-street, I observed a crowd of men at the entrance to the Treasury Gardens, and upon inquiry I was told that they were the unemployed clamouring for work. It is monstrous that in a city like Melbourne such a state of things should exist. Yet it is urged that more immigrants are wanted. Why? Simply to &#34; pull down &#34; wages. At the sametime, there are places in Australia which are quite capable of absorbing not the twenty-six men for whom work could not be found in the rich Goulburn Valley, but 26,000. </para>

Everybody knows that the more abundant is labour the lower will be the rate of wages paid. I have no desire to make Australia a close preserve for those who are already here.

              <para>- What is the use of the honorable member talking like that, when he knows very well there is a column upon the Estimates which shows the expenditure for last year? I hope that this dis-&#39; cussion will be productive of good results. I am satisfied that the Prime Minister desires to do something, but that he is somewhat shackled  in  this matter. He merely wishes to know what the States are prepared to do for immigrants after he has landed them here. When the States have assured him that they are willing to place so many thousand immigrants  in  their territory each year, I am satisfied that he will carry his immigration policy into effect. </para>

            <para>.- I have listened with great pleasure to the remarks of the last  speaker.  At the commencement of his observations I was under the impression that he was most enthusiastic in his desire to secure for us additional population. But subsequently his attitude changed, until all that underlay his speech was a good British tone. I believe that there are three great national propositions  which  ought to be dealt with by this Parliament, namely, increased population, finance, and defence. I think that the first of these is of the greatest importance, because of the direct bearing that it has upon the other two. I quite admit that there are instances such as those quoted by the honorable member for Maranoa, in which difficulty has been experienced in placing in suitable positions men who have been repatriated at the expense of the Government. Of course, we have a moral obligation to see that no immigrant is stranded here. I do not think that anybody can question the sincerity of the Prime Minister  in  this matter. He has always been  in  favour of increasing our population upon legitimate lines. I confess that I was very much surprised at the observations of the honorable member for Angas, who took up a position which was adverse to - the introduction of immigrants to our shores. Personally, I hold that we have never yet attacked this question in a sufficiently strong business manner. I have studied the methods which are adopted in Canada itself for the reception of immigrants there, and I have also seen their arrangements made in Whitehall, together with those made throughout the provinces of Great Britain, where most effective sub-agencies have been established, which are practically miniatures of the central offices in London. I repeat that none of the States have yet attacked this question in a business-like manner. </para>

              <para>- Victoria has a comparatively small territory, but perhaps has not attacked Hie question as she ought to have done. Very little can result from the discussion of the abstract question at the present time, and the scheme&#39; proposed by the Government will be awaited with interest. We  are now asked to vote the sum of &#163;20,000 for the purpose of advertising the resources of Australia, but it has been shown that only a very small portion of that amount can be expended during the current financial year, and I &#34;agree with those who hold that if the question of immigration is to be attacked effectively this expenditure of &#163;20,000 will be a mere drop in the bucket. We must be prepared to spend very much larger sums, in order to do good work. I view the appointment of a High Commissioner as a necessity of the situation, but should doubt very much the desirableness of making such an appointment if the occupant of the office were not required for the important and great work of encouraging immigration to Australia. Lord Strathcona is perhaps the best immigration agent that any part of the Empire has in London to-day. He has under him an excellent staff, and joins with it in doing everything possible to point out to intending emigrants the attractions of Canada. Australia, however, can offer the intending emigrant far greater inducements, than Canada can do. The one obstacle to be overcome is the cheapening of fares between England and Australia. As has been pointed out, there is keen competition amongst the shipping companies trading across the Atlantic, and the journey from </para>

              <para>- It may be possible to do so. We should endeavour, at all events, to offer in that regard as great an inducement as does Canada to intending emigrants. The Prime . Minister has said in effect to the Premiers of the States: &#34; If you will provide the land we will find the people to settle on it.&#34; If the States do not accept his offer, the responsibility resting upon the Commonwealth will be greatly diminished. I shall do my best to support the efforts of the Government to attract to Australia a desirable class of immigrants. Australia desires to attract to her shores a virile class of people, &#39; such as we already have here. We want to attract persons physically and mentally sound, with -plenty of backbone, and a&#39; determination to achieve that success . which the honorable member for Maranoa, by his own unaided effort, has secured. </para>

            <para>. - I do not propose to enter the very wide field of discussion which this question presents^ since I feel that there must be some termination to our consideration of the Estimates, and that it would be unwise at the present time to deal very fully with the subject. At the same time, I wish to say that I do not share the readiness of the honorable member for Maranoa and the honorable member for Kooyong to vote a sum of &#163;20,600 for advertising Australia in the absence of an intimation from the Government as to the nature of their proposals. Much more than &#163;20,000 will be necessary for the purpose in view, but though I will gladly support a larger outlay, I hesitate to agree to an item of this kind which is not accompanied by any definite proposals on the part of the Government. I had hoped that the Prime Minister, since he cannot spend the whole of this sum during the current financial year, would be satisfied with a vote covering what is likely to be expended, leaving any demand for a larger vote to be considered in connexion with future Estimates, and in conjunction with a scheme to be carried out with or without the co-operation of the States. We cannot altogether blame the States for the attitude they have taken up. They say, in effect, &#34; We have the land. We have to provide for the people who are brought out here in large numbers, and we can do so.&#34; </para>

              <para>- Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia, to the extent of their available lands, provide for immigrants, and they say, &#34; We can do the work for ourselves. I&#39;f the Commonwealth is going to expend money in bringing immigrants to our snores we shall be debited with our proportion of that expenditure. That being so, we might just as well expend the money for ourselves.&#34; I am not supporting such a contention ; I am merely pointing out that we must not consider that, the attitude taken up by the States is wholly unreasonable. I agree that one central authority acting for the whole of the States can do this work more effectively and cheaply than any of the individual States could hope to do ; but the Prime Minister should not expect Parliament to vote considerable sums of money for this purpose until he has outlined the scheme in connexion with which he proposes that they shall be expended. I admit that it is not his fault that no scheme is before us. He has been endeavouring to work with the States, but, probably for the reasons I have given, they have shown a reluctance to join with the Commonwealth. At the same time we ought to be satisfied, before agreeing to vote so large a sum, that the method of expenditure to be adopted will be such as to commend itself to us. </para>

              <para>- We are voting money that cannot be spent during the current year unless it is thrown away. The importance of this- phase of the question is shown by the experience of Canada. From what I saw recently when in Great Britain I have no hesitation in saying that -a lot of the money expended by Canada with a view to attract immigration is simply thrown away. She has undoubtedly attracted a large stream of immigration, but  has done so at unnecessary cost. If we are to compete with Canada what will be the result? </para>

              <para>- That state of affairs has not been the result of immigration. Canada was able to find work for her immigrants until the recent crisis, and for that her immigration policy was not responsible.- There are reasons why, even if we spend the hundreds of thousands of pounds that Canada has expended in this direction, we shall not obtain the same result. In the first place, her proximity to the Old World gives her an advantage over Australia. It is not merely the cost, of the voyage to Australia which militates against us. As a rule, emigrants from Great Britain do not &#34;leave with the intention of never returning to their native land. They have the hope that they may be sufficiently successful in other countries to be able to return at some time and spend their remaining days in the land of their birth. Where similar advantages are offered by two countries they deliberately&#39; choose the nearer, believing that its proximity to Great Britain will render it easier for them to return. We hays also to remember that a great deal of what is described as immigration to Canada is not immigration in the true sense of the word. Many people go from Great Britain and the United States to Canada for the season&#39;s work, and return. Under the Canadian system, however, they are classed as immigrants, and no deduction is made in respect of their departure..  I think that the Minister of Trade and Customs made some inquiries from the Canadian Government as -to the number of departures from the Dominion oversea or across the United States border, and that he was informed that the information desired could not be given. Many men cross from America into Canada with a view of following up the crops as they ripen - just as our shearers go from one State to another - and return to the States at the close of the season. All these men are classed as immigrants, and no deduction is made in  respect of their departure. . That being so, the results of the Canadian immigration policy have been greatly magnified. Then,, again, we have to remember that Canada has been willing to receive persons of all occupations, whilst Australia has been seeking chiefly to attract farmers or farm labourers. The immigrants to Canada comprise only a small proportion of those classes. And all our expenditure, if we continued to hold those views, and went to the same extent as Canada, would be spread over a much smaller number of people. Then there is the difficulty of the distance and of the passage-money, though, of course, our efforts might be directed to reducing the latter. It will be seen, therefore, that even if we spent the amount which is spent by Canada, we could not be nearly so successful as is the Dominion. I am not making these remarks in order to throw a wet blanket on the scheme, but only to show the necessity of cheaper and more effective work than is done in the case of Canada. Whatever class we desire to attract to Australia, our efforts should, as directly as possible, reach that class. If we desire to have farmers, farmers&#39; sons, and farm labourers, we ought to place in the possession of every farmer in Great Britain, direct, the information that we have to impart. We should also avoid some of the very questionable methods adopted by Canadian immigration agents. I know the difficulty in handling agents, and of confining them to truthful representations; but we all remember &#34; that in the case of Canada there were undesirable means adopted, which .may or may not have been authorized by any one in  a  responsible position. I rose principally to point out that the success of our expenditure depends upon the system &#39;adopted, and before&#39; Parliament votes any large sum, we ought to know what the proposed system is. I know that the Prime Minister desires to consult the States. </para>

              <para>- Personally, I think that the two questions are inter-dependent. Immigration largely arises from the necessity for providing a sufficient defence; otherwise I do not see why we, as a Commonwealth, should trouble ourselves and make special and strained efforts to attract people here. In my opinion, the attractions of the Commonwealth, to those who know them, are sufficient to induce large numbers of people to settle in the country ; and if the resources are sufficiently advertised, as proposed, the result will, I think, be a constant influx of immigrants. If the. Prime Minister merely continues the distribution of <inline font-style="italic">Australia ToDay</inline> amongst the working, farming, and financial and commercial classes of the United Kingdom, the results will, I think, be very gratifying, because there is no doubt that in that publication is contained a true record of the progress we have made. </para>

              <para>- The Prime Minister has told us that he has distributed various amounts amongst the immigration leagues, and taken other steps. In my view, defence is the paramount question, and immigration the second; otherwise, we might continue in the. happy way of merely absorbing our natural immigration without making any special effort. It seems to me that advertising for the purpose of encouraging immigration is not so necessary as the Prime Minister seems to think. I have no doubt the honorable gentleman&#39;s attention was called to a letter which appeared in the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> about January last, and in which the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">British Australasian</inline> stated that he was able to obtain 500 or 600 immigrants at regular periods as soon as it was thought the Commonwealth was ready to receive them. </para>

          <para class="block">Further, it was announced the other day by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williamson</inline> Wallace that a large lumber of young Scotch farmers were ready to come to this country if they were certain of securing land. So far as some of the States are concerned, and certainly in the case of Victoria, this is a matter entirely for State action or inaction. We must remember that only a month ago the whole community was thrown into a state of anxiety because some twenty-nine Bulgarians were in Melbourne, and others to the number of 120 distributed amongst the States who could not obtain employment. These were white Europeans of the farming class, sober and anxious to get employment, and yet it was over a week before it was possible for them to be absorbed. </para>

              <para>- Does the Prime Minister propose to limit immigration to Englishspeaking people? I have recently drawn the attention of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department to the fact that a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rothe,</inline> who has recently started an agency for the sale of Australian products in Copenhagen, has said that he is able to induce the immigration of a number of Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes who are ready to come here without any assistance, so long as they know some provision will be made for them on arrival. </para>

              <para>- I am pleased to see that the Prime Minister seems willing to accept these immigrants, though they are not English-speaking. If we take what I regard as the true view, and place immigration as secondary to defence, we cannot stipulate that immigrants shall be Englishspeaking. The question has been raised as to the necessity of populating the Northern Territory with white people; and doubtless that will be considered when the transfer of the Territory is under consideration. However, I understand that the Prime Minister proposes to induce white people to settle on our northern shores ; but I am afraid that, if so, we shall have a repetition of the experience of the southern States of America. So long as profitable employment was available in the northern States, where the climate is temperate, the southern States continued to be thinly populated. </para>

              <para>- Simply because the immigrants who went to America found the temperate climate in the north more attractive ; and I take it that if we induce immigrants to go to the Northern Territory, it will be impossible to use any compulsion to make them stay there, when Queensland and Northern New South Wales present superior attractions. The Anglo- Japanese treaty does not terminate until 1915, so that we have seven more years in which to consider this question. </para>

              <para>- I believe it is extremely likely that there will be a financial collapse in japan by that time. But our danger lies in the north, and it is most desirable that the northern part of Australia should be filled. I never understood until quite recently that Russia was meeting the position by placing a population of over 15,000,000 white people in Siberia, so that we may have Russian assistance from the north when our struggle comes. This is an interesting subject ; but I think that everything depends on defence. If the idea is to introduce white immigrants to settle the northern parts of Australia, I think that our efforts will not succeed. In my opinion, we should leave immigration largely to the States which have land to offer, and assist them so far as they will allow us to do so. Those whose Governments do not think it wise to fall in with what we are doing, or are not courteous enough to reply to our communications, must be left to their own resources. The honorable member for Maranoa says that there is room for 26,000 immigrants in Queensland. If that be so, and the State Government is offering land, let us do all we can to assist in getting people to go there. But it will be foolish to induce people to come to Victoria or other States where there is not land available for settlement. A side to this question which has not been discussed is this : the more we make known in England the sound financial position and prosperity of the Commonwealth, the more sympathetic will London financiers become, and their good feeling towards us will be of great service when  the conversion of our loans is attempted. I shall support the proposal. </para>

            <para>. - It has been said that the Labour Parry is opposed to immigration, and a great deal has been published in the . press to that effect. What the Labour Party is opposed to is having workless persons here who must be supported by those who are working. It is remarkable that so much should be said about the need for immigrants, at a time when we have thousands of unemployed, many of them ready to turn their hand to anything. I believe that there would be no difficulty in bringing about a large inflow of most desirable immigrants - men who have money with which to begin the battle of life - if it were not for the&#39; fact, that many of those who have done well in Australia go to England after they have become wealthy and then curse the country which made them prosperous. </para>

He said that he discovered that members of Parliament monopolize the compartments of trains, and travel like princes; but that he did not know whether provision was made for them by the State, iri addition to their salaries.&#39; I have not known honorable members to travel like princes, but I know that they pay for every farthing&#39;s worth of food that they consume. This contemptible cad tells the public that honorable members are the servants of train conductors.

              <para>- I have always? found the conductors careful to do their duty, and to keep their places. This man&#39; says that a train conductor, even when he is paid generously for attentions which he does not give, has not the manners to say &#34; Thank you.&#34; I have had every attentionat the hands pf conductors throughout the Commonwealth. How can we expect immigration when visitors to Australia publish statements like these? The man who reports a private conversation, even if he does so correctly, is not a gentleman. </para>

              <para>- We can deal with scandals here ; but it is difficult to refute lies published abroad. Some time ago the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Fitchett,</inline> in a series of articles published in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> denounced Australia in extravagant terms. He repeated board-ship conversations to the effect that,, because of our legislation, our people were leaving Australia to so to Canada.  When  he got to Canada himself, he found that  the position was the reverse of what he expected, and that Australia was the more favoured country. Therefore, on his return, he wrote an entirely different set of articles, in another publication. Of course, he was well paid for both sets. </para>

              <para>- I am glad that he is not running the country. It is time that we had a High Commissioner to speak with authority, and to rebut the slanders which prevent immigration. In the past, the States have done a great deal to attract immigrants. At one time, South Australia gave 20 acres of land to every immigrant who had paid his own passage, and even then found that she could not attract as many as were desired. Today we have no place to put immigrants. Scores of my acquaintances are out of work. </para>

There are thousands of unemployed, though, of course, I have not a personal acquaintance with all of them.

              <para>- No; but every 1,000 persons settled on the land give employment to a great many mechanics and others in all branches&#39; of industry. They require boots, clothing, machinery, and tools of every description, and the manufacture of these articles would provide employment for thousands more. That is the first thing that we must do. Let us settle men upon the land, and the secondary industries in our cities will spring up subsequently. </para>

              <para>- Yes; and several other unprogressive countries. I am very anxious to see a large population settled in the Commonwealth. If we are going to spend &#163;20,000 in attracting immigrants to our shores, I do not think that we can spend it to better advantage than we can in the Northern Territory. There is land available for settlement there if we only wish to place immigrants upon it. That is where population is&#39; most required, seeing that the unsettled state of the Territory constitutes our greatest danger. Let us spend, if need be, &#163;100,000 in endeavouring to secure some settlement there. I do not wish to occupy the time of the Committee at any further length, but I hold that it is chiefly due to the slanders upon, and the slanderers of, Australia, that the stream of immigration to our shores has been so small during recent years. It will continue to be small until we provide more opportunities for the employment of labour than exist at the present moment. </para>

              <para>- I believe that that is so. I was rather struck by two statements of the honorable member for Hindmarsh which appeared to be mutually contradictory. He declared that the Socialist Party in this House did not oppose immigration. I believe that his statement is based upon fact. It is not safe to oppose immigration in Australia, because it is a subject upon which the electors are unanimous. I do not know of any electorate in the Commonwealth which would return a candidate who was opposed to an immigration policy. All the constituencies are unanimous as to the supreme necessity which exists for endeavouring to fill Australia&#39;s empty spaces. Consequently the statement of the honorable member for Hindmarsh. that he was in favour of an immigration scheme appeared to me to be a very natural one. But I notice that his enthusiasm does not take a practical form, because he subsequently affirmed that the Commonwealth should not take the initiative in this matter, but should allow the States to make the first&#39; move. Now, what is the actual position ? The States are asked to provide land for the immigrants before we move at all. </para>

              <para>- That is a question which I am not at liberty to discuss upon this item. But I wish to. point out that every immigrant who comes to Australia is not prepared to take up land. In other words, he has not a few hundred pounds in his pocket with which he can purchase a farm. Most immigrants come here - as many others have done before them - in the hope of bettering their condition, and we ought to welcome them - irrespective of whether or not they are possessed of capital - so long as they possess those assets which are more valuable in a new country, namely, enterprise, good health, muscle, and brain. </para>

              <para>- And in New South Wales the Government are introducing quite a number of immigrants. But we have a special duty to discharge in this connexion. We have recently enacted a new Tariff which we are told has imparted an enormous stimulus to our manufacturing industries. I understood the Minister of Trade and Customs to say less than a week ago that new manufacturing enterprises are springing up all over Australia. If that be so, here is an opportunity for a protectionist Ministry to bring into Australia numbers of artisans who will be prepared to impart an additional stimulus to those industries, and thus to assist the national work with which the Prime Minister has charged himself. I understand that the great claim which protectionists put forward in country districts is that by means of protective duties population will be attracted here, and as a result the local markets of our agricultural districts will be increased. But it now appears that the Government are loath to prove their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> in this connexion. They seem reluctant to bring any immigrants here save persons possessed of capital. </para>

But I should like to impress upon my honorable friends opposite, and especially upon the honorable member for Hindmarsh, that the constant claim that a graduated land tax is absolutely necessary for the salvation of the Commonwealth is doing as much harm to us in England as are all the statements by irresponsible persons there, about which they so bitterly complain. I know this because I see their remarks echoed in the English press. There I see the statement constantly made that Australia is a country where people can obtain no land and no employment. That statement is doing the Commonwealth more harm than any. of the irresponsible statements by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Trevor</inline> and other persons to whom the honorable member for Hindmarsh referred. If my honorable friends opposite are really sincere in the cry about&#34;stinking fish,&#34; let them be careful that they do not handle it. </para>

              <para>- But in New Zealand  there is no party whose assertion that there is no land available for closer-settlement purposes is being constantly re-echoed in Great Britain. During the last few years the Labour Party in Australia has made the country ring with that misstatement. It is obviously inaccurate to describe Australia as a landless country, when a great. State like that of Queensland, where the Government in power is in strong sympathy with the Labour Party, is advertising large tracts for settlement. </para>

I hope that a comprehensive scheme will be introduced, and that it is not going to include a proposal to wait further upon the States. It is up to the Prime Minister to give proof of the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the contention of protectionists, as to filling Australia, by the incidence of the Tariff, by offering assistance in the shape of reduced passages and by other means to suitable industrial immigrants to come to Australia. There are one or two matters in connexion with this question to which I should like to refer. I believe that some honorable members are afraid of introducing industrial immigrants because they think that already too much of our population is congested in our cities. That feeling may be very considerably overdone. </para>

              <para>- It has nothing whatever to do with land monopoly. If honorable members will bear with me for a moment I shall put my view of the reason for this state of affairs. Honorable members have no doubt observed that country . towns, which used to serve as distributing agencies for their respective districts, have for years on the general average beengrowing less, whilst the principal cities in each State or in each great distributing district have been yearly growing larger. The reason is that the country town as an agency of distribution has been gradually dropping out of existence, while the distribution of the States has become more and more operative from the great cities. In this way we have a natural aggregation of population towards the main cities. That is one factor in this position, and it is due to improved methods of distribution more than to any artificial reason. </para>

              <para>- Since the population of Australia is not increasing at the rate of more than per cent. per annum, more people can live on the production of fewer people than was previously the case. Consequently more are entering our big cities. It is not healthy to have large aggregations of people in our great cities, but at the same time that aggregation is due largely to natural causes, and the introduction of more industrials will not lead to the diminution of the population of country districts. It will give them a new market; and lead in consequence to more people being placed upon the land. Therefore, as far as I can see, there is no reason why the Prime Minister should not attempt to bring out industrial immigrants ; there is every reason why he should. I do not wish to take up the time of the Committee further on this question. I explained a few nights ago the methods by which I thought immigrants could best be brought to Australia, and I shall not touch again on that question. I merely wish to say, in conclusion, that it is somewhat ridiculous that we should be called upon to vote a large sum of money - not too large for the purpose if it were intended to be put to any use - which we know will not be expended. We know that &#163;15,000 of this sum of &#163;20,000  is notto be expended this year. </para>

          <para class="block">We are voting money with the full knowledge that it . will not be used. This is a highly absurd position for a House that regards itself as trustees of the public purse to be put into. I hope that we shall not have a recurrence of the situation; that when the Prime Minister asks for a further vote he will be in a position to ask for a much larger sum, that he will have a cut-and-dried scheme ready in order that wemay know something definite is going to be done with regard to Australian immigration, and thatwe are not to repeat the farcical process of making patriotic speeches on the public platform, and voting certain amounts of money intended to pacify the immigration enthusiasts, whilst we really do nothing. </para>

            <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Wentworth that a greatdeal of talk indulged in with respect to immigration is much of the nature of a political placard. Very little earnestness has been exhibited by Australia in dealing with this question. What have the States done, and what are they doing, to cause an influx of immigrants to Australia? It is true that some of them have sent recruiting agents into other States. </para>

              <para>- Iunderstand that Queensland has a recruiting agent in Sydney, and that Western Australia hassent a Recruiting agent to Tasmania. The honorable member for Wentworth admits that thecongestion of population in our large cities is undesirable. A glance at the statistics is sufficient toshow that the proportion of our population in metropolitan areas is much larger than it ought to be. The position is altogether different in New Zealand. Since the early nineties the increase in the population of the rural districts and the cities of New Zealand has been fairly even. That has largely been the result of land settlement. Is it not a farce to talk about plenty of land being available for immigrants when there are sometimes hundreds of applicants for a block in some of our States ? By every boat leaving Victoria men are sailing for other parts. A great many have left this State for New Zealand, and I have heard of men who have returned in the hope that they would be able to settle down here, but who have been reluctantly forced to go back. </para>

              <para>-I think not. I have followed very closely for some time the land board allotments, and know that the Governments of the States have not had available anything like the land required by our own people. Sons of farmers who are trained agriculturists find itimpossible on attaining their majority, and desiring to strike out for themselves, to obtain a block on which to settle. In view of these facts, those who talk about immigration are merely playing at thegame. Notwithstanding what the honorable member for Wentworth has said, I do not hesitate to assert that land monopoly has driven thousands of people from the country into our cities. The land policy of Australia generally has a tendency to monopoly. </para>

              <para>- I know that in some parts of Queensland there is some really good land - as good as any in Victoria - but a man requires to have well up to  &#163;1,000  before he can go on to it. Land can be purchased on long terms, but it requires a considerable expenditure  for  clearing and so forth, before there is any return. If the States are in earnest they must take more drastic steps than they have hitherto taken. The honorable member who last spoke said he believed there was a &#34;monopoly of land to the detriment of the general interest of Australia; but I venture to say that that honorable member would not  support  compulsory purchase, even at a fair price. </para>

              <para>- That is certainly news to me. In Victoria a resolution must pass both Houses before there can be compulsory purchase; and in South Australia it has not been possible to pass a measure of the kind. In my opinion, the progress of New Zealand is chiefly owing to the fact that, during the influx of immigrants in the last ten or fifteen years, the lands have been thrown open and rural settlement has kept pace with the settlement in the towns. Personally, I do not see what the Commonwealth Government can do in the matter. </para>

My complaint is that there is no earnestness on the part of the States, the Governments of which have given no reasonable chance for the settlement of immigrants. There is no doubt that if suitable land were in the market in large quantities, we should have a number of immigrants,with capital and experience, desirous of settling in Australia. </para>

            <para>.- The determination we come to on this important question will be largely based on what are our aspirations for Australia. If our aspirations be in accordance with the somewhat spurious cry of &#34; Australia for the Australians, in the most limited sense, we shall be opposed to immigration ; but if our aspirations be in the direction of making Australia a great and integral part of the Empire, then our policy will be one of development and land settlement. If our policy be one of a White Australia, I venture to say, with all due respect to the Labour Party, that we must of necessity be in favour of bringing, not a few, but thousands of immigrants into the country, and treating them properly when they get here. It is absolute nonsense to say that we have no land available, seeing that Australia at the present time is practically an empty country. We must set our shoulders to the wheel, and endeavour to attract immigrants. Of course, constitutional difficulty arises from the fact that it is hard to get the States Governments and the Federal Government to work in unison. That, however, should not be impossible ; and doubtless our persuasive Prime Minister - and I use that term with the utmost respect - will be able to induce the Premiers in conference to do something to justify our spending something more than the sum at present proposed in. this connexion. The Prime Minister has promised to do so; and in his important speech on ^defence he made it quite evident that   if  there is any man who recognises the necessity of bringing people to Australia, it is himself. I venture to .say that none of us desire the yellow people to come here ; and yet it would be impossible, with a population of  4,500,000,  to defend our shores if Great Britain ever became em&#39;broiled in a great war. Are we prepared to . maintain -our hearths and homes, our wives and families, by the only effective means? With all respect to the scheme of defence of the Prime Minister, I say that, when we have put forth our utmost efforts  in  arming and in drilling our people, we shall not be able to defend Australia&#39;s  8,000  miles of coast line; and the only sensible course is to join political forces, both. State and Federal, in one common determination to make it possible to settle a large population on the land. The honorable member for &#39; Grey referred to&#34; the movement in progress  Df  inducing men, for various reasons, to leave one State for another; and I do not know that that is altogether an unmixed evil from the point of view of land settlement. Every man who moves from Victoria, for instance, to take up land in New South Wales or Queensland,, leaves areas available for other people ; and the process referred to is, in my opinion, only a natural one. It is quite true that a man may sell out his small holding, to a large landholder ; but, at the same time, when a man dies, his land is very often divided amongst &#34;members of his family. There has never been a greater national work, or one which would more justify us in seriously considering the question of immigration, than that represented by the great irrigation scheme in Victoria. Such a scheme makes it easy to subdivide great holdings in the Goulburn Valley, and settle numbers of families in the place of one; arid what is possible there is possible in many other parts of Australia. It is proper that the Federal Parliament should do something to induce immigration ; and there is no need to wait for the States to take action. In Queensland there are thousands of acres available, and I believe that in the near future the policy of that country will be the same as that followed in America, inasmuch as railways will be constructed in order to induce settlement, instead of settlement preceding railways. I should like to say a word or two about the congestion of population and the effects of machinery. With great regret I heard an honorable member say to-day that, as the result of machinery, men were thrown put of employment. The teaching of experience is that the employment of machinery does not throw men out of employment, but, on the other hand, makes it possible for the poor to enjoy luxuries hitherto undreamed of. Machinery substitutes for hard work employment of a character pleasing and elevating to the worker. That is th&#60;? natural result of all mechanical developments. . The establishment of industries to cater to the present luxurious tastes of the people gives much employment in cities&#34;; and that is one of the reasons why we find congested populations in the capitals. Let me now say a word in reference to what I regard as a somewhat silly argument introduced this afternoon by the honorable member for Maranoa. He has two or three times&#39; applied offensive epithets to me, and he did so again to-day, in quoting a letter  which I read to the Chamber in August last. It was from a reverend gentleman in Rushworth, who stated that twentyseven repatriated Australians had . been dumped in that township, and had to be fed by the residents. I well remember the effect of that letter upon the&#34; members of the Labour Party. They rejoiced when it was made known to them by one in favour of immigration that employment could not be &#39;found at once for these twenty-seven men. Their exultation was, however, groundless. The men had been dumped down in Rushworth,- and, of ..course, for the time being were a source of annoyance, because employment could not be found for them immediately. Every individual who comes to this country is a source of profit to those who live here. Instead of taking work from others, I believe that every immigrant provides more work for the population than he undertakes himself. There have been some bright pages in Australian history, and the brightest have been when population has been flocking into the country. There has been a bright page in the history of Western Australia of late years, because population has been flowing into that State. The dark pages in our history have been when immigration has ceased, and we have been left, to use a vulgar expression, &#34;to stew in our own gravy.&#34; The most empty page in. our history is the honorable member for Maranoa. I have not been able to determine the policy of the Labour Party in regard to immigration ; but it is evident from the speeches which have been made by. its members&#39; that the genuineness of their professed desire for immigration is very doubtful. I have come to the conclusion that, while some of them are prepared to say that they are in favour of immigration in the abstract, the policy of the party is to discourage immigration, apparently in the belief that,as we have a good thing in Australia, we should keep it for ourselves. That is not the policy which makes for progress and development, -although it is progress, development, and safety that we need. . There is safety in numbers, and if Australia is to become a white man&#39;s country, we must fill it with white people. </para>

            <para>.- When, in August last, thehonorable member for Echuca read the letter to which reference has been made, I suggested that a copy of it should be sent to Dr.Arthur. Probably, in the eyes of some,returned Australians are. not of so much account as new arrivals from oversea, born abroad. </para>

Those which appeared were written by returned Australians or absentee land- owners, who, like the person referred to by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, decried Australia and denounced the party with whichI have the honour to be connected. </para>

          <para>I think that the honorable member made a mistake in giving that person the advertisement which he did. He is unworthy of notice, and his statements are known to every Australian to be without foundation, while repliesmade to them will not! receive as much publicity in England as was given to his article. The party led by the honorable member for Echuca is always declaring that the Labour Party is prepared to block immigration. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member  for Wentworth seems to.be well acquainted with stinking fish. . He is. a member of the &#34; stinking-fish party.&#34; Some time ago  the honorable member for Flinders, speaking at Nhill, showed that population is leaving the country, and going into the towns; that&#39;, including Ballarat, Bendigo, and Geelong, the country lost 30,000 or  46,000&#39; in eight or ten years, while the city population increased by more . than that number. The honorable member, when he entered the Victorian AssemDly, was an advocate of a land tax, though I do not  kno  of what kind. Whatever may be the state of affairs in Queensland, much more than 3 per cent. of Victorian territory has been alienated. The Western District possesses (some of the best land in Australia, and some good mining country but if we ex cludethe population of itsfive seaports, its five mining and two inland towns, its country population has decreased by about 17,00 in twenty years. Recently&#39; there has been a slight increase, because of the mining development at Pitfield ; but, except for that, there has been a decrease. The honorable member for Wentworth stated that, by reason ofthe employment of machinery, fewer men are required. </para>

              <para>- We shall see whether the honorable member is in favour of a land tax when the; question is brought forward. Perhaps he will be like some other honorable members opposite, who, to avoid voting upon certain questions, have conveniently left the Chamber when adivision was about to be taken. I know of one  honorable member who, when a division was imminent last week, walked out of the House to avoid voting upon a certain proposal, although he was not paired. </para>

              <para>- There has been no borrowed money expended by the Commonwealth. The Labour Party effectually stopped that. The honorable member for Echuca has said that under the Trawool irrigation scheme a great number of persons would be settled in Victoria. He represents a lot of individuals who in the past have been able to get an irrigation scheme carried out for their benefit at the expense of the community. The people of Rodney - after they had obtained an irrigation scheme - conveniently forgot to pay for it. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member describes &#34; getting at &#34; the Government for &#163;1,500,000 as &#34; smartness &#34; I may tell him that others call it by a different name. To take money out of the pockets of the whole of the people is as much robbery as is the act of taking it out of the pocket of an individual. This is the class of persons who talk about &#34; smartness,&#34; and who denounce the Labour Party for advocating land taxation. I believe that the best way to advertise Australia is to provide those individuals who- are already settled here with constant work at good wages. That is how America has been advertised. If my honorable friends opposite had worked in America they would know that the best advertisers of that country are immigrants from Europe. </para>

            <para>.- We have heard a lot to-night about the stinking fish party, and it seems to me that those who tell us that Canada, New Zealand, and America offer more &#39; attractions than does Australia have earned the right to have that epithet applied to them. The honorable member for Grey has told us that people are leaving Australia for New Zealand. What are the actual facts? The honorable member for North Sydney has placed in my hands a statement as to the number of persons who have left Australia for New Zealand and those who have left New Zealand for Australia during the last two years. In 1906, 22,198 came here from- New Zealand, and 22,426 left. Australia for New. Zealand, leaving a balance of about 220 in favour of the Dominion. In 1907, however, 27,425 came here from New Zealand and only 24,292 left Australia for that country, so that we had a&#34; credit balance of about 3,000. These&#39; figures do not wholly support the contention that New Zealand holds out to the1 settler a special promise of success. The honorable member for Yarra, states that there is no land available in Victoria. He appears to desire to apply that statement to the whole Commonwealth. Tt is true that he admitted that he was familiar only with the conditions prevailing in this&#39; State- </para>

              <para>- I have nothing to say against .the picture which the honorable member has drawn of land tenure in Victoria, but would remind him that this State is a very small spot on the Australian map.. I think that what I can say with regard to the opportunities for settlement in Oueensland will apply with equal force to Western Australian and South Australia. In Queensland we have plenty of land that, has not been alienated and is available for closer settlement. </para>

              <para>- Within the last few years, more particularly, &#39; the Queensland Government have realized the possibilities and their responsibilities in this respect, and have set to work to make available the land for the people. It has seriously set itself to the task of opening up tracts of country which are under the control of the Crown. To point that remark I wouldmention that four or five years ago there was no work for surveyors in Oueensland, but that during the last few years - since-  the breaking of the drought of 1902-the Lands . Department ofQueensland have found it impossible to obtain surveyors in sufficient numbers to do the work before it. Applicationafter application for areas to be thrown open, not in the arid west, but on the coast, is met with the reply that the Department cannot obtain surveyors to make the necessary surveys. </para>

          <para>Mr.ARCHER. - That is true to a limited extent, but leases of land all along the coast are rapidly falling in. In the Port Curtis district, whereI live, no new leases or renewals are being issued in respectof land suitable for closer settlement; and this applies generally. The Government are now constructing a railway in the Boyne -Valley, where most of the land is held under leases, having some twelve or fifteen years to run. That land, however, is being resumed by the Crown, trifling compensation being paid for thebreaking of the leases. In other districts further -up the coast some of the best land for farming is not leased. In some cases areas are held under leases which have only a few years to run, and in no case where the land is suitable for close settlement arethere leases having a longer currency than ten or fifteen years. . The land to which they relate can be. resumed and. compensation paid. The primary reason why closer settlement in Queens- land has not been more rapid and has not, been provided for by past Governments to any great extent, isthat until within the last ten years we have not had. the advantage of the application of refrigeration to dairy produce. In other words the dairying industry which is responsible to-day for the settling of, Queensland - and the same remark will apply to other States - has been confined to local markets. The application of refrigeration to the handling of <inline font-style="italic">our</inline> perishable products has simply revolutionized closer settlement in Australia. The Queensland Government are meeting thechanged conditions by extending their railway system as rapidly as possible. Preparations are now being made for the construction of some fifteen lines, which will open up large areas for closer settlement. Very few of them will run through land that will have to be repurchased. We have been told that land cannot be obtained on the Darling; Downs. It must be remembered, however, that that was the first part of Queensland to be taken up. It was settled, possibly, sixty years ago when no one could foresee what was likely to happen, and all the land was allowed to be alienated. Since then, however, it has been cut up, and is now. entirely in occupation. We have in Queensland a Compulsory Purchase Act, and only last year the Government expended &#163;500,000 in the repurchase of estates. </para>

              <para>- So there is; but the Government have seen fit to buy land alienated for the last forty years, through which a main line of railway runs. This is the land which our friend&#39;s from Victoria and New South Wales have taken up after doing very well in those States. Those who have left New. South Wales for Queensland in many cases timber getters, who took up land on the north coast rivers, and, having been able to sell it at from &#163;20 to &#163;30 per acre, went to Queensland, where they could obtain equally good land forfrom &#163;2 to &#163;5 an acre.

          <para class="block">Queensland vast areas that have not been alienated with leases expired or expiring and which have not been settled for the reasonsI have given. But we have now set to work in earnest. Whereas in the old days the Government waited for a district to be settled before they thought of opening it up by means of a railway, they axe now adopting the practice of Canada, and the United States, and are recognising the advisableness of opening up suitable districts by means of railway communication, and making them attractive to the people, and not waiting for settlement to precede means of communication. As soon as they carry out that policy, there will be vast areas of land available for closer settlement. The repurchase of estates is a mere bagatelle, and can easily be done. </para>

              <para>- It is absolutely fallacious. We have in Australia vast areas suitable for settlement, and it only remains for the States to open them up by means of railways. I have no desire to hurl objectionable epithets at any party, but any section which maintains the cry that there is no land available for settlement here is running down Australia without just cause. The matter is in our own hands. Victoria is settled, but because there are in this State large estates, which the Government have not seen fit to repurchase, or which have acquired such high values as to render their repurchase difficult, it is not to be said that Australia generally is in the same position. I recognise that in seeking to attract immigrants to Australia the Commonwealth must work with the States. If the Federal machine is to run smoothly it is desirable that we should work in harmony with the States. The Federal Government must have some consideration for the feelings, so to speak, of the States. They have had to hand over to the Commonwealth authority various powers and functions to which they do not object, but the Federal authority shows an inclination to grasp all that it can get. In order that the Federation may work smoothly . we should avoid carelessly irritating the States in any degree. I suppose that if there is any obstruction on the part of the States to legitimate demands, the Commonwealth must take a firm stand, but it is inevitable that the States should display some feeling when the two powers come into conflict, and an uncompromising spirit is exhibited. Even in the absence of the co-operation of the States, the Commonwealth Government can- do a great deal in the way of advertising our resources in the Old Country. It. is because of the possibilities in that direction, amongst others, that I think we should appoint a High Commissioner as soon as possible. I know what the Canadian Government and the Canadian Pacific Railway have done in the way of advertising Canada in Great Britain. There are certain ways in which the Government might move in the direction of encouraging immigration ; and while I am not in favour of indiscriminate immigration, I say that we could absorb any ablebodied, sober, steady men. The cry about supplying immigrants with land at once is utterly fallacious, because no man new to the country can go straight on to the land on his own account without courting almost certain hardship and ruin. In Queensland, the land is being thrown open to settlement as quickly as possible ; but we ought to realize that closer settlement has only commenced in the bigger spaces of Australia. Any able-bodied agricultural or other labourer, after two or three years of local experience will be qualified to take up land; but it is sheer cruelty - and I speak from personal knowledge - to dump down, even an English farmer on the land inAustralia before he has become familiar with the conditions of the country. In the case of Canada, it is the common practice for a farmer, when he intendsto settle there, to send out his sonsto work for a year or two to spy out the land and acquire experience, and then to follow them; and any assistance in attracting that class of settler would be most valuable. But that is not the only class of immigrants&#39; whom we have to consider. We desire to have men here who, though Without means, depend on their&#39; own brain and muscle in order to make their way ; and there should be provision for these men when they arrive. It is therefore very important to get into touch with people who desire the servicesofimmigrants. We are told that there is already surplus labour in Australia, and that work for 100 additional men could not be found in centralQueensland. That, however, is not so; and we must remember that therewill always be unemployed in the towns. Inthe big cities, I am afraid, therewill always bepovertyand distress and unemployables until the millenniumor the socialistic State arrives, when, I suppose, those will be made to work. But I know that in the moderate-sized towns - not manufacturing towns - of central and northern Queensland there are numbers of young men who will not go into the country to work. In north Queensland, just now, owing to the low price of copper and other minerals, numbers of men, who have hitherto worked small &#34;shows&#34; of their own, have found employment on the land; while others are looking for work. But that, I contend, is no argument against an immigration policy. If such arguments are acted upon, we shall never people Australia or keep it a white man&#39;s country. We shall never be free from fluctuation in employment, from temporary overpluses in different directions. </para>

              <para>- I do not say that. All I contend is that, for instance, a temporary failure in one industry, such as I have mentioned, may cause a surplus of labour, but that such surplus is no argument against an immigration policy. The fact is that, when there is a surplus of labour in the towns, the men there will not go on to the land, and would not be able to do anything with it if they did. I have addressed myself broadly to the question, with special reference to Queensland. I know that it has been difficult to get land in suitable locations in Queensland, just as in other parts of Australia; but those days are passing away. Even the &#39; alienated lands along the railways, like those on the Darling Downs, are being broken up &#39;and absorbed ; and I know that the Queensland Government will even more rapidly push railways into districts where there are thousands of acres available for settlement. .Some of this land is under lease, but no new leases are being issued. The leases in existence will fall in during the next ten years or so ; and those men who are coming to Australia now, and obtaining experience, will become settlers during the next few years. </para>

            <para>. - Despite the inference drawn by the honorable member.- for Echuca that a section of the House is opposed <inline font-style="italic">\o</inline> immigration of any kind, I am sure that all sensible Australians recognise that an  important factor in our wealth and prosperity is population, and that, at our present stage of internal development, the country cannot assume its rightful position unless we resort largely to immigration. The difference between the two sides of the House on this question may, I think, be easily summed up. Honorable members who, like myself, belong to the Labour Party, desire to see a healthy population of energetic go-ahead people who will help to build up and develop the industries of the country. In order to get that population certain facilities and inducements must be offered, or, as in the past, people from outside will refuse to throw in their lot with us. On the other hand, there are other honorable members who seem to look at the question from the stand-point that the conditions here are all right and cannot be improved very materially - that all that is required is an increased supply of labour by means of a large influx of people. Those honorable members look to that supply being kept up to such an extent that the country will be called upon to establish soup kitchens and labour bureaux in order to support the labourers during the slack times, so that they may be readily available at the lowest cost in the busy times. I say unhesitatingly that I am not prepared to lend myself to introducing labour from the Old Country under false pretences. </para>

              <para>-  I am with, the honorable member in that, but I think we should do something more. We ought to improve the conditions in Australia, so as to &#34;make the prospects of the immigrants brighter. While the Federal Government may do something in the way of advertising Australia, it can do very little in the direction of encouraging and retaining immigrants without the assistance of the States Governments, and, so far, the States Governments have shown very little disposition to co-operate with the Federal authority in attracting the right classes. Some of the States Governments have endeavoured to secure an influx of manual labourers, quite regardless of the fact that the native population is leaving because of their being unable, under present conditions, to retain what they themselves produce. Under such conditions, we can only hope for the very lowest class of labour in our immigrants, because any man with energy and push, desiring to make the best of his life, will not rest satisfied. If we really desire to increase our population, we must set ourselves the stern task of improving our social and industrial conditions, in order, first of all, to retain our native born, and next to attract desirable immigrants. This is an object we have not Been able to attain up to the present time, because the immigration is practically counterbalanced by the emigration, the net improvement being very small over a given number of years. The honorable member for Capricornia quoted, amid some approval from honorable members near him, certain figures comparing the additions to population in New Zealand and in the Commonwealth during the last couple of years. But I think the honorable member should have extended the comparison further back, because if we take the seven years of Federation, we find that New Zealand has by immigration added 48,000 to her population, while the Commonwealth has added only something like 6,000. The time was when New Zealand was considered a bankrupt dependency of the Empire, and one of the least desirableplaces for emigrants to go to; but the legislation introduced by those eminent statesmen, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ballance</inline> and the Right Honorable Richard Seddon, completely altered the position of affairs, so that the Dominion is now the most inviting country in the Southern Hemisphere. Until we put an end to the exodus from our own shores, it will be useless to try to attract people from the United Kingdom. We must first make sure of retaining our own population. When we have done that, our conditions will prove attractive to others abroad. The honorable member for Yarra, when he referred to the. land monopoly which exists, particularly in the older settled States, mentioned the chief cause for the decrease in our population, and its undesirable and unhealthy concentration in the large centres. Official statistics show that of 700,000 adult voters in New South Wales, about 1 , coo own half of &#34;the alienated land of the State, and about 3,000 half of its accumulated wealth. Its land is divided amongst 170,000 or 180,000 persons, and its accumulated wealth between about 200,000 persons, so that about 500,000 are landless and without wealth. Until something is done to make the land available, our population must decrease year by year. The honorable member for Wentworth attributed the flow of population to the cities to the increased efficiency of agricultural machinery. I do not think that that is the true explanation!. The last redistribution of seats gave New South Wales another representative at the expense of Victoria; but in rearranging the elec toral divisions of the State the country divisions were reduced by one, another evidence of the drift of population to which I refer. Those who know the conditions under which people reside in the cities are aware how unhealthy a sign it is when the population is drifting there from the country. We are told authoritatively that in Sydney 1,000 women and children work for from 5s. to nothing a week. Many young girls employed in shops and factories are content to give their services for nothing, merely to learn a trade or business. Last session a proposal was brought forward in the State Parliament for preventing the payment of a lower wage than 2s. 6d. per week. We find, too, that men employed in responsible positions, handling large sums of money, receive only from 30s. to &#163;2 a week, while the remuneration generally of those earning weekly wages is not sufficiently high to offer an inducement to men who are not forced to leave the country to goto the cities. </para>

              <para>- They are true, and if the present state of things can be altered only by telling the truth, the truth must be told. I have just returned from my electorate, where I learnt something about the methods obtaining in regard to State immigration. The New South WalesGoverninent, to provide occupation for the small number of immigrants coming to the State, pays the police ros. for . every man -for whom they find  a  position, and&#39;, as a result, men who have been employed for . years are often dismissed, immigrants&#39; being taken on in their stead at lower rates, the&#39; policemen -receiving ios. for finding one&#39;man a billet at the expense of another. If, as is often the case, the immigrant proves inefficient, he is dispensed with, .and sometimes the former employ6 is reinstated. &#39; Then I was told that recently, when a party of immigrants, used to town conditions, undertook to engage in scrub-cutting, they were driven out to the scrub on a distant station, and their provisions and tents having been unloaded, were left entirely to their own resources. That is treatment to which , the Australian bushman is accustomed ; but these unfortunates did not know how to rig. a tent, how to kill a sheep, or how to cook the provisions supplied to them, and when they found a snake, they were so scared by the stories which they had heard, that they all cleared out. In another case a couple of immigrants were engaged to go into the country to a place where they were told they would receive a certain wage, but, ort arrival, the station proprietor said that he could not pay the wage, and therefore they had to accept less. They were housed, according  to  their own statement, with a lot of dogs, . being, I presume, sent to a shed in which dogs were tied. up. This was too much for them, and they left, carrying their boxes some  12  miles. These men have friends in the Old Country to whom they will write, and their stories will do more to prevent emigration here than our advertising can do to encourage it. Canada and the United States, on the other hand, treat their immigrants in such a fashion that good reports are sent Home, and their friends come out  to  assist in the- work  of  developing the country.&#39; Australia needs development, but we must make the condition of our people such that they will stay here, and others will be tempted to come.  To  bring out paupers to create  a  labour surplus, so that the screw can be turned  011  our labourers, will not advance the best interests of Australia. Those who face the problem in an endeavour to solve it are the -best friends of the Commonwealth, and the jibe that they belong to the &#34;stinking-fish party&#39;.&#39; does not apply. It -is those who discredit the country who really belong to the &#34; stinking fish party.&#34; I regret to- say that included in this class are men who- came - here with -nothing and who have acquired a -good- -deal of this world&#39;s substance, and who consequently owe a great debt of gratitude to Australia. T should like to learn from the Prime Minister how much of -the  &#163;20,000  proposed to be voted for advertising the resources of the &#39; Commonwealth has been expended. </para>

              <para>- I recognise that there has&#34; been a delay in dealing with the Estimates for the current financial year - a delay for which this House is not responsible. The Government thought fit to introduce a new Tariff, and in the interests of the general community it was deemed desirable to dispose of that Tariff as soon as possible. I do hope that no money appropriated for advertising the resources of the Commonwealth will be placed at the disposal of such organizations as that which is controlled by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur,</inline> which do considerable damage to Australia. I trust that when next year&#39;s Estimates are under consideration the Prime Minister will be able to submit a clear cut immigration scheme to the Committee, and will be in a position to say whether the States are prepared to co-operate with him in. giving effect to it. If they are not, any expenditure in this direction will simply represent a waste of money. </para>

            <para>.- I am very pleased to note the amount of newborn zeal which has been exhibited to-night on the question of immigration. It will provide very interesting reading for the country.

              <para>- I recognise that, but, unfortunately, the statement has been published&#39; to the world that we do not want desirable immigrants, and it is&#39; necessary that that statement; should be refuted. From my Own experience I know that quite a number of desirable immigrants have been impressed with the idea that their presence is not wanted in the Commonwealth. Tonight the honorable member for Hindmarsh mentioned that in his State there are thousands of willing artisans who are unemployed. The very reverse is the case in Queensland. Quite a number of employers there, who have been offering as much as 12s. per day for carpenters, cannot obtain them, notwithstanding that they were willing to provide them with permanent employment. It is also very difficult to secure engineers and other mechanics, whilst it is simply impossible to obtain farm hands. </para>

              <para>- But there is a very large quantity of good land. I am satisfied that during the next ten years Queensland can absorb as many persons as choose to make their way there, and that she can settle them upon land equal to any in Australia, the fee simple of which can be purchased at a very moderate price. I wish also to point out that a very good opportunity now presents itself for advertising our resources. Quite a number of persons will be visiting the forthcoming exhibition in London&#34;, and if the Government will make it possible for them to take literature for distribution-- </para>

              <para>- I am glad to have that assurance. I should like to obtain some information from the Prime Min ister regarding the annual payment of &#163;200 to the International Agricultural Institute at Rome. Nobody appears to know what this Institute is doing, or what benefits we are deriving from it. An explanation by the Prime Minister will perhaps remove the suspicion that money is being frittered away merely to put ourselves on a par with other countries. </para>

            <para>. - Iam happy to inform the honorable member that for a very small expenditure we hope to obtain very great advantages. A Conference, at which almost all the civilized countries in the world were represented, was held in 1905, and it was decided to establish at Rome an Agricultural Institute whose operations should be international. The King of Italy has arranged to present to it the revenue of two domains estimated to produce an annual income of &#163;12,000. Every country is subscribing towards its maintenance. </para>

              <para>- It will meet only at intervals. The object of the meeting at this time is to lay down the system and method on which information is to be supplied to and by every country in regard to certain products, and the seasons at which they are available. The desire is through this central institute to make known to all the world where certain crops are in excess and where they are in a deficiency, in. order that a more even scale of prices may obtain, and interested persons may not be able to take advantage of their special knowledge. The advantages likely to be derived from the establishment of the institute are the furnishing of agriculturists with prompt and reliable information on matters of interest concerning various markets; the collection of such information over a large area and on uniform lines ; improvements of methods of production; suggestions to Governments in the general interests of agriculture forming the basis of international agreement; and ready sources of information for Agricultural Departments respecting agricultural conditions. It is one of those unions designed to place the agriculturists of the world in touch with each other; to enable them to compare their systems, to share their knowledge, and to use it for their mutual protection against market operations which sometimes affect them very seriously. </para>

            <para>.- As there seems to be some doubt as to the area of land available for settlement in Australia, I should like to assure honorable members that in Western Australia, at all events, vast tracts of country are available. There is, for instance, an area stretching, say from Albany to Geraldton,  600  miles long and probably  300  miles in width. Railways are being carried into it, and the country is being rapidly settled. There can be seen some of the finest crops that are raised in Australia. Since I first went to Western Australia settlement there has made enormous strides. Northam at one time was the chief centre of cereal production in the west ; but farming operations have since extended for no less than  150  miles due east towards the gold-fields. The facilities for acquiring land in Western Australia are all that the people could desire. The Agricultural Bank- makes advances to settlers in respect of any work done by them on their land. If they build a house, they receive assistance, and they are also Helped to fence and clear their holdings. I do not know of any State where the facilities for settlement are so satisfactory. </para>

              <para>- The Government offer intending settlers holdings of  160  acres for practically nothing. _ If a man wishes to commence operations on a larger scale, he may take up  2,000  acres, and also  1,500  acres on behalf of his wife. No doubt, in time to come, the cry for closer settlement, now heard so frequently in the east, will be heard in Western Aus tralia. I would remind honorable members that those who want land need not go even so far as Western Australia for it.&#34; Within the last fortnight, at the Mount Barker Agricultural Society&#39;s Show, I saw exhibited by the Agricultural Department of South Australia a very fine sample of grain grown in the Pinaroo and other districts, where there is an average rainfall of only 8 inches. This wheat was grown on land which no one would have looked at five or six years ago. Had we been told a few years ago that it was capable of producing wheat of such fine quality, we should not have treated the statement seriously. Another large area of land, stretching from Port Lincoln in a northerly and north-westerly direction, was at one time looked upon as a desert, but it has been opened up by a line of railway  40  miles in length, which the Government propose to extend by another&#39;  40  miles. Less than ten years ago, that country was regarded as useless, but settlers there are now doing well by wheat-growing. It has been clearly proved that wheat can be grown on all areas which enjoy the winter rains, or, in other words, districts where the rain falls at the right time for cereal crops. When we reach the tropical areas, good crops cannot be relied upon, but there ate in South Australia, as well as in Western Australia, vast areas of wheat-growing country that have not been opened up.. It only, remains for men with pluck, who are willing to work and to rough it, to take action. We certainly do not want to settle on the land men such as those we often see hanging about the street corners here. I have often looked at them, and would be afraid to mention within their hearing . that I was in search of labourers. Such men will not leave town to obtain employment, because they will not go far away from an hotel. An expenditure of  &#163;20,000  will not be nearly sufficient for this work. We shall have to expend something like  &#163;200,000  in inducing people to come to the country. </para>

              <para>- If, instead of decrying our country, we spent money in inducing people to come here, we should have no difficulty in finding money for railway construction purposes. If the line to which the honorable member refers is constructed, we shall be able to settle  1,000,000  people along it. I, for one, am not surprised that agents from the Western State are here in the east. Many people in the eastern States are entirely ignorant of the conditions prevailing in the west. I have been asked here whether Western Australia is not a sandy desert, whether wheat can be grown there, and whether it is possible to grow oats- If the people now in Australia wish to hold the country, they must be ready to recognise that we have plenty of room for all who choose to come here. It is idle to assert that there is no land available for settlement. There are large areas available where the Murray flows. Can we not lock our big rivers, and, by means of irrigation, put to good use much of the land that now remains idle? The interior of Australia is like a big saucer. It is eminently suited for the conservation of water, and we need to send out something like 100 engineersto fake the levels of the country and prepare a contour map, so that we may see what parts are suitable for irrigation. </para>

              <para>- Some one ought to take it in hand. I recognise that the Federal Government has not at present any land to offer intending immigrants. At the same time, we have the right to attract people to Australia. We represent the States, and it is for the benefit of the States that we desire to encourage immigration. We certainly cannot improve the position of the Commonwealth by crying &#34; stinking fish.&#34; The land is not locked up. Many sheep stations that are now being cut up and sold at from &#163;5 to &#163;7 per acre have had expended  upon them more than &#163;7 or &#163;8 per acre in respect of ringing, clearing, scrubbing, and fencing. </para>

              <para>- They do. I can assure the honorable member that ring-barking, scrubbing, and so forth probably occupies ten years, so that the country may be made sweet to carry stock. Any man with pluck who can buy grazing land up to &#163;10 an acre in this country can make a fortune. There is no hardship in paying a reasonable price for land  in  a good district, and there is no harm in either the States Government or the Federal Government purchasing estates in order to sell the land to settlers. There is the value for money paid, and one way to encourage immigration would be to impress on immigrants that if they purchase the land at the price asked they have a good bargain. I impress on honorable members that, if they know anybody who requires land, they should send him to Western Australia, where very large areas are available. </para>

            <para>.- This afternoon I mentioned that the whole of Australia had last year spent not more than &#163;50,000 on immigration. I had not the details before me then, but I have since looked the matter up, and I find that the latest statistics support my statement. During 1906-7, New South Wales spent &#163;17,000, Queensland spent &#163;10,000 - of which something like  &#163;3,000  was refunded by the immigrants themselves - and the Commonwealth proposes to spend &#163;20,000. This makes  &#163;43,000,  and substantially supports what I said. I understand that the Queensland Governmentthis year are spending considerably more than in any previous year, and probably that was what was in the mind of the Prime Minister. </para>

          <para>Mr.JOSEPH COOK.- I do not know that that is too long, seeing that in all probability one or two of the Departments which follow will <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> disposed of very rapidly. In any case, I regard the Department before us as one of the most important in the Estimates; it covers the widest range of subjects, and opens up more debatable matter than any other. I think that before this large sum of money is voted - not large in relation to the object in view, but large in itself- we should have from the Prime Minister a full scheme of immigration, either with or without the co-operation of the State. I understand the Prime Minister is waiting for the States to furnish him with some information. </para>

I understand the Government have power to appropriate this vote to any other purpose - that they have power to transfer the ex-: penditure to some purpose that has no relation whatever to immigration. I suggest that progress be reported now, and that the Prime Minister to-morrow make a statement before the division is passed. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; and of that necessary business there need not be a long list. Unless we dispose of the Estimates as a Whole more rapidly than we are disposing of those of the particular Department now under discussion, it will be clearly impossible to conclude the session as early as anticipated. I shall not complain, however, though I should regret the factfor other reasons and for other members. I am perfectly willing to proceed so long as honorable members think fit. But, having regard to the magnitude of. the measures to be submitted, and the importance of the issues with which they will deal, I dare say we shall face them better after a short recess than if we prolong the present session. On the other hand, we have enjoyed a much longer Christmas adjournment than that of the Senate, and the Government itself is prepared to go on as long as is desirable in the interests of public business. </para>
