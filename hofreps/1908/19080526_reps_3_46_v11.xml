                    <quote>
                        <para>When the fleet was at Magdalena Bay, California, Admiral Thomas made the following request to the associated press : - " I wish that you would convey my request to the people of California, that, us far as may be possible, they refrain from furnishing the men of the fleet with intoxicating liquors. I would consider it a personal favour if they would do so. It is nearly always the case when our men reach a home port that some of the people are inclined to offer them liquor. Many consider it a part of the entertainment, and perhaps it is; but it works a bad end. The men are thus induced to drink, and drink too much. " On board the ships liquor is prohibited, and the men are unaccustomed to its use. When  they get ashore there is no such restraint. On the way around South* America the fleet has made an enviable record for good conduct ashore. It would be exceedingly regrettable if, upon reaching the United States again, this good reputation should be dimmed. " I appreciate that most people have the best motives only in offering liquor to the enlisted men, but it would be better for the men and the navy in general if it were not done. I sincerely trust that it will not be." </para>

                    <para class="block">In view of this request on the part of Admiral Thomas, who is in charge of the fleet which will shortly visit Australia, will the Prime Minister issue instructions to the Committees making arrangements for the entertainment of the men that, as a matter of courtesy, the wish of the Admiral in this respect should be conceded? </para>

                        <para>- I saw for the first time this morning the letter from Admiral Thomas published in the press. At the first meeting of the Joint Committee, held last week, this subject was discussed, as far as it could be, in the absence of knowledge of what the wishes of the American Admiral would be. Subject to that consideration, the genera] feeling' of the Committee was that undue temptation should not be placed in the way of the sailors.. </para>

                        <para>- Does the Prime Minister think it fair to take ?250,000 of Customs and Excise revenue for naval and military purposes to protect the property of the wealthy when such money, in the form of indirect taxation, comes for the most part out of the pockets of the never-ending struggling poor? Is he. aware that under such a financial system the great burden of defence oppresses the poor, and allows the rich - who own and control the wealth of Australia  -  to escape that which is their legitimate liability ? Seeing that the cost of national defence under his proposal brings about this result, will he introduce a Bill to impose a graduated land, income, inheritance, absentee, and wealth tax, so that those who shriek so loudly for naval and military armament in Australia will thus be afforded an opportunity to indorse their lip-loyalty to the Empire and their property inspired Australian patriotism with their own sovereigns? </para>

                        <para>- I have a question to put without notice to the Prime Minister. I am unable to find in the Budget papers or in those detailing the proposals of the Government in regard to the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States any definite statement as to the services, other than defence and old-age pensions, for' which provision is to be made out of the surplus revenue to be withheld . from the States. As the Premier of one State has already started an attack upon the Commonwealth in respect of the Government's financial proposals, will the Prime Minister make an official statement as to the services which the Government propose to take over from the States, and the additional services for which they propose to provide out of the Commonwealth's present proportion of Customs and Excise revenue? Further, will the Prime Minister have such a statement circulated for the information of the general public ? </para>

                            stated this morning that the blast furnace was working very satisfactorily, and turning out pig-iron equal if not superior to the best Scotch pig. Yet they were not able to sell the local article owing to the fact that the imported article could be sold at a lower price. During one week recently nearly  the whole of the product of the furnace of 700 tons was stacked, while on other occasions about 400 tons each week have been stacked. In view of this absence of demand and the excessive cost of manufacture, it will mean that they will have to stop the furnace or get some encouragement either by way of duty or bonus.

The particular case to which he has called attention, and on which he, like all of us, desires to obtain, as early as possible, the judgment of the High Court, is one of the greatest, and probably one of the most complex issues submitted in recent years to a judicial Bench. It is above all things desirable in the public interest, that when such a judgment is given it shall be not only well weighed, as it is sure to be, but as complete and as comprehensive as the circumstances of the case warrant and require. </para>

The claims have since been received, and have been referred for examination to the Crown Law officers. I am now awaiting their reply before presenting the Supplementary Estimates, of which I spoke the other evening, and which I intend asking the House to pass before Parliament prorogues. </para>

I understand that a short time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent</inline> showed that an additional expenditure of £67 per annum would enable their wages to be raised to <inline font-style="italic">£2 2s.</inline> per week. </para>

I shall be glad to make further inquiries, but it must not be forgotten that the Government Printing Office is a State office, and not a Federal one. &gt; It is very difficult to bring about harmonious relations in reference to all these matters. As I have said, I will make further inquiries and refresh my memory as to what is being done. </para>

                            <para>- There may be a very great distnction. For instance, the very proper restrictions which are imposed upon honorable members of this House under our Constitution do not apply in regard to a limited liability company in which they may be shareholders. The same doctrine appears to have been adopted by the Acting Administrator and the Executive Council in Papua before they had received the first communication from us, after we had become aware that these applications on the part of Land Office officials were being dealt with. Our communication imposed:  very much more stringent conditions than previously obtained upon officials, even if only holding shares in companies endeavouring to secure grants of land. </para>

                            <para>- In the first case speaking from memory - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drummond</inline> was directly interested. I forget whether the application was made only in his name or not. In the second case, he was partner in a syndicate applying for the land. Of course, the honorable member must recollect that the second application was put in by a brother officer - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pinney</inline> - an hour or two in advance of the application of a person who is not a member of the Public Service. It is also recorded in evidence that the application on behalf of the syndicate in which the officers were partners was pressed into a condition of precedence because of the knowledge that a second application was about to be made. In New Guinea,' owing to the absence of competition, it has become the invariable rule to grant land to the first applicant. Thus, by securing priority in application, one practically secures the land. This attempt to secure priority was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pinney,</inline> another officer who intended to be interested in the land referred to. </para>

                            <para>- I think that is not supported by the papers. It is a tenable theory that he had intimated to officers that under certain conditions they might be applicants for land. But, as I endeavoured to point out, the second case was not merely an application for land in which, as members of a public company, the officers might thereafter have had an interest, but one in which they pushed forward a certain syndicate application to secure priority. This, as I have already explained, would have had the effect of giving them the land, no matter who the second or third applicants might be. </para>

                                <para>- In the first place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline> Smith's participation hardly deserves to be characterized even  by so strong a word as " allowing." The Land Board in Papua had never been called on to exercise the function of selection which is continually exercised by Boards of similar denomination in Australia. On the mainland, the Land Boards are appointed chiefly because there are rival applicants-; whereas in Papua the quantity of land available has been so much greater than the number of applicants, that there has been practically no judicial duty cast on the Boards. Their task was that of registration before sending on the application to the Council, which had finally to determine its fate. In justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline> Smith, let me point out that in no case up to this had there been any real competition for land in New Guinea. That is why the practice arose of giving the land to the first applicant. Practically, there had never been other applicants for the same block-, or, if there had, it had always been possible to satisfy them in the immediate neighbourhood of the land which they desired. Therefore, there had never, as I say, been any obligation cast on the Land Board to exercise judicial functions. ' Consequently, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline> Smith sat on a Board, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drummond</inline> was a member, the latter called attention to the fact, in the first case, that he was an applicant, and in the second, when again it was known that he was interested directly or indirectly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drummond,</inline> was not asked to withdraw, because there was no other officer available at Port Moresby to make the Board complete. The Board had only to discharge what may. be called a clerical function by forwarding the application to the Executive Council, by whom it had really to be decided. </para>

                                <para>- The question, I understand, is as to the time when the instruction sent by himself reached New Guinea. That instruction was sent directly I saw there was a chance of difficulties arising, although at that . time no difficulty had actually arisen. Directly the facts came before me, with my experience of the working of land laws in Australia, I saw the mischief of permitting any system under which officers concerned in the surveying and reporting on land were permitted to have an opportunity of competing with the outside public, who had to depend on them for information and assistance when selecting or applying for holdings. </para>

                                    Smith laid the case before the Council at once. He said he considered that, in view of the authority given by the Administrator, the mere fact that officers were interested in a syndicate; when that fact was known, need not prohibit them from applying for land. But the charge against
                                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drummond,</inline>
                                    based on the second case, had nothing to do with

                                    Smith. The charge against

                                    was that, knowing the first order was meant to exclude anything like active and real competition between officers of the Lands Department and the public outside, he had consented to remain connected with a syndicate which was in competition with an application lodged by a member of  the public. This was held to be a deliberate breach of the previous prohibition; of course, it had to be considered in conjunction with all the surrounding circumstances. It was on that charge that
                                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drummond</inline>
                                    was, as the House is aware, found guilty, and suspended by a majority of the Council.

                    <para>. Before the order of the day is read for the consideration in Committee of the Senate's Message No.' 28, I desire, by permission of the House, to move a motion similar to that which was placed on record in1902, when we were dealing in the same way with the first Tariff passed in the Commonwealth when it had reached the stage which the Tariff now under consideration has reached. I move - </para>

                <para>That having regard to the fact that the public welfare demands the early enactment of the Tariff, and pending the adoption of joint Standing Orders, this House refrains from the determination of its constitutional rights or obligations in respect to the Message No. 28 received from the Senate in reference to the Customs Tariff Bill of 1907, and resolves to consider it forthwith. </para>
                <para class="block">We have standing orders of our own, though these are intended to be subjected to some revision before they are finally adopted. There are no joint standing orders in existence governing the procedure to be followed in dealing with questions which affect both Chambers. Consequently, we are, just as we were in 1902, at large in the absence of any defined method of procedure. A constitutional question might have been raised  in  1902, and, speaking from memory, the point was raised then as to whether a second series of requests, or the pressing of requests by the Senate, ought to be entertained by this Chamber. In the absence of standing orders' dealing with the matter, it was thought wise to waive any constitutional question that might arise, and to deal with the practical question that had arisen, protecting ourselves by a motion of this sort, in order that we might be able to take into consideration without delay the pressing of particular requests by another' place. That was considered to be a wise course to adopt then, and as, in the absence of joint standing orders, we are still in precisely the same position as we were at that time, and there is the same obligation to the public to dispose of the Tariff as soon as possible, in order to permit business to flow in well ascertained channels, instead of being subject to the doubts and hesitations in which it would be plunged if the Tariff were set aside whilst constitutional questions were argued between the two Houses, it would, I think be well to adopt the same course on this occasion. In the circumstances, we protect our rights in future by this motion which I trust the House will agree to. </para>

                        <para>- All constitutional rights which affect this or the other Chamber, or both, can be determined only by the Constitution itself. But I see no objection at. all to the motion submitted by the Prime Minister. It follows a precedent set upon another occasion. My own view of the matter, on the spur of the moment, is that there is really no right of this Chamber involved in the return of a Bill for the second time with requests from the Senate to this Chamber. I do not see any constitutional difficulty in the matter. But in order to preserve any rights that others may think we have, I think the course proposed is not inappropriate. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not quite sure that the course proposed will preserve the rights of this Chamber. The fact that we took this course in 1902, and to-day propose to follow the same procedure, will possibly create a precedent which may be followed for all time. It is quite evident that when the Constitution was framed, it was held that the Senate should not, by way of amendment, interfere with financial Bills or taxation. To overcome the difficulty it was proposed that the Senate should be empowered to make suggestions. </para>

The Senate is not constituted in the same way as the House of Representatives. The small State of Tasmania has as much power in the Senate as have either of the large States of New South Wales and Victoria. In these circumstances, we are placing in the hands of the Senate a power out of all proportion to the measure of its representation of the people as compared with their representation in this House. </para>

                        <para>- That is a very different matter from that with which we are dealing to-day. I hold that the Senate had a perfect right to make certain suggestions for the amendment of the Tariff as passed by this House, but this House having considered those suggestions, and having accepted some, and refused to accept others, the powers of the Senate in the matter are exhausted, and it cannot suggest further amendments, but should take the responsibility of accepting or rejecting the Customs Tariff Bill as sent from this House, after its suggestions had been considered. Now it appears that we are to have the Bill bandied about between the two Houses, and we are invited to believe that the motion moved by the Prime Minister will protect our rights in the matter. As a matter of fact, it will not protect our rights at all, because the very fact that we are taking this course time after time can be cited, when a similar occasion arises, as a. reason why we should take the same course again. We have practically established a precedent. It is of no use trying to make ourselves believe that everything will be made right by passing the joint Standing Orders. These have now been for some years before this House, after having been considered by the Standing Orders Committee, but have not yet been dealt with. An understanding can be arrived at, so far as those joint standing orders are concerned, only by making certain compromises with the Senate . But this House has. no right to make compromises with the Senate in the matter of our powers with regard to money Bills. We must be guided entirely by the directions of the Constitution, and we are bound to settle definitely what the proper interpretation of the Constitution is with regard to this question. The matter is a serious one, and I very much regret that the House at the end of a long session happens to be in. such an unfortunate and tired state that it does not care to go into the matter thoroughly, every one desiring that the Tariff question shall be settled at the earliest possible moment. The very fact that the Senate is constituted on an entirely different basis from this House should be sufficient in itself to lead those who represent at all events the larger States to make a strong stand against the action of that Chamber. </para>

                    <para>. - I am pleased that the honorable member for Kennedy has taken the stand he has.  His  speech throws light on the casting votes which he gave as  Chairman  of Committees in regard to several items on which the Senate had requested amendments. I believe he. felt that the Senate in making requests for increased taxation were taking to themselves taxing powers' that they had no right to take. Apparently the position is whether the convenience of the public in having the Tariff passed is of greater importance than the settlement of the relative powers of the two Chambers. It is of no use for us to mark up on the door of the Senate "No taxing powers," while at the same time giving them power to tax. They have sent down one set of requests, and now they are repeating and insisting upon those to which we did not accede. It will be found that those requests are mostly for increased taxation, and, therefore, they are, in effect, insisting on the power of taxation. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The question is - Are the. Government prepared, or not, to take a strong stand on this matter? Is not the House prepared to take up a firm attitude? One House must give way. The Senate have already repeated some of their requests. Are we to understand that if we reject those requests a second time the Senate will accept our decision, or further press them ? If they do press them again, there will be, comparatively speaking, a deadlock. I approve of the stand taken by the  Chairman  of Committees. It shows, as I said, that his casting vote must have been given in Committee with a view to prevent the Senate from exercising the power of taxation.  His  contention that the Senate is not composed in the same way as this House shows that the course proposed by the Government will make the Senate stronger than the Constitution intended that it should be. In 1902, as the Prime Minister said, we wrote oyer the door of the Senate, " No taxing powers," and then passed the matter by. Every time we run away from the issue in that fashion, the Senate will become stronger. If, on this occasion, they resist our action with regard to twenty items, they will do so next time with regard to forty items. If they can do that, why should they not take the full power of taxation into their own hands ? If, on this occasion, we adopt the course proposed by the Prime Minister, I hope that we shall send back to the Senate, rejected, every one of their requests. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire also to support the view taken by the honorable member for Kennedy. A distinction was undoubtedly made in the Constitution between the powers of the two Houses with regard to money Bills, and rightly so, because this House represents the people in the mass, while the Senate represents them in States, and financial questions are not questions which affect the States as States. The Constitution, therefore, laid down a deliberate distinction between the powers of the Houses with regard to measures of taxation. Such measures can be initiated only in this Chamber, and the Senate has no power to amend them. What the Senate are trying to do now amounts to a distinct assertion of equality of power with regard to money Bills, and in some cases of their right to initiate taxation. The Constitution provides that the Senate shall have no power to amend money Bills, but that they may make requests for alterations or omissions, the intention being to make a distinction between an amendment and a request. If the power of making requests can be insisted upon for any length of time, there is not the slightest difference between a power of amendment and a power of request. The introduction of the method of making requests was intended to convey some power less than the power of making amendments.  Obviously, therefore, the Constitution intended that the power of making requests should not be insisted upon. A request can be made' which we may or may not grant, and there the matter should end. If it means anything further than that - if a continued insistence on requests is allowed - there is no sense in saying that the Senate cannot make amendments. In these circumstances, it seems to me that the House will be abrogating its powers and privileges as the Chamber representing the masses of the people if it gives way in the fashion proposed. I agree with the honorable member for Kennedy that if we admit on this occasion, as we did in 1902, the power of the Senate to press requests, notwithstanding that we carry a sort of pious resolution that we are not really giving way, we shall, as a matter of actual fact, be giving way. The fact is that we are giving way, although we say that we are not. We are saying in effect, " While we are giving way, we are only doing so on this occasion." We said the same in 1902, and the excuse now, as it was then, is that the pressure of public business renders this course necessary. But will not the pressure of public business always render it necessary ? Can we expect ever to have an occasion when we can take as much time as we like to settle the question of the relative rights of the two Houses? The question ought to be considered on this Bill, which represents absolutely the most important expression of the money powers of this Chamber. Proposals for taxation are the very proposals which render it essential that this House should make a firm and determined stand to protect its rights. No occasion could be stronger than this one. </para>

                        <para>- But we are not using the weapons that we have. The proper thing to do is to assert the principle that this House alone has the power of imposing taxation, and that the Senate has no power of insisting upon its requested amendments being made. If the power of insistence is granted, it amounts to a power of amendment. If this House were to take up a determined stand on the question, the Senate would, I think, recognise the true constitutional position, and would give way. Otherwise, it would have to take the responsibility of throwing out the Tariff. On the other hand, if this House gives way on every occasion, our power goes by default, and the Senate is placed on an absolute equality with us in regard to money Bills. </para>

                    <para>.- I was one of those who in the Convention did my best to secure equal powers to the Senate and House of Representatives in regard to all Bills. But that view was not adopted. I do not say that at present I have any regret for what was determined, but the power to amend money Bills was refused to the Senate, whilst the power of making requests was granted.. I submit that the procedure which we have adopted in dealing with the Senate's requests has resulted in giving greater power to that House than it would have had if the Constitution had secured to it the power to amend. We may leave out of consideration the possibility of either House laying this Bill aside. Neither House has any intention of doing anything of the kind. The laying aside of an important measure of this character is not likely to occur amongst reasonable persons. But the fact remains that the power of submitting requests has  been so used, that duties have been increased at the instigation of the Senate. In fact,' for all practical purposes, the Senate has originated taxation - power to do which is actually denied by the Constitution - by requesting increased burdens on the people, and which requests this House has adopted. I blame the Government for that. Had it not been for the anxiety of Ministers, improperly, I contend, to obtain increased duties, and thereby to impose greater burdens on the people than this House was originally Willing to impose, the Government should have refused to allow the Senate to usurp a power which it has no right to exercise by opposing its requests. In their desire to get their own way and to increase Customs duties, the Government have yielded, ' improperly, in my opinion, to the Senate, and that House has consequently practically increased taxation on its own initiative. This House occupies' a very unsatisfactory position in consequence of the course which has been adopted. Leaving out of consideration for the moment the, question whether the Senate has or has not the right to request increases of duties - and I say that it has no such right - it certainly is a fact that this House, under the Constitution, possesses the exclusive power of originating taxation. It should, therefore, have refused to agree to any proposed increase of taxation emanating from the other Chamber. I do not take exception to the course now proposed to be taken under the circumstances. We know that time is short. I suppose that . time always will be short, and that we shall be in the same difficulty on every occasion when the same power is asserted by the Senate. At the same time, I certainly do not think that We are exercising and protecting our rights to the same extent as the Senate is trying to increase its powers. That House has increased its powers, first of all by suggesting increased burdens upon the people, a right not conferred by the Constitution; and, secondly, by insisting a second time on requests having that object in view. How many times messages of this description can go backwards and forwards between the two Houses, I am not aware. It appears that we have given up any rights in regard to the matter which we had. </para>

                    (Brisbane) [3.57]- I agree with the honorable member for Boothby that by adopting the motion which has been proposed by the Prime Minister we are practically surrendering any rights that we may possess. In 1902, there was some excuse for this procedure, because then there had been no time for this House to consider maturely and adopt standing orders for itself. I was much surprised when I became a member of this House to find it working under standing orders which were, I believe, originally those of the Parliament of South Australia.

                    I understand that the task of drafting new standing- orders was referred to a Committee, but this House has not yet taken the trouble to consider the Committee's report. The matter has been allowed to remain in abeyance. With all respect to' the House, I must say that it is not altogether creditable that such a state of affairs should exist. I was at first inclined to agree that it is not desirable that the privilege or right claimed by the Senate should be conceded to it. But after more mature consideration, I am inclined to think that it was rather an advantage that the practice which obtained in 1902, and which is about to be repeated, should be made perpetual. I believe that where there are opportunities for the interchange of views by message between the two Houses, there is less likelihood of there being a deadlock on a matter such as the Tariff, as might be the case if the Senate were limited to sending one set of requests only.

                <para>Colonel FOXTON. - If the Prime Minister's motion is carried, the effect will be to revert to the practice established in 1902. If only one of the Senate's requests be adopted, there is immediately shown to be justification for the second message. As to the constitutional question, I was at first inclined to think that the Senate had no such constitutional right as it appears to assert. But, on looking at the section of the Constitution, I find that it is a privilege of the Senate to send requests of this sort " at any stage." </para>

                <para>Colonel FOXTON.- The Senate has what is practically a right of enforcing its opinion by rejecting the Bill. Whether they have the right to send down one set of suggestions, or half-a-dozen sets, they can reject the Bill as a whole. But there is less likelihood of "a Bill being rejected if there are continuous opportunities given to the Houses to meet upon common ground by way of message. For that reason, I think there is no very great danger to the people of Australia and to their rights as represented here if the practice which was adopted in 1902 is followed on. this occasion. </para>

                    - That is so. For that reason I do not view with the same amount of alarm as some honorable members appear to do the adoption of this course, although, as I said before, Iw as inclined to be of a contrary opinion some time ago. I do not know who compose the Standing Orders Committee,but having regard to the position in which we find ourselves to-day, it should be patent to the House that it is extremely desirable not only that permanent standing orders should be adopted either with or without amendment as recommended by the Standing Orders Committee, but also that joint standing orders should be adopted as soon as possible.

                    <para>. - I take it that if it was the intention of the Federal Convention that the Senate should have the power which it now claims, it would have been set out very clearly in the Constitution. To my mind, it is a dangerous thing that, whereas in one House two States have each six senators, in the people's House,' which was constituted on the basis of population, one of those States has only five representatives, and the other twenty-seven. If it was intended to give the Senate an equal voice with this House concerning money Bills, I venture to say that the intention 'would have been set out very clearly in the Constitution. But it was emphatically the intention of its framers that, while the Senate might exercise the power of suggestion for the purpose of a proposition being reconsidered by this House, if should not have the right to press its suggestions time after time, and try to force down our throat an amendment - for that is what it amount's to - because of its numbers. I ask honorable  members to consider this list of suggested amendments. From my stand-point on the fiscal question it contains many suggestions which I should like to see adopted, but we have come to that stage, I take it, when we ought to put aside all fiscal controversy, and to recognise one fundamental necessity, and that is the preservation of the control of this House over money Bills. Is the House going to surrender its powers, and allow the Senate to practically amend money Bills? </para>

                        <para>- This is no party question. It is not a question of whether this is to be a high or low Tariff, but a question of maintaining the rights and privileges of the House. It is about time that its leader, the Prime Minister, gave us some advice. I feel very strongly about the matter. I have indicated that if there were a chance of dealing with the suggestions, it is probable that, from my. fiscal stand-point, I might favour some of them, but I want to put them all on one side. I ask every honorable member to regard the situation from a much broader stand-point than that of fiscalism, and to maintain the- powers and privileges of this House. If we give way now, we might as well grant to the Senate full power in regard to every money Bill - initiation and everything else. </para>

                    <para>.- I think it may be fairly said that,' under the Constitution, the Senate has only the power of suggestion at one stage of a Bill. In section 53, the phrase used is "at any stage." After its third reading here, the Customs Tariff Bill was forwarded to the Senate, and for the second time it has been returned at exactly the same stage. I consider that the thanks of the House are due to the honorable member for Kennedy for drawing attention to that fact. I feel that the Government are leading us on a &gt; wrong road in proposing to assent to what has been done. This House has the sole power of dealing with money Bills, 'but, in spite of that fact, it is proposed to allow the Senate to make recommendation after recommendation at the same stage. I think that it is a fair argument and a fair reading of section 53 of the Constitution to say that the Senate has the right to make suggestions once and once only, and that is when it receives a Bill from this House after its third reading here. When the Senate sent down its first message to this House, it had exhausted its. power of suggestion, and when we disagreed with any of its requests it had no right to make further requests in regard to the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- We had an opportunity of compromising or agreeing to the Senate's proposals. In a large number of instances we took the latter course, and those proposals were settled, I contend. There is no other stage at which the Senate can act. Where we have rejected any proposals of the Senate, I submit that it has no right to further request amendments. It must reject the Bill if it disagrees with our decisions. It has exhausted its powers of request, and if this House once consents to allow message after message to be sent down covering requests, it might just as well give to the Senate equal powers in regard to all money Bills. </para>

                    <para>In this Bill (section 53)you will find words to the effect that the Senate may not amend the principal Money Bills - Bills imposing taxation and Bills appropriating revenue for the "ordinary annual services of the Government." But if you look a little further on, you will find that the Senate can "request" amendments, and can keep on " requesting " as often as it likes. The Senate can send down " requests " at any stage. I say there is no material difference between the Senate proposing amendments to the House, and requesting amendments to the House. Calling it a different name does not alter the true nature of the thing. But as if we had not enough difficulties already to face, this Bill throws an apple of perpetual discord between the two Houses. This precious distinction between " requests " and "amendments" will lead to continual friction between the two Houses in Appropriation Bills. </para>

                        <para>- It is only fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins to add that when, during the consideration of the Customs Tariff Bill of 1902, I quoted these remarks, in this Chamber while he was present, he stated that his views then differed somewhat from the conclusions which I had read. But the extract which I have cited is from a report of a speech revised by him. I should be glad to know that the views there expressed were not correct. We, in New South Wales, who voted against the acceptance of the Constitution, did so mainly because of the power which the instrument gave to the Senate. I have never opposed the Union of the States; I have always been in favour of unification, and the substitution of a national for the States Parliaments. But the impression conveyed to the people of the smaller States, as I proved on a former occasion by reading a long extract from the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser,</inline> was that the Senate, in regard to money, as well as to other Bills, would have rights equal with those of the House of Representatives. </para>

                        <para>- The Convention gave the Senate the right to make suggestions. I do not wish to allow that Chamber to exercise powers which it does not possess, and if by fair and legitimate means I could cripple any of its powers, or take them away, I should do so. But if the Senate has the right to make requests repeatedly, it is useless for us to pass the motion submitted by the Prime Minister. If Ministers think that the Senate has not the right to make requests more "than once, they should fight the question now, while if they agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins that it can press its requests as often as it likes, they should withdraw the motion, and proceed to the consideration of the Senate's message. Should it be proved that the Senate has the right to make requests only once, its powers will be known to be much smaller than I fear them to be. </para>

If the Chamber has the right to press its requests, they should not waste more time with this motion ; if they think it has not, we should fight the matter. </para>

                    <para>. - Whatever may be the views taken by honorable members in regard to the constitutional question at issue, the motion of the Prime Minister is not calculated to add to the dignity or efficiency of the House, or to settle the point. It rather leaves it open, inviting further differences which may be of more serious consequence than that now existing. But there is another aspect of the matter which has not yet been put before the House. It seems to me that in this, and in all similar cases, in which 'a message comes from another place which it is doubtful that the Senate has the constitutional right to send, there is thrown upon you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the responsibility of determining whether it is properly before us. Your position, as  Speaker,  is not defined in the Constitution, but it is referred to. It carries with it the whole authority and power of the position of  Speaker  of the House of Commons, with this difference : that the House of Commons is part of a unified Parliament, in connexion with which there cannot occur such difficulties as arise under a written Constitution defining the respective rights of the two Houses of a Legislature. </para>

                        <para>- In one sense, too this House may be the interpreter of its own Constitution in matters of this kind ; but, so far as I. understand the question, you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> are the only existing authority who, so far as this House is concerned, has to determine whether this message is properly before us. In your capacity as  Speaker,  sir, you have given a ruling, with which, I think, we all agree - whatever difference of opinion there may have been at the time the question was raised upon the validity of a previous message from the Senate. You were then asked to determine whether it was a message. The same responsibility, I submit, falls upon you at this stage, and the question raised undoubtedly involves the interpretation of the Constitution for a specific purpose. But the interpretation of our Constitution does not rest wholly upon the High Court. It is not wholly within what is known as the judicial power of the Commonwealth. As I understand it, the judicial power of the Commonwealth is distinct from what is ordinarily known as the executive and the legislative power. It is a Department which metes out justice - which carries out the laws of this Parliament, as Well as of others. </para>

It would be perfectly right for the Governor-General to be advised not to give his assent to a Bill which had not complied with the constitutional requisites; but I have not heard it argued that the High Court can go behind an Act of Parliament, which has received the Royal assent, and inquire whether it was passed by the requisite majority, or what messages in regard to it passed between the two Houses of Parliament, and then say, " We think that this is not an Act of Parliament." </para>

                        <para>- It does not arise from that fact, but the honorable member has made a very apposite remark. The position I have mentioned does not arise from the fact that the Attorney-General must so certify ; but the Attorney -General has to do so, because a measure becomes law as soon as it receives the Royal assent, and usage has always insisted on that security. In Australia, before , the final act of granting the Royal assent to a Bill - so that from that time forward it can be regarded by the Courts only as an Act of Parliament - the practice is that the Attorney -General shall advise - as is done in Great Britain - that it is fit to be presented, and that it complies with a number of requisite's that are mentioned in the instructions issued to the Governor-General or the Governor as the case may be. </para>

                <para class="block">House, has not complied with constitutional requirements from receiving the Royal assent. - But it has never been suggested that once that assent has been granted any Court has a right to question the mode in which a Bill has been passed : to say whether the majority by which it was passed or whether the form of the messages passing from one House to another in connexion with it was such as to leave it within the Constitution. Let us take as an illustration what took place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> when you were asked recently to give your ruling on the point of order raised by the right honorable mem- . ber for Swan, that the Senate in making -requests for increases of duty had . exceeded its powers under the Constitution. Suppose that you had determined that it was wrong for the Senate to request any increase of duty, and that at the same time we received a message containing requests for reductions of duty in the case of 150 items, and one small request for an increase of duty. Let us assume that' that one request for an increase passed unnoticed, that the message was dealt with, and the Bill became law. Could it be suggested that in such circumstances the Courts would have a right to examine into the records of the two Houses, to turn to the evidence of the papers or messages passing between them, and to say finally, " Yes, we find that at one stage a message was sent by the Senate to the House of Representatives actually containing a request for an increase of duty, and that that request was unnoticed by honorable members, and effect was given to the message"? Such a position would be altogether impracticable. The Courts could never arrogate to themselves the right to inquire into those matters, and in my opinion, the High Court would never venture to do so. If that view is right, then the position is that we are either dealing with a message under section 53 of the Constitution, or there is nothing before us. I understand that, following the usual practice, a messenger from another place placed this message in the hands of the  Clerk,  and that, as soon it is was handed to you, sir, the Prime Minister moved the motion now before the House. The message being in your hands at the present time, and the Prime Minister having moved this motion, I desire to request your ruling on the point of order whether there is any message, under section '53, before the House. It must be decided, and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

                    are the only authority within the four corners of the Constitution who, so far as this House is concerned, can decide it. I do not want to press very strongly the arguments one way or the other. If I may say so, with all respect, I was entirely in favour of the view which you took on the point of order raised on the first message on the Customs Tariff Bill received from the Senate. You then held that the Senate had a right to send a message requesting increases as well as decreases of duty. That is a very different question from the one now before us.

                <para class="block">It seems to me that, whilst that provision may be wide enough to include one or more requested amendments, yet, reading the section as a whole, the intention was that at any particular stage the Senate might return the whole Bill, and that the. Senate has no power to send a message without returning with it the Bill to which it relates. The message must be accompanied by the Bill to which it relates. I suppose that at the present moment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the Customs Tariff Bill is in your hands, and the only question is whether this message is one that can be sent down from another place. It seems to me that it is not a matter that' can be solved by any motion such as the Prime Minister has brought forward ; that upon you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> rests the responsibility of deciding the question so far as this House is concerned. If by any chance the House disagreed with the view that you took on such an extremely important point as this - and I admit that the responsibility cast upon you is a very grave one - it has a constitutional way of disagreeing with your ruling. I should not think it likely that it would do so, but it is in this way alone that the House is master of the question. You, sir, as  Speaker,  are the only authority that can determine it, and this House can only affect your determination by disagreeing with your ruling if it should desire to do so. I therefore ask you to determine whether this is a message that can be sent down from the Senate under section 53 of the Constitution? </para>

                        <para>- I am not so sure that circumstances cannot arise in connexion with the procedure adopted between the two Houses which would raise the question of the validity of an Act. Suppose, for instance, that both Houses agreed' to  certain rates of duty, and to a certain wording of the various items connected with those rates, and that the Senate subsequently altered the rates and the wording? There is a standing order of the House of Commons, which dates back to time immemorial, to the effect that any matter which has been agreed to by both Houses cannot be re-opened. The transgression of that law, I venture to say, would goa long way toward invalidating any Act passed by this Parliament, if its validity were questioned before the High Court. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that that consideration would be quite relevant. However, we need not discuss this matter' at the present stage. I submit that, until we frame joint standing orders, we must accept responsibility for what is now being done. It is not right that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> should be saddled with that responsibility unless he chooses to accept it voluntarily. If he does so, we may be grateful to him for interposing to do something which from time immemorial he has been under not the slightest obligation to do. I repeat that it rests' with you, sir, to say whether you will give this ruling or not. I do not think that we ought to ask you to give it, and so relieve us. from the responsibility which rightly devolves upon us. It is our own fault that we find ourselves in this position, seeing that we ought to have passed joint standing orders long ago. </para>

                        <para>- No, it waives the whole question as we did before. I have grown tired of raising questions in this House relating to standing orders and procedure. During the first three years that I was a member of the Parliament - owing to the imperfect standing orders that were in operation - I was in constant trouble with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the  Chairman  of Committees. I dropped that kind of thing. I could get no assistance in the House, and consequently the questions Which I raised were allowed to go by the board. Now, after seven' years have elapsed, we are still without adequate pro vision in respect of Standing Orders, and are still to a large extent dependent upon what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> in his wisdom may deem to be right. I submit that he is the servant of the House, and as such, equally with every other honorable member} is bound by the Standing Orders that we adopt. </para>

                    <para>.- Upon the question of your ruling, which has just been invited by the honorable member for Flinders, may I be permitted to suggest that reference to a previous debate shows that when this question was first raised in 1902, you stated the difficulty to the House? It was possible then for the House to have adopted one of three courses. It could have admitted that the Senate was within its rights in transmitting the message which it did, it could have denied that it was within its constitutional rights in transmitting that message, or it could have put the question of rights aside, pending the passing of joint standing orders, having in view the enormous practical importance to the whole community of the settlement of the first Federal Tariff. Upon that occasion a division was taken, and the proposal submitted was fortunate enough to receive the support of the greater number of those who have taken an adverse view of it today. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and by a large majority the motion which I had the honour to submit was carried. The honorable member himself supported it, so that he is in no respect inconsistent in the argument which he has just addressed to the House. Why was that course adopted ? It was recognised that' honorable members are inclined to place the largest interpretation upon any references to their own powers under the Constitution, and consequently by implication to restrict those of' the other Chamber. </para>

The House then had to consider whether it would raise this important constitutional question at that stage, thus imperilling the work of some twelve months upon the Tariff schedule, or whether it would put the question aside pending the adoption of joint standing orders. These would not in any respect alter the constitutional powers conferred upon either House, but might have proved a means of arranging a <inline font-style="italic">modus vivendi</inline> that we could consent to adopt. </para>

                        <para>- In this case it is interpreting, but it is interpreting by supplement and addition to the existing words of the Constitution. We are driven back at present' upon the intent of those words. The words themselves leave us very much at sea. They are capable of two interpretations, and each House will naturally place upon them that which is most favorable to itself. But for pressing practical reasons the House in 1902 put the question aside pending a certain contingency. During the interval we have been so closely occupied that we have not been able to approach the task of arranging a <inline font-style="italic">modus vivendi</inline> by the adoption of joint standing orders. </para>

                        <para>- It would be unlikely to do so, but the course of framing joint . standing orders might involve a settlement of this question. I can conceive that that is possible, though it is not very probable. But joint standing orders have not been adopted, and consequently we find ourselves, in a sense, in the same position to-day that we occupied in 1902. But we do not find ourselves in the same position in regard to the particular question before us, or even in regard to that to which the honorable member for Flinders addressed himself. If, at that time, instead of carrying the motion submitted, we had taken our other course, a practice would have been established by which you, sir, would have been bound. As it is, neither of those practices - the one aggressive, the other concessionary - has been adopted. But, instead, this House then deliberately declared that it. would put this question aside until joint standing order's have been adopted. Those standing orders have not yet been framed, and, therefore to my mind, the precedent applies. Under the circumstances, I submit that your ruling must be that the House, having already been confronted with a precisely similar question under precisely similar circumstances, and having adopted a particular course, which is to have a defined and limited operation, a precedent has been established, and that, in the absence of any other decision to which you, sir, could be pointed, that precedent ought to be observed. </para>

                        <para>- They are exactly the same. The whole contention urged in 1902 was that the framing of the Tariff represented practically twelve months' work on the part of both Houses, and that its rejection at that particular stage would have involved the most grave and serious loss to the whole community. Precisely that position arises again to-day. But I venture to say - and also to hope - that this is practically the last occasion upon which it will be necessary to revise the whole Tariff. Particular proposals - however they may be dealt with - would not involve the community in anything like the same amount of confusion in" which it would 'be involved if we were to provoke a constitutional conflict upon this elaborately complete Tariff with the other House. </para>

But there is a likeness between the circumstances of 1902 and those of to-day in that if the Tariff were rejected now, the work of twelve months would be lost, and the community would be plunged into confusion. Surely that is a reason why we should deal with the constitutional question apart from any other. Could we expect the public mind to deal with it impartially - if it were remitted to the electors for their decision at the ballot-box - taking into account the enormous fiscal consequences that would follow our action ? Shall we not be disabling ourselves, and prejudicing our appeal to the public to assist and support us in our interpretation of section 53, if we raise a question which involves the throwing away of twelve months' work, while the whole trading and commercial community- </para>

                    <para>. - I do not desire to debate this question at any length'. I think, however, that, under the circumstances, it would be wise if the honorable member for Flinders did not insist on you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> giving a ruling at the present moment. The question is of such importance to the future conduct of the business of the House, and its relationship to the Senate, that I do not think you should be called upon, almost at the last moment, to give a ruling which is of such vital moment, and which, probably, would create a precedent. . This is a question which you should have ample time to thoroughly consider, it may be, with the assistance of the Crown law officers ; and, therefore, I think that, under the circumstances, we ought to adopt the procedure which was laid down on a former occasion. My object in raising the question was to emphasize the fact that a motion of this character had been before Parliament and had been the subject of some debate, showing that the course taken then was not to be regarded as a precedent. I hope that the honorable member for Flinders will see his way clear to withdraw the suggestion that a ruling be given at the present moment. </para>

                        <para>.- We could not have better evidence that it was a farce to pass the motion, which has just been agreed to by the House than is to be found in the motion now submitted by the Treasurer. The Prime Minister pleaded that, in the interests of the convenience of the public, a certain course should be taken, and, to be consistent, the Government should follow that up by proposing that every amendment requested by the Senate should be made. By pressing their requests, the Senate are insisting that the amendments should be made. In the circumstances, it is a waste of our time to argue the matter further. ' Honorable senators will only make their position stronger than it has been made by the motion carried at the instance of the Prime Minister, and this Committee will only further humiliate itself. Before going into Committee the House practically agreed not to insist upon anything, and that honorable senators, in another place, should have their own way. But immediately we get into Committee, the Treasurer moves to reject the first suggestion made by the Senate. We refused to make this amendment before, and the Senate, adhering to its original decision, has decided to press it. Now the Treasurer is again asking us to refuse to make the requested amendment, and the Senate must either give Way or stand firm on its original request. The motion carried by the House has', in my opinion, handed over all power to the Senate. An appeal was made by the honor able member for Flinders that we should deal with the difficulty between the two Houses, apart from fiscal considerations. </para>

                        <para>- No, they are not made here. They are brought here as piece goods. They are, for the most part, made of cotton piece goods mixed with wool. They are used in every dwelling in the country. The duties proposed press most heavily on the working class. Every housewife feels them, and every draper in the country protests against them. They are really revenue duties of an unwarrantably excessive character. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 10 per cent. on curtains and blinds, and the free-trade section recommended that the duty should be 15 per cent. </para>

                    <para>.- Surely the Committee does not propose to keep on backing and filling on the items of the Tariff? There must be some finality. If these items are to be sent backwards and forwards between the two Houses, and continually altered by each, we may be here until Doomsday without having concluded our consideration of the Tariff. The only sensible course for Ministers is to agree to the suggested reductions or modify the exorbitant duties, and have done with them. </para>

                    <para>. - I think there is a great deal in the suggestion of the honorable member for Bendigo. I believe that it would be very much better to impose duties of 15 and 10 per cent. on this item than to impose duties of 25 and 20 per cent., as proposed by the Government. I think that, considering that these curtains and blinds are not manufactured in Australia, the item ought to be free. But, as there seems to be no possibility whatever of carrying such a proposal-, we might meet the Senate to a certain extent. I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>. - I have already indicated that I am firmly of the opinion that the time has passed for the Senate to appeal to this House for the amendment of the Tariff. The only way in which we can emphasize that view is to send these items back to the Senate in the form in which they previously left the Committee. In the circumstances, there is only one course open to me, and that is to vote against all the amendments requested by the Senate. The white-washing motion just carried in the House only plays with the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I did, because I believe that when the House does take any action of that kind it should be united, and not divided. . Honorable members should recognise that we have now to consider the schedule, and that, as the honorable member for Parramatta has said, it must be returned to the Senate. It should be remembered that the duty we now impose must remain in force possibly for a considerable number of years. It will be admitted that the duties of 25 and 20 per cent. proposed on curtains and blinds are revenue duties, because, while these curtains may be cut into lengths here, they are not made here. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman does not mean to say that the material of which they are made is manufactured here? The cutting of the piece  goods into curtain lengths may be done here, but that is not an industry the protection of which justifies the imposition of duties to the extent of 25 and 20 per cent. I have voted consistently throughout the consideration of the Tariff against the imposition of heavy duties for the protection of these little peddling industries. If the piece goods from which these curtains are made were manufactured here, their manufacture would be worthy of some protection; but we do not need to impose duties of  25  and  20  per cent. to cover the cost of cutting piece goods into lengths. The duties proposed by the honorable member for Parramatta may be regarded as revenue duties also. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Committee will agree to the modification proposed by the honorable member for Parramatta. From a revenue stand-point, duties of  25  and  20  per cent. must be regarded as extremely high, whilst duties of  15  and  10  per cent. might be considered reasonable revenue duties. I do not think we should neglect an opportunity to derive revenue, but we should make its collection equitable. I intend to support the modification proposed. </para>

That would be worse than duties of  25  and  20  per cent., because in all probability, if the higher duty was imposed, even if the articles are not made here now-- </para>

This is one of those small industries for the sake of which, if it exists in Australia at all, the Committee is asked to impose a burden on the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. If there was a possibility of establishing the . industry throughout Australia, and meeting the requirements of the people, there might be some justification for the proposal. The honorable member for Bendigo assures us that there is no such prospect. In order that we may vote on lower duties first, and subsequently, if necessary, vote on the proposal of the honorable member for Parramatta, I move - </para>

                    <para>.- My principal reason for objecting to the duties of  25  and  20  per cent. is that - according to the definition of " piece goods" in the foot-note to item  123  (piece goods)-curtains and blinds, if imported in the form of piece goods defined by selvedge or by pattern for cutting up into separate articles, are not to. be considered piece goods for the purpose of the lower duties, but are to be dutiable " under the heading applying to the article into which the material is designed to be made." I have gone through drapers' establishments, and been shown long rolls of piece goods intended to be cut up into curtains and blinds and defined by selvedge or pattern, and those, although' really piece goods, are  charged the full rates of 25 and 20 per cent. They are not admitted as piece goods. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members seem to be terribly agitated in their minds because they hear that a Royal Commission is to be appointed. The leader of the Opposition seems to know more than the Government knows.I am quite entitled - and so is the Committee - to adhere to the position we took up before on this item. The honorable member for Bendigo' s statement regarding the duty charged on these importations is absolutely wrong. The honorable member for Melbourne put the case exactly by, interjection. It is wrong to say that the full duty is charged on piece-goods which are to be cut up here. Our object is entirely different. I know that the honorable member for Bendigo, unlike some other honorable members, is a protectionist, and I assure him that this is a protective and not a revenue duty. These articles are made here to a considerable extent. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister is taking up an unreasonable attitude. He has said that he intends to make some of the requested amendments pressed by the Senate, notwithstanding that we have twice' affirmed our proposals. Having looked through the schedule, this seems to me to be an item on which we might well compromise, and therefore I intend to vote for the lowest rates proposed. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the rates originally fixed by this Committee will not be reduced. Raw material in the piece which cannot be made in Australia ought to be admitted free, but the work of cutting it into lengths and finishing it should be done here. In the big furnishing warehouses of the Commonwealth, not only are fine gauze nettings, but also embroidered material of choice designs, cut into curtain lengths and attached to rings, and we should protect this industry. I should like to see a larger margin between the duty on the raw material and that on the finished article, just as I should like to see a larger margin between the duty on cloth and dress material, and that on apparel and attire. </para>

                    <para>.- In my opinion, the Committee should re-affirm the duties to which it originally agreed. I believe in building up our industries. We shall become a manufacturing community only by protecting industries which can be carried on in Australia. We ought not to wait until an industry has been built up under free-trade to give it protection. Surely clips, bands, loops, holders, and curtain tassels, as well as curtains and blinds, can be made in Australia? </para>

Material for making blinds is dutiable at 5 per cent. under the general Tariff, and free if it comes from Great Britain. . It is only when it bears marks showing where it should be cut into lengths 'that it. is dutiable at higher rates. Persons who wish to import blinds practically ready made should have to pay more than those who use what is really raw material. </para>

I think that I can truthfully say that on a previous occasion when this Committee accepted 500 horse-power as being the capacity beyond which dynamos should be allowed to be introduced free of duty, we acted on insufficient information as to the ability of the Australian manufacturers to produce powerful dynamos. On the second occasion the matter slipped through without much consideration. </para>

                        <para>- That is an admission from one of the strongest protectionists in the Committee. I. quite agree with my honorable friend that dynamos beyond the capacity mentioned are not made in Australia. We stipulated originally that dynamos beyond 500 horse-power should be admitted free. The Senate took up an extraordinary attitude, and altered the 500 to 10. Probably both Houses were wrong. I believe that the 500 horse-power limit is altogether too great, taking into consideration the usual requirements of Australian firms; but at the same time I believe that the 10 horse-power limit' is. altogether too small. I think that we ought to give to the manufacturers of electrical machinery in Australia protection in regard to the production of dynamos up to at least 50 horse-power. By so doing we should secure to them the great bulk of the Australian trade. They would thus be able to manufacture those dynamos for which their plants are best suited. The. number of firms in Australia that require electrical appliances up to the capacity of 500 horse-power are very few. </para>

                        <para>- It is, I think, a fair proposition. It would give the Australian manufacturers, perhaps, 90 per cent. of the total trade, whilst it would afford those firms who require dynamos of a greater capacity facilities for obtaining them without penalization. What I propose is a reasonable compromise. I move therefore - </para>

                        <para>- They can be. In fact, I was remonstrated with for the insertion of the 500 horse-power limitation in our report. It was said to me, " Manufacturers have been making some of these 500 horse-power engines in Australia, and if you throw open the doors for their importation you discourage the local production of electrical machinery." It is clear  that unless we give an impetus to the industry it cannot develop, and importations will continue indefinitely. I did not sign my name to any recommendations in the Tariff Commission's report unless I had conclusive evidence before me. I hope that on this occasion the Committee will adhere to their former decision. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems tome that the whole of the evidence before us is that one man in Bendigo says that machinery up to 500 horse-power can be made in Australia. But I can see no reason why we should penalize industries in this country whose machinery is being worked by means of dynamos. It will certainly mean penalizing those mines in Western Australia whose batteries are' running in conjunction with electric dynamos. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable members must recollect the debates that have taken place on this question. It has been proved beyond doubt that dynamos have been made in Australia of a capacity beyond 400 horse-power. Four in particular were referred to that are now working in this country, all of them having a capacity between 400 and 500 horse-power. Therefore, it is nonsense to say that the more powerful machines cannot be manufactured in Australia. As the honorable member for Bendigo has very truly said, if we do not protect those who have been struggling to make these machines, we cannot expect the industry to progress. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt about that. Western Australia happens to be the State which is nearest to Europe, and is, therefore, better able to obtain machinery from other parts of the world than is the case with the other States. The Western Australian people seem to prefer to get their machinery from foreign countries rather than from the eastern States of Australia. That seems to me to be one of the principal reasons for the opposition to this duty. The big mining companies of Western Australia are at the back of the objection.. </para>

To return to the request, I may say that I have no personal interest to serve in this matter. I am not a member of any company, or manufacturing institution. I take up this stand" purely in the interests of Australian, as. opposed to foreign, concerns. Some honorable members who profess to be Australian in sentiment, are prepared to throw Australia and its manufactures to the winds, and I cannot help feeling indignant when I see them taking up such an attitude. We ought to be true to ourselves. There are honorable members who, " although they describe themselves as protectionists, vote against protection. That does not coincide with my idea of what is expected of them. I hope honorable members will not agree to the proposal to limit this item to dynamos under 50 horsepower. Such a modification would do great injury to the engineering industry, and I appeal to the Committee, in all sincerity, not to agree to the proposal made by the honorable member for Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It has not. Some honorable members opposite, as the result of that compromise secured reductions that they desired, and other members of their party in another place have, I presume, sought to so reduce this item that it will apply only to dynamos up to 10 horsepower. Those who know anything about the engineering industry will admit that many dynamos of far greater capacity than 10 horse-power are made in Australia. The honorable member for Kooyong who, I believe, was one of those who arranged the compromise arrived at when this item was previously before us, knows full well that we are making large dynamos here. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the honorable member did. I took a note of his words, and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will bear out my statement. I challenge any honorable member to show that any representative of Western Australia is here at' the mere dictation of any company. We are certainly not here at the dictation of the Treasurer or of a mining company. Although 400 horse-power dynamos may be made in Richmond, that is no reason why we should agree to the Treasurer's proposal. I hope that the proposition which has been put before the Committee will be accepted. </para>

I would remind the Committee that the duty originally levied upon this class of machinery was greatly in excess of that which we are now asking honorable members to adopt - that as the result of a compromise it was reduced from 30 to 121/2 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- In Victoria. When this item was under discussion upon a former occasion a photograph was exhibited of a 400 horse-power machine which had been made in Australia, and we know from the evidence which was tendered to the Tariff Commission, that it is quite possible for machines up to 500 horsepower to be manufactured locally. I ask honorable members to meet us in this matter in order that we may dispose of the Tariff schedule to-night. The Government do not desire to sit late, but it would be a great convenience if, without unduly curtailing the speeches of honorable members or interfering with their undoubted rights, we could complete the consideration of the schedule this evening, so that it may be considered by the Senate to-morrow. I ask the Committee to stand by its former decision. </para>

                    <para>. - The remarks of the Honorary Minister deserve some attention. He has appealed to us to adhere to our former decision in respect of this matter upon the ground that a compromise was arrived at. I am not quite sure, speaking from memory, whether a compromise was arranged, and, if it was, what was the nature of it. But the Minister must not forget that honorable members upon this side of the chamber offered to adhere to any compromises that had been arrived at in regard to Tariff items, so long as the Government would also respect them. The Treasurer would not agree to that proposal, and consequently honorable members have exercised their own judgment regarding these compromises. The Honorary Minister has also asked us to stand by our twice made decision in respect of this item. I should be willing to adopt that attitude if the Treasurer would intimate his intention to take a similar course in respect of other items. To be fair, any such arrangement must be adhered to by both sides of the House. Regarding the proposal immediately before us, I do think that we ought to consider the mining industry as far as we possibly' can. It is an industry of importance to many States, and of particular importance to Western Australia. We know the difficulty experienced in that State in working the poorer propositions. These mines cover a very large area, and if they can be worked profitably they will confer an immense benefit upon Western Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- The Honorary Minister has appealed to the Committee to complete the consideration of the Tariff schedule to-night. May I suggest that its passing would be greatly expedited if the Government would accept the modifications of the Senate, and not insist upon pressing for the imposition of excessive duties ? Both the Minister and the Treasurer appear to think that there is only one interest which has to be considered - the interest of the manufacturers. Apparently, the users of machinery which is the subject of high duties are to receive no consideration whatever. They merely have to pay and look pleasant. If we can only get Ministers to realize that other persons besides manufacturers and their employes should be considered, there may be a chance of disposing of the Tariff schedule this evening, but not otherwise. The proposal of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie is certainly preferable to that of the Government, and I intend to support it. </para>

So binding, indeed, has it been held, that in 1850 a serious oversight as to the commencement of the Act having been discovered in the Pirates' Head Money Bill, before the Lords' amendments had been agreed to, no attempt was made to correct it by way of amendment, but a separate Act was passed for the purpose. </para>

I understand that electrical apparatus will fall _ automatically under item  178b,  dutiable at  17^  per cent. Consequently the Treasurer's proposal really means proposing a new item with that duty attached to it. </para>

There is no definition of electrical apparatus in the Tariff, and we certainly should have a definition of it. Whilst the Treasurer expresses a- hope "that the Committee will get through with the Tariff, he should not forget that such proposals as that now before the Committee tend to delay its passing. We may, without knowing it, be including at a higher duty under the term "electrical apparatus " a number of things of which we have no knowledge.

                    <para>.- The hon'orable member for Lang has made a very sensible request. Any one who has had any dealings with the Customs Department must be aware that it is the practice, of the officials in doubtful cases to levy the highest duty. If there is no trick in this proposal - and I tell the Committee candidly that I fear a trick- it would appear that the Treasurer is willing to forego a  15  per cent, duty on electrical fittings consisting wholly or partly of metal n.e.i, including switches, fuses, and lightning arresters. The honorable gentleman should tell the Committee what the term " electrical apparatus ' ' will cover, and he should put it in the Tariff. We should then "know what we were voting for. I do not believe the honorable gentleman knows what the term covers, but his officers have told him that the proposal he has made will get, over the difficulty. It seems to me that it will provide a drag-net under which all  kinds of electrical appliances will be included in the term "electrical apparatus," and will be dutiable at 17J per cent. I am not disposed to support the proposal until I know exactly what will be covered by the term " electrical apparatus." </para>

                    <para>.- If there is one industry which has been badly treated in the framing of this Tariff it is the engineering industry of Australia. In the circumstances I am prepared to vote in this matter with the Treasurer. I remind honorable members that the duty proposed on electrical apparatus is only 17 J per cent., and that they have not been satisfied with duties of 30 and 40 per cent, for the protection of other industries. Foodstuffs and wearing apparel used by engineers in common with other persons in the community have been' made dutiable in the interests of various industries at from 30 up to 120 per cent. ; but apparently it is a crime to suggest that the engineering industry should be' protected to the extent of 17 J per cent. Really the way in which this Tariff has been framed is enough to make any man a protectionist. We find that every member of the Committee looks after the interests of industries established in his own electorate or in his own State, and it is about time that some one considered the interests of those engaged in the engineering industry of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Other honorable  members  are always out for' loot, and I say openly' that the passing of the Tariff is nothing but a scramble for loot. I am prepared to make that same statement from a public platform. Right through the piece, in considering this Tariff there has been a struggle for what 1 call " loot " on behalf of .various industries, and I can  only regret that so far the engineering industry has been able to get so little of it. Probably the reason why fittings, switches,  fusings,  and lightning arresters are to be made free is that they are not made here, and that it would be rather an assistance to the engineering industry than otherwise to admit them free of duty. No body of men has done better work for trade unionism than have the engineers of Australia. The industry pays good wages, and is carried on under- fair conditions, and I should like to see thousands of people at work in Australia under such conditions. We shall shortly be asked to encourage the immigration of  persons  of the artisan class, and the best persons of that class that we could introduce are those of the English, Irish, and. particularly the Scotch race, whose industry is devoted mainly £0 engineering. </para>

                        <para>- I find it difficult on account of the interjections to put forward a  plea on behalf of the engineering industry of Australia, whilst honorable members have been ready enough to listen to pleas put forward for the protection  of  other industries. Throughout the consideration ' of the Tariff, I have endeavoured to advocate the interest  of  those engaged in the engineering industry, and I shall take advantage of every opportunity afforded .to benefit them. I make no secret of the fact that a great number of them reside in my electorate. For years past they have given me strong support as a free-trader, and it is about time for me to do something "for them now. -I hope that the Treasurer will make a strong appeal to the protectionists in the Committee, and to the " leaven " of whom he spoke the other day, to give some protection to the engineering industry. As the engineering establishments of New South Wales are larger- and better equipped than those of any other State, "I can speak on this matter not only from the stand-point of my eleclarger and better equipped than those of my State. I urge that this important industry of the State from which I come should receive some assistance under this Tariff. </para>

                    <para>.- I think the Committee might make the concession asked for by the Treasurer, although, after the abusive language which the honorable gentleman applied to me early in the afternoon, I do not know that I am called upon to advance any special reasons in support of his proposal. It appears to me that if it is within the capacity of Australian workmen to make dynamos, up to 500 horse-power, and all their accessories, honorable members are quibbling over a very small matter when they object to a duty of 17 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent, on electrical apparatus. Fittings, including meters, fuses, switches, and lightning arresters, are to be free. </para>

The apparatus is infinitesimal ' when compared with the whole of the machinery, and the subject is not of sufficient importance to occupy more time. </para>

The apparatus under discussion has not the remotest connexion with any engineering industry carried on in the honorable member's electorate?

If the Treasurer's proposal is carried there will not be much left in the item, and no engineer in Australia will be the slightest bit better off for the rearrangement. ' Most of this electrical apparatus is covered by patent rights and manufactured abroad. ' The Postmaster-' General has to import all his apparatus, simply because it cannot be purchased here. </para>

This is an electrical age, and Australia is . more and more using electricity, with the result that engineers are endeavouring in a larger measure every day to supply the demand. I admit that' this "is only a side line, but the results will be serious if we lop off one line after another. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily the bulk. There is no doubt that a good deal of the electrical apparatus, such as telephone switchboards, and so forth, required by the Postmaster-General, are admitted free ; but, at the same time, this item touches my electorate very nearly. There are resident in my electorate the members of at least three firms and many of their employes, who are engaged in this class of work. There is, particularly, the firm of Edge and Edge, who are very enterprising, and have done a good deal of work for the Post and Telegraph Department in the past. The work, however, has been greatly reduced for want of proper encouragement; and I take this present opportunity to emphasize the fact that the trades for which I am particularly concerned have been very badly treated, in view of the fact that other industries have received the most favorable consideration. It is quite true that the engineers will not starve if this item be  passed ; but every little encouragement is a step toward success, and this industry ought to receive the same treatment as that meted out to others. </para>

                    <para>.- I appeal to the Treasurer to give consideration to the suggestion I previously made, unfortunately, late in the evening. I pointed out that, while the duty on manufactured doors had not been increased, the duty on door stocks, out of which Australian workmen make doors, had been increased. If the Minister's proposal be carried, door stocks will remain subject to the duty of 2s. 6d., with the result of decreasing the protection afforded to men employed in making doors throughout Australia. The protection granted to the manufacturer of doors in Australia at the present time is so narrow that the greatest possible difficulty is experienced in competing against the doors imported from America. I am told that the amount of timber available for this purpose in Australia is very limited indeed. Even if we made the duty 2s. 6d. per 100 feet super. instead of 2s., the material used in the manufacture of doors would still be imported, or, at any rate, the great bulk of it would be. </para>

                        <para>- It would affect the bulk of the sizes, ranging in value from about 3s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. per door. I am further informed, in connexion with the smaller doors, that the protection already given is so narrow that the manufacturers in Australia have only the lowest possible margin to work on to enable them to keep the industry going. This information was not at the disposal of the Treasurer when we previously dealt with the subject, and I think that he might listen to an appeal from the Australian worker engaged in this industry. </para>

                    <para>. - We have already had two debates on this subject, and the Committee  decided that the duty against the United Kingdom should not be increased from 4d. to 6d. per lb. The duty affects only one firm of directory proprietors, and I am unable to understand why they are being differently treated from those who are interested in other books, which are admitted duty free. Why is this particular printed book taken out of the free category ? </para>

                        <para>- What difference is there between books on natural history and other subjects, prepared here after great research and expenditure of money, and sent to England to be printed, and this particular book, which is also prepared here after great research and expense and printed in England? Why should' not a directory be treated in the same way as any other book? But the point in dispute is whether the duty should be 4d. or 6d. per lb. As the duty of 4d. would amount to about 2s. 8d. per copy on the larger directories, surely that would penalise the proprietors sufficiently to satisfy honorable members. It has been stated that the printing can easily be done in Australia.' It was said in the Senate that a firm of Sydney printers who formerly had the contract for printing Wise's directories had given up the work on account of the conditions imposed. I have it authoritatively stated that no new conditions were imposed, and that the proprietors of these directories did not vary their contract in any way ; but the firm in question' indicated that they could not continue the printing owing to the difficulties involved. Honorable members are well aware that there are difficulties attached to the printing of such books as directories. A great quantity of type has to be kept "standing," and a large number of corrections have to be made, which involve a considerable amount of work and conduce to the disturbance of other work with which the printing firm may be concerned. In any case, if the work can be done in Australia a duty of 4d. against the United Kingdom will afford an ample opportunity for Australian printing firms to tender. I protest against an unfair distinction being made between this particular book and other books which may be prepared in Australia, and printed in England. I shall vote against the Minister's motion. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for North Sydney has asked why a distinction is made between directories and other books prepared in Australia and sent to England to be printed. There may be many reasons. Wise's directories contain many advertisements that the other books referred to do not contain. The leverage used by the firm in question is easily understood. I have before me a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">British Printer,</inline> which contains a list of wages paid to compositors in some of the cities in England. They range from 28s. to 34s. per week. In this country, however, the wages of compositors range from£2 12s. to <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 16s. per week. </para>

The fact that the proprietors of these directories use the low wages and long hours of British printers as a lever ought to be a sufficient reason to induce us to make the duty 6d. per lb. The Committee has been entirely misled by the firm in question regarding the difficulty of having the work done in Australia. They say that they have given every opportunity.

                        <para>- The Salvation Army has a plant which will turn out a very high class of work, and it would only need to make a comparatively small addition to its plant to be in a position to turn out <inline font-style="italic">Wise's Directory.</inline> However, there is no need to waste time in labouring the question. It is sufficient to say that the statements which were previously quoted to the Committee are not in accordance with the facts, and that there' is no difficulty now in getting one or a dozen firms in Australia to do the work if the conditions submitted are anything like fair. When a firm state that the reason why the directories were not printed here was not as stated by Messrs. Brooks and Company, of Sydney - that the conditions were bad - the least which they might have done would have been to send a copy of the conditions to honorable members. There is no more difficulty in doing that sort of work in Australia than there is in doing any other class of printing work, and I speak with some experience of printing. </para>

He takes too much for granted, so long as the representations come from 'one side only, and are in the direction of an increase ina duty. I have received a letter from another firm who are interested in this matter. I do not happen to know the writer personally, and I ask the indulgence of the Committee' while I read the letter in rebuttal of the one just read. It reads as follows - </para>

                    <para>In the Senate last week, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> in supporting an increase of duty to 6d. per lb. preference on directories, said that Messrs. Sands and McDougall had received a telegram from Brooks and Co., of Sydney, stating that the reason they had ceased printing Wise's Directories was that the conditions imposed by Wise's were " intolerable." </para>
                    <para>In contradiction to this statement I have to say that the firm of Wise's never in any way wished or did vary the contract entered into with Brooks and Co. in 1902 ; and, further, that in 1904 Brooks and . Co. undertook the printing of <inline font-style="italic">Wise's South Australian Directory</inline> on exactly the same terms and conditions. Again, in 1905, Brooks and Co. advised the firm of Wise's that they were putting in additional plant, and would be in a better position to cope with the work, and asking for additional directories. </para>
                    <para>If the conditions were, as the telegram says, so "intolerable," why were Brooks and Co. anxious in 1904 and 1905 for additional work? I can only presume, from my own knowledge and what has come to light during this debate, that the rivals of Wise's had induced them to join forces in crushing my firm. </para>
                    <para>As regards the printing of the works in Australia, I can only reiterate my statement that my firm has not had a single offer to print the works at any price whatsoever. </para>

Where conflicting statements are made by interested firms, honorable members must realize that there is always very great difficulty in knowing exactly where the truth lies.

                        <para>- The persons who have to be considered are the public, who buy these directories. There is not a word said on the other side about any protection for the unfortunate person who is to pay. According to the Treasurer, and those who think with him, there is only one person to be considered, and that is the person who has something to gain by the duty. The smaller section of the community have to be considered by them, and the largest section have to pay and to look pleasant, whether they can afford it or not. In the opinion of the Treasurer, only one person in this community has any right to receive any consideration from the Committee, and that is the manufacturer or producer of something in Australia. The taxpayer is not to receive the slightest consideration. Take a New South Wales Directory, which weighs about 8 lbs. At 4d. per lb. the protection on one copy  amounts to 2s . 8d. Surely, in all conscience, that is sufficient protection! To raise the duty to 6d. per lb., and thus increase the protection per book to 4s. is, in my opinion, daylight robbery, and nothing else. </para>

                    <para>.- This is one of those cases which make protection stink in one's nostrils. This proposal is made absolutely for the purpose of putting a rival firm in a position to force upon the public a directory which is not nearly so good. As a matter of fact, <inline font-style="italic">Wise's Directory</inline> for South Australia was printed from 1902 to 1907 by the Sydney firm, who say that the conditions of tendering were intolerable. Why is this extra duty wanted? Simply because Sands and McDougall are issuing a directory which does not contain within thousands of the number of names in <inline font-style="italic">Wise's Directory.</inline> Sands and McDougall do not spend, within thousands of pounds, as much as Wise's spend on the collection of names. In their Bendigo list, there are not one-fifth of the names to be found in Wise's list, and the same remark applies to the lists of residents in Geelong, and other Victorian towns. An attempt is being made' to force on the public a Victorian directory, which is useless in comparison with the full and complete directory issued by Wise's. The Minister agreed, without a division, to rates of 6d. and 4d. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may be sure that I was not ; the information was given to me. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Advocate</inline> office have stated that they could print, within five months, a directory similar to Wise's, and that the work in subsequent years would take only three months. If the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Advocate</inline> office could do the work in that time, there must be dozens of other printing offices in Victoria which could do it in less time. The Salvation Army, which has as fine a printing plant , as there is here, could, I am sure, do it in less time. It may be objected that the information in the directory would be five months old ; but that in <inline font-style="italic">Wise's Directory</inline> must be still more out of date, because the names after collection here have to be sent to England to be printed, and no local correction of proofs is possible. Then the printed matter has to be sent out again. With regard to the statement made by the honorable member for Lang, regarding the firm of Messrs. William Brooks and Company, let me read the following letter - 159 Clarence-street, Sydney, 21st May, 1908. </para>

                <para>Dear Sirs,-In response to your request - per telephone this morning - I waited upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Brooks - of William Brooks and Co. Ltd. - whom I found had printed <inline font-style="italic">Wise's Directory</inline> for several years, and he very courteously gave me information on the subject which enabled me to wire to you in terms as per copy of original message enclosed. I may supplement my telegram by stating that when William Brooks and Co. were printing the <inline font-style="italic">Directory</inline> they appear to have studied Wise's interests in every possible way, despite the fact that Wise or his representative failed to observe nearly all the conditions intended to operate in favour of William Brooks and Co., while the conditions governing the financial part of the contract were of the most stringent character and quite unfavorable to William Brooks and Co. Further, it was constantly impressed upon W. B. and Co. that the work could be done at a lower rate in New Zealand and England, and this aspect of the matter was invariably introduced whenever W. B. and Co. endeavoured to secure a more reasonable rate of remuneration for their work. Eventually, becoming tired of the exacting and harassing conditions of the contract, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brooks</inline> informed Wise of his intention to relinquish the work, whereupon Wise implored <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brooks</inline> to continue the printing of the <inline font-style="italic">Directory.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brooks</inline> was obdurate, and now says that while his firm could easily undertake the work' without in the least straining their resources, nothing will tempt him to work for Wise again. Given the same work under reasonable conditions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brooks</inline> is ready and willing to undertake it. I trust I have comprehended your message aright, and that the information furnished will be of service to you. </para>

                        <para>- No. No information is given as to where Wise's Western Australian directory is printed. All we are told is that it is "published annually." As a protectionist, I desire a Tariff which will compel work of this kind to be done here, under conditions which we can regulate by legislation. The honorable member for Hindmarsh has given information as to the rates of wages and the hours which obtain in many places in England. The firm of Wise, if necessary, could get their directories printed in a newspaper office, as his New Zealand directory is printed at the office of the <inline font-style="italic">Otago Times.</inline> Many newspaper offices could print such a directory in less than three months. I hope that, for the protection of our printers and bookbinders, the Committee will put this duty of 6d. per lb. on Australian directories. </para>

                    <para>.- The Committee ought not to make any amendment requested by the Senate which, in their opinion, would do an injustice to the people of Australia ; but I think that in this instance we might readily accede to the request of that Chamber. I voted for a duty of 6d. under the general Tariff and 4d. against importations from Great Britain ; but we must, if we are to arrive at an understanding with the Senate, make some of the amendments requested by it, and none is more reasonable than this. A duty of 6d. per lb. is hot heavy. <inline font-style="italic">Wise's Victorian Directory</inline> weighs about 41/2 lbs. Assuming that it weighs at the. most 5 lbs., this duty would amount to 2s. 6d. per volume, or about 10 per cent. on the selling price. </para>

                        <para>- But it is a matter of cost. The position is plain. The weight of this volume is at the most 5 lbs., and the duty can be charged upon it only as it is imported in its finished condition. It is a protection to Australian workmen. In the circumstances, the only way in which we can gauge this duty is to consider the total cost. When we propose to impose a duty on any goods coming to Australia, we do not endeavour to ascertain the cost in the various ramifications of production. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but we must have regard to the selling price of the volume, which is£11s. According to the imprint, this directory is printed in Great Britain. We are unable to say  definitely what is the cost of compilation, but it is probable that . it is fully covered by the revenue from advertisements. </para>

                        <para>- I am not. I cannot go into details respecting the cost of compiling the names in this directory, but, as one having some knowledge of printing, I have no hesitation in saying that that cost is covered by the advertisements. The cost of the paper is about 2s. per volume, so that the selling price is a very fair basis on which to estimate the duty. This duty, amounting to 2s. 6d. per volume", is a protection to workmen in Australia as against workmen in Great Britain. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for Wimmera has convinced me that we ought to adhere to our original decision, and maintain the preference of 2d. per lb. He assures us that the paper in each volume costs about 2s., and the duty of 4d. will amount practically to the same sum. Surely a duty of 100 per cent. should be sufficient, and we ought not to increase that protection in respect of imports from the Mother Country to 150 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- I am not contending against that proposition, but the honorable member for Hindmarsh and the honorable member for Yarra if they had their way would vote prohibition every time. The chief question involved relates not to the actual printing of these directories, but to the great principle of preference to which this Government is pledged. We decided to grant a preference of 2d. per lb. on directories imported from the Mother Land, and now that another place, which  is notoriously opposed to the principle of preference, has requested us a second time to strike out the preferential duty, we find the honorable member for Wimmera and the Government themselves going back on that great principle. The honorable member for Wimmera has shown that the duty of 4d. per lb. is equal to a protection of from 50 per cent. to 100 per cent. on the actual printing and bookbinding. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the suggestion of the Senate will not be accepted. First we were requested to make the item free, and then, by some. extraordinary process of reasoning, the Senate go. to the other extreme and suggest duties of 30 and 20 per cent. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended 20 per cent., while the free-trade section recommended 15 per cent, j and, under the circumstances, I see no reason for departing from the decision which .this Committee arrived at originally. The bulk of the gloves- are imported, and the duty in the main is a revenue duty, which, of course, presses very heavily, especially on the ladies. Duties of 15 and 10 per cent, are quite adequate for revenue purposes, and for protecting the small inferior classes of gloves which are made here. </para>

                    <para>.- The Chamber which has recommended such a reversal' is the Chamber to which we were this afternoon asked to bow down in the matter of. taxation. How can we listen to a body which would refuse to give protection amounting to 17J per cent, to the engineering industry, and yet propose duties of 30 and 20 per cent, on gloves? This is only an illustration of the unscientific way in which this Tariff has been dealt with. The bulk of the gloves included in the  item are not made in Australia, and I am prepared to vote for duties of 15 and 10 per cent, on gloves because I believe that the people who wear them can afford to contribute in that way to the revenue when the poorer sections of the people are asked to contribute so largely, under other items.- </para>

                    <para>.- I am not taking any extreme view as to our rights in connexion with these matters, but really it does occur to me that, when in connexion with an item on which we proposed duties of 15 and 10 per cent., another place should have suggested that the item should be free, and should then suddenly propose double the duties to which we had agreed, if we accept such a proposal we shall be transferring the right of taxation with a vengeance to the other Chamber. </para>

                    <para>. Although the duties suggested by the Senate on this item are exorbitant, I must say that, so far as the right of another place to propose increased duties is concerned, I can see. no difference between this and any other item in the Tariff. I agree with the. honorable member for Dalley that if it is wrong for the Senate to propose an increase, of duties in one case, it is wrong for that Chamber to propose increases in any case. I was very sorry that the motion submitted this afternoon was carried. When the leader of the Opposition so strongly objects to the Senate's proposal in connexion with gloves, I want to know why he did not take the same strong objection to all the requests by the Senate for increases of duty? </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know whether these piece goods weighing 5 ounces and under per square yard are manufactured at. Parramatta, as the Minister says. I wish to point out that the item as it stands would do exactly what we intended it should not do. The stipulation as to the weight of these materials gives a preference to the foreigner over the British manufacturer. I am informed that these dress materials, of high quality, light weight, and fine texture, are for the most part manufactured on the Continent. Where the texture and quality are the same, piece for piece, foreign goods of this kind are always lighter than those of British make, and therefore the stipulation as to weight deliberately gives a preference to the foreigner. </para>

                        <para>- When the item was last dealt with in this Committee. Originally we proposed to confine the item to women and children's dress goods under 5 ozs. per square yard in weight. The Senate asked that it should apply to all piece goods, woollen or containing wool, under that weight. We did not agree to make it quite so wide, but included "women and children's dress flannels." The whole item, whether amended as we propose or as the Senate propose, is a mistake. The stipulation as to weight tells in favour of foreign manufactured goods as against those of British manufacture, because the former are invariably lighter, while it will not give us the protection that we thought it would give. I doubt if we are making goods of this fine quality in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The  Chairman  gave an entirely different ruling. Originally the Government proposals contained no limitation as to weight.' This was inserted at the instance of the honorable member for Melbourne, and somewhat against the Treasurer's judgment. . The Senate asked that the stipulation should apply to all dress goods, including men's, under that weight. We refused to agree to that request, as it was too wide; but, in order to meet them in part, we inserted the words  including women and children's dress flannels." That is as far as the Treasurer thinks he can go. </para>

                        <para>- I have no knowledge as to that; but it has passed  both  Houses. The Senate's proposal is far too wide. It would include men's dress goods under 5 ozs., and the Committee ought not to agree to it: We are endeavouring to protect our manufacturers, and these particular classes of goods are made beyond any shadow of doubt in New South Wales, and, I believe, in Victoria. I hope the Committee will adhere to the item as we modified it on the last occasion. </para>

                    <para>.- The desire of the honorable member <inline font-style="italic">for</inline> Melbourne was to avoid penalizing the poorer classes, as he said these lighter dress fabrics were all imported. The item, however, will not have the effect which the honorable member anticipated. For winter wear, there is not a piece of dress stuff worth making, ford men's, women's, or children's wear, that is not over 5 ozs. per square yard in weight, so that in the winter the poorer classes would have to pay the higher rates of duty on piece goods, and get no benefit from this provision. Winter goods under 5 ozs. per square yard are absolutely shoddy. </para>

                        <para>- I mean shoddy so far as wearing is- concerned. In the summer, the position is reversed. All the light materials that women wear in summer will be under 5 ozs. per square yard, so that the lower duty will operate on the costly materials worn by the richer classes. As the honorable member for Parramatta said, these lighter materials are nearly all French,  and not British goods. If the intention of the item was to differentiate between the poor and the rich, it is going the wrong way about it. The importer, whether he pays 30' or 15 per cent., passes it on to the consumer. The only trouble is at the Customs House. The weight of the material cannot . always . be guaranteed, and every case will have to be.opened. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not want to do anything to stop the protective incidence of this item. I am accepting the verdict of both Houses, in this case, that there must be protection. I want to make sure that we do not give a sham preference, or a preference which is actually in favour of the foreign against the British article, as to goods that, must and will be imported.

By all means keep on . the protection which has been passed ; but surely the intention is to give the manufacturer in the Mother Country at least an equal right to bring his goods in with the French manufacturer. That is my point. This stipulation as to weight shuts out the British and lets in the foreign article. . </para>

                    <para>. - I quite agree with the honorable member for Parramatta. When this item was dealt with by the Committee, I happened to be coming down from Brisbane. In the railway carriage were two commercial travellers with a knowledge of the piece goods trade. One of them said, when he read what the Committee had done, " I do not know whether the members of the Federal Parliament are mad, but the fact of the matter is that what they have done will let in the rich person's material, and exclude that used by poor people." When I reached Melbourne I called upon two softgoods merchants, and asked them whether what I had been informed was correct. They said that they had read the debates in Parliament, and that the effect of the amendment, carried at the instance of the honorable member for Melbourne, would be to let in the very goods which he intended to keep out. Of course, the intention of the honorable member for Melbourne was to give the poorer people the benefit. But, as a matter of fact, the 5-oz. stuff is the richest material made, and it is principally made by foreign manufacturers. I am surprised at the Treasurer supporting such a provision. It is a class tax, and he professes to be opposed to taxes which set class against class. </para>

                    <para>. - The proposition submitted by the honorable member for Parramatta is a very serious one. It would amount to a tremendous invasion upon the 30 and 25 per cent. duties upon woollen goods. In fact, the effect of those duties would be swept away. Under the guise, and with the apparently good intention of having a shot at the foreigner, my honorable friend is certainly going to' cut very deeply into the duties on woollen goods if he succeeds in getting the words referred to excised. </para>

I am rather suspicious as to how it will operate ; and I should be prepared. to knock out the paragraph, and so have one uniform duty on woollen goods without any discrimination. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Committee will not accept the amendment. Take the suggestion of the honorable member for Maranoa to increase the weight per square yard to 8 ounces. Before the item went to another place, the importers canvassed on the right hand and on the left to try and get that alteration made, so that it would include material for men's clothing. Is the Committee going to be led into the taking off the protection which it gave to the woollen industry ? This proposal is only a means to that end. </para>

                        <para>- If that is done, the woollen industry will then get the protection which the Committee intended to give to it. I am surprised at this suggestion to increase the weight per square yard coming from the honorable member for Parramatta, seeing that it is practically a New South Wales industry which is making this material'.' He has submitted a proposition which, if adopted, will be the means of taking off some of the protection which we intended that the industry should have. I hope that the suggestion made by the honorable member for Bendigo will be adopted. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member knows that it can be done. The only effect of the stipulation as to weight is that these piece goods are coming to-day from France, whereas previously they used to come from Great Britain. Surely we do not intend to produce that result with our preferential Tariff ! That is the very last thing that we are seeking to do, and for honorable members to say that because we want to try to put matters on a fairly equal footing as between the foreigner and the Britisher, therefore we want to destroy the Australian woollen mills, is absurd. I repeat that it is in the power of the Government to so re-arrange the duties as to protect Australian industries. If they do not do so, it is their own look out. I do not raise that issue. </para>

                        <para>- Yes . The duties have been fixed at 15 and 10 per cent. from the 13th November last. That has been agreed to by both Houses, and we cannot go back on it. We are engaged now in settling points of difference, and cannot re-open the Tariff in the way proposed, undoing what has been done. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Government - and I address my remarks to the Prime Minister in particular - realizes the gravity of the situation. I do not think that Ministers have properly considered it, and I intend to move a modification on the amendment requested by the Senate. If the paragraph is agreed to as it stands, half the protective effect of paragraph  a  will be destroyed, and I am sure that Ministers do not wish that to happen to one of the chief items of the Tariff. . The present arrangement allows light woollen goods to come in at half the duty imposed on heavy woollens, which was never intended. . </para>

                            <para>- I thought that he had spoken more than once. However, I am not complaining of that, but I am sure that the honorable member on looking at the items remaining to be dealt with, will recognise that it would be impossible for us to dispose of them during this sitting unless we sat all night. Many honorable members have been travelling all . night, and it has always been the custom not to sit late on Tuesdays. </para>

I do not say that it is an announcement that the Government intend to make such a proposal, but it contains statements pointing to the view that an independent Board of Commissioners should be appointed. </para>

                        <para>If appointed such a Board could not relieve the Postmaster-General of his responsibility to Parliament for the working of the Department. Subject to this condition, it might perhaps afford a substitute for the present Central Office under a Secretary and staff whose duties confine them to their desks in Melbourne. Three or more officers clothed with greater authority whose duties, though performed at the Federal Capital for a part of the year, would also require them to keep constantly in touch with the Department's operations in all parts of the Commonwealth might possess better opportunities of bringing its business methods up to date, and so of satisfying the reasonable demands of the public. They could undertake  for the Post Office the duties at present discharged for the Department by the Public Service Commissioner, and in this manner concentrate the administration of this large and expanding Department. </para>

                    <para>But however attractive this or other proposals of the same nature may appear, and admitting that the adoption of new business methods has become essential for the effective federation of six separate State Post Offices, it cannot be denied that there is no direct precedent for such 'a change, either in the Commonwealth or beyond its boundaries. The management of State railways in Australia presents very different problems and has been dealt with by Acts which differ considerably in their devolution of Ministerial powers. In endeavouring to apply these precedents to the work of a Post Office and a telegraph service operating over the whole Commonwealth daily, and affecting almost every one of its citizens, and to a telephone service rapidly extending to thousands of individual homesteads in remote districts, the problems presented are of another order and require more prolonged examination than could be afforded at present. </para>
