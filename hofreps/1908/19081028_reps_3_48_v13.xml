                        <para>Skilled telegraphists at 7s. per day in Western Australia ! Think of it ! And the Arbitration Court will not allow a man to swing a pick under8s. per diem. The Department actually pays its casual labourers in Perth8s. per diem, and instrument fitters temporarily employed 10s. per diem. Who fixed the rate for telegraphists? Is advantage taken of the Government holding a monopoly of this class of employment? It looks like it, and such action is usually called sweating ! </para>

                        <para>- No doubt, the honorable member is cognisant of the fact that I have nothing to do with the fixing of rates of wages for telegraphists, that being done by the Public Service Commissioner. I have given instructions that for casual labour, such as instrument fitters, the rates ruling outside must be paid, and have made representations to the Public Service Commissioner in regard to the rates of pay of permanent hands; but he holds that there are circumstances which make service in the Department better, at the rates of pay which are given, than service outside. I should like it to be clearly understood that the fixing of rates of pay is not within my province; that I can merely make representations on the subject to the Public Service Commissioner. </para>

                        <para>- Among the regulations circulated this morning is one which provides that recruits joining the Royal Australian Artillery will be paid the full amount for which they undertake to serve only in the event of their service being considered satisfactory during a period of three months. If, before they have served for three months, the Department decides not to retain them, they are to be paid less than the full rate. Is it intended to apply this rule to the recruits who have enlisted within the last three months? </para>

As in one State alone a loss of some hundreds of pounds has been caused by men joining the Royal Australian Artillery for very short periods, it was found necessary to deal with the matter ; and, if the honorable member will put a series of questions on the notice-paper, I shall let him know exactly the state of affairs. </para>

This was made clear by interjection immediately following; by the Prime Minister. The communication as a whole was not intended for publication, being, in fact, a private letter. Major-General Hutton's views have evidently undergone no change, since he presented a report to Parliament while commanding the Military Forces of the Commonwealth, in which he contended that the danger to Australia was not merely through a raid. He speaks of " the invasion of Australia for purposes of territorial aggression as being under certain possible circumstances a military undertaking of no serious difficulty." </para>

                        <para>. - I shall not detain the Committee long, but I have a few remarks to make in . reference to the new protection. Members of the Corner party and of the direct Opposition have said that there is no need for new protection, because the Wages Boards in operation in some of the States, and the Arbitration Courts in others, cover most of the industries affected by the Tariff. But those who have taken an interest in factory legislation know that in Victoria, at any rate, a Wages Board can be established only after a special resolution has been passed' by both Houses of the State Parliament. In many of the protected industries no Wages Boards exist. I have not had time to compare the schedule of industries protected by Wages Boards with the Tariff Schedule, to see what industries are not protected, but I know several trades which are without protection. Some industries have obtained Wages Boards since the passing of the last Tariff. For the first seven years of Federation, during six of which the old Tariff was in operation, they were without that protection, and in some cases the Wages Boards . have not yet met. The leader of the Labour Party has placed on record the rates of pay for agricultural implement workers fixed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins.  His  decision could not be enforced because of the judgment of the High Court; but I have prepared a table which shows in parallel columns the </para>

                            <para>- Not so. much as that; let us say that there is an average difference of about 5s. per week. I do not know who is the  chairman  of the Agricultural Implement Makers Wages Board, but I do know that very often the determination of what should be the scale of wages fixed by a Wages Board rests with the  chairman.  Many representatives of the workers on such Boards have to meet their employers round the table. I am glad that the honorable member for Fawkner is present since, believing him to be a fair- minded man, I wish to point out to him as the  President  of the Employers Federation, the weakness of the Wages Board system. When an employé, as the representative of his fellow-workers on a. Wages Board, has to meet his employer at the table, he cannot fight against him as he might be expected to do if his bread and butter were not at stake. During the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, 1 pointed out that in some instances representatives of employés on Wages Boards had been dismissed from their service. I fail to see why a man, because he is chosen by his fellow-workers to represent them on such a body, should be dismissed by his employer ; but in one case - that of the Wages Board relating to the butchering trade - four out of five representatives of the employes lost their employment. The fifth representative was the secretary of the union, and the employers therefore had no power over him. Fortunately, those men were able to obtain other positions. </para>

                            <para>-I am glad to say that there has been some improvement in this respect, and that employers are showing, more and more a readiness to give the Wages Board system a fair trial. Perhaps, like the honorable member for Fawkner, they think that if they do not they may have something worse. The Honorable member is now prepared to support the, Wages Board system, although a few years ago the Employers' Federation, of which he is  president,  was bitterly opposed to it, and is to-day hostile; to conciliation and arbitration legislation.I believe that in nearly every industry to-day the manufacturers are prepared to give their men a fair show, and that the positions of men representing their fellow employes on Wages Boards are not jeopardized as they were a few years ago. Still, there are some who find that they cannot obtain work whilst they are members of Wages Boards. After their Boards have made their awards, and have ceased to exist, they  have experienced less difficulty in obtaining employment. Some honorable members have declared that there is no necessity for an amendment of the Constitution to provide for the new protection, because the Wages Board system is already in operation in most of the States. I have here a report of the evidence given before <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> Royal Commission in Tasmania, which  throws  an interesting light on this  subject,  and I regret that no representative of Tasmania on the Opposition side of the House is present, since I should like to show the opponents of industrial legislation from that State what were the conditions of labour there less than two years ago. </para>

                            <para>- Tha honorable member on the occasion to which I refer backed up the bogus union of the shearers, and said that the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill would be beneficial to it. I admit that some honorable members of the Opposition are not opposed to industrial legislation. Among them are the honor - able member for Dalley, who favours the new protection, and the leader of the Opposition. When  interrupted,  I was about to point out the necessity for a Wages Board system in Tasmania, and was regretting the absence from the House of some of the representatives of that State, whose political creed, I believe, is the same as that of the present Tasmanian Ministry, which has made no effort to introduce industrial legislation for the protection of the workers. The conditions prevailing in Tasmania at the time the Royal Commission took evidence were so bad that the Commissioners considered it advisable to withhold the names pf those who gave evidence. Thus, instead of the statement that " John Brown, John Jones, or John Robinson," gave evidence, we find a blank, and then the statement " was sworn and examined." I have not had time to go carefully through the evidence, but some of the examples are very striking. I have compared some of the rates paid there with those paid in Victoria under Wages Boards. Low as the rates fixed by the Wages Boards are in many cases, and handicapped as the system is by the fact that the employe has to meet his employer at the same table, and is afraid in many cases to bring forward all the facts that are within his knowledge regarding the place where he works, because his employer would ask : " What right have you to say that regarding my factory when you know that my opponent, whom I am selling against, is sitting alongside me?" - notwithstanding that weakness of the Wages Board system - the wage earners under Wages Boards in Victoria are in many cases receiving from 33 per cent, up to 50 per cent, more than is paid in Tasmania in similar industries. On page 16 of the report appears the following: - </para>

                            <para>- The Victorian Wages Board rates are quite low enough. If the New South Wales rates happened to be higher I should rejoice to find that the Minister had taken them as a basis. I always believe in giving the highest rates in the Commonwealth where Government work is concerned. I suppose some rates would be higher in Victoria than in New South </para>

To show the wages in the same industry in Victoria under a Wages Board, I have here a copy of the report of the Chief Inspector of Factories. I admit that the name " millman" is not included, but I will assume that those men are sawyers or machine workers. It does not matter what particular line you take, the lowest rate fixed in Victoria is 45s. per week, as against£1 5s. which that employer swore he was paying in Tasmania. One of the men employed at that establishment gave evidence as to the wages he received, as follows - </para>

                    <para>For the work that that man is paid£1 13s. to perform in Tasmania, a man here would receive from 48s. to 64s. a week. That, at any rate, is what the Wages Board system, even with its drawbacks, has been able to do in the way of increasing the rates of wages in Victoria. There follows the evidence of another man who was evidently in the same mill, and who was getting £1 7s. per week. I have not had time to compare the rates in other industries, which, under our Tariff, receive the same protection in Tasmania as in every other State. I have heard honorable members on the other side say that they intend to oppose any alteration of the Constitution in the direction of the new protection. If so, they must admit that they are prepared to see men engaged in industries in Tasmania paid 5s. or £110s. a week for work for which from £2 5s. to £3 per week is paid in Victoria. </para>

What manufacturer in Victoria will pay£2 5s. to £2 10s. per week when he could go to Tasmania and escape Wages Boards? I know, and so does the Postmaster-General, that when the brush-making industry was placed under a Wages Board in Victoria, one manufacturer, I think he was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mitchell,</inline> moved his factory to Tasmania..

                            <para>- It is necessary that a great deal more land should be thrown open. On many of the estates, not only at Skipton, but in the railway area between Ballarat and Ararat, down to Hamilton and Warrnambool, and thence back to Geelong, there is some of the finest land in Victoria; and yet we are told that there is less population there now than there was thirty years ago. If we eliminate Colac and Camperdown, and the mining population at Beringa and Pitfield, there is, as has been shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey</inline> from the figures of the Government Statist, less population now than there was formerly. Down at Werribee, only some twenty or twenty-two miles from Melbourne, there is a landholder, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percy</inline> Chirnside. </para>

                            <para>- I presume the valuations are made by the men employed by the shires; and as most of the large landholders have control of the shire councils, they  select officials who must keep down the valuations or go. If a shire valuer were to value the land honestly, he would know that his position was not worth very much ; I doubt whether such an official would find his position worth more than that of employes who have to meet employers on Wages Boards. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with precisely the same blocks. I admit that a piece of land in Collins-street and a piece of land in Little Lonsdale-street would have different valuations, but I am now speaking of precisely the same blocks valued by the shire official and the Water Commission. The latter body is independent and not under the control of farmers and graziers, who are members of the shire council ; and I have no doubt that the Commission's valuations are the more accurate. Honorable members know that the Victorian Taxation Commissioner has recently raised the value of many Victorian estates, having proved that they were worth more, from a taxable point of view, than they were twelve or eighteen months ago. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to deal at length with the land question ; but as the honorable member for Fawkner referred to it last night, I thought it just to show that the Victorian land laws have not conduced to settlement. There never would have been a Closer Settlement Act but for the agitation of the State Labour Party, and everything possible has been done by the other political parties to prevent land valuation. </para>

I have a letter written to the newspapers by the latter, in which he said that the statement was made as a joke. A Methodist newspaper published in this city denounced him at the time for making the statement even as a joke. When others make jokes, they have to abide bv the consequences. But although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> deliberately said that marriage was a luxury for the workers, he is still acting for the Employers' Federation, and, as far as I know, has never been reprimanded. </para>

I had not intended to deal with this matter; but as the Women's National Leagues of Australia are continually repeating the lie, it must be referred to. It was not a representative of the labouring classes who put forward the doctrine. </para>

                            <para>- The statement is continually being made to injure the Labour Party by those who supported the honorable member. The Treasurer, in his Budget, dealt with the coinage of silver. I thought that he was in favour of encouraging Australian industry, and would give opportunity for the minting of silver in Australia. If no settlement has yet been arrived at, I hope that another attempt will be made to come to a definite conclusion. The Postmaster-General, when I spoke of the Government having decided' to get the work done abroad, said that that had not  been  decided. That being so, I hope that the decision will be come to that silver shall be coined here. We should know how long the present arrangement is to last. </para>

                            <para>- We are producing far more silver than we require for currency purposes, and we ought to mint our own silver coinage. I desire now to refer to the Estimates of Expenditure. Yesterday I asked the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs whether the Public Service Commissioner had brought in an amended classification under which increased salaries were provided for all heads of Departments. I was informed in reply that it was not proposed to grant an increased salary to the heads of " all " Departments I believe that as a matter of fact about one out of nine heads of Departments is not to receive an increase - and that as they were administrative heads it was not necessary to refer to the Public Service Commissioners proposals to increase their salaries. I think, 'however, that we should learn exactly how we stand with regard to such increments. When the classification scheme was before us we found that it fixed the salaries of all heads of Departments, and it seems to me tha't the fixing of the salaries of such officers should rest  entirely  with the Public Service Commissioner. When the Public Service Bill was before this House, we decided to exempt from the Act the officers of Parliament, and in that respect I think that we made a big mistake. The officers of Parliament have as much right to be graded by the Public Service Commissioner as have any other members of the Commonwealth Service. Appropriations have to be made in respect of these increases, and we have a right to ask how far it is proposed to go. Members of the Public Service lower down the ladder have not received an increment for years, although they are serving the Commonwealth to the best of their ability. They are as much entitled to consideration as are those who happen to be in close touch with Ministers. As I pointed out on a former occasion, members of the Public Service Commissioner's staff receive special treatment, simply because their duties bring them under the immediate observation of the Commissioner.  They  are singled out for special treatment, just as honorable members might be disposed to give special' consideration to officers or to the messengers in Parliament House, because they happen to be brought into close touch with them. The principle, however, is a wrong one. The recommending of increases to heads of Departments should rest entirely with the Public Service Commissioner, and I intend <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> vote against all such increases, unless good reason is shown for granting them. We find, in the first place, that provision is made for increasing the salary of the. Secretary of the Department of External! Affairs from <inline font-style="italic">£800</inline> to ^900, and for a similar increase in the case of the Secretary to the Department of the Attorney-General.. I believe that when the  last-named  gentleman entered the service of the Commonwealth, he received a salary of ,£750 per annum. Since then his remuneration has been increased to £800 per annum, and it is now proposed to grant him a further increase of  £100  per annum. Where are these increases to stop? We have a right to hear from the Treasurer a statement on the  point,  so that we may intimate to the Government, if we think fit, that, in the event of these increases being granted, corresponding increments should be allowed Throughout the service. </para>

                    <para class="block">The minimum wage provisions of the Public Service Act were carried largely as the result of a return, which I had secured and put before the House, showing the low wages paid in some branches of the service. The minimum wage is only <inline font-style="italic">£no</inline> per annum, or 7s. per day. Those who receive that wage, so far as I am aware, are not to have an increase, but the men on top of the ladder are to have a big advance on their former salaries. I trust that the Treasurer will be able to give the Committee information regarding the work done by these officers, so that we shall not have to vote in the dark. I hope also that he will supply some information with regard to the coinage of silver in Australia. If an agreement has been entered into with the British Government, we ought to be made familiar with its terms, so that we may be able, if necessary, to take steps to have the minting of silver carried out in Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to make a personal explanation in reply to certain remarks made by the honorable member who has just resumed his seat. As- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> is not a member of this House he cannot defend himself here, and, believing that the honorable member for Yarra is a fair-minded man, I wish to say that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> was first accused of making certain remarks about the Labour Party, and the marriage tie, he vigorously denied the statement attributed to him. The evidence, including that of the Methodist clergyman .referred to, so far as I have been able to gather, is entirely in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole's</inline> assertion that he made no such statement. I make this explanation, because, although the statement attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> is alleged to have been made by him nearly ten years ago, and has been denied by him again and again- </para>

                        <para>- - The debate during Friday and yesterday took a somewhat unusual turn. Instead of discussing the Budget, we appear now to be considering the social structure of the universe; and I do not mind taking part in such a discussion for a few minutes  this afternoon. It may be that now that the recent danger has passed, honorable members breathe a little more freely. We have listened, at all events, to a series of speeches from the Labour corner that have been far removed from the Budget, but have been none the less interesting. Honorable members of the Labour Party have hurled at honorable members on this side of the House - as they have done many times before - almost every conceivable kind of epithet that would denominate them as reactionaries to all social progress.. </para>

I do not intend to allow to go by the board all the statements that were made in the heat of debate by the Prime Minister and honorable members who support him in reference to the Opposition. I do not believe that I am associated either with a party of social wreckage or with a party of social reactionaries. I have not the slightest intention of permitting myself to be so labelled by men whom I regard as pursuing paths that are inimical to ultimate social progress, or by those who are, in my judgment, the enemies of the best interests of the very men whom they profess to represent here. </para>

I do not seek outside for justification of my reply On Thursday, we had the leader of the Labour Party, followed on Friday by one of his most brilliant henchmen - the honorable member for Kalgoorlie - urging that we, on this side, believed in the doctrines that Malthus propagated. I should like, in passing, to congratulate the honorable member for Kalgoorlie on the speech that lie made. I disagreed with many of the sentiments expressed by him, but his address was a valuable contribution to the debate. There were, however, one or two passages in his speech that impaired the effect of the whole. One of them was the statement from Malthus that he read to the House in support of the allegation of his leader that we, on this side, believed in the doctrines of that writer. </para>

                            <para>- I repudiate that statement. I hold that so far from individualism pointing in any such direction, there can be no real progressive constructive individualism until we have, so to speak, knocked Malthusianism on the head. What is the doctrine of Malthus? Simply that there is not enough food on the globe for the population that might possibly be born. Every one knows at this time of day that such a doctrine is obsolescent. And by-the-bye, Malthus was not the author of it; he merely crystallized the teaching of men born thousands of years before him. Plato taught it, and all down the ages there have been exponents of what I do not hesitate to describe as the same devilish doctrine. If honorable members will refer back to Hume, Franklin, and other philosophers of the same type, they will find that they were the real authors of Malthusianism. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. My point is that in disproving Malthus, you open the way for a constructive individualism - a competition and struggle which pushes a nation up rather than drags it down. The first of our tenets is a repudiation of any such doctrine as Malthus taught, and we certainly stand for the stripping from the policy which we believe to be at the base of all human progress of any such inhuman and degrading attributes as those with which the honorable member sought to clothe it. I believe there is a constructive competition as well as a destructive one, and it is for that constructive side of individualism that I, at any rate, stand, as I believe do the majority of those who are with me on this side of the House. If such a charge as was made by the honorable member could lie against any section of the House - and I do not say it can - it would more properly lie against my friends in the Ministerial corner. For of all the distorted statements of this same doctrine commend me to an article, published in the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> of Sydney, on Thursday last, by a gentleman named H. Ingemann. </para>

I think that every name in their vocabulary has been applied to me, and so it does not much matter whether another epithet or two is added. In the first place, what do these men, or these honorable members, agree upon? I had better use the word "men," because this gentleman is not a member of Parliament yet, although there is hope for him to become one, as the result of writing this series of articles. It is only fair to say that fie begins with human nature. One cannot begin on a better basis, but I am bound to say that my honorable friends often leave it out of account. When they soar aloft into the vague Empyrean, building their beautiful castles in the air, all of which they surmise may be realised at some time of day, I am afraid' they leave human nature struggling on the earth as they fly.

                            <para>- I will tell the honorable member what I am doing. I am inquiring whither I am to go for the authority for statements made by honorable members opposite. Will they take this authoritative essay, styled and boomed throughout Australia as" The Rising Tide," in their organ, or the statement for labour by one of their members in this chamber? The two are in direct conflict. Remember always that this is a fundamental and far-reaching conflict. If human nature is changeless, or practically changeless, my honorable friends may be sure that this same old human nature will pull down many of the airy castles that they propose to build. If it is a changeable factor there is another answer to be made, to the effect that its results have been pretty uniform throughout all the years of the past. </para>

That brings me to another statement to which I take strong exception. After stating in his own way the doctrine of Darwinism, on which he proposes to base his whole scheme - I have no fault to find with his definition of Darwinism, except that he leaves out some material points, although, so far as he states it, it is correct - he deduces from that law the following :  - </para>

We see that man's moral character is inspired by natural demand and necessity. For this reason it is clear that there can be no absolute morality. </para>

                    <para class="block">I take strong exception to that doctrine. It is not in accordance with the ethical teachings of our time, or with the views of some of the best Socialists of to-day.

He had better denounce that; not denounce us. We repudiate a doctrine of that kind as applying to Japan or anywhere else. We say it is a ghoulish doctrine. </para>

                            <para>- It is not my object to attempt to tie honorable members opposite to these statements. I am simply speaking in reply. We on this side of the House have been saddled with this kind- of belief, and I am merely pointing out that if that doctrine is supported anywhere in this House, the Labour corner is the home in which it might most probably be found, according to the statement of their own essayist. </para>

                            <para>-  His  name is Ingemann, and his exposition is not of Continental Socialism, but of Australian Socialism. If the honorable member does not know anything about the gentleman I have no doubt that, on application in the proper quarter, he will get all information. The writer makes a number of other statements to which I cannot subscribe, because I do not believe that they are correct. Of course, he lays every evil under the sun almost at the door of our present industrial system ; showing how that system is ramifying through the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the community, and undermining character and moral qualities of every kind. </para>

                            <para>- That is what I was wondering on Thursday and Friday last. If it had not been sought to introduce these matters into the political arena and to fasten charges on honorable members on this side, there would have been heard no word from me in reply. But these statements trip off the tongue almost daily, and they will be believed unless there is an answer to the contrary-. I desire to say, once and for all, that, so far as I know, honorable members on this side of the House would repudiate any such ghoulish doctrines, so contrary to fact. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member need not talk like that, because I have had -as hard a time, and possibly a great deal harder time, than he has had. I should be very sorry if I thought I was placing anything in the way of the legitimate aspirations of the working men of Australia. But I do not say that to believe in the uplifting of those at the bottom in the industrial scale, it is necessary to indulge in painting our civilization in the blackest of all paints, in the wa,y so characteristic of my friends in the Labour corner. We are all going in the same direction - we all desire to help those at the bottom, but in these later days, the Labour Party are developing the idea that the only way to help the man at the bottom is to pull down the man at the top. After all, we must remember that the few at the top - battening and luxurious as they may be - even if they are all that Upton Sinclair has said of them - do not prove that the way I have just indicated is the best to  assist the man at the bottom. In regard to the criticism offered on honorable members on this side, and referred to again by innuendo to-day by the Secretary of the Labour Party, I should like to say that whatever statements have been made by those who support us such statements can be matched and over-matched by statements from men who vote for the Labour Party. These absurd, totally unnecessary, and unjust statements regarding designs on the home, are being made as freely to-day as ever they were, not by theoretical Socialists like Karl Marx, but by men who advocate the political Socialism of to-day. Such statements are still being ma.de throughout the Continent of Europe, as is shown by the magazines which lie about the tables in the Library of this House. Honorable members who desire to know the facts, have only to refer to such periodicals in order to ascertain that the Socialists of the Continent advocate these theories every day of their lives. For myself, I dismiss that kind of argumentation ; it is not worth while, and I should not have troubled myself if suggestions had not been made as to the attitude and sympathies of men with whom I am associated. If honorable members opposite desire to repudiate that kind of sentiment, they need not bother honorable members who sit with me, but should turn their attention to the utterances of those who are supposed to have the same international aims as have many of the men who support the Labour ' movement in Australia. I have already referred to Malthusianism, which was quoted, and enforced, by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie on Friday. I am aware that, in the newer school of economists, there has been evolved a theory, namely, that the struggle for existence is no longer an individual struggle, but has become a corporate struggle, and that, therefore, to Socialism, as an expression of the corporate sense, we may subscribe as an engine of progress. That doctrine has been stated clearly by such writers as Benjamin Kidd, and, I think, most beautifully of all, by Professor Henry Drummond, in his <inline font-style="italic">Ascent of Man.</inline> I regard that book, from its literary side alone, as worth reading by any man, and I am bound to say that I subscribe to some of the tenets to which he gives such unique and admirable expression. There is one factor which my honorable friends, in quoting these economists, nearly always leave out of sight. No writer emphasizes  it so clearly and decisively as does Henry Drummond. It is that, lying at the root of the corporate struggle for existence, is the principle of sacrifice, of self-suppression, of self-abnegation. Drummond illustrates this very beautifully by pointing out that the lovely blossoms of the fruit '.ree die in order that fruit may be produced, and the species propagated. It is the law of the tree, and the law of life, that there can be no progress without sacrifice. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that the workers in some cases make an undue sacrifice, one which should not be expected of them, but which will lessen as the world becomes more enlightened. I have no word to say against those referred to by the honorable member. We must try to lift them up from the bottom. But there is a radical difference between the ways in which it is proposed that this should be done. Stripped of the ghoulish doctrine of Malthus, the law of struggle, as stated by Henry Drummond, Benjamin Kidd, and other writers,, is constructive in its nature. Competition is no longer regarded as inherently hellish and tigerish, a thing of tooth and claw; it has its constructive side, and is needed to lift up the race to higher ideals, and to push it forward to greater prosperity, peace, and permanence. It is the constructive side of the competitive struggle that we feel it our duty to emphasize, since the members of the Labour Party nearly always leave it out of account. We must, from time to time, in debating the questions which come before us, go down to the fundamental principles of progress. The conditions of employment must be discussed with reference to the principles of personal freedom ; not necessarily freedom to amass millions of money, and to oppress one's fellows, but freedom to use one's powers of initiative, and one's God-given intelligence to better one's own position, as one betters the world around him. All these questions must, in the last resort, be settled, if they are to be settled at all, by taking into account the principle of personal freedom. For instance, the existence of trusts, although a mighty, ever-pressing and menacing problem, must be considered in the light of the principle of freedom for voluntary combination). We must not, to stamp out trusts, destroy this right to combine. My honorable friends would abolish trusts by nationalizing industries, but I do not think that that would make things better. I especially commend to those who have not seen them, a series of articles which recently appeared in the' <inline font-style="italic">British Weekly,</inline> in which is set out the very latest word on Socialism and Collectivism. The best and most practical socialistic writers of to-day have come to the conclusion that under Socialism there will not be much more comfort and luxury for the working classes than there is now. </para>

                            <para>- An Italian Socialist has come to much the same conclusion ; and so, too, has M.  Renard,  a French Socialist. Socialism, to-day, is taking upon itself a soberer garb. Karl Marx has been put overboard. If its writers keep on their present course, they will soon cease to inspire the extravagant hopes which, in days gone by, did so much to account for the success of their propaganda. The question of employment must always be considered in relation to personal characteristics, which are in their essence moral, and lie at the root of all human progress. Initiative, personal freedom, the relation of reward to. 'the quality and volume of the service rendered, these and other factors must be considered in regard to State employment. Although it is a truth which my honorable friends put in the background, we must recognise, if we are to be honest in the discussion of the social question, that some of our inferiority is accounted for by lack of character, defective moral fibre, want of ability, ignorance, intemperance, and improvidence. I do not say that these are not due in part to adverse environment, but I say emphatically that, however favorable the environment, they will not necessarily disappear. </para>

                            <para>- The latest socialistic writers confess that  they  do not yet know what to do with the lazy man, and there are many other questions which they have not solved. The further their doctrines are probed, the more they are found to be merely the expression of admirable sentiments, with no scheme behind them. They have nothing but shifting expedients, which vary with time and place. In other words, Socialism is a cry for something better by those who do not know precisely what would be better ; and I take exception to this want of definiteness. I am not prepared to throw overboard all that is worth keeping in our civilization until I know what we are to get in exchange. </para>

                            <para>- Capitalism, for one thing. The members of that party describe capitalism as an upas tree, which must be uprooted and destroyed. I admit that on its bark are many blotches and many pests; but I say, cleanse it, and make it bear the fruit that it should produce, instead of cutting it down in the belief that it is merely cumbering the ground. My honorable friends see the barnacles on the hull of the ship of State, and say, " The vessel is rotten. Throw her. on the scrap heap, and build a new one." But wisdom dictates that we should strip off the barnacles, and still trust our fortunes to the old ship, which has ridden so many storms, and served us so well for so long, letting her bear us proudly to our destiny. I had not intended to make these extended references to Socialism, but I thought it worth while to repudiate the statements of honorable members opposite, and particularly that of the Prime Minister, that ours is a party composed of the wreckage of political beliefs. He said, amongst other things, that we contain the wreckage of the black labour party. My reply is that one of my first actions in this Parliament was to move an amendment to the first Address-in-Reply, declaring that the white labour proposals of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, and the honorable member for Hume, were not satisfactory. Whatever wreckage there may be on this side, there is no wreckage of self-respect. Whatever we may have forfeited as a party, we have not lost our self-respect, nor trailed our political reputations in the dust, as the honorable gentleman opposite has done. The Treasurer likes the dust. He has bitten it many a time, and does not mind it. I desire to make the truth appear, and therefore I have taken the trouble to repudiate some of the statements which have been made during this debate. A great deal has to be done before everything can be said to be fight from an industrial and social point of view. At present, social wrongs need » righting, and the industrial pyramid may begin to rock and quake at its base unless the unappeased  misery that ramifies throughout this modern world of ours can be alleviated and ameliorated by some action, State or otherwise. But we must not confuse the troubles of society with the structure of society itself. We must not confound those accretions that have gradually grown about our social structure with the belief that the social structure itself is rotten and insecure. I do not believe that it is, and, therefore, I say let us deal with all these problems. Let us regulate our trusts, control them, clip their wings, prevent them from doing damage, but do not let us debar individuals  from  voluntary combinations of a constructive and beneficial kind. And so with almost every other aspect of our social problems. There is a right and a wrong way of dealing with them, and I believe that my honorable friends in the Labour Corner are wasting much valuable time in preaching the panaceas they do. The troubles of society are keen enough and deep enough to merit all our sympathy and our desire to assist in their betterment. Instead of realizing that, however, the Labour Party call names. That is what their propaganda consists of nowadays. They abuse " the other fellow," who does not see eye to eye with them as to the precise means that should be taken to deal with this terribly complex problem. Instead of doing as they are doing - instead of desiring to uproot the whole social structure - they should join hands with us in an effort to uproot those evils that have grown round it, and which are|, undoubtedly, impeding its progress to-day. I subscribe almost entirely to a statement as to the difference between Socialism and Liberalism, which was made at Dundee recently by that brilliant young statesman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winston</inline> Churchill. The Socialists there were opposing him tooth and nail, and making every effort to prevent his return to the House of Commons. Here is what he said - </para>

                    <para class="block">That very accurately sums up the essential differences between a liberal and constructive programme, and that advocated, and sought to be furthered by the Labour Party, who believe in the brotherhood of man. It is after all a difference of method. Broadly speaking, we both seek the same object. We desire to see society elevated and purified, so that men who wish to work honestly for their sustenance will have every opportunity to do so, and having done so, will be guaranteed the right to a life of decency, comfort, and well-being. In that, we have a common aim with them, but we do not believe that the destructive principles which they preach and propagate will bring about such a result. On the contrary, we believe that such principles will tend in the end to accentuate the very evils from which they now desire to escape. There are some matters connected with the Budget to which I had intended to refer, but I shall content myself with a reference to only one of them. I should not mention it, but that it has been dealt with very vaguely by the Treasurer, and I should like it to be cleared up. It has to do with the severance of the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth, and particularly with the taking over of the States debts. The Treasurer, in delivering the Budget, made a. statement which was repeated almost word for word by the Prime Minister during the debate on the censure motion. The statement was - </para>

                    <para> I do not know why they should be brought into this calculation- £990,000; total, £10,680,000. To place themselves in the position which the Commonwealth Treasurer offers to place them in-r-that is, of being relieved of their debts, now totalling £247,974,624, in thirty-five years - an annual payment to Sinking Fund, accumulating at 3 per cent, interest, would be necessary of ^4,101,000. Deducting the amount now paid to» Sinking Fund by the States, £800,000, £3,301,000 is left. So that they would pay in all £13,981,000. </para>

I desire to know what is meant by that statement. Does the Treasurer suggest that if we took over the debts of the States we should begin to incur that liability ? In round numbers, he offers to relieve the States of a payment of £14,000,000 on account of their debts and the item of old-age pensions. Are we to understand from this that the honorable gentleman proposes at once to undertake a payment of this kind on behalf of the Commonwealth ? </para>

                            <para>- I understand the honorable member's figures to this extent - that they are a piece of bluff, and nothing else, to the States. There is really to be no relief. It is only a make-believe, and the honorable member is disingenuous when he puts forth such a statement. I should have said nothing about it, had the Prime Minister not emphasized the point in his speech the other night. He repeated the Treasurer's statement, and took care to say that if sinking funds were established in all the States, to the extent that they are established now in some, a payment of £4,000,000 sterling per annum for a sinking fund would have to be made. Now, the Treasurer tells us that there is not going to be any such payment. </para>

                            <para>- I protest against this kind of reckless statement being made to the States, which, on being sifted, means nothing. The Government are going to relieve the State, maybe; but while they relieve the taxpayers of the States in that direction they put the same burden on them through the Federal medium, and so it must go on, not for thirty-five years, but for from sixty-five to eighty years, which, I believe, was the broad statement made by the Treasurer. </para>

Judging by the way he is going, he will need to make the money fly by that time, for his obligations are piling up at an alarming rate. He now wants£1, 000,000 extra with which to finance his old-age pensions scheme. </para>

                            <para>- No money was needed until a return had been made from the Federal Customs revenue. That is how the honorable member financed old-age pensions in New South Wales, and he need not try to make this audience believe anything to the contrary, because we know the facts. My leader baited the honorable member night after night as to where the money was to come from, but the honorable member did not care. There was no money when the Act was passed, and immediately afterwards the honorable member left State politics. The money to pay the pensions came, as I said, from the Federal Customs [revenues. Now the honorable member is doing the same thing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Waddell</inline> says that the Commonwealth pensions scheme will cost £2,200,000 per annum. </para>

                            <para>- All will depend upon the administration. The honorable member need not pay ' half as much as is being paid in New South Wales; if he likes he can starve the poor old people after entering into an obligation to pay them, but it would not be honest, fair, or human. Does the honorable member believe that the Government of New South Wales are wasting that ,£150,000? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knows absolutely nothing about it, or he would not make statements of that kind. I know hundreds of people in New South Wales who are praying for the Commonwealth pension scheme to come into operation as speedily as possible, so that they may obtain pensions . to which they are morally, and now, I am glad <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> say, legally, entitled. The honorable member will find when he comes to make the payments that there will not be £150,000 less, but in all probability nearer £150,000 more, to find for New South Wales. The Prime Minister declared the other night that we had passed an Old-age Pensions Act which was very much more liberal and broad than that of any of the States. If, therefore, we have passed a measure that is to be more liberal than that of New South Wales, how is it to be financed for a paltry £1,200,000 a year? The honorable member is no miracle worker. He may be a verbal juggler, as the Prime Minister is, but, that will not find the money. The money is not in existence. I am entitled, therefore, to say that the honorable member needs another million pounds to finance his old-age pensions scheme, and he wants £600,000 more for the Government's new defence scheme. We voted this year about £1,100,000. The new scheme is to cost £1,700,000. Here again, by some species of legerdemain, which is a peculiar attribute of the Prime Minister, he tells us that only £200,000 more is required to finance the new scheme. We are paying £1,100,000 now; the new scheme is to cost £1,700,000, and the Prime Minister says there is a difference of only £200,000 ! Of course, the trick that the Prime Minister has played on the House is by dragging in the amount paid into the trust fund last year for naval defence. By the way, that item of £250,000 is wrongly stated in the Estimates. It is for no part of our land defence. I take harbor and coastal defence to be part of our naval defence. Why, then, is that money included in the Estimates under land defence? </para>

                            <para>- It was voted last year, and the Estimates were debited with it. That brought the total for defence last year to considerably over .£1,400,000. That is how the Prime Minister works his financial trick to show that we want only another £200,000 for the new defence scheme. </para>

                            <para>- I shall leave that point and allow myself to be sidetracked by the Treasurer's statement that the trust funds are bearing interest. We have, I believe, about £666,000 in the trust funds. In the year 1906-7, £150,000 was placed to a trust account, and the next year £165,000. I cannot find that either of these funds has ever earned a copper of interest through the whole of those two years. Here is a man who is supposed fo be husbanding our money and looking after our resources, yet for two years large sums of money are allowed to earn no interest. </para>

                            <para>- I am simply quoting statements furnished by the Treasurer to the House. In 1907 a sum of £[150,000 did not earn a copper of interest, and to-day there is £666,000 in the Trust Funds, and, up to three months ago, only £[53,000 of that was earning interest. </para>

                            <para>- I did desire to make a statement as to what is to be done after 1910, but that matter can wait until we have definite proposals before us. In the meantime, I protest as strongly as I am able against what I regard as the anti-State note which pervades the whole of the Budget statement. There is no reason that I know of why we should be constantly girding at the States in the effort to keep our own house in order. The States have their rights, as much as we have. </para>

The Braddon clause will have expired, if we so determine, but there will still be the obligation on this Parliament to do what is just and fair by the States, and that obligation will not be removed in the slightest degree. In the meantime the Treasurer should stop this girding at the States, which cannot help in the adoption of a satisfactory scheme for the future. I confess that if I were in the position of some of the States Treasurers, I should decline to be talked to as the Treasurer talks to them. I should prefer to trust the good sense of the electors and people of Australia, rather than be talked to as the Treasurer has been talking to the States Treasurers lately </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I say I should not be disposed to discuss matters amicably with the Treasurer if he were constantly girding at me behind my back. The States have a right to reasonable treatment. We must remember that, after all, the Commonwealth is not an entity cut off from all relationship to the States;' and that after  1  9  10  we are trustees of the States, so far as the Customs and Excise revenue is concerned, and also so far as a great part of the States income, on which they depend to keep them solvent, is concerned. We cannot rid ourselves of the trusteeship, and we ought not to try. I, therefore, hope that the Treasurer will , sing a different tune in the near future, so that we may get to close grips, and that the States may discuss with us, in an amicable way, the best means of solving an intricate question in a form satisfactory to all concerned. </para>

The honorable member opened, I think, by calling attention to the curious turn the debate on finance has' taken, deprecating it, and, by some strange process of logic, that seemed to be charming only in its absurdity, he proceeded at once to make the debate still more curious by dragging into it a phase that hitherto had been absent. The latter part of his remarks seemed to have taken the form of, probably to him, an interesting dialogue with the Treasurer. If I were permitted to use the language of yesterday, I should say that it was an interesting dialogue between two sly "old dogs"; but, as that would be unparliamentary, I must not say it. At any rate, if my reading of the temper of the House be correct, there did not seem to be much interest in the latter portion of the honorable member's remarks, or, at any rate, in the dialogue which he carried on so lengthily with the Treasurer. For present theatrical effect it might have been better had the honorable member for Parramatta kept the first part of his speech to the end ; but, with that cleverness with which we must credit him, the theatrical effect was altogether ignored in the desire to impress a section of the outside world, who will ic him the honour of reading his remarks. </para>

                            <para>- It may not have been the honorable member's intention - I give him credit for that - but that was the effect of his remarks. More particularly would that have been the outcome of his utterance, but that some of us were able to point to the curious method the honorable member was adopting, and to the fact that he was quoting, only in part, the statements of a practically unknown writer, and endeavouring, not merely to fix the responsibility on the Labour Party, but to charge that party with subscribing to the doctrines mentioned. We were treated to a carefully-prepared little essay on the Labour Party and the evil effects of their policy and professions - the honorable member was careful to use the word " professions " - on the national interests. The honorable member endeavoured to show that we were really the worst enemies of that section of the community whom Labour members are generally supposed to represent. It is curious that, when challenged, the honorable member could name only two points, neither of which appear on the platform of the Labour Party, and to neither of which at any rate I personally subscribe. I should like to say that these few words in reply are not offered on behalf of the Labour Party, but only on behalf of myself as a member of that party. I regard it as necessary, at any rate as concerns myself, that the statements of the honorable member should be repudiated in no unmeasured terms, and that, if possible, in the same copy of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as that containing the honorable member's speech, the repudiation may appear. I am glad to say that the honorable member now declares that he had no intention to injure the Labour Party ; but, nevertheless, it should be shown that his remarks regarding the party have not been allowed to pass without reply. As I say, the honorable member referred to two points, neither of which appears in the programme, policy, or methods of the Labour Party ; and if I may, for the occasion, alter a few lines of Elliot,. I would say - </para>

I have stated that I am speaking for, not the party, but myself, and I have said merely that the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> is not the organ of the Labour Party. There has been no repudiation. I am glad to have the honorable member's admission that his -opening remarks were incorrect. It may reasonably be supposed that his arguments, having been based on incorrect premises, must fall to the ground. The foundation being unstable, the superstructure, when touched by the zephyr breath of truth, must fall. </para>

                            <para>- I have not read the previous issue; but there is nothing in the article justifying the conclusion of the honorable member for Parramatta that it is published with editorial approval, and sets forth the doctrines of the Labour Party. He quoted only selected sentences from that article- He asserted that the members of his party had been charged with standing behind the doctrines of Malthus and other monstrosities which have been put forward at various times to injure political parties, and proceeded to hit back at the Labour Party by charging it with subscribing to what he properly called these " ghoulish and devilish doctrines." He said that the writer of this article subscribed to those doctrines, that he is a Labourite, that he was writing on behalf of the Labour Party, and that, consequently, every member of the Labour Party was bound by what he said. Nothing could be meaner than this attempt to saddle me, a member of the party, with the doctrines  which  the honorable member described in such appropriate terms. But not one of his statements referring to the Labour Party's aims as inimical to the interests of the community will bear investigation. That is not the worst. The members of the party can state here their own views, if they feel disposed to do so; but the writer of this article cannot. I charge the honorable member with quoting only passages from the article, for purposes which he has not made public.  His  attempt to saddle tha editor with the doctrines and teachings of the article was deliberate; but I have now been furnished with a copy of the issue of the 8th October, in which, in an explanatory note, the editor says - </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member deliberately charged the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> with approving of these articles. He said that they were put forward with editorial approval, and committed, not merely the <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> but the Labour Party. There is no need to read further. I have clearly proved that the statement which the honorable member made was built upon a foundation that will not bear much investigation. And to what, after all, does his argument amount? The honorable member attempted to saddle me, as a Labour member, and Labour members in general, with subscribing to what he called the " devilish doctrines " of Malthus. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member, for a reason that has my approval, deliberately refrained from reading the closing words of the paragraph. But, having read these lines, he charged the writer of the article with subscribing to a certain doctrine. Having a copy of the paper before me at the time, I challenged him with not having deduced the right inference from the particular portion of the article that he quoted. In the next paragraph but one, the writer himself refers to that doctrine as an immoral one. Could anything show more clearly that the writer himself does not subscribe to it? Could anything be more wicked, under the circumstances, than the attempt of the honorable member for Parramatta to charge the writer - having failed in a similar attack on the Labour Party - with subscribing to a doctrine which in this very article he repudiates as immoral ? The writer goes even further, and makes, with evident approval, two quotations from Darwin, which show conclusively, if further proof is necessary, that the honorable member for Parramatta went out of his way to do injury in a direction where he ought to be seeking to do good. This is what the writer quotes from Darwin, with the greatest possible approval - " Looking to future generations," says Darwin, " there is no cause to fear that the social instincts will grow weaker, and we may expect that virtuous habits will grow stronger, becoming fixed by inheritance. In this case the struggle between our higher and lower impulses will be less severe and virtue will be triumphant." </para>

Then the writer goes on to use a still stronger quotation from <inline font-style="italic">Darwin -</inline></para>

I do not know that I need trouble honorable members with any further remarks on this subject. It seemed to me, however, that some reply should be made to the statements made by the honorable member for Parramatta. The honorable member also charged the Labour Party with standing behind a policy that was inimical to the interests of Australia. It is very easy to make such a general statement, but it is not easy to build it up by substantial facts. The Labour Party have, at all events, a policy that does not contain any of the fearful doctrines that the honorable member alleges it does include. </para>

He sought to injure the party b\ urging against us a belief in doctrines to which we do not subscribe, and in attributing to us sentiments that we have repudiated time after time. </para>

                        <para>.- Although we are not all in agreement as to the details of the Budget, we might cordially congratulate the Parliament and people of Australia upon the great advances that have been made during the period of Federation. While it is our duty to criticise adversely any signs of extravagance or unjustifiable expenditure, we, as the Federal Parliament, should take every available opportunity to place the true facts before the people, and to express our faith in our Federation. The revenue, as disclosed by the Budget, has increased from £11,296,985, in 1901, to £15,015,789, in 1908. That is a very substantial increase. The Customs and Excise revenue has risen from £8,894,000, in 1901, to £11,645,000, in 1908. Of the total increase of revenue the Post and Telegraph Department is responsible for nearly £1,000,000. Last year the increase in Customs revenue was £2,013,000, or nearly £1,000,000 over the estimate. The expenditure on the Post and Telegraph Department, in 1907-8, was , £3,297,000, or slightly above the revenue, but we must deduct £429,000 set apart for new works and buildings. Even including that amount, the total loss on the Department last year would not come to more than the extra sum paid to the railways for the carriage of mails. A business department of such rapid growth and great magnitude, that can earn a profit of over £400,000 in one year, should not be allowed by this Parliament to retrograde, and certainly should not be starved in the matter of new postal services or the provision of suitable buildings for the conduct of its business throughout the Commonwealth. While the increase of expenditure has been great, the earnings have also been great. In 1901 the total expenditure of the Commonwealth was £3,733,000. In 1908 it was £6,158,000. That shows an increase in Commonwealth expenditure of £2,425,000, most of which is accounted for by an increase of nearly £1,000,000 in the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department, and of £500,000 on defence, the latter sum including £250,000 placed to the Harbors Defence Trust Fund. In those two items there is an increase of expenditure of £1,500,000. The sugar bounty accounts for an increase of expenditure of nearly £600,000. Consequently those three items alone account for an increased expenditure of £2,100,000 out of the total increase of £2,425,000. The other increases are mainly £30,000 for External Affairs, and that Department has increased its administrative expenditure on account of Papua; £32,000 for the Attorney-General's Department, which covers the High Court; and £48,000 for Home Affairs, which is largely the result of the supervision of the erection of new buildings. Consequently  the whole of the new expenditure that should be debited to the Commonwealth does not amount at the outside to more than £300,000, or about the sum that was put down as the cost of Federation during the Convention debates. Last year, notwithstanding the passage of the Surplus Revenue Bill, the States received £331,000 more than the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they were entitled. This made a total of £6,058,000 paid to the States in excess of their three-fourths share. The Treasurer's estimate of revenue for the present financial year is £14,577,000, as against an actual revenue of £15,015,000 last year, or an estimated reduction of £438,000. The Treasurer anticipates a decrease of £600,000 in the Customs and Excise revenue. On whether the Treasurer's estimate of revenue will be exceeded or not will depend any extra amount to be set apart for 'new services, particularly in the Post and Telegraph Department. I do not think that the big reduction anticipated in the Customs and Excise revenue will take place. With our increasing consumption, and a population which I hope to see growing, our revenue from that source is not likely to diminish. By the old Victorian Tariff, under which Only <inline font-style="italic">about</inline> one-third of the items were dutiable, a Customs revenue of about £2 per head was collected. The present Federal Tariff makes about two-thirds of the items dutiable, and yet we anticipate an increase of only about 12s. 6d. per head. Consequently, I hardly think that there will be a very large reduction in Customs and Excise revenue in the future. Whilst we are making such rapid progress In the expansion of our Commonwealth affairs, a total increase of £354,000 for all services, such as is proposed this year, seems altogether inadequate. I can see no reasonable possibility, under present circumstances, of the additional money being derived in order to' provide the absolutely necessary new services out of revenue, unless there is to be a large increase on the Treasurer's estimate. The only solution is for the Commonwealth Parliament to enter the market and borrow the money. According to estimates made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hesketh,</inline> the Chief Electrical Engineer, we require £700,000 or £800,000 straight away to bring the postal and telephonic services reasonably near the requirements of the public. A very large proportion of that would be expended in reproductive works. I do not propose that we should enter the money market and raise short-dated loans for the money to be expended on ordinary services. The whole of it should be devoted to reproductive works in the shape of post-office buildings, and telephonic connexions which are known to be thoroughly sound and profitable business investments. The Treasurer, in delivering his Budget, mentioned that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner's proposal in 1902 to float a loan of £500,000 to carry out certain works was repudiated by Parliament. But there is no parallel between the conditions of 1.902 and those of the present day. At that time large sums of money were being handed back out of the Commonwealth's quarter of the Customs and Excise revenue to the States, and to have raised a loan in those circumstances would have been unsound financing. But under present conditions we have reached the limit in expenditure of our one-fourth, so that the need for a loan for reproductive purposes exists now where it did not exist then. I can quite understand the hesitation of the Government to bring down a proposal to borrow sufficient money to bring the postal and telephonic services up to date, because the policy of the Labour Party is against borrowing. That party advocate the imposition of a land tax to raise all the revenue required for the Commonwealth for several years to come. They are quite within their rights in advocating that policy. </para>

                            <para>- It is, much in the same way as the burglar possesses himself of other people's property. While the imposition of a land tax would raise revenue, I am satisfied that it would not have the ulterior effect that its advocates anticipate. The imposition of a land tax sufficiently heavy to sweat down land values would, I  admit, cause the owners of land to subdivide and sell it. But the result, according to experience in Victoria, is that the land does not become distributed amongst the class whom the Labour Party are anxious to serve - those people who have no capital. The result is merely that large estates are cut up and distributed amongst a sort of middle class, consisting largely of those who are already farmers. There is only one straightforward, honest method of acquiring land for closer settlement; and that is for the Government to go into the open market, and purchase it at a reasonable value. The Government have power to provide for compulsory purchase. </para>

                            <para>- I favour the principle of the Victorian Act which allows a man only one block, thus absolutely preventing any accumulation. "Under that Act a man cannot traffic with the land, seeing that there is the condition of perpetual residence. As an example of the " padding " by which we were cajoled we had that paragraph in the speech of the Governor-General, which states that the Government have in view the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau, and the encouragement of immigration. I admit that some real attempt has been made to establish a very necessary Agricultural Bureau; and this is certainly a matter which should be taken in hand at an early date so that our productions may be sent to the Old Country bearing an Australian brand ; and, further, I hope that, simultaneously, there will be appointed a High Commissioner to see that due effect is. given to the institution. </para>

                            <para>- So I understand, although we have been promised the High Commissioner over and over again. The honorable member for Parramatta, in one of the ablest, most erudite and searching speeches I have had the privilege of listening to in this Chamber, has shown the absolute unreliability of the Treasurer's estimate in regard 'ito old-age pensions. On the Treasurer's own figures, old-age pensions will this year cost, in New South Wales, about £[590,000. </para>

                            <para>- Then, the Commonwealth Statist is wrong; and I can only say that I have appealed to the highest authority. However, assuming that the figures are correct, it is only reasonable to suppose that, if there are certain restrictions in the Commonwealth Act, the people passing over the borders, who have not te undergo the residence test, will more than make up for any little discrepancy as compared with the results of the New South Wales legislation. According to the Commonwealth Statist, the cost of old-age pensions will be. ,£1.580,000, and, until I am furnished figures, on an equally sound basis, I must accept that estimate. I should now like to refer to the Pacific Cable, on which there is a loss of £18,000 a year. The Treasurer has told us that negotiations are taking place in the Old Country as to the possibility of further popularizing this means of communication ; but he has not explained what those means are. I suppose, however, we shall have the information when we are discussing the details of the Estimates. Last night, there was circulated a paper dealing with the question of new protection. An amendment of the Constitution is proposed, in order that certain industries which enjoy protective ' duties may be brought under legislative control by the Commonwealth. I fail to see, however, any reason for laying this memorandum or paper before us at this particular stage in our history, unless, as usual, pressure has been brought to bear on the Government by the Labour Party.

                            <para>- It is temporizing or befooling the members of the Labour Party, at any rate, it is deceiving the House. Of course, these little acts to stave off the evil day - those little baits held out to the Labour Party - we can readily understand, seeing that on the Labour Party the Government depend for their existence. In the course of this afternoon, the honorable member for Yarra made some reference to the valuations in connexion with the land tax. I should like to say, in justice to the municipalities, whom he attacked very virulently, that the valuations made have no relevance to legislation, either by the States or Federal Parliaments. The municipalities have the complete auton'omous power to make their own valuations ; and these they make only in order to raise sufficient revenue to enable them to meet their anticipated expenditure. They may either have a high valuation at a low rate, or a lew valuation at a high rate, so long as they raise sufficient revenue for their purposes. Under the circumstances the attack was uncalled for. I should like again to emphasize the need for a sufficient expenditure upon urgent and necessary improvements in the services of the Department of the Postmaster-General. The Government should provide money for this purpose, and should be careful to prevent its expenditure on any but sound reproductive works. I do not propose that money should be borrowed by means of loans at long date, like most of the State loans; it should be possible to raise it on short-dated Treasury bills, or, as suggested by the Cabinet Committee, by means of loans of a ten years' currency. Instead of locking up money in trust -funds, and starving necessary services, the Government, professing as it does to represent the people - though, in truth, representing only a section of them - should bring forward proposals for assisting the rapid expansion of our commerce. Better telephonic, telegraphic, and postal communication is required, particularly in the country districts. The prosperity of the country is due chiefly to the efforts of our primary producers ; but these are now greatly hampered by the failure of the great Departments of State to keep pace with their growing requirements. </para>

                        <para>. - Undoubtedly the finances of the Commonwealth are, and have been from the first, in a peculiar position. I am not one of those who say that in the past too much money has been returned to the States. It must be remembered that the financial position of the States differs greatly. The Tariff, in spite of everything said to the contrary, produces an immense revenue, with the effect that a State like New South Wales, which, prior to Federation, relied very little on the returns from Customs and Excise, now has an enormous surplus every year with the direct result that the State Government has reduced direct taxation and expended money lavishly in developmental works to the advantage of its people. Victoria, too, is in a similar position. But Tasmania receives about 60 per cent, less revenue from Customs and Excise than she raised prior to Federation. Whilst New South Wales, owing to the large return of Customs and Excise revenue, has been able to increase its expenditure, and to remit direct taxation, the Tasmanian Treasury has been so depleted that retrenchment of the Public Service has been necessary, and the increase of salaries quite out of the. question - though many of us would like to see the emoluments of, at any rate, the poorly-paid members of the service considerably increased - whilst many public works essential to settlement have been retarded. </para>

                            <para>- The Government is naturally desirous of helping the needy States, whose representatives cannot blame it for not having spent more money on the transferred Departments, thus still further impoverishing the State Treasuries. But the bookkeeping system should have been discontinued long ago. It was intended' that at the end of five years Parliament should deal with the question of bookkeeping as it thought fit, and there will never be a true Federation so long as the system continues. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The artificial barriers which divide the States should be removed, so far as trade and commerce is concerned. The continuance of the bookkeeping system is a great embarrassment to business men in their Customs transactions, and the time has come when this Parliament should deal with the matter in a Federal spirit. It may be replied that Tasmania would gain an advantage by the abolition of the bookkeeping system. That is so. But I think that the representatives of the larger States will agree to the abolition notwithstanding that, fact. Coming now to another matter, I consider that the proposed provision for old-age pensions will not be sufficient. I have again gone through the report presented in 1906 by the Royal Commission which inquired into the question. Its members, after visiting the capitals of all the States, and taking all the evidence they could obtain, came to the conclusion that £1,500,000 would be necessary to pav old-age pensions at the rate of 10s. a week, and invalid pensions to persons over the age of sixty. They based this estimate on the expenditure of New South Wales where, at the time they made their report, there were 22,000 persons in receipt of pensions, totalling £508,000. In Victoria, where the rate of pension was then 8s. per week, 11,452 persons were receiving an aggregate amount of £205,000. </para>

                            <para>- In New Zealand there are 11,770 persons in receipt of pensions at the rate of10s. per week, totalling £325,000 per annum. I draw att mention to the great difference between the number of the recipients in New South Wales and New Zeal and and that of the Victorian recipients. The Victorian Legislature passed an unending Bill by which the number of recipients of old-age pensions was reduced by between 2,000 and 3,000. The restrictions of that Act are not to be found in the Commonwealth Statute. We also decided, and very properly I think, that under the Commonwealth system, unlike that in operation in Victoria, the right of the incapable poor to receive a pension should not be governed merely by the question of age. This Parliament deliberately affirmed the principle that any person physically incapacitated from earning his daily bread should be entitled, whatever his age might be, to receive a pension of 10s. per week. In these circumstances I am confident that the majority of honorable members believe that the provision of £1,100,000 made by the Treasurer for invalid and old-age pensions will prove insufficient, and I fail to understand why so many honorable members voted a few evenings since against a motion in. which they were asked to declare that it was inadequate. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie, who did not speak to that motion, has said during the course of this debate that he was confident that the provision made by the Treasurer was inadequate, but he voted against the motion believing that to vote for it might be to embarrass the Government. We all know how sensitive is. the honorable member in his desire not to embarrass the Ministry. I cannot think that that was the real reason for his voting against the motion. If, as I believe, he and others voted against it because of a desire that a Federal land tax should be imposed in order to make good the deficiency, I would point out to them that it would be little short of a calamity to attach to the proposal to pay old-age pensions such a fightable proposal as is one for the imposition of a Commonwealth land tax. </para>

                            <para>- I am expressing the hope that no attempt of that kind will be made. Let the question of the imposition of a Federal land tax be dealt with on its merits. Nothing can now be gained by tacking on to any party programme the proposal for a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions. Turning to another subject, I do not think that this House or the Commonwealth is satisfied with the proposals made by the Government with regard to the transferred properties. We know now that their value is something like £9,000,000, and that, taking the rate of interest at  4  per cent., the States will have paid during ten years over £3,500,000 by way of interest upon them by the time that a settlement is arrived at. It is true that we have returned to the States large sums in excess of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; but I would point out that under the Surplus Revenue Act surplus revenue that we formerly returned to the States will now be paid into trust funds. Since we have determined to return to the States only their three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue, they can very properly demand that we shall deal promptly with the question of the transferred properties. Nothing can be gained by postponing again and again the settlement of a question which must become more acute as time goes on. Further delay must result in conflict, since the States themselves are anxious for a settlement. They have handed over to the Commonwealth properties on which they have been paying interest ever since we assumed control of them, and a settlement should have been arrived at long since. I am sure that this House will not accept the proposal of the Treasurer to pay the States out of their own money for the transferred properties. We took them over on the understanding that we should pay for them, and we should carry out our part of the agreement. There is another agreement, that ought to have been dealt with many months ago. The Prime Minister, acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, nearly two years ago entered into a contract with the Premier of South Australia for the transfer of the Northern Territory. South Australia has carried out her part of the bargain. The State Legislature has passed a Bill confirming the contract, but no effort has been made by the Prime Minister to induce this House to deal with it. Whilst we are doing nothing, and still holding on to the agreement, the Northern Territory is becoming more and more a noman's land. In 1906, when negotiations were proceeding for the transfer of the territory to the Federation, it had a population of 1,313 whites, and 2,387 aliens. At the Medical Congress held last week, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Norris,</inline> in the course of a very thoughtful paper on this very question, stated that the white population of the Northern Territory now consists of 680 males and 50 females. We have there an area of 325,000,000 acres, and, as the result of fifty years of settlement, a white population of only 730. We know that the settlement of the Territory has been too great a work for South Australia, and if the Prime Minister is not prepared to ask this Parliament to accept the agreement made with that State, it is only fair that the Government of South Australia should be so advised without further delay, so that it may take other measures for peopling that vast area. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that. It is time that we dealt with the question. It brings us face to face with a subject of vital importance to the Commonwealth, and that is the control and settlement of tropical Australia. I am one of those who believe that the Commonwealth Parliament adopted a proper policy when it determined to make, if it were possible to do so, Australia a white man's country. We had the effects of the introduction of black labour into the United States fresh in our minds. We know that there are 10,000,000 negroes in the United States to-day, or double the whole population of Australia. We read of scenes of the utmost atrocity arising from the presence of that alien race. It matters not whether the whites or the blacks are the instigators, it is almost impossible to read the papers that come by any mail without being shocked by the atrocities arising from the racial war that is going on in what is known as the black belt of America. With these facts staring us in the face it was our bounden duty to make an earnest endeavour to make Australia a white man's country, but, in the eloquent language of the Prime Minister, a White Australia must not be considered synonymous with an empty Australia. Yet up to the present, although we have deported the kanakas, the Federal Government have done nothing to remove from Australia the stigma that practically four-fifths of its area is empty. </para>

                            <para>- Sometimes we make rather a bugbear of the Northern Territory, and throw upon South Australia in that regard a reproach which is not altogether deserved. Four-fifths of Western Australia is in almost the same position as  the Northern Territory. The settlement of the great State of Queensland is practically confined to one little corner of it so far as regards what in Queensland would be called closer settlement. The electorates of Brisbane, Oxley, "Moreton, and Wide Bay cover about one-fifteenth of the State. Omitting Capricornia, the electorates of Kennedy, Maranoa, and Herbert cover practically seven-eighths of the entire area of Queensland. Yet we reproach South Australia for having done nothing to settle the Northern Territory, while four-fifths of Australia is only to a slightly less extent unpopulated. Even in New South Wales the electorates of Gwydir, Calare, Darling, Barrier, and Riverina comprise about three-fourths of the entire State, so that even in the Mother State the greater portion of the population is confined to the sea coast. The great question before Australia is what we are to do with the tropical country. This is not a new problem. One has only to read the history of the settlement of tropical countries in all parts &gt;of the world to find that no European nation, not even Great Britain, has attempted to deal with the question as Australia proposes to deal with it. We are starting out on altogether new lines in endeavouring to make a tropical country a white man's country, surrounded as we are by coloured people. It is not creditable to us as a Commonwealth Parliament that up to the present we have absolutely shirked the great question of dealing with tropical Australia. We made a start in connexion with the sugar industry ; but that will never settle any great portion of Australia, because we have almost reached the limit of our sugar production. I do not mean that we have reached the limit of Queensland's capacity to produce sugar, for she could produce enough to supply the world ; but we find it imperative now to impose a duty of <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> per ton in order to keep the Australian market for Australian sugar. The moment the production of -Queensland sugar reaches the limit of Australian consumption, the increase of production must cease. It is therefore idle to look to the sugar industry for the solution of the great problem of the settlement of our tropical area by white labour. With those questions before us and the financial problem facing us like a brick wall, we have a right to complain that the time of Parliament is being taken up by matters which could very well stand over until these greater and more national subjects have been dealt with. What has Australia done in regard to Papua or the New Hebrides? We hear a great deal of the desire to strengthen Australian relations in the Pacific, but in the whole history of British settlement there is nothing more pathetic or more disgraceful than the manner in which Australia has practically driven the New Hebrides and other Pacific settlements away from all social and trading intercourse and sympathy with herself. One can read how splendidly loyal the Islanders have been towards the British and Australian connexion, when their every direct and pecuniary interest lay in throwing in their lot with the French settlers and the French Government, who give them enormously greater facilities for trade than does Australia. Whilst we talk a great deal about extending our connexion and influence in the Pacific, we are by our trade and commerce barriers - our Tariff - practically prohibiting all trade between us and the Pacific Islanders. Australia will never secure the sympathy and co-operation of the Islands outside her own territorial* limits until she is prepared to treat their settlers as brothers in the Pacific Ocean, and to make them part and parcel of her community. It is time the external affairs policy of the Government assumed practical importance. The Prime Minister has made statement after statement in the House to the effect that his one great object was to populate this great continent with white people, but not one shilling is. voted to give effect to that policy. The necessity for the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth, in order to make a start towards the solution of the problem of white settlement in the tropics, has frequently been urged on us, but so far it has all ended in talk. There is nothing more deplorable in the whole history of British settlement than the present condition of affairs, not only in the Northern Territory, but in the whole of the northern provinces of Australia. There comes a time when an individual has to show to the rulers of his country that he is effectively occupying his possessions, especially his lands. That which applies to the individual may very well be made applicable to nations. The time is very near when Australia will have to give an account of her stewardship, and to show the world, as other countries have had to do, that she is effectively occupying her tropical territory. If she cannot do that she will be told that she must not shut out other people. That happened in the case of tropical Africa, which was divided amongst the nations of Europe because it could not be shown that it was effectively occupied. Can any one say that we are effectively occupying the Northern Territory with a population of about  730  whites on an area of  325,000,000  acres? Even across the border in Western Australia the same thing applies in practically the same degree, and is true also of Northern Queensland. Whilst Australia has declared against alien immigration - and with that declaration I agree - we are doing nothing to make Australia a white man's country with proper white settlement. It is high time that we gave this matter our serious and earnest consideration. So far as my information goes the office of Minister of External Affairs has been more neglected than any other in the Commonwealth. All the great matters which affect the very nationhood of Australia have not received the slightest attention from this Parliament. In the control of Papua, the trade of the New Hebrides, and other important directions, no attempt has been made to make the office of External Affairs a live administrative office for Australia. Despite the fact that the House, by a deliberate vote the other night, declared that the Commonwealth finances are satisfactory, I do not think that the Australian community regards them as such. If we are in earnest as to the purchase of the Northern Territory, we are face to face with an enormous expenditure in that direction. If we are in earnest in our defence scheme we must provide for increased expenditure there. If there is any earnestness in our immigration scheme; if we are to populate Australia and to give the question of white settlement in the tropics a fair and serious trial, we must be prepared to spend money on it ; but not a shilling is provided in the Estimates to meet those demands. During this debate, as during many others in this House, justice has not been done to those who did the great work of settlement in Australia in the pre-Federation days. There were enormous difficulties in the way of our earlier settlers, separated as this continent was by  12,000  miles from the Old Country, with inefficient means of transit. In some of the States settlement was begun under very unfavorable circumstances, yet the development has been marvellous. When we carp at the States Governments and charge them with unfairness and incapacity it is only fair to remember the enormous work of development done by them in pre-Federation days. And at what cost? We often hear it said that the States have plunged Australia over head and ears in debt. The Government Statist of Tasmania, to whom I appealed for confirmation of my figures, states that the total receipts from works constructed out of loans amount to  £16,943,000  per annum, and the net cost to the people of Australia for the whole of the Australian borrowing is only  6s. 6d.  per head. That is the result according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnston.</inline> But the honorable member for North Sydney, who has given to this matter, as he does to all matters that he takes up, the closest and most careful consideration, arrives at an even more satisfactory result from an Australian stand-point. He estimates that it costs the people of Australia to-day under1s. per head per annum for the whole of our enormous national debt. The earnings from the works for which the money was borrowed practically pay the whole of the interest on the debt. In New South Wales and Victoria the railways are an asset, and we know that there is not one State in the Union which could not sell its railways for the whole, or more than the whole, of its national debt. It will be seen, therefore, that the old pioneers, who carried out work from which we are receiving such benefit, did not do badly. It would be well, indeed, for the Commonwealth Parliament, if, after fifty years, it could be said that every penny spent or borrowed was returning to the Commonwealth  20s.  in the  £1,  and that there remained a commercial asset which could be sold for as much as or more than the total national debt. </para>

                        <para>.- It was brought home to me this afternoon that, perhaps, the reporting of our debates would be much enhanced in value to the outside public if, by some scientific discovery, there could be reproduced side by side with the written words, the attitudes and facial expression of honorable members. I listened carefully to the very clever and interesting address of the honorable member for Adelaide. But I fancy that, if those who read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> could have seen that honorable member's obvious satisfaction at the success of certain phrases, and at the ability with which he turned quotations to advantage, they would more or less discount, as, I take it, the Committee did, that speech, clever as it was.

                        is not given the unique opportunity that honorable members have of judging the sincerity of a speech, it is only right to say that the quotations he made to prove that the honorable member for Parramatta had not approached the subject in an honest and straightforward way, did not help his case for a moment. The honorable member for Parramatta, it will be remembered, said that he did not attempt to fix on the Labour Party - nor do I  - the sentiments or policy expressed in the quotation ; he merely pointed out that in the last issue of the Sydney
                        <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline>
                        which is described as the Labour organ, there appeared a signed article which practically indorsed Malthusianism. The honorable member for Adelaide was able to read one sentence, which he certainly led us to believe referred to that quoted by the honorable member for Parramatta. The sentence quoted by the honorable member for Adelaide was this -

                    <para>An immoral custom can also, by being practised by a family or a nation, become hereditary. </para>
                    <para class="block">Honorable members who read the article will see, however, that that refers to something quite different from the matter dealt with in the quotation read by the honorable member for Parramatta. Immediately following the sentence quoted by the honorable member for Adelaide there is this - </para>

                    <para>That has nothing whatever to do with those sentences which betrayed a Malthusian tendency, and to which the honorable member for Parramatta referred, and said we ought all to deplore. </para>

                        <para>It is not for the defence of capitalistic property and institutions that we advocate an armed citizenry. We would not fire a pop-gun to save them. It is for the defence of the co-operative Commonwealth to see clearly ahead of us. The gun must be ready at home, if needs be, to second the resolution carried at the ballot-box, " That the people do now take possession of their own." </para>

On the one side we are told by a distinguished member of the Labour Party, and, inferentially, by the Labour Party itself, that defence, for the major part, is a project for the defence of property ; while, on the other hand, we have a French, communistic proposal to arm their people in order to get what they can by force, if not by argument. I find the utmost difficulty iri interpreting the real intentions of ray friends in the Labour corner. </para>

                            <para>- Then, doubtless, the honorable member is prepared to adopt our  view,  and will pay for the monopolies in the coin of the realm. The honorable member has to carry out his pledge to the electors to nationalize these two industries, and. therefore, he has to consider how the necessary money has to be obtained. Then he is brought face to face with another pledge, that there is to be no Commonwealth borrowing. On the honorable member's own showing he has either to humbug his electors in a transparent, and almost indecent way, or has to break the second pledge, and so outrage his own lofty spirit in a way I am sure would prove overwhelming to him. Here we have an excellent instance of the humbug of the Labour Socialist programme and platform. I do not go into these matters with any satisfaction ; it is one of the griefs of my life that I have occasionally to show up the inconsistencies of honorable members opposite. </para>

                    <para class="block">Members of the Labour Party have not spoken openly in favour of immigration, but recently they have denied that they are against the policy. I always find, however, that when there is a proposal to further immigration there is an outcry against it from the Government corner. I express my regret that the Government have not seen fit to put into tangible shape all their protestations in favour of immigration for the last five or six years. We have had perorations from the Prime Minister on the necessity of filling up the empty lands of Australia. We have had the honorable gentleman filling large halls in Sydney or Melbourne with addresses on the one subject of the imminent need for population ; and we were promised, I think, in reply to the honorable member for Flinders, that some definite step would be taken on these Estimates, in the event of the States not being able to co-operate, to carry out the policy.

                            <para>- Yes. Its trouble is that Labour members are interested only in stifling the question, and the Prime Minister cannot live without their support. The land difficulty, however, need not deter us. Only one in' every ten of the immigrants, who enter Canada takes up land. We should do all we can to bring here, not petted capitalists, who are, apparently, the only immigrants whom the Labour Party would welcome, but men whose capital is the best the citizen can possess - good brains and healthy bodies. The Prime Minister has had every opportunity to provide for the bringing out of such men ; but he shelters himself behind the miserable subterfuge that the States will not co-operate with the Commonwealth, in this matter. </para>

                            <para>- In every country a percentage of the population is unemployed. That always will be so. But the industrial conditions of Australia are infinitely happier in this respect than those of other countries. If honorable members of the Labour Party hold that the more men there are here the less work will there be to do, they brand themselves as followers of Malthus, about whose doctrines we have heard so much to-day. Every immigrant must provide additional employment for those who are .here already, and must increase the market of our producers. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to have the honorable member's assurance in regard to China. The members of the Labour caucus number a good many, but that does  not seem to be a happy place, judging by the noises which I hear coming from its meetings now and again. If the Prime Minister is sincere in regard to immigration, he will do all he can to encourage persons to come here. We were told that the Tariff would give work to thousands. The Minister of Trade and Customs spoke of the factory chimneys rising in every city of Australia. Should not the Prime Minister add the coping stone to this fiscal creation by bringing out highly specialized workers to further stimulate Australian protected production? The public will soon begin to ask him straight-out questions on this and other points. Before resuming my seat, I should like to refer to a fund which I did not expect that the Government would cease to make provision for - that out of which the payments for advertising our resources are made. It is too useful to the Government to be abolished, since it satisfies the literary aspirations of Australasian writers on political subjects, makes known the possibilities of distant places like New Guinea, to which no great flow of immigration can be expected - and advertises the Prime Minister. By means of this fund the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Fox, of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> - the newspaper's political representative in Melbourne, and consequently a person to be considered - were obtained. </para>

                            <para>- I thought that the honorable member knew of only one good paper; I am glad to find that he thinks that there are two. The arrangement made with the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fox</inline> should be paid so much a page for an article on Australia, for information for which he was to have the free run of the Government Departments. He wrote an article, about which I make no complaint, which appeared in the first number of the <inline font-style="italic">Lone Hand,</inline> a monthly magazine published by the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> Company. The Commonwealth undertook to receive so many copies of this article - I think 100,000 or 200,000. The papers seem to show that the negotiations in regard to it took place before the Prime Minister went to England, between him and an advertising agent for the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin.</inline> I do not know that the Government knew exactly what the arrangement meant. Undoubtedly its promise to take so many copies of this article insured a certain circulation to the magazine, and thereby enhanced the value of its advertising columns. The redeeming feature in the transaction is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fox,</inline> realizing that he owed a debt of gratitude to the honorable gentleman for the way in which he had been treated, wrote an appreciation of the Prime Minister, which appeared a couple of issues later, in which he was spoken of as second to no one who has ever inhabited this earthly sphere, the equal of Disraeli, the compeer of Gladstone, and an infinitely firmer character than Bismarck ! The Government has also engaged the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Randolph</inline> Bedford. </para>

                                stood for a seat in this Parliament, but was not elected, so that he must be a good man. He is certainly a powerful political writer, and an important figure in the Australian journalistic world.

                            <para>- I do not know that gentleman. Has he, too, written an article on New Guinea ? It seems to me that, excellent though such articles may be, they do not increase immigration here by advertising our resources. The chief advantage we gained from the payment made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fox</inline> was the appreciation of the Prime Minister, to which I have referred. I have no quarrel with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fox.</inline> If the work of writing articles on Australia was to be done, I do not say that I should prefer any one else to write them ; but the arrangement was one which I should not like a Ministry which I was supporting to make. It is a bad practice to provide a fund for advertisements of this description, and as the system shows a tendency to increase, I call attention to the matter, in the hope that this misuse of the fund may be abolished. In conclusion, I have only to say that I am gratified that the Labour Party has admitted in this debate what they would not admit when their votes would have had effect, that the financial proposals of the Government are not satisfactory. We gave them an opportunity last week to declare straightforwardly that that was so, but we did not then hear even a whisper from them, except by way of interjection. They refused to say "yes" or"no." They preferred their usual course of running cunning; but have since confessed that the finances are not sound. They have admitted that the Government have put in the political shop window a number of show goods, without being in a position to pay for them, and that if the Ministry carry out all the proposals now before us, bankruptcy within the next few years will stare the Commonwealth in the face. They practically admit that the provision made for the payment of old-age pensions is insufficient; but we hear no clamour from the Labour Party, who have always sought to obtain an advertisement at the expense of the aged workers. </para>

                            <para>- But the Labour Party, I think, now admit that if the Treasurer's estimate of the revenue to be received is correct, we shall not have enough to pay old-age pensions. If the Prime Minister, with the assistance of his friends, were to pass all the measures that he now has before Parliament - if he succeeded in carrying his proposals in respect of defence, the transfer of the Northern Territory, the construction of a transcontinental railway, and a hundred-and-one other expensive projects, and began to try to find the money for them, there is more than an odd chance that the aged poor would have to wait, whilst honorable members of the Labour Party did a little more electioneering on their account. The Opposition placed clearly before the House the unsatisfactory position of our finances. The Labour Party, however, would not say that they were unsatisfactory. They preferred to vote that they were not, and to try to shelter themselves behind some subterfuge or excuse at the next general election. The excuse advanced in this House by one or two members of that party is about the most paltry that could be used. They said that they preferred to trust the Ministerial party, rather than to trust the Opposition. Honorable members in the direct Opposition do not desire any political association with that party, so that the Labour Party evidently fears that we might, unassisted, carry out our method of advancing the interests of Australia - a method of which they have expressed strong disapproval. They did not think that they were going to swop one instrument for another. They knew that if they gave up the control which they hold over this Government, they would have to stand alone, and by refusing on the no-confidence motion to express a simple "yea" or " nay," they confessed to the people that they realized that they cannot stand alone, and that the most they can hope to do is to use some one else's brains to achieve their objects. </para>

                        <para>.- We have had, during this debate, a repetition of misrepresentations of the Labour Party, which sounds very like the playing of an old tune. Much the same criticism has been levelled against us again and again, and that to which we have listened during this debate is just as untrue as is that which has been indulged in on former occasions. The honorable member who has just resumed his seat, referred to the Labour platform adopted at the recent Brisbane Conference, and in order that there may be no excuse for the Opposition misquoting our objective and platform, I intend to put before the Committee what that Conference evolved as a programme for the next Federal elections. It is all very well for honorable members to attempt to attach to the party opinions expressed by individual contributors to Labour journals ; but the true expression of the Labour movement is to be found in the compromise arrived at between the different sections of opinion, some moderate, and some extreme, voiced at the Conference, and embodied in the Labour objective, platform, and pledge. These constitute the only basis upon which the Opposition are fairly entitled to criticise us. </para>

In addition to this, another question of far-reaching importance was dealt with at the Conference, a question which, with the approach of the time when the operation of the Braddon section will expire, is likely to become one of the burning issues before the country. It will be necessary for the Commonwealth Parliament to arrive at some solution of the conflicting interests of the Commonwealth and States Governments with respect to the Federal revenue. Both the States and the Commonwealth Governments represent one and the same people, and whatever scheme will best serve the people themselves should prevail. The present scheme is but temporary, and after 1910, the responsibility for the adjustment of Federal revenues will devolve upon the Commonwealth Parliament. Section 87 of the Constitution reads as follows - </para>

                    <para class="block">I wish to emphasize some very important words in section 87, namely, " Until the Parliament otherwise provides." They fix upon this Parliament the responsibility of determining the distribution of the Federal revenues after the expiration of this provision in 19 10. In accordance with section 87, the States have received from 1st January, 1901, to 30th January, 1908, £57,776,002. The three-fourths to which they were entitled under the Braddon section amounted to £51,601,929, so that they received £6,174,073 over and above  the three -fourths to which they were entitled under the Braddon section, this amount being the unexpended portion of the one-fourth which the Commonwealth was entitled to expend. In other words, the Commonwealth did not expend its full one-fourth, but handed to the States its own unexpended balances. </para>

                            <para>- That is really a. bookkeeping matter. Another provision of the Constitution - section 85 - enacts that the Commonwealth shall compensate the States for transferred properties by agreement, and, failing that, as the Federal Parliament may decide. One of the reasons why this question has not been dealt with is that the States have themselves valued these properties at from £10,000,000 to £14,000,000, whilst the Commonwealth, on the other hand, has valued them roughly at from £8,000,000 to£10,000,000. As no agreement had been arrived at, a Commission was appointed, consisting of a valuer, representing the Commonwealth, and valuers representing the States, to recommend a scheme for settlement. In to-day's papers, I notice a statement that that Commission considers that the amount payable in respect of transferred properties will be, roughly speaking, £8,500,000. This justifies the refusal of the Commonwealth to accept the higher figures. </para>

As the interest on these properties would be a charge against the revenues returnable to the States as part of the cost of maintenance of the transferred Departments, the settlement of the question is merely a bookkeeping matter. As 1910, the year of the expiry of the Braddon section and the trial period provided in the Constitution, approaches, another difficulty - the transfer of the States debts to the Commonwealth - presents itself. Section 105 provides that - </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable member. The aggregate States debts on 30th June, 1907, which mature annually up to 1952, were as follow :  - Amount owing in London, £185,831,848; in Australia, £58,903,451, or a total of £244,735,299. Since then the debt has grown. On 30th June, 1908, the amount owing in London was £183,422,390, and in Australia £64,552,234, or a total of £247,974,624. I take the figures for 1907 as they relate to the same year as the other latest figures I am using. The average percentage of the interest is 3.21, and the total interest bill on the 1907 basis amounts to over £8,750,000 annually. Incidentally I should like to state that the imports into Australia for 1907 were £51,809,033, whilst the exports were £72,824,247, or an excess of exports of £21,015,214. Deducting from the excess of exports the amount of interest payable on the debts of the States, there is, roughly, a balance of £12,250,000 of excess of exports in value or kind. That amount has gone to some authority outside the Commonwealth, and there is no explanation on the face of it to show who has received it. I have no doubt that some of the money has gone to pay interest on some of the private debts owing by institutions in Australia to persons abroad. At the same time it is not reasonable to suppose that those debts are greater than the total public debt of Australia. It is, therefore, fair to assume that some millions of money are being drawn from Australia annually by persons outside as incomes in respect of properties held within the Commonwealth. I agree with the honorable member who said that it was a wise provision in the Constitution that the Commonwealth should take over the States debts. If this huge debt could be federalized and financed through a Commonwealth Government bank the immediate saving and the total wiping out of the debt in a comparatively few years would be an immense beneficial  national undertaking. At the same time, it is one of those questions in which it is impossible to travel in advance of public opinion. It would be hardly worth the effort to relieve the States of this great debt incubus if they competed against the Commonwealth in raising loans and embarked on a further unrestricted excursion into the domain of borrowing. The States Governments have shown conclusively that they will absolutely refuse to be limited in any way in their policy of borrowing. In fact, they will not even agree to refrain from competing with the Commonwealth in the raising of loans. If the Commonwealth is to take over the huge debt of the States only to be met in the money market, when trying to wipe it off in a number of years, by the States Governments raising loans in competition with them, and if the States on being relieved of the debt are simply to continue with fresh enthusiasm in the direction of public borrowing, it appears to me that the great effort that would have to be put forward by the Commonwealth Administration and the great self denial which the Commonwealth Parliament would have to practice in order to relieve the people of this immense debt hanging round their necks would scarcely be worth the sacrifice. This attitude of the States Governments appears to render impracticable at present the transfer of the States debts to the Commonwealth, and consequently the question must await the time when an enlightened public opinion will show the States Governments their duty more clearly. We have therefore to determine upon some scheme for the division of the Customs and Excise revenues between the States and Commonwealth Governments upon a fair and equitable basis. This question was dealt with exhaustively by the recent triennial Labour Conference at Brisbane, at which the whole of the political labour organizations of the States were represented, sending the best brains of the movement, including parliamentary and lay members, to attack the great problems which face the people of Australia in the immediate future. Their scheme is as follows - </para>

                    <para class="block">Leaving out those clauses in the State Government resolutions referring to the Public Debt - these are to be allowed to stand as at present, pending the adjustment of revenue returns, according to the Labour scheme - it is interesting to note that the principles of our party's scheme meets the State Governments' objections. Resolution 1, clauses <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> of the State Governments, is met by paragraph 2 of the Labour scheme. Resolutions 3 and 4 of the State Governments are met by noninterference by the Labour scheme. Resolution 5 of the State Governments is met by paragraph 5 of the Labour scheme as relating to Western Australia, and as relating to Tasmania, by treating her the same as other States in the general scheme, thus allowing Tasmania an equal return, although her Customs and Excise revenue is much less than that of other States. This concession is made because of the loss of Customs and Excise revenue by Tasmania. This is known to exist, but cannot be traced, because Tasmanians periodically travel to the other States, buy largely, and take goods home as persona] effects. The State Governments should, therefore, support the general principles of the Labour scheme. Indeed, I should like it to be recorded that this scheme has already been brought under the notice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Waddell,</inline> the State Treasurer of New South Wales.

                        did not express complete approval of the whole of the scheme, but some of its features commended themselves to him ; and in the recognition that the present time is inopportune for taking over the States debts, for reasons previously given, the State Government of New South Wales, through their Treasurer, express complete accord with the Labour scheme. I have made a calculation, with a view to explaining the Labour Party's financial proposal.

The following calculation has been made as a means of explaining the scheme to honorable members. The figures are worked out on the basis of five years prior to 1910, as per clause <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of paragraph 4. There will no doubt be differences of opinion as to the years upon which the calculation should be based.

                    <para class="block">The difference between £4,132,143 allotted and £4,145,286 returnable, is accounted for by the fact that I have not worked to the fraction, but it is near enough for illustration purposes. There would then be a special grant from the Federation to Western Australia on account of the fact that her average payment of Customs and Excise revenue is about £1 per head in advance of other States, and she is therefore to have an increased return for that reason. This, however, need not be entered upon now. I know that the honorable member for South Sydney, whose calculations are regarded as having the weight of authority, estimates the amount returnable at 23s. per head. I do not know how that figure is arrived at, but I find that over the five years I have taken, it amounts, roughly speaking, to £1 os. 9d. To give an example of how the States would fare under the scheme which provides for their receiving an increase with an increase of population, I may say that on 31st December, 1907, the population was 4,178,000 - these figures were not available when I  worked  out the calculation - and on that basis the States would, roughly speaking, be entitled to receive another £400,000. Let us see how the State of </para>

                    <para class="block">For the six years before Federation, the expenses of collection have to be allowed for, except in tha case of the last half of the financial year of 1901, which was paid by the Federation, whilst the revenue returned after Federation was net - <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> after expenses of collection had been allowed for. For 1901, New South Wales received £1,958,344, gross amount, from Customs and Excise. Taking the figures I have stated under the Labour scheme, and on the basis of population for 1906, New South Wales would receive £1,531,467. Even without allowing for cost of administration of Customs Department, this is only about £400,000 short as compared with 1901, but to make up for this, the Federation has taken over expensive non-paying Departments, such as the Defence, the cost of Customs administration, the loss on the Postal Department, and must also take over shortly quarantine and lighthouses. Besides all this, there are other great national responsibilities placed in the keeping of the Federal Parliament which have to be provided for. I would emphasize again the fact that the period taken as the basis for calculation is only for illustration purposes, and in no wise can it be connected with the party's scheme. As a matter of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Watson  thinks the <inline font-style="italic">-per capita</inline> amount returnable to the States will be about £1 3s. per head. This would mean the return of about £5,000,000 to the Spates annually. The honorable member for North Sydney, by a different process of reasoning, in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> fixes upon £5,250,000 as the returnable amount. This would  mean a great deal, indeed, to the States. I trust honorable members will carefully preserve this scheme for future reference, as the financial question promises to be one of the burning issues of the next Federal election. I should like to emphasize the fact that in New South Wales we have a Government composed of the remnants of the old freetrade party. Those persons who go about telling the people that they do not believe in using the Customs House for revenue purposes, at the same time base the whole of their financial complaints and clamour against the Commonwealth on the basis that enough money is not returned to them from the Customs and Excise revenue, and they would compel the Federal Government to impose the heaviest of revenue duties on the necessaries of life of the working people. </para>

                            <para>- In doing so I voted for a sufficient duty to protect and encourage the piano-making industry, and that action has been justified by the recent opening of a new factory at Richmond, to which honorable members were invited. The period on which I have based by calculations was fixed upon merely for purposes of illustration, and the years chosen must not be regarded as indorsed by the Labour Party, because other honorable members may think that another period should be taken. The honorable member for South Sydney, as I have already pointed out, believes that, on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, about <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 3s. will be returnable to the States, and one of the ablest members of the Opposition, the honorable member for North Sydney, has arrived at the conclusion that a fair thing would be about £1 5s. per head. </para>

                    <para>Mi*.  J. H. CATTS.- The honorable member showed that about £5,220,000 would be annually returnable. That amount is equivalent to about 25s. per head. I have his scheme here in .the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> if it is necessary to quote it. As the settlement of this question is to be made an issue at the forthcoming Federal elections, I hope that every elector, man and woman, will give it the closest attention, so that the interests of Australia may be intelligently dealt with, and we may in the future, for some years, at any rate, have peace in regard to a matter which, in the past, has caused considerable disturbance. </para>

                        <para>.- I am not in the habit of occupying much of the time of the House or this Committee, and shall not do so now. But on an occasion like this it is due to oneself, and to one's constituents, to explain his position in regard to the various matters brought forward for discussion. It seems to me that I and others who supported the motion of no confidence would have only to refer to the speeches since delivered by many of those who voted against it if we felt that we need to justify our attitude. Almost every speech since delivered from the other side of the House has condemned the Government for its management of the finances. Some honorable members, like the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, have been very severe, and others have been milder in their criticisms j but the tone of the Committee shows that we do not clearly know whither we are drifting, and that there is a general fear that the ship of state is leaving the deep water of solvency for the shallow waters of very risky finance. The criticism of the leader of the Opposition was fully justified. H*a did not charge Ministers with extravagance, but he laid bare the inevitable results of their policy, so far as the finances must be affected by it. He pointed out that no proper provision is made in this year's Estimates for their various commitments. It would be wearisome to the Committee were </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">I again ,to go into all the details connected with this subject ; but it is very plain that no proper financial provision has been made for the proposals directly enunciated or foreshadowed in the Government policy. The honorable member for Flinders has shown that, at the beginning of the next financial year, we must have a deficit of about £1,500,000, assuming the Treasurer's figures to be correct, the estimates of revenue being £6,500,000 and the probable expenditure about £8,000,000. It is impossible to get any explanation from the Treasurer, who makes no answer to these criticisms, and is apparently satisfied to drift along until he bumps against something solid. The action of the leader of the Opposition was amply justified. We do not expect, or particularly desire, to shift the Government at present; but his motion had the effect of sharply calling attention to the state of the finances. It is not to be wondered at that those responsible for the development of the States, especially where there are vast unsettled coastal territories, as there are in Queensland and Victoria, are exceedingly uncertain as to the future. The public is only just waking up to the value of much of our land, and within the next few years there will be a great increase in settlement, which will necessitate a great increase in expenditure. The Governments of the States are charged with the work of development, and they realize that, after 1910, they will be absolutely in the hands of the Commonwealth. No' doubt when the time comes this Parliament, realizing that it, like the Parliaments of the States, is responsible to the people of the States, will agree to a reasonable solution of the difficulty. A great deal has been said about the aggressive attitude of the States, and the manner in which they growl and whine. But New South Wales is practically the only State whose revenues have benefited greatly from Federation. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but I am looking at the matter from the point of view of the necessities of the States Governments. In the first year following Federation, Queensland suffered a loss of revenue amounting to £500,000, and although she has, in the last seven years, received money over and above her proportion of the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, her receipts last year were £71,000 behind what they were prior to Federation. This year she has just about made up the deficiency of her three-fourths share. </para>

New South Wales is not the only State concerned. The aggressive attitude adopted by the Commonwealth authorities towards the States has given rise to ah uneasy feeling on their part. No doubt I shall be told that aggressiveness was first shown by the States themselves. </para>

                            <para>- I do not suggest that the honorable member is. The people of Queensland are Federal in spirit, but I know that many of them feel that there is a distinct inclination on the part of a certain set of politicians not confined to the Labour Party to try to acquire, at the expense of the States, greater powers for the Federal Parliament. That, perhaps, is a natural inclination ; but those who realize, as we do in Queensland, the absolute necessity of the States controlling their own local development recognise that it must be combated. The Federal power has taken up in many cases a distinctly aggressive attitude towards the States. </para>

                            <para>- There is a distinct inclination to go beyond the Constitution and to throw upon the States Governments the onus of appealing . to the High Court to determine whether we have exceeded our powers. I heard to-day a member of the Labour Party blaming the States Governments for having put the Commonwealth to the expense of defending proceedings in the High Court to determine the constitutionality of the Surplus Revenue Act. When the High Court determines that the Commonwealth has exceeded its power in passing any measure honorable members of the Labour Party criticise St severely, and hint at political bias on the part of the members of the High Court Bench. That is the attitude they usually take up when a decision is given against them. The honorable member for West Sydney, and some other members of the Labour Party, have been declaring in New South Wales, that Parliament makes the laws and not the High Court, and that it is time that the Court ceased to rule the people. That tribunal is the only security to which the people, as electors of the States, can look to preserve their power to govern themselves and to control their own local affairs. </para>

                            <para>- They do not need to be told that the High Court is their only protection as electors of the States Parliaments. I was asked by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports to give an instance where the Commonwealth had taken up an aggressive attitude towards the States. I think that a case in point is to be found in the way in which it is proposed to bring the Commonwealth system of old-age pensions into operation. At the present time Queensland, and several other States, have their own systems in force, and yet the Commonwealth Government are calmly appropriating revenue - which would go to the States - to provide in the future for a Federal system. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. The people of Queensland are to-day providing for a local system of old-age pensions, and at the same time they are being called upon to contribute to a fund to provide for a Federal scheme to come into operation nearly twelve months hence. That is obviously unjustifiable. If contributions towards a fund to provide for a Federal system in 1909 have to be spread over more than one year, how are we to get on when the total sum required for the payment of those pensions has to be found each year ? </para>

                            <para>- That was not the intention of the people when they voted for Federation. The Federal Parliament was created by the States to carry out certain specific functions, and it is not the paramount power in the political life of Australia. Some honorable members undoubtedly favour unification, but the honorable member for Herbert is the only one who, to my knowledge, has openly declared himself, in this House, in favour of it. While a number of others obviously believe in unification, they are not prepared to come into the open and to make such a declaration. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. The honorable member first of all spoke of the party as a political machine. He then pointed out that he did not refer to honorable members of this House; that his personal relations with the members of the Labour Party in Parliament had always been of a pleasant character, and that he found it easy to work with them. There can be no doubt that our personal relations with the members of the party are of a pleasant character. Honorable members in the Labour corner and I are the best of friends. We enjoy one another's society, and I do not think that there is the slightest feeling between us. We can work together, so far as many political and social objects are concerned ; but, at the same time, it appeared to me that the explanation made by the Prime Minister did not fill the bill. If the Labour organization outside this House is the machine, the members of the Labour Party in this House are machine-controlled. </para>

                            <para>- We know that that is not so. Those who run the machine very often are not in politics. The fact that honorable members of the Labour Party are dependent on men who are not in politics - men of various shades of political thought, some of them out - and - out Socialists and some of them leaders of political unions - shows that they are controlled by the machine outside. Honorable members of the Labour Party would not be here unless they secured the nomination of the Political Labour . Leagues. I fail to see how we can dissociate the members of the party in this Parliament from the hard-and-fast organization which controls them outside. As to the remark made by the Prime Minister that he could work politically with the members of the party in the House, although he could not work with the terrible machine outside, it seems to me that the connexion between the party and the machine was well illustrated in Queensland a few days ago. I notice that when a proposal was made to the Queensland Labour Party to enter into a coalition, the offer was handed in writing to their leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowman,</inline> and the answer came back, not from him- </para>

                            <para>- I cannot admit it. I feel that the control is still there, although it is quite open to the honorable member to break away from it if he likes. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie addressed himself at considerable length the other day to the question of Socialism, and I interjected that the Socialism which was spoken of in politics here was a political term. It is not exactly the theory of Socialism that is meant, and anti-Socialism is simply another political term. The term " Socialism " that we use refers to the policy of the Labour Party in favour of nationalization. I notice that when we criticise the members of the Labour Party as Socialists, we have to explain what we mean. It is rather an inexpressive word, for the whole matter is wrapped up in the idea of nationalization. We on this side, maintain that to carry the idea of nationalizing all the means of production, distribution, and exchange, to its logical conclusion, would absolutely entail the controlling and limiting of the freedom of every man. woman, and child in the country. </para>

                            <para>- Not absolutely; but only in certain directions for their own good. To get the proper perspective in considering these industrial questions, we have to go back a long way, and consider them from the historical point of view. We must trace the way in which our industrial and economic life has gradually evolved, from first of all a state of extreme Socialism in far-back ages, and then a state of extreme license of individualism, while now we are gradually working back into a system involving limited control. According to our arguments, the Socialism which the Labour Party advocate in the nationalization of all the means of production, distribution, and exchange, means really complete and entire Collectivism. It will leave no room for individual initiative and enterprise. If the State carries on all the vast, intricate, and complex functions of industrialism and commercialism, it must utterly wipe out the very characteristics of healthy mankind - -the initiative, energy and enterprise which have built up our civilization. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that presently. If Government control is Socialism, we are all Socialists to some extent; but where we differ from the members of the Labour Party is that they are going to extremes. They go to such extremes that one feels that they will check the building up of character, and that we must drift back to a low grade of civilization. Each proposal, however, must be judged on its own merits. I can imagine that as time goes on the State may have to undertake different commercial enterprises. But that policy will only be justified by the fact that we have proved from experience that we cannot control them otherwise. </para>

It puts vast power,, through the aggregation of capital, into the hands of a very few, who may use their opportunities for the oppression and starving of numbers of people. But when it has been proved that we cannot take away the power of evil from these people without nationalizing the industries,, then, and then' only, shall we be justified in going to the extreme of taking them over. </para>

                            <para>- No. The Labour Party admits straight out that it advocates the nationalization of monopolies, simply because they are monopolies, and not because they have been proved to be harmful. The only difference between the Federal objective and the State objective is that in the latter complete nationalization is honestly advocated, whereas In the former there is a vague statement about the equal distribution of wealth, and all that sort of thing, which admits of any interpretation one likes to put upon it. The leaders; of the party in the country have told us plainly that they are simply going forward' step by step. But there is no doubt they will be forced forward at a faster rate by the organizations outside Parliament. 1 was very glad to learn that provision is to be made for the establishment of an agricultural bureau. In the first speech I made when I became a member of this House, I pointed out what an excellent thing it would be to have an agricultural' bureau, and went into particulars, and further indicated that I hoped this would' be the first branch of a Department of the Interior, which would lay itself out to assist and advance every branch of industry, and' especially the primary industries. I wish also to refer to a remark made by the Prime Minister in his recent speech. He said that he could not work in any degree with honorable members on this side of the House, who were reactionaries, and so on. As a comparatively new member, I claim to be just as liberal as the Prime Minister himself, and as many of those who support him. </para>

It seems to us that the fundamental principles are not so evident as the fundamental differences between the Prime Minister and those who keep him in office. But we have proved by our votes that we are prepared to support many of the proposals of the Government. We have criticised the details of their projects, and have not approved of certain methods lay which results were desired to be obtained, but otherwise we have supported them. I may mention the Australian Industries Preservation Act, which we criticised in detail, and which is showing signs of breaking down. We objected to the power proposed to be placed in the hands of an officer under political control. We likewise objected to the idea that any' man may lay .a written information against any person or corporation without responsibility, and that a political officer without legal knowledge or experience in the weighing of evidence may launch a case against individuals. </para>

The honorable member has introduced a little amusement into the proceedings. As far as I know, the Prime Minister has never endeavoured to come to an understanding with the Liberal members of the House. From the little experience I have had here, I should say that there must be some personal feeling that grew up before I became - a member of Parliament that is keeping the Libera] forces apart. </para>

                            <para>- I shall never do that. Whatever action may be taken to unite the progressive forces in this Chamber, must be initiated by the other side. Before concluding my remarks I. wish to say a few words in regard to immigration. We are persistently told that in Australia there is no' land available for immigrants. In refutation of that statement I wish to quote a few figures which show the area which was taken up in Queensland during the week ended 24th October - not an exceptional week by any means. The return from which I am about to quote shows that during that week there were two grazing selections comprising 20,000 acres, 48 agricultural selections embracing 16,138 acres, and'  33  prickly pear selections containing  52,720  acres, taken up, or a total of  88,858  acres. It is therefore farcical to urge, as members of the Labour Party frequently c&gt;o, that there is no land available for settlement in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I ain satisfied that Queensland has not lost population, although I believe that Victoria has. Not long ago I quoted certain figures in this House which showed that the former State was gaining population at a considerable rate, and I feel certain that if the statement of the honorable member be true, the exodus which she is now suffering is merely a temporary one. Possibly it is due to the return to the other States of a large number of workers who annually visit Queensland in connexion with the sugar harvest. , I thank the Committee for the patient hearing which has been accorded me. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he can indicate when it is likely that the debate on the second reading of the Defence Bill will be resumed - this week, next, or ever during this session. I should also like to ask the honorable gentleman if he is in a position to indicate the views and policy of the Government in regard to the proposed scheme of naval defence, which, is not incorporated in the Bill before the House. It is- somewhat difficult to debate the defence question, and confine ourselves solely to the military branch, and, therefore, it is' most desirable that the Government should indicate in some way what their proposals are in regard to naval defence - whether or not they intend to carry out the scheme submitted to the Admiralty, and commented on in the .recent despatch. It would greatly conduce to a free, full, comprehensive, and satisfactory debate if . we could deal with both branches of the question instead of being limited to military defence, and in the dark as to the Government policy on the naval aspect. </para>

                        <para>- - As soon as the debate on the Budget closes, we shall ask the House to pass the Works and Buildings Estimates - which are not a lengthy part of the Estimates - in order that the works may be nut in hand at once. The desire is then to send the Manufactures Encouragement Bill to another place, and to resume the discussion on the Defence Bill. I remind the honorable and learned member that an amendment has already been moved on the Defence Bill, which indirectly raises the question of naval defence, and in the course of the discussion an indication of the view of the Government on naval defence will naturally be given. </para>
