                        <para>- I wish to ask the Treasurer, who, I understand, is acting for the Minister of Trade&#39; and Customs, whether he intends to fulfil the promise he made to me in this Chamber on the 4th December last, that medicated plaster should be admitted into the country free of duty. I have been informed that, notwithstanding his promise, the Customs officers are collecting duty on this plaster. May I, to refresh the honorable member&#39;s recollection, quote the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> account of what took place in Committee on the Tariff. It is as follows - </para>

                        <para>Mr LIDDELL - I  think that plasters should be placed upon the free list. Of course, we all know that there are varieties of plasters. I bold in my hand a book, a copy of which has been forwarded to every honorable member. It shows how important the matter must be if the agents of Messrs. Johnston and Johnston, manufacturing chemists, will incur that expense. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is mistaken in thinking that I am acting for the Minister of Trade and Customs; it is the Prime Minister who is doing so. No doubt I made the statements which the honorable member has read, though. I do not remember the occurrence; but I shall take the earliest opportunity - probably to-morrow - to see the Prime Minister in reference to the matter, so that whatever promise I made may be carried out. </para>

                        <para>- So many insinuations of this kind have been made against me that I now take no notice of them. I have read the statement referred to, but, as a matter of fact, I do not own an acre of land within hundreds of miles of Tumut, and never did. The nearest place to Tumut at which I own land is Katoomba, where I have two or three allotments, and that, as honorable members know, is hundreds of miles away. In no other place have I any interest of any kind. </para>

                        <para>- Up till the present time the matter is purely a departmental one. It has not yet become a Cabinet question. But it occurred to me that in carrying out work of this description it might be wise to send competent men who possessed a considerable training in this particular branch of industry to Great Britain, in order that they might perfect themselves in it, rather than to import too many workmen in connexion with the small-arms factory which it is proposed to establish. This is the basis of the rumour, and the position will remain unchanged until further investigation takes place, which will not be for some little time. Before any steps of that kind are taken the House will be informed of them. </para>

                        <para>-I found that the military authorities in the various States were accepting responsibilities - among them the conduct of Cadet camps - for which Parliamentary sanction had not been given, and, believing it to be unwise to spend money which Parliament had not voted, I directed, in general terms, that the Commandants should be informed that very good reasons must be given for the anticipation of Parliamentary votes to insure the approval of expenditure. That instruction may have had some bearing on the state of things to which the honorable member has called attention; but I shall read the newspaper paragraph in question, and, having in formed myself more thoroughly in regard to the matter, give the honorable member a more definite answer later. </para>

                        <para>The cost per head of militiamen, excluding arms and accoutrements, but including administration and instruction under the present system is about&#163;20 per annum. The cost under the new system of a member of the National Guard is estimated at about &#163;5 per annum. These figures in both cases exclude stores, field artillery, ammunition (reserve) works and buildings, and repairs. The cost per head of arms and accoutrements remains as at present. The existing rate of pay for a militiaman (Infantry private) is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> 8s. per annum. The great saving, under the proposed scheme, becomes obvious from a comparison of the two systems, in one of which, as proposed, the men are dealt with locally in large bodies, and in the other, as at present, in small detachments widely scattered over the Continent, or, by reason of the small numbers in each centre, in concentrations which entail bringing men and horses excessive distances. Instructors at present spend a large proportion of their time travelling to scattered units. The cost of administration, travelling expenses, instruction, and such like will under the proposed system be reduced per head to a minimum.

See remarks, <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> page 441, in which it is stated that the number obtainable would not materially affect the comparison between, say, 20,000 men engaged in training as specified and 800,000 men who, although having the same national and legal responsibilities with regard to defence, are making no effort to prepare. </para>

                            <para>Yes. The Militia are always short of the number provided for, the percentage short varying throughout the year from 10 per cent. upwards (officers about 20 per cent.). Great efforts have to be made before the annual camps to fill up vacancies, and, in the past, regiments have been known to have taken men to camp who have not even completed their short recruit drill, thus obtaining a good paper statement. During the last camps 2,600 of the troops had three months&#39; service, or less. The average length of service in the various States shows that not less than one-fourth of the strength goes out, and is replaced every year. The proportion is really greater, because the average service is increased by a proportion of men with considerable service. The existence of this large casual element means that a considerable number are passed out after one year&#39;s service or less. Such training is comparatively useless.

                        <para>. - I must thank the House for the courtesy extended to me on Friday, in permitting me to continue my speech this afternoon, and for paying me the further compliment of stating that some of my statements were very informative. I do not often transgress by making a long speech, but I feel that there are some matters in this Bill on which I may be able to give Parliament some special information. I fear that on Friday I may have done the Minister an injustice by omitting to point out what occurred on 2nd April, 1908, when I brought before him in this chamber certain of the regulations which I had previously referred to. I then pointed out that under those regulations it was simply impossible for men in certain corps to obtain promotion from the ranks. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> page 10089, reports the ensuing discussion as follows - </para>

                    <para class="block">So the matter was brought fully before the Minister at that date, and he gave that definite promise, in consequence of which I caused to be sent to him within a week draft regulations which would carry out the intentions of the Act, and which he himself, in a subsequent discussion, admitted would&#39; fulfil the intention of section 11 of the Act of 1903 to permit men to rise from the ranks. Yet those regulations have not been altered, and so I again point out that the Minister&#39;s desires, and the will of Parliament, have not been carried out, although the Minister has officers who are responsible for seeing that that is done. The Minister seems to be served by his Board very badly. I tried also to show that regulations framed under the present system are absolutely incomplete. I will give instances. I suppose that during the last fortnight all honorable members have received a circular from certain religious organizations with regard to the position of conscientious objectors, complaining that it is very unfair that any man whose religion forbids him to bear arms - such, for instance, as the Quakers - should not receive consideration. I replied to that circular by pointing out that section 61 of the Defence Act met that position - </para>

Consequently, unless we can induce the Minister to get the Board to do their work, every conscientious objector will be forced to bear arms under the Government scheme, although there is a provision in the present law specially framed to meet their case. </para>

                            <para>- I have not attended any of their meetings, but if the honorable  member says that is so, I see no reason to doubt it. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, spoke of the cost of uniforms. I refer to this matter more particularly because the Prime Minister, in December last, when bringing the Government scheme before the House for the first time, expressed the opinion that the expense of uniforms was far too great. Lieutenant-Colonel Legge, who, I understand, drafted the memorandum on the land defence of Australia, discusses in it the cost of. uniforms. I hear that some honorable members have expressed the intention of seeking to have khaki specified in the Act itself, seeing that the regulations are so absolutely ineffective. But its insertion in the Act will render impossible some simpler and perhaps more suitable uniform, if discovered in future. Eighty pages of these regulations, which I hold in my hand, apply to questions of dress only, in spite of the statement that a simple khaki uniform was to be adopted. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence dealt with this question, because, they said, it was impossible for some men to take commissions on account of the expense involved in obtaining uniforms. Under the heading of &#34; Infantry Officers,&#34; I take the following as an example of these regulations :  - </para>

                            <para>- I understand that it was promised that a change should be made, but this regulation says that the uniform shall be &#34; Gradually replaced by the uniform now prescribed.&#34; This shows distinctly that instead of there being an endeavour to meet what was the desire of the Parliament at the time when the Act was passed, an altogether different state of things has been permitted. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that the Minister is completely blocked by a number of &#34; passive resisters &#34; who simply refuse to carry out what he has expressed his intention of having done, and what is the desire of this House. The people of this country do not want this sort of rubbish. They want our soldiers to be clothed in a simple kind of uniform which shall be inexpensive, and the officers to wear a uniform which will be fit for field work, and will give good service. I do not say that the Minister is responsible for what I have described, but if Parliament gives a distinct indication of its wishes it is time that the men who are employed to do the will of Parliament see that practical effect is given to them. </para>

                            <para>- But the honorable member must surely know that unless the Minister has technical knowledge he has to accept the advice of his subordinates. I am sure that the Minister has tried to comply with the wish of Parliament in regard to officers&#39; commissions. He was good enough to get the Inspector-General, the Chief of the Military Board, and the Secretary of the Department, to meet me, and it was agreed that every man should be given the right to rise from the ranks, and that the cumbrous system of competitive University examination should be done away with. </para>

                            <para>- With the Minister&#39;s permission. The next question to which I wish to refer is the marriage regulations. It will be remembered that about two years ago a case was brought up in Parliament in which a man was not allowed to get married until he, and the lady whom he wished to marry, had been paraded before an officer. At that time the Minister promised to see that the practice was altered. Things have improved, although, at the present time, a member of the Permanent Forces may be married and may be a man of good conduct, but yet he is not allowed to live outside the barracks. He is not allowed to go home to live with his wife, and to sleep with his wife at night. I think that is very wrong indeed, not only to the man, but to the woman. The Minister will see on page  171  of the Regulations, Regulation  71,  the following provision : - </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the Minister that it would be a very good thing indeed. Another matter to which I wish to allude relates to the regulation with regard to the practice of saluting when in plain clothes. I believe that, as a matter of discipline, it is right for men to salute when they are in uniform. But it is wrong to insist that a soldier in plain clothes, when he meets an officer in the street, shall be compelled to salute, particularly in this community., where all citizens are equal before the law. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. There is nothing to compel a member of the Citizen Forces, in plain clothes, to salute an&#62; officer ; but the practice in regard to the Permanent Forces is really one that degrades the uniform. I say so for this reason - that if a member of the Permanent Forces in plain clothes does not salute an officer, the punishment may be that he is. not permitted to wear plain clothes for one or two months. Therefore, the wearing, of the uniform becomes a penalty instead of being a source of pride. Every soldier ought to be proud of his uniform. But, although the regulation does not apply to the Citizen Forces, I can tell the House that not very long ago I was attending a military class, where the main point of the lecture was that, if one met a senior officer when in plain clothes, one ought to salute him. The advice given by this officer was that if one did not desire to salute, one should stand aside, or look into a shop window until the senior officer had passed. That seems ridiculous, and of course I am not going to give names ; although it would be a good . thing to do, so if the Minister desires to have them. But in this community, where every man has equal rights before the law, we do not want to import ridiculous practices of that kind. What I have said shows that the pages of the <inline font-style="italic">Book of Snobs</inline> seem to require an appendix. Another matter to which I wish to refer is &#39; the right of members of the Forces to express their views in the press. I know there is a good deal of jealousy in this House as to the right of a member of the forces to speak or write about matters connected with the service. In my opinion, however, if there is no breach of confidence, or if what is said is not prejudicial to the service, all members of the forces should have an equal right in this respect. It appears that any officer at head-quarters may write to the newspapers as much as he pleases ; so much so, that It is scarcely possible to take up a Sydney newspaper without finding an interview, for example, with Brigadier-General Gordon. I should like to know whether the Minister is responsible for the following statement by that officer, and whether the scheme there outlined is to be included in the expenditure on account of the proposed new state of affairs? - </para>

                        <para>That is not all. We are putting the wages in the hands of the people. I consider the Government should build model buildings for their workmen, as private firms - the great gun-maker, Krupp, of Germany; Lever Brothers, of Sunlight Soap; and Cadbury, of the chocolates - have built them. Then they should build a model town of little homes and gardens within the limits of the municipality of Lithgow, so that their employes should enjoy the best condititons of living possible. I would have the Government make no profit, but just get from their tenants the interest they have to pay on the capital borrowed. You see, they will be quite sure of their tenants and of the best class of tenants. In that way the Commonwealth would be in possession of a set of employes who would not be at the beck and call of any rise in the value of land, or in rents, caused by any circumstances that may happen. They would be satisfied that they had good homes, sanitation, gardens - yes, and even amusements - playgrounds, and swimming baths - provided at a reasonable cost; and I think that if that is the case there will be very little trouble with the employes in the future. If any did not care for those conditions they could go elsewhere. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have no objection to such information being made public, but the same principle ought to apply from the top to the bottom. A little while ago I suggested that every man in the forces should be permitted to send in a written report containing his opinion of the Government defence scheme. That suggestion was acted upon, but we find that the reports, instead of going direct to the Minister of Defence, have to be sent through the District Commandants. Any criticism, therefore, on the District Commandants, or on the present system of administration has to pass those officers; and we can well understand what would be the result of any adverse comments. The honorable member for Adelaide has several times asked for the production of those reports without success; and, although there is a deep feeling of dissatisfaction throughout the forces, I should be very much surprised, indeed, to find any adverse criticism in the ones which were forwarded. Honorable members may remember that I made a request some time ago that the regulations under the Bill should be submitted for consideration by Parliament in order to ascertain whether they are drawn and administered in the democratic spirit we desire. As a matter of fact, however, we find that the whole of the work done by Parliament in passing a defence measure is rendered absolutely nugatory by regulations which are prepared and administered by bureaucratic officials. For that reason I am sorry that the House will not appoint the Committee which I suggested, and which I shall make anothereffort <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> have brought into existence. I should now like to draw the attention of honorable members to clause 4, wherein it will be seen that the word &#34;garrison&#34; is struck out, meaning that the Field Artillery will in future be permanent. The Minister ought to remember that, according to the proviso in sub-clause  58B,  clause 8, the Field Artillery may be trained for a term not exceeding twenty-eight days. </para>

In view of the limitation of the training to twenty-eight days I remind the Minister of Lord Wolseley&#39;s comments on the fact that, under the territorial scheme in England, the Field Artillery was to be trained for only forty-two days. On the 20th May last I asked the Minister if he had noticed a cable relating to Lord Wolseley&#39;s criticism, and whether the Government agreed with it, and he replied that he approved of Lord Wolseley&#39;s remarks. </para>

The Inspector-General of the Military Forces points out in one of the first paragraphs of his report, dated 28th February, 1908, that the Council is not doing the work it is paid to do, and is supposed to do. Otherwise he would never recommend the creation of a new body for the purpose. He sends in reports, and I should like to know who takes any notice of them. I have quoted from his report the recommendation in favour of the appointment of a General Staff to perform the work which the Council of Defence ought to perform, and does not. It should be remembered that I am quoting from the report of the senior officer of our Military Forces, the man who would have to lead them in time of war.

                        <para>Some months ago I recommended that the posts of Deputy Assistant Quartermasters-General in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland be held by officers of the Citizen Forces, whose duties would be mainly in connexion with camps of training, and that the routine work now carried out by the Deputy Assistant QuartermasterGeneral&#39;s Department be distributed amongst the remaining Departments of the District HeadQuarters, the Senior Ordnance Officer, and the District Paymaster. The three officers of the Administrative and Instructional Staff now holding appointments as Deputy Assistant Quartermasters-General in these Districts could then give the whole of their time to instructional work, which would include forming and conducting Classes of Instruction to prepare Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers for examination and promotion. I consider that the time of these three permanent officers is to a great extent being wasted. </para>

                            <para>- I know that the  Deputy  Assistant Quartermaster-General in Victoria is not out of the Commonwealth. I have nothing to say against these officers personally. If a man is given a soft job at a good salary, I do not think he is under any obligation to make a public struggle to get out of it. The point I make is that the Inspector-General of the Military Forces, who is paid ^&#163;1,500 a year to- go round and point out these things, does that ditty, and no action is taken. Dealing with Instructional Staff Officers, the criticism is that they should do less office work&#39; and more instructional work. We have a good many Instructional Staff Officers in Australia, and the one thing that some of them cannot do is to give military instruction. I have read out a list of the duties imposed upon Instructional Staff Officers, and I have shown that it appears to be one of their duties to get hold of the newspapers. We know that in the case of one of these officers, instead of his time being devoted to instruction, it was devoted to the organization of the recent review. I have .not referred to the matter publicly before, but I was very glad to hear what the honorable member for Laanecoorie had to say as to the way in which that review was - not organized, but disorganized. Nothing which the honorable member said was too severe. Men were kept hanging about for hours; they were told to parade at 9.30 a~m. for a march past at 2.30 p.m., and were compelled to stand for hours on sodden ground. Then again the arrangements for the supply of food to the Americans went wrong. There was no programme. The experience gained by the review at Sydney should have enabled the whole arrangements to be properly carried out, but as it was a state of disorganization prevailed. On the following day, however, the usual &#34;office puff&#34; was published. We were told that the review had been magnificently carried out and that its success proved that there were in the Commonwealth forces at least two officers who knew how to organize troops. It was probably written by one of them. </para>

                            <para>- Another point that I wish to make is that the Instructional Staff carries out its instructions in an extraordinary manner. A short time ago a whole day was given to an examination of militia officers who wished -to pass for the rank of lieutenant-colonel. The candidates were called on to handle a &#39;large body of troops at Heidelberg, and the examination was a very severe and thorough one. Three months later an examination of two officers of the Permanent Staff took place. A hastily gathered parade on a Saturday afternoon took place  nt Heidelberg; only a few troops were taken out, the proceedings lasted about an hour, and the orders given, to those who heard and understood them, were simply ridiculous. That is the sort of thing that is going on. Is it any wonder that militia officers are dissatisfied when they find different standards adopted at examinations of permanent and militia officers? instead of the permanent officer having to undergo the move severe examination he is passed through a very simple test by his own friends. </para>

                            <para>-  I am told that it is; but that matter can be dealt with more effectively by my honorable friend. Another complaint that I have to make is that this House does not obtain straightforward information. I have already shown that the Minister is very badly served by his officers. Statements are made to him, and not being conversant with technical details he accepts the information that is placed in his hands. When he makes a promise in this House it is reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and some one in his Department reads that report. That, at all events, is the practice in other Departments. </para>

                            <para>- Some one reads it for the Minister, and there should be in the Department an officer charged with the duty of seeing that promises made by the Minister in this House are carried out. Instead of that, we find that, as I have shown, a promise made by him as far back as mid April last has not yet been fulfilled. I also wish to show that the House has been frequently misled by information supplied in answer to questions, and I am glad to be able to quote chapter and verse in support of my contention. Two or three days after the opening of the present session I asked the Minister of Defence the following question - </para>

                            <para>- There may be nothing wrong about that, but if the answer supplied to my question was false we have good cause for complaint. On another occasion I asked the Minister, as reported at page  435  of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the present session, whether a circular had not been issued by which a right enjoyed by men under the regulations, to complain in writing to the final military authority, had not been varied. I quoted a circular issued by the chief staff officer, refusing to permit warrant, non-commissioned officers, and. privates to minute papers, and I inquired, &#34; Is this practice still continued in the Department.&#34; To the last inquiry the Minister replied, &#34; Not that I am aware of. Further inquiry will be made.&#34; A further inquiry was made of the Minister as to whether this had not been the practice in his Department during a definite time, and it was denied. I have the minute here - </para>

Regiment.  13  - In regard to minutes  10  and  11  (of the N.C.O.) attention is called to circular No. 7 dated  29-8-04,  with reference to the signing of minutes by W.O.&#39;s and N.C.O.&#39;s of Instructional Staff. By order, (Sgd.) J. H. Bruche, <inline font-weight="bold">Major, D.A.A.G.</inline> &#34; By order &#34; means by order of the District Commandant, and I venture to say that the Minister has not looked into this matter. The point we have to consider is not whether the question involved is trifling or important, but whether the House has not a right to receive truthful answers to questions put to Ministers. If my complaint is not further considered I shall have to bring it forward as a question of privilege. The rights of Parliament are infringed when false information is given to it by an officer through the Minister. </para>

                            <para>- Not in the German sense. May I point out to the Minister that even the English system with which there was general satisfaction when the Defence Bill of 1904 was brought in, and of which our system is a far too slavish copy, is breaking down. Writing on the 16th August, 1907, the military correspondent of <inline font-style="italic">The Times</inline> says - </para>

                    <para>There is thus much which appears to cause the new command to be regarded as one of doubtful wisdom, and we have to seek the real motive and excuse for the creation of the new appointment in other considerations. The Duke of Connaught was appointed Inspector-General of the Forces on 1st May, 1904, and his duties were regulated by an Order in Council a few days later. In a higher military sense the appointment has not given the results expected. His Royal Highness has not been invariably well treated. </para>
                    <para>Nor has our Inspector-General. </para>
                    <para>He has not been kept sufficiently in touch with  the proceedings of the War Office. His reports, reputed to be of much value, have not seen the light and the public has no knowledge whether the recommendations which have followed his inspections have or have not been carried out. There has been little or no visible influence upon the organization and administration of the Army arising from his inspections and reports. One Minister, no longer in office, went so far as to suggest that the Duke should alter one of his reports. The presence of the Inspector-General, of the Chief of the General Staff, and of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief at Aldershot at the Essex manoeuvres in 1904 led to such confusion of authority that we have been practically unable to hold great </para>
                    <para>Manoeuvres ever since. </para>
                    <para>It is clear that, when a new Inspector-General is appointed, his duties must be revised and his sphere of influence be more accurately delimitated. Here we come at once into a region of conflicting opinions upon the higher governance of the Army. The Secretary of State&#39;s colleagues of the Army Council should be the first chiefs of the Army ; they should combine authority with patronage and power, and delegate inspection to one of their own members. An Inspector-General with a seat on the Council would strengthen this governing body and would speak and act in its name. </para>
                    <para class="block">There is evidence that in England the system that we followed is already producing results which show how unsatisfactory it is. Our conditions are widely different from those of England, but because it adopted a Council of Defence, we followed its example without having the same conditions or the same ability to draw upon. The late Minister of Defence experienced the same trouble. Shortly before he left office, he expressed his opinion on the systems existing in the Department. With reference to the Ordnance Department - </para>

The Victorian Railways do not want defence work, as correspondence from that Department, signed by the Secretary, gave instructions for it to be stopped as long ago as 1897. Notwithstanding that the difficulties were smoothed over, and the work continued. The fitter in charge of defence work at Newport received 2s. 6d. per day from the Defence Department in addition to his railway pay for supervising defence work. Yet all this work was supervised by the Defence Department&#39;s own officer, the I.O.M., whose salary is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;540.In1898,</inline> machinery to the extent of about &#163;700 was purchased and placed in the Victorian Ordnance Stores in order to do all departmental work, but even then, and even now, it is continued at Newport, whereas if the Department were to do its own work, all cost for&#34; supervision, use of tools, &#38;c, could easily have been avoided, by engaging one or two extra men by the Defence Department. The only extra cost would then have been their wages.

The engineering work for the Defence Department is at present suffering through being so much decentralized, and that which we are doing in Sydney is nearly all on guns which have been condemned as obsolete by the Defence Committee and the Military Board. There is work now being done at Newport for Western Australia and Queensland. If all Defence work could be centralized in a proper establishment where the manufacture of small arms ammunition could be carried on, also the manufacture of stores, heavy gun ammunition, gun carriages and all other gear required by the Department, not only would there be a great saving possible, but there would also be a great gain to the </para>
                        <para class="block">Department in having its own officers gaining experience in that direction. The Defence workshops have been criticised by a retiring officer  as  an expensive luxury, but when the Newport accounts, and the English orders are taken into consideration, this so-called expensive luxury could easily be converted into a commercial and active industry, giving more than value for any outlay incurred. It would be hard to break down opposition, as there are people in the Department whose interests are best served by orders going abroad. I see from the press that Armstrong&#39;s representative in Australia is a  Col. Stanley.  I don&#39;t know if that is our  Col. Stanley,  but, if so, how can we expect to manufacture our own material when such men are representatives of English firms? It  would  be interesting to know if there are other firms, such as Vickers, Maxim, &#38;c, with representatives in Australia. One point with reference to the conversion of the Tasmanian gun may be  worth  mentioning, and that is, that the extra remuneration given for supervision to the fitter in charge of the work was &#163;36. This amount could have been saved had the work been done in the Defence Department&#39;s own workshop. </para>

With Japan alert and vicious and armed, the control of the Pacific to be yet asserted ; China, answering the call of the West to test its latent strength ; India made restless by the weakening of traditional faiths, and the fertilization of&#39; the native mind with Western thoughts and ideals, there were possibilities that might make a deep draught upon their undoubted reserves of strength. If the East ever became the centre of conflict and power, it would be for them, who represented the Northern races in strange seas, the civilization of Europe some  12,000  miles from its source, with the spirit and devotion of their forefathers, to guard the sacred fire. </para>

Although labour meetings may, on May Day, pass resolutions against militarism, it is because of the protection of the military that they are able to do so; and to that they owe their industrial supremacy. </para>

                            <para>- The organization is a live one, and if the representatives of the Labour Party wish to change their opinions they are perfectly entitled to do so. But to those who are endeavouring to change the platform of that party I should like to commend the following words by General Ian Hamilton, in speaking of the barriers which exist between the workers of the east and the west, between a white nation like Australia and the people of the Orient - </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>What, then, are these barriers? They are the safeguards imposed by fleets and armies, by what is called militarism. What but the  army  and fleet serving under the Stars and Stripes lends any significance to a declaration by American labour leaders that Chinese Coolies must be excluded from the States? But for those military forces the least that even a pacifically inclined China could do to retain its own self-respect would be to retaliate by ordering every American ship, concessionaire - merchant, missionary, and globe-trotter to disappear from the middle kingdom within twenty-four hours. If a generation hence China found herself faced only by Europeans and Americans who had beaten their swords into policemen&#39;s batons, she would then be free to set to work and starve them to death with Celestial serenity. Under conditions of perpetual peace and that industrial and social inequality of all men, without which perpetual peace is a fantastic dream, the Chinaman, as I have seen him in Manchuria, is as capable of destroying the white working man of the present type and driving him from the face of the earth, as was the brown rat of  destroying  and driving out from England that excellent but less strenuous, less omnivorous black rat who had preceded him. The Socialists who gaily flaunt the words &#34;Unity of Labour&#34; on their banners little dream where their theories would lead them to in practice.&#39; Is it, then, to be the fate of the white man ultimately to sink and disappear? It depends, in my humble opinion, on whether he has the good sense to close his ears to those who tell him that wars and preparations for wars are pure evil, and that pure unadulterated commercialism would be an earthly paradise instead of the Limbo of dead souls which I personally should conceive it to be. It is heroism, self-sacrifice, and chivalry which redeem war and build up national character. What play do the heroic qualities find in the ignoble struggle between nations for commercial supremacy with stock exchanges and wheat pits for their battle-fields? It seems to me that the working men must take their choice. They must, as the world seems at present constituted, either accept the militarism, with its occasional wars, or else elect for one long, cruel, life and death struggle against a rival worker who will certainly ruin them in the end. </para>
                    <para class="block">I feel that the attempt by America to exclude the Chinese is largely paralleled by our own efforts in that direction. The United States only partially exclude the Chinese and other Oriental races, whereas we exclude them completely. America is a strong nation, Australia is a weak one, and if the words I have quoted are true of the former they are doubly true of the latter. I regret the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Flinders. A German pastor who recently returned from England has declared his conviction that if Germany desires peace she will have to build ships, and there is not the slightest doubt that if Australia desires peace she must prepare for war. Although I believe that the attack by the honorable member for Flinders is largely prompted by party feeling - that it is an attempt to injure the Government and to block this Bill- </para>

                        It is somewhat foreign to the discussion of a Bill of this kind ; but it would be most useful if indulged in when the Estimates of the Department were under consideration. Before dealing with the Bill itself, I propose to refer to one or two matters mentioned by the honorable member - matters of which I have some slight knowledge. He declared that the Field Artillery - with which I have been connected for nearly forty years - has been proved to be the weak spot in our defence system. With that statement I shall deal when I come to speak of the existing Defence Force. I shall then give reasons why that branch of the service is weak, and I shall suggest what I conceive to be the remedy for that weakness. I regard the charge of misfeasance which the honorable member has made in connexion with the Ordnance Department as a most serious one.

If he is employed in the workshops and has supplied false information, he ought to be summarily dealt with. If, on the other hand, his statements are true, the officers who have privately benefited by making unjustifiable use of the Ordnance workshops ought to be severely dealt with. In the interests of the public service and of the Defence Force, the matter ought not to be allowed to rest where it is. </para>

                        - I do not see that that circumstance affects this question at all. I could quote instances of a similar character which have occurred in Queensland. The honorable member also emphasized the desirableness of getting all work connected with the conversion of guns in Australia undertaken- locally, and he quoted reasons-  why this course should be adopted. But I would point out that there are two sides to every question. It has come under my notice that the cord used in the manufacture of breeches for the Queensland mounted forces is of very poor quality indeed.

                        - The statement is in the Minister&#39;s office, and also a pair of breeches, as a specimen which was sent after four days&#39; wear, although I believe&#39; it was erroneously alleged that it had had only one day&#39;s wear. It was sent, I think, to Sydney,  and the answer received was that the damage appeared to have been done by a man falling down and tearing it. However, the whole regiment did not fall down, and I understand that this was only a fair specimen of the whole of the cord after being worn. Consequently, there is a converse side to the question. If this work is to be done in Australia it ought to be most carefully supervised, and thorough experts should be employed to check it. The honorable member for Corio also referred to the privilege that he would confer on members of the Defence Force of communicating with the press, and being allowed a freedom in criticising their superior officers, which is certainly not usual in any Government Department. Nothing could be more subversive of discipline than such a procedure. As to saluting, my own impression is that in a military force, at all events, where discipline is one of the most essential factors for success, no man should be above saluting his superior officer whenever he sees him. There is no degradation in it. It is merely a recognition of the other&#39;s superior rank.

                        - I should if they belonged -to the regular forces. In the case of the citizen forces I certainly should not insist on it. I draw the line at that. I do not hesitate to give ray opinion from a fairly extended experience in the defence forces. I began as a gunner thirty-six or thirty-seven years ago, and from then till now, whenever I have met my superior officer in the street, I have never hesitated to take off my hat to him as a mark of respect. I have suffered no indignity by it.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- The principle is the same. It is a mark of respect. It may be regarded broadly as a matter of mere courtesy, as from inferiors to superiors in rank in a military organization. This Bill is one pf the most important that has come before this Parliament. It deals with two subjects, which have been probably as fertile as, if not more fertile! than, any others in provoking controversy and dissension, or, at all events, discussion, for centuries. One is the question of the defence of the country in which the disputants happen to reside, and the other is the great question of the liberty of the subject. Federation was accomplished very largely, I might almost say principally, for, the purpose of adjusting and bringing to a better state of organization our military and naval forces. That was urged as one of the leading reasons why Federation should be brought about. Prior to that we had,  comparatively speaking, efficient forces in all the different Colonies, as the States were then called, but they were under separate Acts, different Governments, and different military commands, entirely independent of one another, and the systems varied more or less. But, roundly speaking, the system was practically the same throughout Australia, having been arrived at through experience by the various Governments and Parliaments as the one best adapted to the conditions of life in this continent. That men nt the development of what has since been called the militia from the old volunteer forces. The fusion of the States commands took place immediately after Federation, and then came the present Defence Act, based, as were also the Defence Acts of nearly all the Colonies, upon the Act passed in Queensland in 1884, at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, with the assistance of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> French, who was then Commandant. That was the first occasion, so far as I know, upon which,&#39; in any British community, the principle of compulsory service, as we have hitherto understood it, was. passed into law. Happily it has not been necessary so far to put that law into force, and, I believe, it never will be. I allude, of course, to the sections of the various Defence Acts, and of the present Commonwealth Act, which make every adult male between certain ages, in case of danger of war, compellable to serve his country in the ranks. Most thoughtful men agree with that, although there are exceptions, such as those referred to by -the honorable member for Corio, who have addressed honorable members by circular, urging that they have conscientious scruples against bearing arms. We know that certain religious bodies have such scruples, but, excepting them, and excepting, also, thorough &#34; wasters &#34;  -  I do not wish it to be understood that I am classing those religious bodies with the &#34; wasters,&#34; by whom I mean certain people who are utterly careless of these matters, and who would shirk any responsibility for the defence of their country if they could, quite irrespective of conscientious scruples - most thoughtful men will agree with the axiom laid down by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence, that every able-bodied man in the community should be compellable, in case of emergency, to assist in the defence of his country. </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON. - Yes. Of course, it may be said that both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence have gone a good deal further, but a man cannot actually join in the defence of his country unless there is an attack upon it, so that, after all, they are stating nothing more than&#34; what appears in the present Defence Act. The next axiom which I think most people accept - at all events, those do who accept the first - is that it is necessary to train the adult male population, or, at all events, to see that they have been sufficiently trained, before they reach manhood, to enable them to bear their part in the defence of the country when called upon, in such a way as not to go into the ranks as the merest raw recruits. </para>

                        Quite so. The whole force must be a complete military machine or organization based on what has been found to be best by the experience of centuries. Although it is most desirable for the sake of national safety that all adult males should be trained to as great a degree of efficiency  in military affairs as is possible, there are certain limitations. Theoretically, the best way to obtain the most effective results would be to make every man a soldier. That would afford the best means of defence for any country, but it cannot be done. &#39; Respect must be had for our industries. The business of the country must be carried on, and so most nations have solved the difficulty by establishing standing armies of paid soldiers. The Prime Minister - I cannot lay my hands on his exact words - laid down the principle that it was undesirable that a certain selected set of men should be paid for doing work - that of defending the country - in which everybody should share. The Minister of Defence, elaborating that argument, spoke of only 20,000 men in the Defence Forces doing the work of 800,000.

When it comes to actual fighting, admitting that we cannot put our whole population into the field, we must adopt the principle of paying certain men ; for I do not suppose that any one wants a soldier to fight for the defence of his country without being paid. So that it is merely a question of degree - of the extent to which any community is willing to make sacrifices for the purpose of having a portion of its male population specially trained for defence purposes. </para>

                        In my opinion the voluntary system will answer, supplemented by certain early military training. If we train every man in the community in the manner in which it is proposed under this Bill that men shall be trained, we shall undoubtedly have a very large number of men away from their civil occupations, whilst, in my opinion, a sufficient amount of training can be secured without such sacrifices. It is generally accepted as a principle that preparations for war should be governed by the reasonable probabilities of the immediate future rather than by remoter possibilities. That is especially true in regard to armaments. Not much more than a decade elapses before armaments in any branch of the service become obsolete. Every ten years or thereabouts, we get a new pattern of gun, and a new drill. The same remark is also true to a very large extent, in regard to
                        <inline font-style="italic">personnel;</inline>
                        because, although we cannot train our men sufficiently in a short time, still a few years&#39; training is quite sufficient to enable a number of men to become very useful soldiers. The Bill before us deals both with naval and military matters. The salient feature of it is compulsory service. A little later on I shall draw a comparison between the designation &#34;universal training &#34; given to the system proposed in this Bill, and &#34;compulsory service.&#34; The Minister of Defence has described the relative cost of the scheme under which we now work, and that which it is proposed shall become the law. I cannot imagine how so large a number of men as it is proposed to train, can be trained for the outlay indicated by the Minister. Of course, I have no means of checking his figures. It must be purely a matter of speculation from my point of view. But the question of cost is not confined to the actual outlay by the Treasury. We have also to add the value of the labour of the men who are to be taken away from their civil avocations to attend camps for three weeks in each year. Even if they were paid 17s. 6d. per week each, to arrive at the cost to the country, we have to add to that amount the sum which they would have earned had not their services been required for military training.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON. - We must take into consideration some factors of considerable importance which have not been sufficiently dwelt upon. First, we must consider our  geographical position. Every one knows that the insular position of Great Britain has been the greatest protection she has had against attack in the past, and it will be so in the future. We are much more insulated than Great Britain is. It would be far more difficult to conduct an oversea invasion of Australia than of Great Britain, owing to the enormous distance that would have to be traversed by the attacking power, and the extensive line of communications&#39; that would have to be kept up. It also has to be remembered that we are an integral part of a great naval Empire. It seems to me to be inconceivable that during this generation or the next there should be the slightest fear of an invasion of Australia. </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON. - If the British Navy were wiped off the face of the earth - be cause that is what it comes to - I do not know what would Happen. But so long as there are&#39; British ships to intercept a line of communications, no armed occupation could be maintained. </para>
                    <para>No such expedition has ever been carried to a successful conclusion unless this condition has been fulfilled, and some of the greatest military disasters recorded in history have resulted from failure to secure or retain the assured sea command which is essential for the prosecution of an oversea campaign. </para>
                    <para class="block">I will go so far as to say that if the Boers had had a fleet which the British Navy had failed to wipe off the seas, we could never have carried on the campaign in South Africa, because we could not have relied upon supplies coming forward. The campaign would have had to be abandoned. It is not necessary that the protecting squadron should be in any way commensurate with the invaders&#39; naval force as regards strength or numbers ; but as long as the protecting power has ships on the sea which are at liberty to intercept the line of communications, any continuance of an occupation of Australia would be impossible. If the Empire were engaged in war with a European Power, or with two Powers, what should we have to provide for? Assuming for the sake of argument that, instead of the British Fleet having blocked up the fleets of the hostile powers, the latter had overcome and rendered the strength of the British Navy to such an extent inoperative that they were able to make an invasion, still, if Britain could keep ships afloat, and at liberty to roam the seas, the enemy&#39;s lines of communication would unquestionably be disturbed and interfered with, and, as I said before, a continuance of the invasion would be impossible. Can any one conceive it possible that during this generation or the next, no matter what advance may be made by other European powers in naval construction - even though Great Britain were to be utterly out built - the British Navy will get so far behind, relatively speaking, as not to be in the position I have described? </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- I am not saying that it should. And the converse of what I have indicated holds good. A hostile power may, notwithstanding the present enormous preponderance of the British Fleet, still be able to avoid the British cruisers, and to make raids on our shores ; and for that we should be prepared. But an invasion in force is almost inconceivable within the life of any living man. No nation would dare to risk it. I do not suggest for one moment that we should depend entirely on the British Fleet for our defence. </para>

                        - I have done so for a great many years, thus giving, at all events, an indication of my personal feeling that it is desirable for Australia to be in a position to take part, not only in her own defence, but in the defence of the Empire. We are aware that no Australian militiaman, or, for the matter of that, no member of the permanent forces, is compelled to serve outside Australia; but, in the event of Great Britain being involved in war, and there being any necessity for such a step, I am quite sure the manhood of Australia would flock in tens of thousands, as they have done before, for voluntary service of the Empire elsewhere.

                        - Are officers to be taken away from their vocations for a longer period than three weeks at a time in each year? I am afraid I shall have to ask the Minister for a good deal of information on points of that kind. There is another factor we have to consider in connexion with the training of Australians - a factor already touched on in the interjection of the honorable member for Barker - and that is their natural aptitude for military exercises. I have never met an officer or non-commissioned officer brought from the Old Country for instructional purposes in Australia, but who has said - and I have made a. point of asking questions on the subject - that he was astonished at the facility with which Australians appeared to grasp instructions. Whatever the reason may be I cannot say - it may be that it is a superior education, or the freer life - but in my experience the testimony is unanimous that in six weeks, or not much more, an average Australian can be trained to as great an efficiency as would require twelve months in the case of an ordinary English recruit.

                        There may be something in that, but, whatever the explanation may be, the fact remains. To revert for one moment to the British Fleet, I desire to point out that, although there has been a redistribution, which has been commented on by the Minister of Defence, and also by the honorable member for West Sydney, as indicating a weakness on. the part of the Admiralty, the leading members of both the great political parties in- Great Britain have declared, and continue to declare - and
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winston</inline>
                        Churchill reiterated only two days ago - that the British Government are determined to maintain the two-power standard. And, in my opinion, it is no indication of any weakening of the naval strength of Great Britain that the fleet has been concentrated in the North Sea and the neighbourhood of the English Channel ; the movement is for strategical purposes, and with a view to increased strength for the purpose of striking. The only two naval powers in the Pacific at this moment worth considering, from the British point of view, are Japan and the United States, one of which is our close ally, and the other, though, perhaps, not actually an ally, is on the most friendly terms with Great Britain.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON. - A younger brother, if he is big. According to the policy which has been laid down by all great commanders, fleets are for the purpose of &#34;wiping out&#34; or &#34;bottling up&#34; the enemy&#39;s ships in order, for the one reason, if none other, that our own transports shall have free access to the enemy&#39;s shores. Where can the naval strength, of which Great Britain could possibly have reason to take notice, be said to lie at the present time? Is it not in the North Sea and European waters? Difficulties with Japan  are impossible at the present time, and the same may be said of the United States; and, therefore, the British Fleet is taken where it will be able to strike most effectively against any possible enemy. </para>

                        That was not the only place until the conclusion of the treaty with Japan and the crippling of the Chinese fleet. Formerly there was a powerful Chinese fleet, and a Russian squadron at Vladivostock, and we were not on the best of terms with Russia; but now it may be said, for  all practical purposes, that there are only two great naval powers in the Pacific, with each of which Great Britain is on the most friendly terms.

                        - Naturally, not as I conceive, for the purpose of merely protecting Great Britain from invasion, but for the purpose of striking early and crushing blows at the fleets of possible enemies. Now I come to a question, which is undoubtedly somewhat delicate, but which -I do not propose to shirk. I have already -said that I cannot conceive that, during this or the next generation, we shall be in any danger of invasion. So far as one, humanly speaking, can see into the future, our connexion with the Mother Country will certainly last that period, and we shall have the benefit of the protection of the British Fleet, or, as it may become known later, the fleet of the Empire. But we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that we in Australia have decided on -a policy which may, and, in my opinion, not improbably will, raise one of the most . difficult questions which the British Empire has yet to face - the great race question. We have declared that we shall have a White Australia - that we shall have no Asiatics here - and there is no probability of our abandoning that policy. On the other hand, Great Britain has teeming millions of subjects in India, and alliances and friendly relations with other great Asiatic nations; and we have already had an instance in South Africa of the delicate nature of the negotiations undertaken in connexion with the coolie question. Whatever the future may, have for us, it seems to me that there might be an endeavour on the part of, let us say China, for the sake of argument - not next year., in the next ten years, or even the next forty years, but possibly- later - assuming that that nation wakes in the sense that Japan has awakened, to force its way into Australia in exactly the same way as Great Britain forced its way into China in the past. Therein lies the necessity for our taking strong measures for the defence of this country. It might be difficult for the Mother Country to recognise and give complete effect to our desire in regard to such a matter. One cannot possibly foretell what might happen. We can only imagine the possibilities, and it is the possibilities, even though they may be very remote, with which we have to deal, or to make provision for. Coming to the Bill, let me say that the Prime Minister in December mentioned that the details of the Government scheme when it appeared would be fully made known to honorable members. Has that prediction been fulfilled? I think not.

                        - I wish to know a great many things. 1 wish to know what the regulations are going to be. So far as I can see, the honorable member for Corio has very  aptly said that this Bill may be regarded as a blank cheque to be given by Parliament, to be filled in according to the sweet will of the Government. I am disposed to regard the Bill as a framework on which to hang a uniform. There is a great paucity of detail in the measure, and if the honorable gentleman who introduced it will permit me to say so, there was paucity of detail in the speech in which he mo&#39;ved the second reading.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- The system proposed is called universal training, but for my part I am unable to distinguish it from compulsory service. In the Bill itself in some clauses the training is called service, and in others the service is called training. The speech of the Minister was characterized by the same peculiarity. In the first place, whether training or service, what is proposed is certainly not universal, because should this Bill become law there would be an enormous number of exemptions; and, in fact, the residents of whole districts might be exempted. </para>

                        That is what we do not know. No principle is laid down governing the exemptions. The Governor-General is to be given power to make regulations by which, if he chose to do so, though of course he would not, he might render the measure inoperative by exempting the residents of nearly every district in the Commonwealth. Undoubtedly under this Bill the exemptions will be very extensive. Any one who knows the conditions of the sparsely-populated districts of the interior must be aware that it would be almost impossible to carry out the principles of this Bill in, a very large number of those districts, unless it is proposed to bring men many hundreds of miles to some place at which they could undergo their training. That would involve an enormous expense, and I should like to know whether the time occupied in travelling to and from the place at which the training is given would have to be taken out of the three weeks provided for? Difficulties of this kind are best illustrated by extreme instances, and I could mention districts in Queensland where it would be impossible for a man to travel from his place of residence to any place at which it would be possible to assemble a sufficient number of men to justify the holding of a camp of training, and return in very much under the three weeks allowed.

                        What is the difference between training and service ? I understand that all military service embraces military training, because a man is being trained while he is serving. I should like to know what is meant by the training which does not amount to service, and which, apparently, is intended to be the kind of training provided for in this Bill. Failing anything in the Bill, or in the second-reading speech of the Minister of Defence, to indicate what is intended, each member is obliged to adopt his own method of arriving at the correct interpretation. If a man is enrolled in a body fully officered and equipped as a fighting machine and made up or divided into companies, battalions, batteries, and so on, and is subject to military law and discipline, he undoubtedly belongs to a military organization. Serving in it, his service is military service. If, on the other hand, we are providing in this Bill merely for training, and enlistment and enrolment do not mean enlistment and enrolment in a military organization intended to engage in fighting as an army, what is being provided for is merely a school of instruction. Which of these two forms of service is intended ? Is it proposed that there shall be a complete military organization in the usual acceptation of the word, capable, as it stands, of entering upon a campaign, or merely that there shall be established a school of instruction? Neither the Bill nor the speech of the Minister has been definite on that point, and I am still in the dark as to what is intended.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- The present concern has, apparently, nearly gone. I am glad to have the Minister&#39;s assurance that it is intended to establish a military organization under this Bill, because it would be a farce to suppose that members of a mere training school could be called out for service unless they were properly organized on military lines. &#34;Since it is intended to provide for a military organization &#34; a force equipped and ready &#34; for active service, I say unhesitatingly that, so far as one can gather from the principles and details comprised in the Bill, it will entirely fail to be of value as a defence force for sudden emergency. Although the establishment provided for may be called a military organization, it would still, practically, have to commence its organization if called upon for active service. </para>

                        No, the honorable member attacked only the administration.  That has nothing to do with this Bill, for the same administration might be continued under this measure. If this Bill is intended to provide for service, it is undoubtedly compulsory service, and why not say so? Why should the Government shy at the words &#34; compulsory service &#34; and, by speaking of &#34; universal training,&#34; seek refuge in something which bears very much the appearance of a subterfuge? I have shown that the training proposed would not be universal. I should have added that all bad  characters  are to be exempted. Under the proposed new section 581, a man would only have to prove that he had been convicted of any disgraceful or infamous crime--

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- What is a disgraceful or infamous crime? A man need only show that he is a bad character to&#39; be exempt from training under this Bill. The training proposed is not universal; but it is compulsory, and we have it now from the Minister of Defence that it is also intended that, it shall be service. There are only two important points in which what is proposed differs from the compulsory service of the Swiss nation. &#39; First of all it is not intended to pay our men, whereas the Swiss do pay their men. </para>

                        three farthings, as a matter of fact. First of all, the Swiss are paid, and in the second place the Swiss service is very much more irksome and a greater tax upon the individual than that proposed in, this Bill. Those are the two main points on which the systems differ, and, &#39;after all, it is only a difference in degree.  The service in each case is practically the same, the only difference being that in Switzerland the men are now called out for sixty-eight days  a year, whereas here it is proposed that they shall be called out for eighteen days per annum. In all other respects the Bill provides for compulsory service.

                        The Bill . provides for what is described as &#34; universal training,&#34; and on the authority of the Minister, who states that this organization will be a going concern, I say that compulsory service is what is aimed at. Let us see if this&#39; organization would be sufficient for the purpose for which it is intended. What about the officers? And here we find a weak point in the Bill. An officer is expected, I presume, to serve three weeks in every year just as the men in the ranks are called upon to do. The Minister has told us, by way of interjection, that it will be possible for the officers to undergo longer terms of service.

                        - I quite agree with the honorable member, and here I repeat we have a weak point in the Bill. What is to be an officer&#39;s compensation ? Are we to contine our officers to men who can afford to leave their employment in order to devote three months, instead of three weeks, in each year to military training?

                        - But, as the honorable member for Corio has most justly pointed out, it is constant intercourse between an officer and his men that makes a corps. When an officer meets his men once or twice a week, he comes to know the respective capacities of his non-commissioned officers, and, through them, to know practically the whole of his command. If we are going in a case of emergency to put a new staff of officers over men whom they have never seen before, we shall not have an efficient force.

                        - Most unsatisfactory. The British militia has provided splendid material for the army, but I would prefer our own militia under the present system, since during the whole year the officers are in constant touch with their men. lt is assumed by a great many people that a militiaman puts in only sixteen days&#39; drill, but, as a matter of fact, in some branches of the militia, the men and their officers are constantly together ; the officers benefiting by this frequent association, and the men benefiting by the instruction which they receive at weekly drills and at week ends.

                        No; but that is not the proposal now before us. The existing system is alleged to be too expensive, and we are told that we should get rid of it. If the weekly drills of the present day ave to be substituted to any extent for the three-weeks&#39; camps, we shall fail largely to get rid of the alleged expense of the existing system. The aggregation of men in a camp for three weeks is said to be far more inexpensive in the matter of training than would be a continuous training throughout the year., as under the present system.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- The Prime Minister has said that the system for which this Bill provides has been found, to work well in a country the physical conditions of which vary in a most remarkable degree from those of Australia. He could have gone much further, and have said that  the physical,  political, social, and economic conditions of Switzerland are vastly different from those prevailing here. The fact that this system has been a success in Switzerland does not argue that it will be successful here. </para>

                        We must do that under any scheme. One of the chief items of expenditure incurred under the present system is said to relate to the cost of travelling to and from camps in connexion with the Easter manoeuvres. That expense will still be incurred to a large extent under the new system. The men cannot always manoeuvre over the same ground. It is even urged in the memorandum issued by the Government that in the course of time this force will be able to undertake movable camps. We have already done that in Queensland, and I believe that the system has been followed in other States.

The force of which I was in command was set loose on a railway line thirty miles from Brisbane which we were to attack. For eight days we struck camp every morning, and on only one occasion did we re-encamp where we had pitched our tents the previous night. By seven o&#39;clock every morning camp was struck, baggage packed, and everything ready for the march. </para>

                        Excellent. The same system would be followed under this Bill, and the same expense would have to be undergone in order that the forces might be adequately trained. I fail to understand how, under this scheme, the officers are to be trained. If a man is not to see his command, or a portion of his command, during eleven months of the year, it is unreasonable to expect the corps to which he belongs to prove efficient when called upon. I was. hopeful that what was really intended was training, and not service - in other words, that we were to have an organization such as we have at present, and that the new system was to be something in the nature of a recruiting ground for our present force. That, I believe, is the true solution of the difficulty. The Minister suggested something of the sort, but was not definite as to the time during which the present force was to be continued. I come now to the question of arms. We have been told by the Prime Minister or the Minister of Defence that every man will retain his uniform. It will be his own property, and he will not be permitted to wear it during eleven months of the year. What sort of uniform will it be at the end of the eight years&#39; period? A man is to wear his uniform for three weeks, and then put it away for eleven months to be moth eaten. At the end of that period he will take it out and wear it again for three weeks, after which it will once more be given over to the moths. Then, again, during this intermittent training extending over eight years is each soldier going to retain his rifle ? If not, how is he to practise rifle shooting, how is he to become a proficient marksman ? If he is to be allowed to retain his rifle, then I prophesy from my experience of the way in which arms are kept by men who hold them free from inspection, that at least 50 per cent. of the rifles distributed will be found useless when they are brought up in connexion with the next annual training.

                        That is a difficulty which is inherent in this intermittent training, and I do not see how it is to be got over. Either a man must have his rifle, or it must remain in the ordnance store. If it remains in the store, the good man who desires to use it, and perhaps take great care of it for the purpose of improving his shooting, will be deprived of that privilege for eleven months of the year. The men will have their rifles for only three weeks.. If, on the other hand, every man is to retain his rifle, we cannot get away from the difficulty of inspecting the rifles, and the almost certainty that more than 50 per cent. of them will have become useless at the end of the year when the men have, to go up again. I desire now to refer to the present force. I quite agree with the Minister that since Federation there has been a distinct improvement in the Defence Force. For a great many years I served in the volunteers, and since 1884 I have served in the militia. I can unhesitatingly say that there is a distinct improvement. The knowledge of manoeuvres and tactics, exhibited at the annual camps, is distinctly superior to what it was eight or ten years ago.

                        I must be understood to be speaking only of the State in which my experience has been gained. The administration under the Military Board has been at least as satisfactory as it was when there was a General Officer Commanding. To my mind, things have worked more smoothly since the advent of the Board&#39; than they did previously. Of course, there are, as there always have been, and, I presume, always will be, complaints of administration in military matters. Undoubtedly a great organization of that kind cannot be carried on without some mistakes. So far my experience is that the Board is more approachable, if I may use that expression, than was Major-General Hutton.

                        - Yes ; and my experience with them was satisfactory. I confess that there is a great deal to be said on both sides. But the honorable member advocates the appointment of a responsible General Officer Commanding. One is naturally inclined to cast his memory back to the dissensions and the difficulties which arose out of disagreements between the General Officer Commanding and the Minister. It goes without saying that a Defence force, whether it be naval or military, must be under the absolute control of a Minister responsible to Parliament. It required a great deal of tact on the part of the various Commandants as they were called in those days, and probably also on the part of the General Officer Commanding, who preceded the institution of the Board, in order to avoid - though in some instances they did not avoid - conflicts with their Ministers. One notable instance was that of a naval Commandant in Queensland who, because his vessels - two gun-boats and a torpedo boat - had authority to fly the white ensign, defied the Minister, and was going to take them to Sydney, and report himself with them to the Admiral.

                        the Premier of the day, who was administering the Defence Department, sent a posse of constables on board, and arrested the whole lot; the civil arm prevailed against the naval arm. That was the end of Captain Wright. That is an instance of what some men placed in a position of that sort will assume to themselves. If those constables had arrived an hour later, the vessels would have left Moreton Bay, and would not have shown up again until they appeared in Sydney Harbor. I do not know what would have happened to them. I believe that the Admiral very properly condemned the whole proceeding. It ended all right for everybody except Captain Wright.

                        - Wright was wrong in that case. One criticism which the honorable member levelled at the present system and the control of the Board was the absence of  schemes of defence for the various States. I was on the Council of Defence for Queensland. Every year we met and prepared a scheme of defence which was marked &#34; secret.&#34; A sealed copy  of  it was kept by each member of the body under lock and key. That system probably obtained in other Colonies too. Does it not occur to the honorable member  for  Corio that the fact that I do not know anything of any scheme of defence for Queensland now is no indication that there is not a scheme in existence? He must remember that the whole system of the administration of our defence has been concentrated in Melbourne, and I take it for granted that something analogous, only on a very much wider scale, to the scheme of defence which used to be drawn up in each Colony is now drawn up for the whole of Australia.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON. - It was kept very carefully, and it was a very admirable system. Undoubtedly some such method as that ought to be adopted for the Commonwealth. I quite agree with one remark of the Minister, and that was that, in regard to volunteers, the experience of the Commonwealth has been the same as was that of each Colony before Federation. The establishment of a militia system killed the volunteers. I served for twelve or fourteen years in the Volunteer Force, but, in Queensland, on the establishment of the militia, all, or nearly all, the volunteers became militiamen. In the Queensland Act of 1884 provision was made for the establishment of new volunteer corps, and a good many were established, but not one of them can be said to have teen a success. The Minister has stated that only one in three of the volunteers throughout Australia attend the annual camps. I should imagine from my experience that that is a very liberal estimate. Probably less than that proportion attend. </para>

                        They do. Some prefer to join the volunteer regiments, because they consider that as volunteers they are a little bit higher in the social scale than are the members of the militia. They regard themselves as volunteers, and not as regular soldiers, and they can, perhaps, afford to do without the pay.

                        In that connexion I can speak only of those batteries in my own State, of which I have a thorough knowledge, because I commanded them for many years, although I am not in immediate command of them now. The one great disability under which the Field Artillery of Queensland labours is the want of proper horses. Prior to Federation, and largely as the result of representations made by myself to General French - who was the Commandant of Queensland at the time, and who himself was an artilleryman - the Government of that State purchased a number of horses for this arm of the service. As an officer in command of a battery, I felt that the responsibility was thrown upon me of avoiding the danger to life which was caused by the very unsuitable horses provided under the hire system. I wrote very strongly upon the matter, with the result that the Queensland Government purchased a number of suitable horses. They cost, I think, from &#163;800 to&#163;1,000. The change was a marked success. The horses became as well drilled as the men, and understood the words of command.

                        I know that that is a difficulty in some States. But in Queensland the experiment worked admirably, because only a few miles from the spot where the batteries were drilled there was a large paddock in which the horses could be run.

                        Oh yes. All the field batteries are horsed in that way. There are a few horses, belonging to the instructional cadre, which are usually handed over for use by the medical corps.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- I have referred to the disabilities under which the Field Artillery labour in regard to horses under the present system, and have instanced a case in which a whole day was lost by two batteries as the result of the poor quality of the horses supplied to them under contract. This sort of thing happens constantly : A parade is called, say, for 2 o&#39;clock. Very  often the men do not get out of the drill yard for an hour or an hour and a half. That is so much time lost, and militates against the training of the men. Over and over again a request has been made that a different system should be adopted, and that the horses for the field batteries should be purchased, at all events in some of the States. It is impossible for me to say where the fault lies, but the fact remains that a recommendation to this effect has been made and has not been carried out. The Minister of Defence is aware also of a disability applying to the Field Artillery in Queensland on account of the lack of an artillery range, at which the annual practice and instructional and competitive practices can take place. For two years the Queensland batteries fired no shell whatever. It can scarcely be expected that satisfactory results can be obtained under such circumstances. A proposal has been under consideration for many years for the acquirement of a range on Crown lands on the north coast line, at no very great distance from Brisbane. The scheme has been reported on very favorably, and the land has been reserved from alienation by the State Government. I understand that the matter is still under consideration. </para>

                        Yes. I urge that that, or some other site, for a range should be acquired. I heard recently that an officer had been sent up to Queensland- and had furnished an adverse report on the ground that there is a small house within the danger zone. Having regard to the fact that the land can be acquired for something like ios. to 15s. an acre, and that it is admirably situated for a manoeuvring ground and for an artillery range, I think that the fact that a small farmhouse is within the danger zone should not prevent the acquisition of the property by the Commonwealth. It can also be acquired by resumption. The honorable member for Corio has mentioned the omission of the word &#34;garrison,&#34; from clause 4 of the Bill, which leads one to believe that it is the intention of the Government to have permanent field batteries. That is not a policy which has hitherto been favoured by the Defence Department. So far as I am aware, none of the expert authorities have recommended that there should be a permanent Field Artillery.

                        With an additional period of training, which is to be provided, I understand, this year - the period being twenty-eight days, instead of sixteen days, as has hitherto been the case - proper horsing of the batteries, and suitable ranges, I feel confident that the Field Artillery will be all that could be desired. The Minister of Defence has told us that one-third -of our militia forces are recruits. Now the period of service is only three years. I do not know what he means by a &#34;recruit,&#34; but I assume he speaks of &#39; .those who have done one year&#39;s service or less. But when we remember that the period of service is only three years, and that in the ordinary process one-third of the men retire every year, it will be seen that we are constantly augmenting the number of  men in the country who have undergone some amount of training.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- Exactly ; and that is where I take exception to the Minister&#39;s figures when he alleges that we have only 15,000 men upon whom we can rely. I recollect that when I commenced to enrol men in a field battery under the Queensland Act of 1884, after the lapse of about five years, the numbering on the roll had risen from one - I myself as commanding officer being the first one - to about 350. I should say that from 80 to 90 per cent, of the men who had passed out of the ranks during a period of about six years were trained men. Most of those men were thoroughly well trained and, in case of emergency, would be available. Scarcely any additional training would be required to make them efficient again. </para>

These men  are  a valuable reserve, which we -always have in Australia as the result of our present system. I venture to say that with a little extra training they would be -as efficient as almost any of the men who  Are  now serving in the ranks. A very large number of them perhaps served three or four  or  more years, and would return to the ranks at once in a case of emergency. So that it is a mistake to say or argue that those who attend camps are the only men who can be relied upon for the defence of Australia. </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- I think the Minister mentioned that about 80 per cent, of the men in the ranks attend camp. The remaining percentage is largely made up of men who are probably thoroughly efficient, but who are absent through illness 01 through being engaged on some distant employment, or who for some other reason are unable to attend a particular camp. They lose their efficiency for the year, but that does not say that they become inefficients. It must not be assumed that they are inefficient because they are technically non-efficient. They may actually be the most efficient men in the corps. </para>

Some men go through a part  pf  the recruit course, and then drop out, perhaps, because they do not like the training as much as they thought they would.

Only in that way could we obtain a record of the services of the men who have been passed out of the various corps of the Commonwealth, and who have become thoroughly efficient during their period of service. With a little extra training these men would be brought right up to date. </para>

                        - Tactics have changed, but company drill and battery drill remain very much the same. Besides, within a week, a man who has been through the ranks can be made as efficient as ever he was. A few drills will put him right. He will be quick to draw comparisons, and probably will recognise the improvements which have been made. The honorable and learned member for Corio knows that scores of movements - at all events, it is so in field artillery drill - have been abandoned as useless, everything being now in the direction of simplification. The Minister said that it will not be possible to largely increase the strength of the militia if provision is made for it on the Estimates; but if certain changes, which, I think could be made with advantage, are adopted, it will not be difficult* to increase, and, possibly, double the present force. We could certainly maintain as many as ft is desirable that we should have under arms, having regard to our needs or surroundings, and the possibilities of the immediate future. The Committee which sat in September, 1906, recommended, at my instance, as the result of experience in Queensland, that the  continuous training, that is, the annual camp, should last for a period of eight days, and that eight days&#39; pay, not to be otherwise earned, should be specially allotted for attendance at camp.

                        - No. At present, if a man does not go to the annual camp, he can, by attending extra drills at other times during the year, earn the camp pay of eight days ; but if attendance at camp is to be a crucial test of his technical efficiency, camp pay should be ear-marked, so as not to be earned in any other way than by attendance at camp.

                        It should be enacted that if a man does not attend the annual camp he may not, by attending extra drills, earn the eight days&#39; pay ; but that he may attain efficiency by attending an equivalent of extra detached drills. In Queensland a man could not earn the camp pay except by attending the camp, with the result that 90 per cent. went into camp for the eight days. Such a regulation as I suggest would, I think, remove the difficulty which now exists in Victoria of keeping the men together for more than a four days&#39; camp. It may be said that employers object to a camp of eight days, but, if so, that is largely owing to the fact that the employes are satisfied to go for only four days. If they were deprived of camp pay, unless they attended for eight days, they would bring to bear a moral suasion on their employers, with the beneficial result which we have had in Queensland. Of course, if a man says to his employer, &#34;It is not of much importance to me whether I go to camp for eight days or for four,&#34; the employer replies, &#34; I cannot spare you for more than the four Easter holidays.&#34; But if the employe finds it to his interest to attend for eight days, he will, in the great number of cases, as the Queensland experience shows, arrange with his employer to0 let him get away.

                        - Yes. A four days&#39; camp is an absolute farce; but a fair amount of training can be done during an eight days&#39; camp, which, so to speak, &#34; tops-up &#34; the training of the year. There is, however, a waste of time in crowding the whole year&#39;s training into the period spent in camp as now proposed. A great deal of the training can best be done in the drill sheds, or drill yards, or open reserves, where the men can attend for half a day at a time. Instruction given in that way, week by week, is gradually absorbed by the men. While on the subject of camps, I wish to refer to a practice which, I understand, is the result of a resolution passed by this House, making Sunday a blank day.

                        That is an additional absurdity. My experience is that more mischief and drunkenness results from the want of employment on that day than occurs on any other during a camp. Without being a bigoted Sabbatarian, I favour as strongly as does any one the setting apart of a day of rest each week ; but common sense should be exercised in the matter of Sabbath observance in camp. When 1,000 or 2,000 men are left idle in camp, some of them&#34; are bound to get into mischief. Many merely sit about telling yarns of a questionable character, or skylarking. Of course, they cannot be prevented from playing games, and otherwise amusing themselves; but&#39; they would benefit more, and their time would be spent more to the profit of the country, if they were engaged in ordinary military exercises. I have been assured by an&#39; officer who was recently present at a camp where two clergymen held services that, on being questioned, they informed him, separately, each without the other&#39;s knowledge, that their opinion was that it was a huge mistake to leave the men unexercised on the Sunday; and all who have attended camps will bear out that view. I hope that, in the interests of the forces, and even of morality, the present practice will be discontinued. Every one, from the senior officers down to the recruits, object to it ; but they are compelled to observe it. The Minister of Defence and the honorable member for Corio laid great stress upon the cost of officers&#39; uniforms. According to the Minister, an infantry officer pays&#163;39 16s. 6d. for his uniform.

                    <para>ColonelFOXTON.- That all depends on whether a man is a dude or not. If a man buys a pair of boots of a particular pattern, that does not seem to be a great hardship, and they should not be included as one of the items that he is compelled to buy. Then there is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;8</inline> for a mess uniform, which is optional. He need not get dress boots -&#163;1 - unless he likes. There is a great coat at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> 10s. All he has to do is to have his next great coat of a particular pattern. It is a very serviceable article, whether worn for military purposes or. otherwise. </para>

As the Minister said, some men do not like to be seen without the full kit, but if men are so thin skinned they had better not attempt to join the commissioned ranks. So far as my experience goes, very few men are deterred from taking commissions on the &#39;score of expense in this direction. A man&#39;s first year&#39;s pay will practically pay for his uniform. </para>

                        I do not agree with the honorable member. He may be perfectly correct as regards the official figures put before him as to the number of men who are technically efficient for a given year, but to say that all those who are non -efficient are inefficient is . incorrect. There are also a large number of men throughout the country who, having passed through as efficient, are available at any moment for the service of their country should the need arise, and would gladly  rejoin their corps. I come now to a more serious complaint against the Minister. I was surprised and disappointed that he should indulge in language such as he used with regard to the wearing of uniforms. He said -

                        <para>Honorable members who had an opportunity of seeing the gorgeous spectacles on the occasion of the visit of the American Fleet, must have been struck by the view of decent, respectable, inoffensive gentlemen, appearing arrayed like escapees from the  Mahdi&#39;s  harem. It is astounding to me that men should desire to get into such uniforms. I can understand men in China, in times gone by, assuming great masks in order to frighten the enemy, or gorgeous costumes being resorted to by savages, or the rain-makers of Africa; but I cannot conceive that any respectable, middle-aged man, who has lost his waist, can desire any such costume. ! do not know whether the reporting staff have been kind to the honorable member by omitting from his speech something which was still .more offensive, 1 or whether he himself, feeling that he had overstepped the bounds of good taste, expunged it from the report; but, as a matter of actual fact, he went so far as to say that in doing so officers were &#34;making asses of themselves.&#34; </para>

                        That is so. Every honorable member must, of course, decide for himself the degree of good taste that he will employ in any speech he makes in this House, because, provided that he does not transgress the Standing Orders, he is distinctly within his rights in holding outside people up to ridicule. In that respect, the Minister was entirely within his rights.

                        - I do not know how a uniform can look like an ass. It must be the man inside it. It would be much more to the credit of the honorable member if he said that he regretted having used such language. Personally, it does not affect me. I am a politician,&#39; and am not sensitive to remarks of that kind. &#62;

                        If they are wrong, the honorable member is at fault .for allowing them. They are worn in pursuance of regulations for which he as Minister is responsible. The worst feature of the attack is that it is made on men, some of whom have written to me - -

I have seen some of his colleagues displaying their figures in that garb, and two of them at least had lost their waists, to use the graphic language of the honorable member. Had he them in his mind&#39;s eye when he referred to escapees from Mahdis&#39; harems? The honorable member told us that the only calling in the world that required no training was that of critic.

The only consolation I can give those men, who very naturally take exception to the reference to them and their uniforms, is that the Minister of Defence, as critic, was &#34; born that way,&#34; and cannot help it.

                        The Minister is, undoubtedly, a very eminent critic of clothes, but I hope that, when he deals with the question again, he will not use language of the kind. I have already said that I am in favour of compulsory training within reasonable limits, and the Minister very naturally asks what I conceive those (limits to be. Having regard to the intelligence and special aptitude which the Australian youth has for military exercises, I suggest that his training as a cadet should commence, say, at the age of twelve, though the exact age is not very material, and continue day by day and week by week until the age of sixteen. Then he should be given three or four weeks&#39; training annually - and we ought not to shirk the word &#34; compulsory &#34; any more than we do in connexion with education in its ordinary branches - from sixteen to seven teen, and from seventeen to eighteen, following as nearly as possible the idea which permeates the Bill. The youth will then have arrived at an age at which he will be eligible to enrol himself in the militia, as we now have and understand that branch of the force.

                        Yes; and my belief is that under such a system there would never be any scarcity of militiamen. Doubtless a large number of the young men would regard themselves as having given enough of their time to military service, but, as I have said, a very considerable proportion would have become so imbued with the military spirit that they would desire to continue.

                        Yes, on a peace footing. Under such a system as I have outlined, there would always be applicants waiting for enlistment, especially if, as was done in Queensland prior to Federation, there was a small amount of deferred pay due after three years&#39; service - an arrangement which proved a great attraction. The Department could then afford to discharge any man who did not display all the necessary qualities, or neglected his drill and general training. With a peace footing of 20,000, the Minister of Defence could, by a mere stroke of the pen, raise the number to war strength, the whole of the machinery being already provided.

For instance, if a battery of  75  were increased to a strength of  130  or  150,  the same officers would suffice; and that is really, in my opinion, the true solution of the difficulty i&#39;n regard to military organization in Australia. With such a system, we should always have an effective militia, providing it were properly equipped; and I must say that, so far as my experience in Queensland goes, the equipment at present - and the credit for this is largely due to the Minister - is infinitely superior to that under the control of the States. I see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has pretty much the same idea as I have expounded ; but, apparently, he favours the continuation of the senior cadet training, under compulsory service, to the age of nineteen. 1 should retain the militia in its present, or some similar form, and recruit it, as I have said, from the youths who have been trained up to the age of eighteen. </para>

                        No; I am entirely in accord with that principle up to a certain point; and its recommendation to me is that, between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, the labour of a youth is not worth so much to himself or to the country as it is between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one, and, therefore, his civil avocation in life is &#39;not interfered with to the same extent. The extra training of one week per annum during the following five years, up to the age of twenty-six - years in which a man may have taken on himself the burden of matrimony, and have other mouths to feed - would not seriously hamper his civil and industrial life. By such means there would gradually be created, in the course of fifteen or twenty years, just as the Minister desires, a reserve of partially-trained n?.en, who would be most valuable as recruits if it were deemed necessary to raise the strength. These men would be a re serve, as I say, though not practically recognised as such; at any rate, at the end of a generation, the whole of the male population would be trained up to a certain point, and such a force would prove extremely useful, though . years might have elapsed since the actual training.

An honorable member made a similar suggestion to me a little time ago, and pointed out that members of trade unions constantly apprise the secretaries of any change of address, but I reminded him that it was to the personal interests of die men to keep the officials informed, seeing that otherwise they would doubtless place themselves under some disability. If we remove all personal incentive, we shall find the reserves&#39; to be simply reserves on paper, though I do not think it would matter much, seeing that, under the present Act, in case of war or danger of war, a man may be called upon to serve wherever he be found. </para>

                        I admit that there is something in the point raised. But those numbers in training will have to be faced in later years, and it does seem to me to be anomalous that a lad who is nineteen years of age when this Bill passes should be exempt from, the whole of the military service required. However, as the honorable member for Adelaide says, we must begin somewhere. I have still another objection to the Bill, which would remain, even if I were prepared to go as far f.s the Minister, or as the honorable member for West Sydney, in the matter of compulsory training. What have the public to say on this question?

                        I can. The Minister of Defence and the honorable member for West Sydney, who are advocates of the principle, have described it as revolutionary.

                        Whether the honorable gentleman said so or not, it undoubtedly is revolutionary. It means the introduction of a principle which the Minister certainly admitted that, so far as he is aware, has never hitherto been introduced in any British community.

                        As I said in opening my speech, one of the greatest principles with which the proposal would interfere is that of the liberty of the subject. It is proposed, under this Bill, to impose disabilities and onerous duties upon the individual, under very serious penalties for default, and to that extent to deprive him of his liberty. In the circumstances, I say that the Bill should not be passed until the people at a general election have been given an opportunity to express an opinion upon it.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- They have not spoken upon it any more than they have spoken upon the increase of the salaries of members. Neither of these questions was before the country at the last election. I do not know whether the other States of the Commonwealth have had a similar experience, but before the principle, of compulsory education was adopted by the Queensland Legislature - of which I was a member - appeals were made to the people at elections and in other ways to say whether the principle was one which should be adopted. The matter was discussed for years before the principle was finally given effect to by law. </para>

                        - The honorable gentleman has missed my point, which was that the principle of compulsory education was freely discussed, was submitted to the people at several elections, and wa*s not finally passed into law until they had returned members in favour of it. I believe that the principle has been adopted in every State in the Commonwealth, but it has been as a result of appeals made to the people answered in the affirmative in each case.

                        That is another question which I must leave the honorable gentleman to answer. If it was necessary, and in the past it was admitted to be necessary, to ask the constituencies to speak out on such a question as the compulsory education of children up to the age of fourteen or fifteen years, how much more necessary is it that we should ask the people of Australia to speak out on this question of compulsory military service for adults before we attempt to deal finally with it? The Prime Minister, in his utterances prior to the last general election, gave no hint that it was the intention of the Government to submit a scheme for compulsory military service. The honorable member for Batman has said that this principle was before the people of Australia, and I should like him to indicate in some way how and where it was put to them. I never heard it mentioned in any election address in Queensland. The electors of Batman may have spoken on this important question, but I venture to say that the people of Australia were not asked to vote upon it. If I were asked conscientiously to say whether the majority of my constituents are in favour of compulsory military training, such as is proposed in this Bill, I candidly admit that I should not be able to say whether they are or are not.

                        - I believe that they would be in favour of such limited compulsory training as I have myself indicated, up to the age of eighteen. But having regard to what I consider the non-necessity of going further at the present time, I do not believe that they would say they are desirous of having compulsory military training extending from the age of eighteen up to the age of twenty-six years.

                        I beg the honorable gentleman&#39;s pardon. I say that we can do all that we require by enforcing training up to the age of eighteen years. Lads who join the militia at the age of eighteen, and who have been through cadet training, and especially those who have been officers or non-commissioned officers of cadets, are found to require little more training except, perhaps, in the technical branches of the service. They are well up, even in tactics, and their training has been excellent up to that point. I have in mind at the present time many young men who, joining the militia forces from the cadets, immediately took a prominent &#39; place in their corps, and very soon attained to commissioned or noncommissioned rank. Training up to the age of eighteen years could be made very effective indeed. I sincerely hope thai the Government scheme will be modified in the way I have indicated. Surely we can. rest where we are for the present, and advance by steps to the ideal proposed in this Bill, with all the onerous duties and penalties it would impose on a family man if it should really be found in practice that it is necessary to go so far? Surely we can see how a less advanced scheme would work first, and have this as our objective for twenty-five or fifty years, hence if necessary, adopting in the meantime something which will be a step in the direction in which we desire to go, without imposing onerous burdens on the adult population ? We could thus maintain a militia numbering  15,000  or  20,000  which we could always increase to a war strength of, say,  40,000,  which Major-General Hutton estimated as all that would be required for the defence of Australia in any possible circumstances. Whilst I am in favour of compulsory military service and training, though not, as I have explained, to the extent advocated by the Minister, I feel certain that if the second reading of the Bill is passed there will be very little prospect of modifying its provisions in such a way as to commend them to me, and I shall therefore feel bound to vote against the second reading.

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- I approve of the principle up to a certain point, beyond which I do not at present think it necessary to go. There is another objection. I foresee as plainly as possible that if the Bill&#39; gets into Committee an effort will be made to introduce into it a provision that the men serving or being trained in the proposed organization shall be paid for their services. Can we afford that? If that principle were introduced the expense would amount to twice as much - as the existing militia forces cost us, and would be prohibitive. My suggestion is that just as we do not pay a boy while he is attending school to receive the ordinary scholastic instruction which is provided for by the State- </para>

                    <para>Colonel FOXTON.- Just so. But as we say it is necessary in the interests of the community that a boy should be educated up to a certain point, which is provided for by the State authorities, so I say it is quite competent for the Commonwealth Parliament to step in and say to the same boy when he has reached fourteen or fifteen years of age that it is necessary that fie shall receive further instruction in military training in the interests of the community at large, and he must therefore continue his compulsory education which for Commonwealth purposes is not&#39; yet complete until he has reached the age of eighteen years. That appears to me to be a perfectly fair proposition, and obviates entirely the difficulty of paying for the services rendered. The proposal would then be one purely for training up to the age of eighteen years, and up to that age those undergoing the training would not be members of any military organization, but merely persons attending a training school to learn what would be required of them when they joined the military organization. </para>

                        As the honorable member implies, the proposal would affect the time, which is the turning point with many lads, when they become either respectable citizens or larrikins, and when a little care, discipline, drill, and attention from the Commonwealth might prevent their becoming the latter.

                        That is of course most important. As I have said, up to the age of eighteen the work of a lad would not be of the same value to himself or to the community as it would in later years. I should like, in conclusion, to put myself right, in case anything I may have said in my allusion to the Asiatic question and our danger from that quarter, implies that I have doubts as to the protection upon which we might rely from the

Surely the fact that in Queensland we, in a typical corps there, passed through the books 350 men in six years, when the strength was only sixty-five, is an indication that there are thousands of men who are. competent to step into the ranks at any moment and assist in the defence of the country. But to suggest that anything I have said implies that we desire to depend upon others for our protection is distinctly to misrepresent me.

                        At all events, we have determined that our nation shall be a white one. And, although, as I believe, the destinies of this country are bound up with those of the Mother Country, and will be for generations to come, still we must recognise the fact that in the distant future we may have to fight for the policy to which I have referred, and the purity of our race. To be in a position to do that, we must take steps to train our youths, within reasonable limits, to the use of arms. But that is not all that we should do. There is a great factor in the defence of Australia to which no reference has yet been made, and that is that we must encourage as many white persons as possible to come to our shores for the purpose of throwing in their lot with us, and so strengthening us. We must school ourselves to the knowledge that by so doing we shall add, not only to our strength, but also to our wealth and our material prosperity. We must overcome all &#34;narrow objections to the adoption of that policy. But whatever steps we may take in that direction as a means of defence, and  whatever methods may be finally adopted for the purpose of qualifying our manhood to maintain that high ideal, we must always bear in mind that, belonging as we do to the greatest combination of nations, the most powerful confederation of peoples that the world has ever seen, it is to our honour, as well as to our interest, to maintain and strengthen the integrity and the pre-eminence of the British Empire.

                        <para>.- After the number of speeches we have heard, I approach the consideration of this question with some timidity. The leader of the Opposition has told us that we are quite safe under the British flag, that so long as we remain part of the British Empire there is no need to fear, and that the consideration of this question should be delayed, as there is no need to take any action. And the honorable member for Brisbane has said that he practically agrees with that statement. In the first place, I want to point out that one of the two questions before the country was that of defence. </para>

                    <para>Australia has never fostered a desire to evade her share in the scheme of national defence, and still less is there any tendency on our part to make hard bargains with the Mother Country, and so secure cheap naval protection. We are willing, and even anxious, to do our share, and we object very strongly indeed to the charge that we in any way seek occasion to do otherwise. Such tactics on the part of well-meaning people, who would like to see the naval contribution raised, have done enough mischief already, and it is time to put them aside and face the naval problem. </para>

I desire to refer now to the question of the supremacy of the British Empire. The leader of the Opposition has told us that it is as strong to-day as ever it has been. While I believe that that statement is correct, at the same time we have to recognise that other nations are falling into line, and that in the Old Country there are those who, like the leader of the Opposition, believe in the good old policy of free-trade. </para>

                            <para>- That is the position. That is what the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated only in March last. But we see that the fiscal policy of the Old Country has not had that effect. For sixty years it has prevailed. If we compare another country, say Germany, with Great Britain we find that so far back as 1884 Lord Beaconsfield visited Berlin, and on his return stated that that country was a hundred years behind Great Britain. It is of no use to disguise the fact, that to-day every nation is arming for either offence or defence. .&#39; No one can shut his eyes to the fact that Germany bids fair to become one of the mightiest nations in the world in the very near future. We may be asked if she is in a position to do it. The leader of the Opposition stated the other day that Great Britain, with a population of forty-four millions and with twelve million persons on the poverty line, is contributing about &#163;70,000,000 annually for her army and navy. Is Germany able to compete in the same direction? What is the actual position to-day? Germany pays more money ira insurances to her workmen than Great Britain spends on her navy. Last year, for instance, she spent &#163;35,000,000 for that purpose. These are the men who are to stand behind the guns, and they are being protected and cared for. The recruits of the German army are not taken from the unemployed, but in England, last year, out of 84,000 who presented themselves for examination, no less than 23,000 failed to pass the test. In Germany the workers are fully employed, but in Great Britain, under a policy which throws men out of employment, it naturally follows that a large proportion of them will not be equal to the demand made upon them in the battles of the future. The working classes of Germany are in a far better position than are those of England. Men there are being trained and educated in such a way that, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percival</inline> Hislam, when war takes place, the German will be able to hold his own with the Britisher on land or sea. That being so, we have a difficult position to face. If Great Britain becomes involved in war, we, as a part of the Empire, must also be involved. It is to its manhood that a nation has to look for its defence. We find that the people of Germany are so prosperous that in seven years the deposits in the Savings Banks there have increased&#39; by over ,&#163;200,000,000, whereas, during the same period, the &#39;deposits in the Savings Banks of Great Britain increased by only &#163;18,000,000. Last year the deposits iri the Savings Banks of Great Britain increased by only &#163;400,000, whereas the deposits in the Savings Banks of Germany increased by over &#163;30,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- I am not dealing with that phase of the question. No Britisher, whether in the Old Country or in Australia, can afford to shut his eyes to the great progress that Germany is making in all walks of life, lt was only in 1889, less than twenty years ago, that a Naval League was formed in Germany/ with the avowed object of bringing about the supremacy of the German Empire on the sea. In that year, the League had a membership, I think, of 883, and the Minister of War then sought, without success, to pass a Bill providing for an expenditure of &#163;10,000,000 on battleships. Shortly afterwards a new Minister of War took office, and his first move was to make use of the Naval League, with the result that its membership soon increased to 250,000, and it was not long before the vote of &#163;10,000,000 for naval purposes was agreed to. Ever since then, the League has been agitating for. an increased naval expenditure, and its efforts have been attended with so much success that it is intended during the next nine years to expend &#163;192,000,000 on the German navy. </para>

                            <para>- Some of these vessels were built a good many years ago. The German Reichstag recently passed a Bill providing that battleships should be cast aside after twenty years&#39; service. The position of Great Britain to-day is one that every Britisher must look at fairly and squarely. It is idle to disguise the facts and to think that Great Britain,  12,000  miles away, could protect us from the attack of a nation within only fi*e days&#39; or six days&#39; steaming from our shores. Japan, with a population of  47,000,000,  is within five or six days&#39; steaming from our shores, and while some honorable members have laid stress on the point that she is in alliance with Great Britain, w&#176; must not forget that she is building warships more rapidly than she has ever done. She possesses to-day the largest battleship afloat, and stands fifth on the list of the naval powers of the world. What is our position? Are we, as the leader of the Opposition suggests, to stand idly by, and to agree to a policy of drift? Have we not said to the people of certain nations : &#34;We will not allow your goods to come here?&#34; Have we not imposed a Tariff against their goods, and said to them: &#34;We will not even permit you to land here?&#34; In these circumstances, are we going to do nothing to protect our shores? The time has arrived when we should do something. The delay advocated by the leader of the Opposition, and also bv the honorable member for Flinders, who opposes the second reading of this Bill simply on the ground that a column of figures given by the Prime Minister was not correctly added up, should not. be tolerated. In his first speech in this House the honorable member for Flinders said that the question of defence was the most important with which this House would have to deal. He was not prepared to say what an adequate system of defence would cost, but urged that it would exceed  &#163;1,000,000  per annum. I am pleased that the Government are looking the position fairly in the face, and are determined to do something to protect our shores. Let me hark back for a moment to Germany and her ship-building. Last year the German Minister of War instituted inquiries to ascertain how many firms in the German Empire were prepared to lay down ships. He found that there were fourteen, and that each was capable of turning out a vessel in about two years and four months. According to the report which the Minister of War has received, there are something like  40,000  skilled workmen in the ship-building yards of Germany, and they are capable of turning out ships equal to some of the finest vessels afloat. Whilst Great Britain is protecting her coastline at a cost of  &#163;7 50  a mile, Germany is protecting her coastline at a cost of  &#163;2,980.  Then, again, Great Britain is protecting her shipping at a cost of  &#163;2  ros. per ton, whilst Germany is protecting her shipping at a cost of  &#163;4 15s.  per ton. These figures show the rapid strides that the German Empire is making, and I venture to say, without fear of successful contradiction, that its progress is due to its fiscal policy which is that of protection. I wish now to refer to the proposal for compulsory military training. The honor- able member for Brisbane said that he is not prepared to entirely support the Bill, because this provision goes farther than he thinks is necessary. He seems to think that eighteen years is too early an age at which to commence military training. </para>

                            <para>- A Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed to inquire into military matters, after holding eighty-two sittings, and examining  134  witnesses, came to the conclusion that for the effective defence of Great Britain some system of compulsorily training every citizen of military age and sound physique should be adopted to prepare for emergency. Lord Roberts, who, I suppose, will be regarded as a high military authority, favours compulsory military training, and so does Lord Milner. Lt.-Colonel William Plumer, speaking at Kensington, England, a little time ago, said, respecting the proposals of the Deakin Ministry - I take the report from the <inline font-style="italic">United Service Magazine -</inline></para>

                        <para>While, then, to some it looks as though compulsory training were a hardship, to me it presents itself thus : the community expects that in time of danger all able-bodied men will rally to their country&#39;s call, and I feel sure they would. It becomes the duty of the country to give to all men a training in arms which shall save courage from being the mere suicide of ancient Greece. It is said that gymnastics of some sort were rendered almost obligatory by the liability of every citizen to military and naval service at a moment&#39;s notice. August Bebel, the German Socialist, is quoted as saying that home defence is a duty for all who are capable of fulfilling that duty. Mark the word &#34; capable.&#34; It means now a good deal. I regard it not as a duty  forced  upon men, but as a training given them in anticipation of a duty which I know, and you know, they would gallantly accept, even though it spelt death. But our desire is that it should spell victory and national safety. Every one not under a physical disability should know how to ride and swim, shoot and trench, and also know some trade. I believe the training could be so planned as to do away with larrikinism, and to add to the physique of our race. It could be combined with valuable technical education and agricultural knowledge. Though we pray  earnestly  against war, we do not wish, if war comes, to see our manhood die for lack of knowledge. It seems to me universal training in the use of arms may well be regarded by Christians as the strongest assurance that we shall not be lightly attacked. </para>

                            <para>- It is the statement of one of the leading authorities in connexion with the South African war. What is the objection to compulsory military training? So far as I have been able to gather, ux people who are under that system to-day are amongst the best citizens in the world. Even such a learned authority as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harold</inline> Cox, the Secretary of the Cobden Club, of whom the  deputy  leader of the Opposition knows so much- </para>

                            <para>- On the spur of the moment I cannot find the exact quotation to which I alluded. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cox</inline> makes one statement concerning the compulsory military system with which I do not agree. He adopts an attitude somewhat similar to that of the leader of the Opposition - a sort of &#39; &#39; Yes-no &#39; &#39; attitude. He affirms that it is the duty of every man to render a fair day&#39;s work for a fair day&#39;s wage, and that it is the duty of every citizen to pay the taxes legally imposed upon him. But he adds that if its citizens do that, no nation need have any apprehension as to its future, quite irrespective of whether or not those citizens can handle a rifle. Upon that point I disagree with him. As a humble member of this House, and as one who took an active part in excluding foreign goods from the Commonwealth with a view to providing employment to the artisans within our borders, I have felt it my duty to emphasize the desirableness of erecting a fence around Australia, &#187;o that our people ma,y be permitted to dwell in happiness and security. </para>

                            <para>- If that leader be a good and wise one, surely I am to be commended for so doing. By universal consent the Navy is our first line of defence. Under the Government scheme, and according to the figures quoted originally by the Prime Minister and repeated by the Minister of Defence, the proposal is to spend  &#163;260,000  on naval defence&#39; as against  &#163;1,545,000  on military defence. If the Navy is our first line of defence, obviously there is a striking contrast between the amounts which it is proposed to allot to the two branches of the service. We propose to spend practically  &#163;6  upon military defence for every  &#163;1  on naval defence. </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to that point directly. In adopting a scheme of defence we must be more than careful that we shall accomplish something more satisfactory than has obtained in the past. The primary object, of course, is not the training of young men - although that is an important secondary consideration - but is to secure that measure of defence which will give us a sense of security and safety against any foe that is likely to attack us. It is laid down among the obligations of the British Empire towards us that the British Fleet guarantees Australia against invasion in force, and against attacks by any considerable squadron of armoured vessels ; that, in the third place, the exigencies of war may require the withdrawal of the Australian Imperial Squadron, while, fourthly, Australia cannot be guaranteed against attack by unarmoured commerce raiders up to four in number  but the loss they would inflict would not be of more than secondary importance. Consequently, according to the statement of fact thus put before us by the official <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book,</inline> we have simply to prepare ourselves against attack by unarmoured commerce raiders up to four in number. I discover in the Prime Minister&#39;s speech some fallacies, which appear on the face of them to be obvious. He said - </para>

                    <para class="block">That appears to be a contradiction of what the honorable gentleman first said. He speaks of a compulsory universal training and in the next breath says that the Government trust to a voluntary service freely given. I find it difficult to reconcile those two statements. How can a service be compulsory and voluntary at the same time? </para>

                            <para>- lt is no mare&#39;s nest for me to assert, as a practical thinking man, that it is impossible to increase the 15,000 men who are now said to be properly equipped, to 200,000 men, properly equipped and officered, and provided with all the munitions of war, in less than eight years, for a paltry increased cost of &#163;250,000. Common sense rebels against such a suggestion. Another most important question is whether men who have possibly wives and young families dependent upon them can be taken away from their homes, and from their daily avocations, where they are earning 8s., 9s., or 10s. a day, and compelled to serve their country in this way for eighteen days a year, without being given some payment for it. There would be a howl of indignation if I made the suggestion which fell from the honorable member for West Sydney. He said that in Switzerland the men were paid 7&#38;d. per day, but he thought Australia could pay more, and, therefore, in the magnanimity of the Labour man&#39;s heart, he would give them is. 3d. a day. </para>

                            <para>- There are thousands of men in the least-populous parts of Australia who, for reasons of convenience and from pecuniary considerations, it would be impossible to lay hold of under this scheme. It would be impracticable, because too expensive, to mobilize them and drill them even in the ineffective manner proposed. One of the difficulties surrounding this matter is suggested in the speech, of the Prime Minister. He said that the British Admiralty were not satisfied with the contribution made for the upkeep of the British Navy, and that a section of our people were not satisfied with the bargain from our side. That remark applied to the Naval Agreement of  1902.  The&#34; Prime Minister&#39;s statement was correct in one respect. The agreement was not satisfactory, inasmuch as the evidence contained in the report of the Colonial Conference shows that the Admiralty expected a larger contribution from us than they were getting under the previous Naval Agreement. It was, however, ultimately settled that the payment by Australia should be  &#163;200,000  per annum. The Prime Minister having submitted that aspect of the case, the question arises whether the measures which have been outlined by the Government embody such proposals as are likely to be more satisfactory to the British naval authorities and to the British people themselves than were the conditions previously existing. We naturally assume that as the Cabinet contains such a large amount of wisdom, its members have carefully considered this matter in the drafting of a Bill which is to be submitted to Parliament for the express purpose of giving a larger measure of satisfaction to the naval authorities in Great Britain, and also to the people in Australia. The Prime Minister in his speech went on to say that - </para>

                        <para>It was intimated in the clearest terms that so far as the British Parliament is concerned it would make no further demands of any kind upon us in connexion with the Imperial Naval defence. The statement of the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir H.</inline> Campbell-Bannerman, that naval defence and foreign affairs must go together, was made at the opening of the Imperial Conference in April last. That axiom exactly summed up the effect of the debate in the Commons. </para>

                    <para class="block">But what were the facts leading up to that determination? When that statement was made the Prime Minister had intimated that the people of Australia were not satisfied to continue the payment of the subsidy of  &#163;200,000  per annum. I should like to know what authority the Prime Minister had for making such a statement. I believe that the Australian people were proud to make the contribution. It was not so much as we felt we were entitled to pay, but it was something respectable in proportion to what other portions of the Empire were contributing. We have to remember in this connexion, that if Great Britain is to continue to maintain a two-power standard navy, it is absolutely essential that the various parts of the Empire should come together and assist the British people to carry the great burden of expenditure which such a policy involves. I venture to say that the proposals which have now been made to this House will not be more satisfactory to the British people or to the naval authorities. The Prime Minister sought to justify his position in these words - </para>

                        <para>At the  very  outset of the recent Colonial Conference in London, the Prime Minister of Great Britain met us with a frank avowal that the British Government preferred no claim for money in relation to naval defence, and went on to add the extremely pregnant statement that the control of naval defence and foreign affairs must always go together. If honorable members appreciate the force of that .axiom, they will see that it implies much both now and in the future. It implies that, for the present, seeing that we have no voice in foreign affairs, we are not obliged to take any part in Imperial Naval defence. </para>

                    <para class="block">Now, I ask honorable members seriously to consider this position. The Prime Minister says that because we have no &#34; say &#34; in the foreign policy of the Empire, therefore we are under no obligation to continue to contribute towards the Navy. But he ignores the fact that our relationship to the British Navy arises from our dependence upon it as our first line of defence, and that we make our contribution, not on account of any foreign policy with which Great Britain may be concerned, but because of the protection which Great Britain is in a position to afford to us. In the circumstances we recognise that it is our duty to pay a fair quota towards the maintenance of the British Navy. </para>

                    <para class="block">There the. Prime Minister comes back to the old position that the very first line of defence is the command of the high seas. Can it be satisfactory to Great Britain that we now propose to withdraw our contribution of  &#163;200,000?  Of course, I know that the Prime Minister will argue that, as we have no control over the British Navy - that because the ships may be withdrawn to the Indian Ocean or the Bay of Biscay - we are not protected as we should be. But one of the arguments contained in the Prime Minister&#39;s speech, in relation to. military defence, is that it may be necessary to take our men more than  1,000  miles away from the settled portions of the country in order to defend the Australian shores; and the same line of argument that holds good in the one case must hold good in the other. I venture to say that the proposals will not be satisfactory, at any rate to the people of Great Britain, who will feel that we are not treating them fairly. Man for man, we are richer than are the people of Great Britain ; and those who can afford to pay are under obligation to do so. The people of England, when they find what is the determination of this Parliament, as expressed in this Bill, and in a Naval Bill yet to be introduced, will be more than restive, seeing that the intention is to withhold the dole we have hitherto contributed. My own opinion is that if we showed a disposition to increase the naval subsidy to a limited extent, it would be worth a great deal from the point of view of the solidarity of the Empire. The honorable member for Batman has stated that the question of compulsory service was submitted to the people at the last elections. Was there a single leader in Parliament who ever mooted the question at the last elections? </para>

                            <para>- If so, he is the only one who did. Certainly the question was not before my constituency, and I venture to say that it was not mentioned in half the constituencies of Australia as likely to come within the range of practical politics. I repeat what has been said from this side, that we had no more warrant for introducing the measure which increased the pay of members of Parliament than we have for introducing this measure. Every proposal involving a great and important departure from existing conditions ought to be submitted to the country, embodied  either in the platform of the leader of the Government, or in the platform of the leader of the Opposition. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of the foreign gentleman who presumes to sit in judgment on Britishers day after day. The policy outlined in the Prime Minister&#39;s speech does not purport to give us a navy, but merely improved harbor defence. A great many people in Victoria - I do not know so much about the other States - have been carried to the seventh heaven of enthusiasm by the expectation that we are going to form the nucleus of a navy. But is it practicable to establish even the nucleus of a fleet? What are the feelings of the people likely to be when it is discovered that, not a fleet, but only an improvement in harbor defence is to be accomplished? As to compulsory service, I venture to say that, when it comes practically before the people, and it is known that the young men throughout the land are to be compelled to serve until twenty-six years of age, there will be such a revulsion of feeling that the present Government, if in power, will have very short shrift. I may be right or I may be wrong in my conjecture, but that is the opinion I hold as to the reception that will be given to the measure when the people rightly grasp its meaning and import. The policy, if carried out, will mean enormous expansion and increased taxation, so that it will be almost impossible to pay old-age pensions. And besides, it seeks to bring about a condition of things which has never yet been successfully adopted by British-speaking people. I have already dealt with the question of pay in the military service; but there is a most important proposal in the speech of the Prime Minister having reference to the pay to be given to those who enter the naval service. The Prime Minister said - </para>

                    <para class="block">The question is whether we can adopt a different rate of pay from that in the British Navy, and still carry out the project which the Prime Minister placed before us. That is really a most important question; and the honorable gentleman pointed out that a small navy is bound to be a failure - I have not the exact words before me - that in the British. Navy the men are transferred from ship to ship, and serve under different conditions, so as to get a thorough grasp and knowledge of the work generally. In our small navy, we could not do that, and consequently it is absolutely necessary for the perfection of the training of our naval forces that our men shall be from time to time transferred from the ships of our fleet to those of the Imperial Navy, there to receive a measure of training which we could not give them ourselves. We will suppose that for their services in our fleet they are receiving Australian rates of pay, and that it is something in excess of what they would get in the Imperial Navy. Honorable members will admit that there is likely to be some grumbling on their part if, when transferred to .the Imperial Navy, they are asked to accept less than they receive while in our service. On the other hand, if it is proposed that they should continue to receive the Australian rate of pay while serving with the Imperial Navy, what is likely to be the feeling of British sailors when they know that men infinitely inferior to themselves in naval training are receiving for the same work a higher rate of pay? </para>

                            <para>- I am offering no opinion 011 that matter. I am merely stating what the position is. The Prime Minister iri his speech on the subject led honorable members to believe that there would be Australian rates of pay, and he went on to say that, in order to perfect the Australian Navy, our seamen must be transferred from- time to time to the ships of the Imperial Navy. I have pointed out that it cannot be satisfactory to the sailors of the British Navy that our transferred men should be receiving a higher rate of pay. That must be obvious, and I am backed up in the opinion I have expressed by what I have read from what may be regarded as the latest and final despatch of the Admiralty authorities, that it is impossible to give our men transferred to the ships of the Imperial Navy a higher rate of pay than that prevailing in the Imperial Navy. </para>

                        <para>In the Imperial Navy, as honorable members are aware, the men and officers on every station are changed at short periods. Elaborate provisions are made to prevent them becoming hidebound, sit-at-ease, indifferent, or mechanical. They are transferred from ship to ship. They are put regularly through fresh courses of training. They have to return periodically to learn the latest methods in their particular Departments. The consequence is that the Royal Navy is a most progressive weapon, always up to date, and its men constantly in practice. </para>

                            <para>- I venture to say that the honorable member would not make such a suggestion, although that is what is implied in his question. It is clear that he gave the matter no consideration when he propounded his question. We cannot possibly hope to exchange with the British Navy, if we are going to adopt a higher rale of pay. Common sense rebels against such a proposal, and I have shown that the Lords of the Admiralty are distinctly against it. I venture to say that on that point their pronouncement, as I have read it, will be final. Turning to the question of cost, the Prime Minister told us - </para>

                        <para>There is about to be created by ourselves at an expenditure of ^250,000 a year, a force towards which the Admiralty will not contribute and over which they can claim no control, except that which this Parliament may be pleased to give them. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Lords of the Admiralty, in their latest despatch, mention - and they give details - that the annual cost, instead of being &#163;250,000 a year, will amount to &#163;345,000. This is another very considerable increase upon the estimates placed before us by the Prime Minister. In all probability we shall find that the annual cost will mount up to over &#163;400,000, or more than double the subsidy which we are now paying to the British Navy. I believe that the great bulk of the Australian people are thoroughly loyal to the Empire, but I can well imagine the very small number who are disloyal, and desire to cut the painter, dancing with joy when the Prime Minister said that we were about to create a force over which the Admiralty could claim no control. In their, latest despatch the Admiralty go on to say - </para>

                        <para>My Lords will be ready to co-operate in the formation of such a flotilla subject to a satisfactory understanding being arrived at in regard to the general administration of the force. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Then the despatch contains some very carefully thought out instructions indicating how far the control of the Admiralty is likely to extend. Instead of our having a force which we shall be absolutely free to do what we like with, and which will be absolutely under our own control, we find that it will be subject to a good many directions which the Lords of the Admiralty lay down as essential in order to secure that oneness which is necessary, because, as the sea is one, and the Empire one, the Fleet should be one, and under command of one authority. If our ships venture &#39;out a certain distance beyond our territorial waters, they are to be immediately placed under the command of the senior naval officer upon the station. So much for our own control. It may be true that the present system of defence is not as effective as we could wish it to be, but I venture to say that it is not carried out to the best advantage. It is certain that, for lack of funds, men who were willing to enroll themselves in our militia, have not been enrolled. There has been in the past an evident dread of incurring any increased expenditure to make our Military Forces efficient. That is one of the reasons for their inefficiency, but when the inefficiency is discovered, we have people who say, &#34;Let us burst up the whole thing, and go in for an entirely new arrangement,&#34; although the new arrangement proposed will cost us four or five times what the existing system is costing. . Are people prepared to face that position? I come now to another consideration, When, under this Bill, we have taken our men in hand, and drilled them for the prescribed number of days, are we then likely to have a very efficient force? They will scarcely become a consolidated whole, as we are not likely to import the rifles and ammunition necessary to thoroughly equip an army of 200,000 men. What would be the use of the men without proper equipment? It is obvious that in that respect the scheme is likely to fail. But is it necessary, from an Australian point of view, that we should attempt to do anything like that which is proposed in this Bill ? I am thoroughly in accord with those who say that we should be in a position to defend ourselves ; but as Great Britain guarantees to defend us&#39; from an attack in force, all that we have to dread is a raid on the part of some cruisers that may attempt to land here a&#62; comparatively small body of men. To meet such an emergency what we need is not a huge, unwieldy army of partially trained men, but a few men so thoroughly drilled that if necessary they could take up the <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of instructors and drill the additional troops required for our defence. We all remember how rapidly the men whom we sent to South Africa were brought under discipline. True, that- discipline was not perfect ; no one imagines that the members of our contingents were drilled like Tommy Atkins. The training to which they were subjected was very imperfect, but the verdict of the officers in charge of the Australian contingents in South Africa was that they were a most useful body of men, and useful, more particularly because they had not been over drilled, but had been educated to take the initiative to an extent that made them a most valuable arm of the service in the Boer war. If there is to be an attack in force upon our shores, the class of warfare will be somewhat similar to that which took place in South Africa. The tactics that were so successfully adopted by our men there will be followed here, and in such an emergency I have confidence that our men will prove their worth. I have very great faith in the bravery of Australians, and believe that with comparatively little drilling they would be able - because of that initiative which has become characteristic of Australians - to play a worthy part in driving back any force that might escape the lynx eyes of the Imperial Navy, which is our first line of defence. I hope that the amendment will be carried, for, to my mind, it suggests the right mode of procedure. Realizing that the Imperial Navy constitutes our first line of defence, let us consider, first of all, what expenditure will be necessary to enable us to support it. Having determined what that expenditure is likely to be - and I venture to say that it will be considerably more than even the .Lords of the Admiralty have laid down - we shall have some idea of what we can afford to spend on the military side. In that matter, the Government have not left us entirely without a lead. In 1906 the Prime Minister said that an expenditure of &#163;1,650,000 per annum was altogether beyond our means. We now have before us a scheme which, at his own low estimate - an estimate which common sense rebels against as being inadequate - means an expenditure, not of &#163;1,650,000, but of &#163;1,740,000 in the first year, and in the third year, of &#163;1,800,000. If the Prime Minister was on sound ground when he said that we could not possibly face an expenditure of &#163;1,650,000 per annum, what justification can there be for a proposal to expend &#163;1,800,000 in the third year of the operation of this scheme? To what extent is that expenditure likely to increase when in the eighth year the number of men available will have gone up to 200,000? That is a conundrum which cannot be mathematically worked out, but it is worth consideration. If the people only ponder oyer it they will obtain some indication of the taxation they are likely to be called upon to bear&#39; in order to carry out a scheme which, in the first place, is unnecessary, and, in the second, is likely to lie ineffective and inequitable in its operation. </para>
