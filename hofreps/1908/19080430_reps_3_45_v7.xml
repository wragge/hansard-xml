                        <para>- I read the telegram, but have no knowledge of its accuracy. The Commonwealth is not responsible for what has occurred in the New Hebrides. We protested against the terms of the dual control, and recently, on hearing that the French Government had appointed a representative, and that the British Government had not made a similar appointment, cabled to the Colonial Office, pointing out that British settlers were under disability by reason of the activity of the French official and the absence of a British representative.. A reply was received about six weeks ago that the British appointment would be made as soon as possible. I am not aware that an appointment has yet been made, although the newspapers have since reported that minor positions have been filled with Frenchmen. As to the truth of that statement I&#39; have no knowledge, but if, on inquiry, it proves correct, &#34;I shall again communicate with the British Government, which has chosen this form of administration, but, for reasons which may be good, though unknown to us, has not exercised the powers it possesses under the joint agreement. </para>

                    <para>.-I wish to make a personal explanation with regard to a matter which occurred yesterday. I, regret having to do so, but I believe that a mere statement of the. facts may assist honorable members on similar occasions in the future. Yesterday, since there was to be a division on a certain  10704 <inline font-style="italic">Customs</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Tariff Bill.</inline> item,  as  to which the voting was likely to be very close, the whipping was - somewhat naturally - expected to be keen. What occurred, according to my own knowledge of the circumstances, was briefly this. I state the facts without comment to the Committee. I do not think that comment is necessary. Comparatively early in the debate the honorable member for Barker approached me and said that he had been asked to pair with the honorable member for Herbert. He asked me whether I was agreeable, and what I thought about it. I said that if the. honorable member for Herbert required  a  pair there were several honorable members whom he could get to pair with. I made inquiries, and found that the honorable member for Herbert and the honorable member for West Sydney were paired for the day- the honorable member for Herbert for the higher duties, and the honorable member for West Sydney for the lower duties. I then saw the Government Whip, and <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> was assured by him that the honorable member for West Sydney was with the Government on that division, and, that, in consequence, it was necessary to break the honorable member for Herbert&#39;s pair with him.&#39; I then found that, on the strength of that assurance, yet another honorable member, the honorable member for Barrier, was giving  a  pair to the honorable member for Herbert for that particular division. I then fortunately - very fortunately - met the honorable member for West Sydney, who unexpectedly had returned to the precincts of the House, and I learnt from him that he was firmly in favour of the lower duties, in spite of what the Government Whip had told me and other honorable members when he was trying to get an additional pair for the honorable member for Herbert. I then took the step which I think was only  a  reasonable step to take, of informing honorable members who would be expected to vote for lower duties that  a  certain amount of manoeuvring - I use the word in its mildest sense - was going on with reference to pairs, and that they must be on their guard. I made out what I considered to be  a  fair list of pairs for those absent from the Chamber, and I went and saw the honorable member for Yarra in reference to the matter, as I had understood that he had been intrusted with the whipping for the Government on this question. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want to go into the subject as to whether the Government is included in the honorable member&#39;s party. That is outside the scope of my explanation. But all yesterday, and on the previous day, I had been fixing up the pair lists with the honorable member for Yarra, and I had no knowledge of any alteration of this system. I read out a pair list to the the honorable member, and he had no objection to offer to it. In that pair list the honorable member for Wannon was paired with the honorable member for Echuca. When the division was taken, however, I found that the honorable member for Calare stood out - as I understood, at the instance of the Government Whip - being under the impression that he was paired with the honorable member for Wannon. So that, in two instances yesterday, we found one honorable member paired with two others on a division where the numbers were expected to be close. The Treasurer may express amusement at this kind of thing ; but if these tactics are to be pursued in future, the only safeguard that an honorable man will have in this Chamber will be to sign his own name in the pair-book. </para>

Difficulties in regard to pairs arise only in connexion with the Tariff, and they are due to the fact that many honorable members&#39; often decide to vote in a way that is unexpected. </para>

                        <para>- It was before &#39; his &#39; return. In addition to that, I had told the honorable member for Calare, whose name has also been- mentioned, that I- would not ask him for a pair for the .honorable member for West Sydney if some other pair could be obtained, and that in any case, I should not ask him if the honorable member for West Sydney were voting as he proposed to do. When, at the instance of the -Minister of Trade and Customs, I asked the honorable member for Calare for a pair for the honorable member for Wannon, he said, &#34; No, I shall not give you a pair, because your party has refused to give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler</inline> - the honorable member for Perth - a pair. If you will give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler</inline> a pair, then I shall be pleased to pair with the honorable member for Wannon.&#34; I replied that I had not refused any one a pair, and the honorable member said that, in those circumstances, he would give me the pair for which I asked. I immediately agreed that the honorable member for Perth should have a pair, and one has been found for him. Every pair for which I was asked in connexion with the division in question was given. </para>

What I have challenged is the right of the honorable member to arrange pairs for honorable members who are not members of the Opposition, arid who usually vote with us. If the two members of the Opposition who were unpaired last night had sought pairs, they would have obtained them. The others must speak for themselves, for the Opposition Whip has no authority to pair them, and I have none. </para>

During the afternoon I was asked by the honorable member for Laahecoorie to pair with him for a specified time, in-order that he might transact some business Outside the House. I agreed to do so, and a division was taken during his absence. Later on the Opposition Whip spoke to me about a pair for the honorable member for Perth, who is out of the State, and I said that I would endeavour to secure one for him; Subsequently the Government Whip asked me for a pair for the honorable member for Wannon, who, like the honorable member for Perth, is a member of my party, &#39;and I informed him that if he could find a pair for the honorable member for Perth, I would give him a pair for the other member of. my party, although I certainly was not anxious to pair. </para>

The suggestion made by the Senate to insert the proposed new paragraph AA under item 170 as a substitution &#39;for the words to which I have referred, which were included in item 176, is an excellent one.

I do not think that the Minister will find any larger industries of the kind in any part of the Commonwealth ; and I am astonished that it should be proposed to accept this request. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it is at all likely that this firm does only the enamelling. The freight on cast-iron goods will be just as heavy as on enamelled goods; and the chances are that the firm do their own casting, though, of course, I cannot speak definitely. I do not blame the Government for not going behind the agreement made in the Senate, but that agreement does not absolve honorable members, who have a duty to perform. If these goods are being made here, arid we are instituting a protective Tariff, the industry ought to be protected. </para>

Even if the firm themselves have not a foundry, according to the honorable member for Robertson, they give the work out, so that it is done in the Commonwealth all the same. That shows that foundries exist in Australia, and would be injured by the adoption of the request. I am pleased that the Treasurer has agreed to postpone the request until we get full information. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Treasurer will reconsider his decision to postpone the request. I am surprised that the argument in favour of increasing the duty on these articles, which are used chiefly by the poorer classes of the community, should come from the Labour corner. They are used by the very men who should be assisted by the members of that party, such as prospectors and others who go out on the land. Many honorable members have seen these articles, both tinned and untinned, in use in various camps throughout Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Committee will give some consideration to the requirements of the mining industry. In view of the very low price of metals, affecting as it does some very large mines in which the use of imported rock drills is found to be necessary, the imposition of a high duty is a serious matter. I believe that we are all agreed to give as much assistance as possible to every industry. It would be a very material assistance to the mining industry if we acceded to the Senate&#39;s request, and it would do no injury to the local industry of rock-drill making. When this item was under consideration previously, there were some apparent contradictions, which can be easily reconciled. On that occasion instances were given of the use of different kinds of  drills.  It is not a question as to whether the Australian drill is a good one or not. For certain kinds of rock it is suitable, and therefore is used. To say  that it has been used successfully in different mines is only evidence of the fact that it is suitable for drilling the strata in particular localities. The users of various  drills  in other kinds of rock, notably in the Cobar district, declare that the Australian drill does not answer so well as does the imported drill. It is urged that, whilst, the Australian drill may do the work, it costs too much far repairs. In the case of other rocks, however, the cost of repairing the  locally-made  drill is not so  great.  It all depends on the nature of the country in which it is used. From the general manager of the Great Cobar Copper mine, who keeps  a  record of the outlay on  drills,  I learn that the imported drill costs  12s.  6d. a year for repairs, and the </para>

                        <para>- Without any protection, the Australian drill is able to undersell the imported article. Honorable members can readily understand that a mining company will not give <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> more for an imported drill unless it has a good reason for not preferring the local drill. Every mining company will take the latter where it is adapted to the rock which it has to work. In such cases there need be no fear of the Australian drill not holding its own. It is always a question of the suitability of a drill to a particular formation of country. When rock drills were on the free list, the Australian article was able to hold its own wherever it was found to be suitable to the country. It is not possible to compel any mining company - which naturally wants to procure the most efficient machine it can - to use the Australian article. No matter what duty may be imposed, a company will prefer to use the imported drill, even at an additional cost of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7.</inline> where the Australian drill is not suitable to the country. The local makers will not sell one drill more if honorable members impose this high duty, but the mining industry will be handicapped to the extent of the duty. Why should they put a serious handicap on mining when they cannot benefit the local manufacturer? It would&#39; be most foolish on their part to unnecessarily tax the mining industry and retard its development. Owing to the fall in the price of metals, the position of many mining companies is a very serious one, especially where low-grade ores are being dealt with. The Committee is here afforded an opportunity to benefit the mining industry without doing an injury to the local manufacturer of rock drills. Those who succeeded in imposing a high duty previously failed to realize that for certain rocks the Australian drill is not suitable, and that for others it is suitable. There is really room for the employment of all kinds of rock drills. Every mining company can&#39; be safely left to select the drill which is best suited to the particular country which it is working. Undoubtedly there will be a demand for the cheaper article where it will do the work. The fact that it can be obtained at a lower price, arid that parts can be procured readily is a great inducement to any management to use the Australian drill. Owing to the nature of the rock, or the hardness of the country at Cobar and Broken Hill in New South Wales and in Western Australia, the </para>

                    <para>.- I trust that the Committee will assent to the request of the Senate. The reason why rock drills of Australian manufacture are inferior to imported drills is that in the case of the former it is impossible to regulate the stroke. With the Australian drill, the same blow must be struck, irrespective of whether  it is working upon . hard -or soft rock. In the case of imported drills, however, the blow can be regulated according to the hardness of the rock in which the drill is working, and thereby the steel parts are saved. This is the reason, why imported drills do better work in rock generally than do the Australian drills. When the latter are employed, the constant jar upon- the parts necessitates frequent repairs. I think we must all recognise that at the present time the mining industry stands in need of all the assistance that we can offer it. The big companies are paying no dividends to their -shareholders, and every penny that is being taken out of the mines is being expended. Consequently this, is not the time when we ought to increase the duties upon the tools of trade of the mining industry. These rock drills are tools of trade, and I hold that the mine managers who are responsible for the economic working of the mines should be at liberty to use- the tools which they regard as the best without being penalized for so doing. Of course there are any number of places in Australia where the locally-made drills can be used, but the mine managers themselves are the best judges as to where the imported article can be employed to most advantage. . I trust that the Committee will agree to the requested reduction of duty. </para>

                    <para>.- Both the honorable member for Darling and the honorable member for Fremantle have made but a strong case on behalf &#39;of the users , of these machines. It is unfortunate   that the products of the engineer should be the working tools either nf the farmer or the miner. As a. result, we find many honorable members representing agricultural and mining constituencies combining forces to defeat the -duty proposed upon these articles. Whilst the honorable member for Darling was speaking, I asked him what was the average price of rock drills, and his reply was <inline font-style="italic">&#34;&#163;34&#34;</inline> Now, I contend that the poor man does not Pa&#62;&#39; ;&#163;34 f&#176;r a t0&#176;l &#176;f trade, and where companies are concerned, an extra. 5 per Cent., 10 per cent., or even 20 per cent, will not prevent them from obtaining the imported  article if they desire it. The honorable member for &#39;Fremantle has said that the mine managers themselves are the best judges as to the class of rock drill which should be employed. I admit that. But I would point out . that mining managers would not purchase the imported article if they would not be more than recouped by so doing.&#39; Personally, I fail to see why the engineering industry should be neglected.

                    <para>Many types of rock drills are in use in Australia. A Victorian engineer (Taylor Horsfield, of Bendigo) and a South Australian mining manager (Captain Hancock, of Moonta) had designed rock drills, which had considerable improvements on those imported. It was said, however, that under present conditions there was small chance of petting Australian designed and made drills into general use.  The  better such drills were the greater the probability of their being copied  by  American makers, and sent to Australia free (if percussive). The method of American manufacturers was thus described : When they found a better drill than their own, their agent secured  10712 <inline font-style="italic">Customs</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Tariff Bill.</inline> samples, sent them to America to be copied ; they were then sent to Australia, and sold at any price, until the local manufacturers were knocked out. - (Q. 46487, 46643.) Percussion rock drills, now duty free, were made locally, but competition with the importer was impossible. A duty of 25 per cent. would enable the local men to capture the market, and would greatly increase employment. - (Q. 48031.) </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that imported drills are covered by any patents. I fancy that the patents have expired. It is an extraordinary thing that Australian workmen. - although they profess themselves in favour of protection - insist upon using imported articles whenever the opportunity presents itself. Quite recently I had a painter working for me, for whom. I bought Australian-made brushes. He declined to use them, and insisted upon being supplied with English brushes. Similarly, I was told by a saddler some time ago that no good leather was made in Australia. Yet, as a matter of fact, we export tons of leather to England and other parts of the world. </para>

                        <para>- An Australian case has more weight than an English case with the Judges. There is a certain amount of prejudice in the minds of many persons against the manufactures of their own country. This obtains everywhere; but perhaps it is more accentuated in Australia than in other places. Whilst a duty of 20 per cent. may be too high, in view of the depressed condition of the mining industry at present, due to the low price of metals, the Government might, perhaps, agree to a compromise. I suggest a duty of 15 per cent. That will give a certain amount of protection. </para>

                    WILLIS (Robertson; ) [3.53]. - This question gave rise to a considerable discussion when the item was first under review. The evidence of the Tariff Commission was largely quoted, and it was shown that imported drills cannot be made in Australia, because of the patents by which they are covered. Even the honorable member for Bendigo has admitted that the Australian drills sell at a lower price than the imported drills. In view of these facts, the contention that a high duty will give employment to our engineers falls to the ground; the only effect. of a high duty will be to penalize mining. I hope, therefore, that the honorable member for Dalley will reconsider his determination in this matter, and allow these drills to be imported subject to a duty of 5 per cent. I think that the honorable member for Batman admitted that they cannot be made here because of the patents which cover them.

                        <para>- The evidence which was read show that the drills are completely protected by patents. I suppose they cost more than the locally-made drills, because they do work which cannot be done by these drills. So much capital has been invested in mining that the imported drills, if necessary, will be bought whatever they cost. Therefore, if the intention is to increase the revenue, a high duty will have that effect; but it will be useless so far as providing work for our engineers is concerned, because these drills cannot be made here. The constituents of the honorable member for D alley will not benefit by a duty of 20 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- When the matter was last discussed, the honorable member for Balaclava stated that recently, when the Long Tunnel mine was sinking 800 feet, the men who did the work were at liberty to choose their own drill, arid commenced with the Taylor-Horsfield drill. Subsequently they tried. the Ingersoll drill, and finally reverted to the Australian drill, because they found that it did better work than was &#34;done by the American drill, and at a lower cost. The drills were being used, not in &#34; cheesy &#34; country, but in granitic rock - some of the hardest rock that is to be encountered in deep sinking. The Australian drill bored  160  feet per month. </para>

                        <para>- I can name a dozen districts in which Australian drills have been used. Captain Hancock, of Moonta, speaks well of these drills. They are made, not only in Victoria, butt also in Queensland and South Australia. The Victorian maker, has his factory, not in my district, but in Bendigo. He was originally an apprentice, subsequently a journeyman, and is now a master, employing a very large number of men, and turning out a very fine drill. </para>

Rowe, mining manager of the New Chum Railway Company ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Francis</inline> Agnew, mining manager of North Johnson&#39;s Reef Company. These mines are widely separated and are in different kinds of country. Experience shows the Australian drills. to be cheaper and better than the imported drills, and an advantage to be obtained in using them is that spare parts can be had- and repairs made more expeditiously than in the case of imported drills. The manufacture of drills employs skilled labour, which receives high rates of wages. The patent  Tights  in connexion with the Ingersoll drill will expire in a few months, and, therefore, the contention that it cannot be made in Australia will in a little time have no force. I also -point out that rock drills are not all made by men with a large amount of capital. They are often made by men working in a very small way, who have settled in mining districts, and who, by industry and ability, have got together a little plant, with which they manufacture rock drills which are&#39; giving every satisfaction.  In the town of Maldon, in Victoria, there is a manufacturer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Faulkner,</inline> who has made over  200  rock drills the results from which have been eminently satisfactory to those who have vised them. I urge .honorable members to support the Government proposal,  considering that the locally-made article is as good as, and often superior to, the imported rock drill,- that it is sold at a lower price, and that its manufacture iri this country affords employment to a large number of people. This is not a matter of geographical protection, but relates to an industry that has branches in every part of Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- I am afraid that some honorable members have overlooked the discussion that took place with regard to rock drills on the last occasion when the Tariff was under consideration. The . original . proposal of the Government was that the duties should be  30  and  25  per cent. It was shown in the course of the discussion, as a reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> shows, that a meeting. of the mine owners of Bendigo had. taken place, and. that they gave their verdict absolutely in favour of .the imported article. I do not wish to decry the rock drills that are made in Australia, or to &#39;minimise, the possibility of their manufacture here. But I cannot act against my judgment, nor can I cast a vote which, in my belief, would be in the direction- of loading the cost of * mining to an extent that would absolutely ruin it. The request of the Senate appears . to me to fit in with . the necessities of to-day. I venture to say that a reduction of the duty to 5 per cent, will do good.&#39; I do not know whether the Treasurer knows&#39; anything about mining. Perhaps he is not so omniscient as are some other statesmen, who appear to think that they made the world; and are themselves angels. I know that the Treasurer understands pastoral interests, but if he follows mining with any degree of closeness, he must be. aware that there is an absolute disinclination on the part of the public of this country to continue investing their money in mines.) In face of that fact,- it is surely the province of the Legislature to refrain from hampering the industry. I assure honorable members, from my knowledge of mining requirements, that they will do well to vote for the Senate&#39;s request. . A point .that should not be lost sight of is that the duty to which we are asked to agree was the result of a compromise. Those who wished to make rock drills free found that they could not do any better than agree to a 5 per cent, duty, and therefore they accepted it. I trust .that the Committee will give consideration. . to the almost &#39; innumerable difficulties with which the mining interest is faced. No sooner do you get a man down  2  feet below the surface than he ceases to be your. man.  Although you pay him he becomes your master. There are a thousand, considerations in connexion with mining that tend to retard the industry, and if we increase its difficulties by taxing  its machinery, we shall strengthen the determination of many of the investing public nc: to operate in mining. </para>

                    <para>, - I. hope that the Committee will- not act on the advice tendered bv the honorable mern. ber for Laanecoorie, but will agree to. the request of the Senate.  I consider that the mining industry is entitled to fair consideration at our hands. Mining is one pf the principal industries in the Commonwealth. We cannot ignore its necessities; 1 know of no community that is more cosmopolitan than is the mining community. Those engaged in mining run their undertakings on strictly commercial principles. It is -with, them a&#39; question of making the most of the expenditure incurred. Those at the head of mining concerns are men possessed of a considerable amount of ability and knowledge as to the best methods of carrying on their works. They are not affected by party prejudices. They prefer to use the latest and most up-to-date methods. Mining men generally admit that for the softer class of country the drills made in Australia are very suitable. They are used for such country. A considerable amount of Our mining, however, is-not conducted in soft country, but has to contend with rock that is very hard and difficult to handle. It is simply because, the- imported rock drills are found to meet; these special requirements that they are used. The imposition of a duty would not limit the use of imported rock drills ; it would simply add to the cost of the undertakings in connexion with which they are employed. It stands to reason that if those engaged in mining could procure a locally-made machine for <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;&#34;j</inline> less than the price of an imported machine, considerations of hard cash would induce&#39; them to use the Australian rock drill. But it is not suitable for special kinds of work, and therefore they cannot use it. If it were a question of undercutting in prices, as .has been suggested, there might be something in the argument of the honorable member for Laanecoorie. But those who have to- deal in the open market know to their cost that there is none of the undercutting of prices that has been suggested. If mining men could use the locally-made machines in difficult country, I- am satisfied that the lower price alone would induce them to do <inline font-style="italic">so&#39;.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I would ask the honorable member to look at the question from the stand-point that I have been suggesting. Here is an industry that is run by cosmopolitan men, many of whom have had experience in all parts of the world. Mining men travel perhaps more than do. men engaged in any other industry. Their ideas are broadened by travel. They run their industries for the purpose of making as much out <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> them as they Can in return for their capital expenditure. Is it likely that men engaged in an industry conducted on these lines would pay increased prices for rock drills simply on account of prejudice against the locally-made machines? ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Salmon.</inline> - The. prejudice undoubtedly exists </para>

                        <para>- I have no knowledge of what mine managers in Western Australia do. I cannot speak on -their behalf. But it seems to me to be most extraordinary to say &#34;that the big mining concerns are run by a few directors who practically have no knowledge of their own requirements, and who disregard the expert opinion of the men whom they engage to carry on their operations. My inquiries lead me to the conclusion that assertions about prejudice do not apply to any material extent to this industry. &#39;If the locally-made rock drills were suitable for certain classes of country, the principles of commercialism, to say nothing of patriotism, would conduce to their use in the big mines. But&#39; where deep sinking and difficult work has to be undertaken,&#39; it is notorious that locally-made rock drills are not equal to the imported machines. </para>

                        <para>- I am. speaking of mining men generally who are familiar with the practical part of- the work. In dealing with- these matters I prefer to be guided by the views of practical as against those of. theoretical men, -My argument is supported by the fact that the imported machines, although dearer than those of local manufacture, are used in mines controlled by practical, levelheaded, close-fisted mem, not because of any prejudice against the local machines, but because the imported ones render more efficient service. The honorable member for Fremantle has pointed out .that one reason why the imported machine is preferred for use in certain areas in Western Australia is that its stroke is regulated, whereas the Australian manufacturers have  not  regulated the stroke of their machines. We are asked to assume that a community that is endeavouring to obtain the best possible returns for its outlay, has not sufficient common sense to recognise what are the best machines for its purpose, and we are told that we should endeavour by taxation to compel it, against the hard logic of the pocket, to use a locally-made machine. To put forward such a plea is to reduce our proceedings to a farce. The imposition of these high duties will not mean a very material increase in the output of locally-made machines, but it will add to the cost of those who find it absolutely necessary to use the imported machine, and to that extent it will be disadvantageous to the general mining community. </para>

                        <para>- If it is as good as the imported, and is offered for sale at <inline font-style="italic">j&#163;j</inline> less than the price of the imported machine, that  in  itself should be sufficient to appeal to the mining community. Apparently it is npt, and the honorable member therefore desires to place an increased embargo&#34;&#34; on the imported machine, in order to compel mine-owners to use the local production. Men engage in mining, not as a matter of sentiment, but to make money, and they use  the  imported machines because they find that they are superior. The mining industry has been hard hit during the last few years. Prices of metals have materially decreased, and, in many cases, the margin of profit has been reduced almost to vanishing point. Those having the. control of a large number of mining propositions  are seriously considering whether they can continue to carry on operations upon a payable basis. The most effective machinery is necessary to enable them to do so, and yet it is proposed to place increased duties upon machines which experience proves must be used by them, and so to reduce their margin of profit.. The mining industry is one of the big wealth-producing factors of Australia, and cannot derive much benefit from Customs taxation. It gives employment to thousands of men, and, having regard to its importance, it should receive some consideration at the hands of the Committee. I- hope that the requested amendment will be made. </para>

                    <para>. - I am rather unwilling to prolong this debate, because, when the item was before us some months ago, I gave expression to my views with respect to the taxation of mining machinery. Since then, however, the whole question has been reviewed by another place, and, as we are now invited by it to reduce- the duties imposed upon this item, I think I shall be justified in adding a few words to what I sai.d on the subject on a previous occasion. I do not consider it wise to place special burdens upon the great primary industry of mining, which supports large communities, gives employment to thousands of men, and has an immensely beneficial influence on every other industry in Australia. Mining is an arduous calling. In many cases men have to go into the wilds and overcome numerous . physical difficulties in their efforts to discover the existence of gold and other minerals, and yet, when they have made a discovery, some honorable members would hamper their operations by imposing a heavy burden of taxation upon their tools of trade. Such a policy is,  to my mind, unwise. It seems like! killing the goose that lays the golden egg. The policy of the Government in respect of the requests made bv the Senate is summed up by the familiar expression, &#34; Heads, I win ; tails, you lose.&#34; They invite the Committee to agree  to every requested amendment providing for increased  duties, although they must know that in accepting increases by the Senate they are sacrificing the exclusive powers of this House to initiate taxation, and they almost invariably call upon honorable members to reject a request for reduced duties. I should have thought that the arguments advanced in favour of this request would have convinced the Government of its wisdom. The Australian, drill, although offered at a lower price than the imported machine, is not used in cases where the rock is very hard and refractory. </para>

                        <para>- I have not precise personal knowledge of the subject, but it has been stated by the honorable member for Calare, the honorable member for Darling, and others, that that is so. We_ have to remember that this item relates to a tool of trade. Tools of trade used in many other industries are free, and yet we are asked to impose heavy duties on one of the tools of trade of one of the greatest industries which has produced in Australia about &#163;700,000,000 of new wealth. One is inclined in this connexion to think &#39;of great mining centres like Broken Hill, Ballarat, and Bendigo, where the industry has been carried on for years, and has almost become an ordinary business, but my view is that we are, as yet, only on the fringe of mining development in Australia. Why should we be seeking to impose additional burdens upon those&#39; who are directing their energy and knowledge to an effort to open out new mines, and so to discover fresh sources of wealth in Australia? I shall certainly vote for the requested amendment. It seems to me that the mining industry has scant sympathy from the Government. Ministers are inclined to deal sympathetically with items relating to industries with which they are familiar; but they appear to have but little sympathy with the mining industry, and especially with&#39; the mining industry in Western Australia, where a great deal of hard refractory rock is met with. </para>

                    <para>.-The right honorable member for Swan &#34;recently visited Bendigo - an important mining district - which has been developed under a protective Tariff. Listening to the speeches made during this debate, one would imagine that by imposing these duties we are taxing the industry. As a matter of fact, so far as these machines are concerned, the industry was taxed prior to their being manufactured in Australia. A mining man had then to pay &#163;60 for a machine which he can purchase to-day for about &#163;30. That is a result of local competition* The United States would levy a duty of 27J per cent, on Australian machines,, and yet representatives of American firms ask us to admit their machines free. Is that fair ? I can quite understand the attitude of the honorable member for Calare. The honorable member is out for free-trade, and is consistent. He would not support a duty even if it could be shown that the local machines were better than the imported article. We have been told by the honorable member for Darling that the local machines will not do the work required to be done. </para>

                        <para>- I will tell the honorable member. The Australian machine is working to-day under a pressure of 115 lbs. to the square inch. Is that enough for the honorable member? What is the position? Honorable members can go to Bendigo, and in the deepest mine in the world they will find that an Australian rock drill is being used. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is no doubt very anxious that we should go to a division, but I do not intend to permit an Australian machine to be decried without saying something in&#39; its favour. I have in my hand a photograph of the largest rock drill in the world. It was made in Australia, and weighs 1 ton 6 cwt. We are being asked to permit these machines to be imported duty free. Honorable members who are supporting the request would say to Australian workmen, &#34; You are good, enough to work in the mines at Bendigo and Broken Hill, and good enough to work 3,000 feet or 4,000 feet below ground, but you are not good enough to make the mining machinery we require.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- There are 120,000 men employed in mining in Australia. There are some 1 9,000 employed in Western Australia, 42,600 in New South Wales, and 26,000 in Victoria, and we are told that the 19,000 employed in Western Australia are against the Australian machines. As a matter of fact they are not against the Australian machines. The majority of the men working in the mines of Western Australia went to that State from Victoria. They have used the Australian machines, and know the result. </para>

                        <para>- That is like some of the honorable member&#39;s other statements. I saw an Australian machine boring with1&#188;-inch steel at a 4,400-feet level, with a pressure behind it of 115 lbs. to the square inch. If the honorable member doubts my word I shall be pleased to take, him down the mine, and let him see for himself. Would the honorable member be prepared to vote for a duty on these machines if that statement were proved to be correct ? Of course, I know he would not. </para>

                        <para>- About the same as that of the imported drill. It is not entirely a matter of price. If one tried to send a drill to the country from which the imported drill comes, he would be charged 27 per cent. duty. Yet we are asked to allow foreign-made drills to come in free. In Western Australia, ,&#163;4,396,000 has been expended on mining machinery, a very large sum ; but the expenditure has been greater than it need have been, because the mine-owners have gone to the Old Country instead of buying Australian-made machinery. Is no consideration to be given to, the men employed in our engineering works, or to those who have expended money in building up our factories and foundries? Over 16,000 men are employed in the engineering trade in Australia, and &#163;1,550,000 has been invested in the industry. Are we to close our factories &#39;and: foundries in order that foreign-made machinery may flood the market ? </para>

                        <para>- Let me remind the honorable member that local competition has reduced the price of these drills from &#163;60 to &#163;30. How many of the 120,000 miners in Australia would vote for the taking off of the duty ? Are these drills the tools ot trade of the working miner in the sense that picks and shovels are ? No. If the duty were taken off, only the importers would benefit. A short time ago, when a drill was required for a quarry not far from here, an importer asked &#163;45 for one, but when he heard that an Australian manufacturer had offered to supply a drill, he reduced his price to &#163;32. My answer to the honorable member for Calare is that local competition is bringing about the manufacture, at reasonable prices, of&#39; machines which give every satisfaction. I hold, in mv. hand a piece of stone which was brought up from a depth of 4,440 feet. If the honorable member for Darling can produce harder stone from Cobar or Western Australia, I shall be ready to vote for the taking off of the duty&#39;. He and the honorable member for Kalgoorlie are members of the Labour Party ; but is the proposal for the removal of the duty advanced on behalf of the miners of Western Australia ? </para>

                        <para>- Apparently the right honorable gentleman thinks that he has the numbers, and that further speeches are useless. The removal of the duty would benefit, only the importers. I have shown that it is not a tax on the mining industry, and I hope that the Committee will not be led away by statements like those of the honorable member for Calare, who under any circumstances would vote against the duty. I am surprised that the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, who was elected to represent one section of the community, is now&#39; representing another section. In the interests of the great body of workers I ask the Committee to adhere to its former decision, and vote for the duty. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. No man has a right to be working there for less. In view of the great depreciation existing at present in the price of all metals, and the difficulty of providing new sources of employment or opening up new mining enterprises, the honorable member for Batman must consider that it is not a question merely as to whether these duties will affect the mines or not. We are faced with the very serious question of whether there will be full employment at all in mining. I regret to say that probably, unless there isa change in present conditions, a great many men must lose their employment. There is a disposition in this Chamber to ascribe many of the effects that we see to wrong causes. We are blaming certain duties which the Government are imposing for effects which really arise from our absolute inability to alter the condition now obtaining throughout the world, which means lower prices all round. I fear that the influence of that condition is going to be serious upon the miners as a whole. It is a grave position with which Australia is at present faced. When this item was last before this Chamber, I voted for a duty of 15 per cent. It is perfectly idle to say that these drills cannot be made in Australia, because I know of my own knowledge that they are being used in some of the mines at Broken Hill, and used successfully. The question as to whether a man uses an Ingersoll drill, a Rand drill, a Sullivan drill, a Holman drill, or the Bendigo drill is mostly a pure matter of prejudice, dictated by the mining manager, or sometimes by the directors. But it would be just as idle to assert that for all purposes the Bendigo drill is equally serviceable and equally useful with the imported article. I feel strongly that there is no legitimate reason why a useful and valuable drill should not be made in Australia in larger numbers than  are  being used at present. I know of my own knowledge that the Bendigo drill is being successfully used at present in the Long Tunnel mine. The honorable member for Batman read a certificate from a very capable manager, and, if there is anything in the desire to give reasonable protection, it is absurd not to give some assistance to an industry which is not very vigorous, and needs some help. I see no reason, other than the great reduction of prices now affecting the whole world, why I should change the vote which I gave previously. I propose, therefore, to ask the Committee to accept a duty of 15 per cent. in the general Tariff, instead of the 20 per cent. which appears in the schedule, with a duty of 10 per cent., instead of 15 per cent., against the United Kingdom. Will the Minister agree to that, as a large  10722 <inline font-style="italic">Customs</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Tariff Bill.</inline> number of honorable members are prepared to vote for it? </para>

In regard to the merits of the proposal, I cannot for the life of me see why&#39; we should differentiate between the mining and all the other industries &#39;of Australia. Tools of trade that are necessary to the mechanic in any other industry, and that are not produced in a satisfactory form in Australia are admitted free under this Tariff, but when it comes to a question of the mining industry, a duty of this kind, for which there is absolutely no justification, is imposed. There are at present, speaking from memory, working in Australia 1,500 or 1,600 rock drills, half or nearly half of which are in Western Australia. The fact cannot be disputed that, although the great majority of mining managers in that State, and certainly those of all the principal mines are Australians, and most of them Victorians, none of the Australian drills are working in the principal mines in Western Australia at present. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hamilton,</inline> the manager of the Great Boulder mine, tried to perfect the Taylor-Horsfield drill that came from Bendigo in order, I suppose, that he might be able to use that class of drill at a lower cost than he had to give for imported drills. He expended considerable time and energy in the attempt, but ultimately had to abandon it. Surely when the locally-made drill can be obtained under present conditions for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7less</inline> than the imported, there must be some solid reason for mining managers buying the dearer article. Their justification is that the locally-made drill has not been perfected up to the condition of the imported drill. It is not a question of prejudice at all, but a question of capacity to meet the existing conditions. If I could see my way clear to vote for the duty, I should be very pleased to do so, but I cannot do so when I know that it means imposing a tax of about &#163;20,000 per annum on the mining industry. I thoroughly believe that the imposition of the duty will not diminish the number of drills imported. The drill that has been giving satisfaction, that has a superior valve gear, and has the advantage of a number of other patents, will still be preferred. </para>

                        <para>- If the Austral Company can make a satisfactory drill I shall be very pleased.

As to the question of who will ultimately pay for it, if the Committee insist on piling these duties in a general fashion upon the mining industry in connexion with articles that cannot be satisfactorily produced in Australia, instead of putting prohibitive rates on articles that can be satisfactorily made here, and allowing those which cannot to come in free, it is the working man  who will ultimately suffer, because he will lose his employment in the mining propositions of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I fail to see the point of the interjection. A great number of necessities in machinery for which there is a market in Australia are being satisfactorily produced here now. But there are other classes of machinery which, on account of patent rights and their highly technical construction, we cannot produce satisfactorily. I believe that this is one of them, and that the patent rights in connexion with the imported drills make them absolutely superior to the locally made. They are so superior that mining managers have been compelled to pay the higher price for them. We are asked now, in order to give employment to a very few workmen in Bendigo, to impose this great additional burden on the mining industry, which must ultimately affect the men employed therein. There is no justification for. it, and I am prepared to accept the amendment requested by the Senate. </para>

                    <para>There appears to be a difference of opinion as to whether the duty should be 5 per cent, or 20 per cent., or some intermediate rate, and I think the Committee would be glad to have, the question&#93; put in such a way that a clear vote can be taken on the item. . It may be a- matter of some difficulty to decide how it is to be put. I understand from the Chair, that if the usual proposition, &#34; That the requested amendment be not made,&#34; is put and agreed to, that will be conclusive, and the duty will remain at 20 per cent. That would not) be satisfactory to the Committee  because <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> understand that a number of honorable members are not in. favour of the Senate&#39;s request, but are willing to adopt some duty lower than 20 per cent. We should arrive at some way of putting the question, to enable those who are against the Senate&#39;s request- to vote against it, and then allow others, to propose am alternative if- they -like.  It - is usual in a case of that! nature to give the Committee an opportunity of halving a straight out . vote. &#34;... </para>

                        <para>- I think that if the question were put that the requested amendment to 5 per cent, be made, the opinion of the Committee could be tested, because all &#34; those who wished to make the duty higher could vote for the omission of that figure. I desire to say a. few words on the main question, because I detect rather a strong disposition on the other- side to prolong the agony on the Tariff. I am not going to help them, because they have a sword hanging over their heads, and want to leave it there as long as they can.  A  rock drill is really a tool of trade. Hundreds of tools of trade are admitted free for industries which are getting a protection of 30 or 40 per cent., but -the gold miners, the coal miners, the copper miners, and the tin miners do not get a shred of protection out of the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- Why should not the artisans on gold-fields, or the companies which employ them - for it is exactly . the same thing - get their tools of trade free if the artisans in other  industries get theirs free? Take the hat and. other factories which are protected to the extent of. 30 or 40 per cent. - - indeed, some hats have been given a protection of 120 per cent. - they get their tools of trade free, and but for a protest from this side, they would have got free machinery too. .Why should not the gold mining industry have its tools of trade free if the artisans of Sydney and Melbourne get theirs free, seeing that the. latter get a protection in respect of the articles which they&#39; produce? The miners do not get a single shred of protection. Theirs is a most uncertain industry. As every one knows, thousands of miners depend not upon their own industry, not upon the merits of their work, but upon whether a certain mining proposition is paying. If it is not paying, they are thrown out of work. Other industries are made secure in that regard by giving them a protection of 40 per cent. There is no such protection given to the miners, and therefore I submit that the mining industry should receive the same advantage as regards a tool of trade. I hope that I have not disturbed the conversations in the chamber. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member will only exercise a little patience he may even see rock drills exported. Seeing that Australia is an important mining country with great possibilities, my idea is to have all the machinery used in our mines made locally if possible and under the best conditions. If the machinery for gold mines is made here that will assist the coal and iron mines and other branches of mining. While I voted in the light of certain knowledge for a duty of 20 per cent, on rock drills I feel inclined now, owing to later information, to ask for a reduction of the rate. I am willing to take the lowest rate, which I consider is fairly protective, and that is 15 per cent. If the Treasurer would adopt my suggestion it would be a fair arrangement. Otherwise it will be better to admit rock drills free than to impose a duty of 5 or 10 per cent., because that would be merely a revenue duty. A point .was brought up by the honorable member for Batman, which I cannot allow to pass without comment, and that was that working miners are not affected by the price of rock drills. That is a very absurd idea. The whole thing hinges upon the working of low-grade mines. We know that in Australia there are thousands of mining propositions which by very cheap treatment could be made to pay. We should not hinder any companies which are willing to invest their capital in that direction from opening up their mining propositions. The very first men to benefit when a mining proposition is opened up are the employes. The honorable member for Batman also overlooked the fact that we have got beyond the pick and shovel days of mining and have now reached the era of machine mining. In the future the mining of Australia will have to be done mainly by large machinery and with large capital. It is therefore of no use for him te suggest to the Committee that it is not &#39; desired to tax the pick and shovel which a poor man uses. He, as well as anybody else, has to use machines. If a body of men undertake mining contracts or take a mine on tribute they, too, must use machinery. If I had the opportunity I should urge that a bounty upon, the production of mining machinery should be offered, because, in my opinion, that would be much fairer to the mining industry than a protective duty. After listening to the statements of honorable members I am rather in doubt as to which drill is the more efficient - the . Australian or the imported. That there are a number of mine-owners who greatly prefer the foreign drill goes without saying. But, seeing that a company has manufactured a fairly efficient drill, struggled along, and sold a large number of drills, I think that it would be unfair to take away all protection from them.&#34; Therefore I shall support a duty of 15 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to point out to the Committee that the noise and the exchange of interjections which frequently take place during the progress of divisions are scarcely in keeping with the dignity of this Chamber, and that it is a matter of impossibility for me to preserve order without the assistance of honorable members. Many times when I have attempted to call the Committee to order, I have not been able to raise my voice sufficiently to make myself heard. I ask honorable members to assist me in maintaining order whilst divisions are in progress. Of course, it is only natural that a certain amount of excitement should be engendered at such times, and I am prepared to allow a reasonable latitude in that connexion, but I do ask the Committee to help me to maintain more decorum than was manifested during the division just taken. </para>

                        <para>- Upon a former occasion the honorable member for Flinders voted against the imposition of a duty of 15 per cent. on this item, and in favour of a duty of 20 per cent. In the recent division, however, he voted for a 5 per cent. rate. I expect that he will vote for the admission of these articles free  if  he gets the opportunity to do so. At a later stage: - if the Government do not take action in that direction - I shall move that the item be recommitted with a view either to making it dutiable at 15 per cent. or to admitting it free. </para>

                    <para>- Those honorable members who call themselves protectionists, and who - after voting for 20 per cent. upon this item when it-was previously under consideration in. opposition to 15 per cent. - assisted just now to defeat a proposal to levy a reasonable duty upon it. are worse than our direct opponents. They have attempted to place those who are endeavouring to frame a scientific Tariff in a false position. I hold in my hand a volume of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> which shows that when this matter was formerly under consideration the honorable member for Flinders and the honorable member for Echuca, both of whom were returned to this House because of their professed protectionist principles, voted in favour of a duty of 20 per cent. in opposition to a duty of 15 per cent. If this Committee is not entitled to an explanation regarding their change of front, certainly their constituents are. </para>

                    <para>.- I am glad that the Government propose to accept the suggestion in the second column ; but I trust that, later, this item will be recommitted. A suggestion to that effect has been made by the honorable member for Laanecoorie ; and I hope he will follow that up by a motion, if the Government do not take action. Rather than have a duty of 5 per cent., I should like to see the item absolutely duty free. At present, we find that the engineering industry has been most badly treated. Other industries have had their cup filled every time, but the engineers are asked to be satisfied with a duty of 5 per cent. and free. There has been a combination of the. mining and agricultural votes, whether protectionist or free-trade, to practically free this item. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Flinders and others may look after their own troubles; all I desire to point out is that the most robust industry of engineering is given the least assistance. It is surprising that I, a free-trader, should have to fight for protection for that industry; but I desire to emphasize the cruelty of protectionists, who, while giving every consideration to the textile and other trades, leave the engineering trade with the small duty which I have mentioned. We have heard about geographical protectionists ; but it is a fact that engineering is a specialized industry of New South Wales, and that this request is a blow at that State. </para>

                        <para>- I hear the cheers of the Treasurer ; and the honorable member for Wentworth need not be concerned about my attitude - I can look after myself very well. But the cheers of the Government are of no&#39; avail, unless they follow the cheers up by recommitting this item. Many honorable members have indicated that they would like a duty of 15 per cent., and I suggest that, when the item is recommitted, . the Ministry do not propose 20 per cent., but test the genuineness of those honorable members by proposing a duty of 15 per cent. I would rather have a duty of 15 per cent. than no duty ; but rather than have 5 per cent. I would prefer absolute freedom. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to think that the position is most inequitable. The Holman drill which, I believe, is made in Cornwall, is one of the best here; and if we are to have preference, it should be in favour of the British drill, as against the combination drill to which reference has been made. I urge that the item be made free in the second column, in order that we may more effectually have a reconsideration of the position. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Government will not be led into a trap. They have been asked to recommit the item with a view of getting a good rousing revenue duty attached to it. Let us either have a protective Tariff or nothing. An attempt is being made to get rid of the proposed preference to Great Britain in this instance. I ask the Government to stick to their original proposal in this respect, and not agree to anything in the nature of a recommittal. Members of the Government have told us over and over again that duties of 10 and 15 per cent. are merely high revenue duties, and, as one who believes that the worst kind of Tariff is a revenue Tariff, I shall not support anything of that sort. The Government, having been beaten on a protectionist proposal, should stand by their preference proposal, which amounts to only 5 per cent. I trust that the Senate&#39;s suggestion will be agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- That would mean that another place would have another opportunity of considering the question. If, however, we agree to the word &#34; free,&#34; the item will not go back to the Senate for reconsideration. The effect of striking out the word &#34; free &#34; would be to give the Senate another opportunity of considering the whole position. I noticed very particularly that while the lash was being applied to certain honorable members in the Opposition corner, none seemed to enjoy the spectacle more than the occupants of the front Opposition bench. Not one word of protest - not one sympathetic interjection - came from the direct Opposition. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly; a little delay will give an opportunity for conversion in other quarters. I ask those honorable members who desire to see a protective duty maintained on this item to vote against the proposal of the Government, and to refuse to allow the word &#34; free&#34; to stand. The result will then be that the 15 per cent. duty will operate, and the Senate will have another chance of giving consideration to an industry that deserves better treatment than it has received. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member need not feel apprehensive in the slightest degree. I do not intend to refer to him any further, but have rather risen with the object of making the position plainer. &#34;Let the galled jade wince&#34;; it is not for us to cry out. I wish to draw attention to the point which has been raised by the honorable member. In obedience to your ruling, sir, I do not for a moment intend to say what is likely or not likely to happen in the Senate, but honorable mem-&#39; bers may go to a division under a misapprehension, having heard what the honorable member for Laanecoorie has said, if no reply is made. If I understand the position rightly, whatever we do on this particular matter now before the Committee. - whether we make the item free in the second column, adopting the Senate&#39;s suggestion, or whether we do not - we shall not open the way . for the Senate to make another alteration in the item. Throughout this debate, you, Mr. Chairman, in dealing with a request for several different amendments in one item, have put those requested amendments separately, and I submit that you have been right in doing so. We are entitled to accept, reject, or accept with a modification each of the amendments requested in respect of any one item, and I contend that nothing we may do in respect of the duty now before us will enable the Senate to reopen the question on which a division has just been taken. The honorable member for Laanecoorie seemed to be under the impression - and in the absence of a reply to his speech others may hold the same view - that we may take certain action in respect of the question immediately before us which will have the effect of reopening the matter with which we have just dealt. That would be not only unconstitutional, but entirely repugnant to the course which you, sir, have adopted throughout the consideration of the Senate&#39;s requests. If some honorable members are dissatisfied with the decisive expression of opinion just given, they may ask the Government to&#39; recommit the item. </para>

It is open to the Government to move the recommittal of the request, and the Treasurer has indicated that he intends to do so.

                    <para>- If it fits any honorable member, and is regarded as offensive, I&#39; willingly withdraw it. Having regard to what has taken place, I think that the proper course for me to take is to move that the Senate&#39;s request be agreed to, at all events for the time being. I do not propose to discuss what would be the effect of rejecting the request; but if the matter with which we have just dealt is again to be considered by the Committee, I take it that the proper course to adopt will be to move for the recommittal of the request. The honorable member for Flinders said that the Government had intimated that they intended to move for a recommittal. As a matter of fact I have made no such statement. </para>

                        <para>-I have made no such promise, but the probabilities are that the recommittal will be moved, because I regard the division just taken as one of the most important that we have had on the Tariff, and one the result of, which will be most disastrous. I wish to emphasize the point that I am submitting this motion only because I feel that, judging by the result of the last division, I could not hope at present to secure the rejection of the request. In view of this explanation rip honorable member will be able to say hereafter that in submitting the motion I entered into a compact of any kind. </para>

                    <para>.- I  think the Minister should give some reason why this requested amendment should not be. made. We have dealt in a previous item with the w hole of the rock drills that are used in the mining industry, and if the Minister insists that this requested amendment be not made, the only effect will be to place an impost on machinery required by prospecting parties and persons searching for artesian water, without at the same time rendering assistance to any Australian industry. </para>

It would give to those who are not in favour of an item being free, but who are in favour of a duty lower than that, proposed,, an opportunity of so voting. </para>

                        <para>- I would point out to the honorable member that, under the circumstances, his course would be to move a modification of the motion of the Treasurer. For instance, on the next request, in item 177, the Treasurer may move that it be made or not made, and then it will be competent for the honorable member to move that the request be made&#39; with the modification that the duty be 15 per cent, or 10 per cent. I would then first put tq the vote the lowest duty proposed. </para>

If that be so, I submit, with great respect, that we ought to adopt that procedure now . If the first proposal is not carried, any higher duty, within the range of 25 per cent., should be open to discussion. </para>

When the Treasurer moves that a certain request be accepted or rejected, as the case may be, it is competent for an honorable member to move a modification by way of amendment, imposing a higher or a lesser duty. </para>

                        <para>-  But I point out that the modification is placed in contradistinction to the proposal to make the item free ; and it is that we desire to avoid. We desire to have the item free if possible, but, if we cannot carry that, we ought to be at liberty to propose a modification as near to free as meets our views. As things are now, however, we must either vote to make an item free, or vote to impose the duty in the schedule ; that is, we may vote for a modification, but it will be a modification which prevents our voting to make the item free. </para>

                        <para>- I point out that I am following the course that has been followed all through. It is quite competent for any honorable member to move any duty he thinks proper. In item  177B,  for instance, the Senate requests that the duty of 12&#189; per cent. proposed by the House of Representatives be not imposed, and that the item be made free; and, as soon as the Treasurer moves that that request be accepted or rejected, it will be competent for any honorable member to move, by way of amendment, whatever duty he thinks ought to be inserted. That amendment will be put first, and then, if it be negatived, honorable members will have an opportunity of voting to make the item free. </para>

                        <para>-  We desire the matter put to the vote until the mind of the Committee is ascertained ; and we cannot ascertain the mind of the Committee when a duty of 5 per cent, is placed in contradistinction to making an item free, and we are asked to vote for 5 per cent., while we are in favour of free. The  Chairman  says that we may move that a duty, which stands in the schedule at  25  per cent., be  5  per cent, or  10  per cent, if we like, but that would shut us out from voting- to make the item free. There should- be an opportunity, at some stage or other-, of voting for making the item free, without the alternative of afterwards voting only for the full amount; because such a position is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution. </para>

I was opposed to the item being tree, and not in favour of so high a duty as  25  per cent., being prepared to vote for a duty of  15  per cent. I think that in such a case there should be some opportunity given to honorable members to vote for a&#39; duty between  25  per cent. and free. </para>

                <para>There was a long discussion when the question was before the Committee previously. Information, was given and letters were. produced to show that machines up to  500  horse-power were made here. To make the amendment requested by the Senate would have rather a disastrous effect upon the manufacturers of dynamo electric machines up to that capacity. The reduction appears to be ridiculous. </para>

You, sir, have ruled that we must vote either for &#34; free,&#34; or for the duty as it stands in the schedule, and that there is 110 way of coming in between the two.  I  submit that that is not ascertaining the mind of the Committee. The words in the Constitution are very clear. We can make the amendments requested by the Senate &#34;with, or without modifications.&#34; If the amendment to insert &#34; free &#34; is not adopted, the Committee should be able to get. as near to &#34; free &#34; as possible.

                        <para>-  There must be some way in which honorable members who desire the item to be, say,. 5 or 10 per cent., instead of &#34; free,&#34; can test the feeling of the Committee, The only difficulty is whether it is possible to move to make the duty 5 per cent, after the division is taken upon the Treasurer&#39;s motion.I doubt very much whether the division on the Senate&#39;s amendment itself can be taken before the division on any modification of the Senate&#39;samendment. </para>

                        <para>- I  understand the Chairman&#39;s ruling to be . that if the Committee goes to. a division on the Treasurer&#39;s motion, &#34; that the requested amendment, be not made,&#34; and if that is carried, and the amendment is not made, there is no possibility of moving a modification. I am inclined to agree with that. Apparently, the only way in which a modification can be moved to insert, say; &#34; 5 per cent.,&#34; is as an amendment on the Treasurer&#39;s motion, and such amendment must be put before the motion is put. </para>

                        <para>-  I understand that those who want to carry &#34; free &#34; do not want to embarrass their own action by moving an amendment that the duty be, say, 5 per cent. But that is essentially one of the difficulties; attaching to the position in which we are placed in&#39; dealing with amendments requested by the Senate. The Committee cannot modify a requested amendment after it is wiped out of existence. Under the Constitution we have to deal with the request as it comes to us. As long as that is open, any modification can be moved upon it, but if honorable members, wanting to have the item free, wish to take the division on &#34;free,&#34; before a division is taken on any duty intermediate between &#34;&#39;free&#34; and the existing duty, then of course they take the risk of the requested amendment being rejected and so wiped out. The course which I suggest is one which. commits any member who takes it to the intermediate duty . which he proposes, even though he may desire to have that only as a second string to his bow. </para>

                        <para>-  We wish to avoid that if possible. I should be very sorry, sir, to disagree with your ruling, because as a general rule, your decisions are absolutely reliable. . But we seem to have been following this practice, not merely while you have been in the chair, but from the beginning. I have always doubted its expediency. We ought to follow the analogy of what was done by the Committee&#39; originally when dealing with the Tariff before it went to the Senate. The rule then was to put the lowest duty first. We ought to deal first with the Senate&#39;s request that the item shall be made free, and if that proposition be rejected, to see to what extent we can go on the lines of the request. We are not bound by the ordinary formula in which questions are put from the Chair when we are dealing with matters of substance. I admit that you, sir, have been following the formula which was laid down here at the very beginning of our history, but I doubt whether it is a wise one. </para>

Can we not free ourselves from technicalities by moving that the article be free, and on and after 1st May,  1908,  dutiable at  10  or  5  per cent, as the case may be. </para>

Under the Constitution we have the power to accept wholly or to accept with a modification or to reject a request- of the Senate. Apparently some honorable members desire first to reject the request of the Senate to make this item free, and then to accept the request with a modification, but surely that is not a proper method of transacting our business. </para>

                        <para>-  If the  Chairman  were to accede to the desire of honorable members on the other side it would mean that we should have to take a vote on the question as to whether the item should be made free, and if that proposition were negatived to proceed to modify the request, but that is not within our power. In my opinion once a request is rejected it is disposed of, and the original decision of this Committee stands. There is a. further argument in favour of the attitude adopted- by the  Chairman.  If he were to accede to the desire of those who wish to get an opportunity to vote that the item be made free, and then to vote for an ascending scale of duty, we should be repeating what we have already done. Surely it is not a businesslike proceeding . to have on every item a repetition of the votes, compromises, and sometimes something worse than compromises, which- we had when we were first dealing with the Tariff proposals of the Government. If honorable members on the other side desire to secure a modification of the Senate&#39;s request in this case, the feeling of the Committee must be tested on a substantive motion as against the request itself. &#39; They must hot try first to secure the request and then to get a modification of it. </para>

May I ask, sir, whether you have ruled that the Committee cannot have an opportunity of deciding whether it. will adopt the Senate&#39;s request, and then if it should not, of modifying the difference between the request and the original proposal ? Surely a modification covers a rate between free and 12 J- per cent. ? Would not  6  per cent, be a modification of the Senate&#39;s request that the item should! be made free ? The rejection of the request is one thing; but a modification of it - some figure between free and 12 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> - is another thing. I should like, sir, to get a ruling on that point from the  Speaker  if you have no objection, otherwise I can easily get a ruling on another occasion. </para>

It is competent for any honorable member to move the imposition of any rate provided that it does not exceed the r?.te to which the House has agreed, namely, 12J per cent. If a proposal were submitted that the duty should be fixed at 5 or 10 per cent., that question would be- put first, and ultimately the Committee would deal with the original amendment.  </para>

                        <para>-  When an item was under consideration this afternoon, sir, you took a course which seemed to me to be absolutely free from any objection, and I was hoping that you would take a similar course on this occasion. You will remember that when we were dealing with . the Senate&#39;s request concerning rotary and percussive rock drills a difficulty arose owing to the fact that some honorable members might wish to vote for the suggestion to make the duties 5 per cent, and free instead of 20 and 15 per cent., and if that proposal were not adopted to vote for a modification of the original figures. You put the. question from the! Chair in such a form that honorable members had an opportunity of deciding first whether they would adopt the request, and then, if it were rejected, of deciding whether they would  modify the original proposal, which would be a modification of the Senate&#39;s suggestion. I think that you studied the convenience of the Committee in putting every honorable member in a position first to give a straight vote on the question as to whether the Senate&#39;s suggestion should or should not be adopted, and then, if its . suggestion to reduce the .duty &#39; in the first column from 20 to 5 per cent, were rejected, to move the adoption of a rate between 5 per cent, and 20 per cent. That course gave honorable members a proper opportunity of expressing their minds. You will see, I think, that there are two courses open to us. One is to accept a request in its entirety, and the other is to accept something which is a modification of the request. </para>

                        <para>-  On a former occasion the position was met fairly. Some honorable members wished to vote for the Senate&#39;s request to reduce the duty to 5 per cent. ; others wished to vote for a duty of 15 per cent. ; while others again wished to vote for the original duty of 20 per cent. The Committee was afforded an opportunity first to decide whether it would adopt the request, so that if it were rejected it would  be open to any honorable member to move the adoption of any figure between 5 and 20 as a modification of the request. Those who wish to offer an opinion by their vote on the present request cannot do that if they are, compelled to choose between the request and the modification proposed. It will put them in a wrong position. They cannot express their views at all. </para>

That is precisely what we do not want to do. I submit that the Constitution distinctly provides that we may either accept a request of the Senate or accept it with such modifications as we may deem fit to make. The modifications which the Committee desire to make can be ascertained only after we have disagreed with the request of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to point out a way in which the honorable member for Parramatta can overcome the difficulty which has been created without his being open to any charge of inconsistency. I suggest that he should move the insertion after the word &#34; free &#34; of the following words : &#34; and on and after 1st May, 1908, 1 per cent.&#34; The division upon that proposal would be regarded as a test of whether or not the word &#34;free&#34; should be retained. If the proposal were not carried, it would then be open to any honorable member to move for the imposition of some other duty proportionate to the duty in the first column. </para>

I understand from your ruling, sir, that if the Senate&#39;s suggestion be not accepted by the Committee, honorable members will have no opportunity of moving for a lower rate of duty than that originally agreed to, namely, 20 per cent. I want to refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> the question of whether the Committee should not be afforded such an opportunity. If the Committee does not accept the request of the Senate in its integrity, I think that honorable members should be free to move for its acceptance with a modification, which, in this instance, might be 10 per cent. </para>

                    I have protested. I hope that the  Chairman  will adhere to his decision, even if it be overruled&#39; by the Committee. I trust that he will not permit
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                    to decide this matter when the Committee is capable of deciding it for itself. If outstanding Orders do not give a proper direction in such cases they can be amended. I object to the  Speaker  of the House as the authority who referred the requests of the Senate to this Committee, subordinating the principle underlying the creation of the Committee, by coming here to direct it. The whole practice of the British Parliament depends upon the preservation of the distinction between proceedings in Committee and proceedings in the House, and for
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                    to come here and direct the Committee seems to me to be most improper. The  Speaker  and the  Chairman  must both be supreme in their own jurisdiction. In spite of precedents which have been established, owing to Chairmen being weak enough to give way, I hope that on the present occasion the  Chairman  will adhere to his decision, and see that effect is given to the Standing Orders.

At the same time, the proper course is for us to make our own Committee procedure.

                <para>That is very definite and clear. Passages in other works, to which I have not had time to refer, point out that it would be a bad thing to allow . a contrary practice to grow up, because of the probability of conflict between the opinions of  Chairman  and  Speaker.  Therefore, with all due respect to the right honorable member for East Sydney and the Committee, I must decline to allow my ruling on this or future occasions to go to the  Speaker.  Of course, if a motion dissenting from this ruling is carried, it will establish the precedent to be followed. </para>

                    <para>.- The difficulty that I am in with regard to the proposal .of the honorable member for Coolgardie is not that of the honorable member for Lang. I am not concerned with whether we have to justify ourselves for voting for a duty of 2^ per cent, or not. If we adopt a duty of 2 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent., it will be a formal duty, and we shall be safeguarded. But is the position of the commercial community safeguarded? It would be rather an awkward thing for importing firms, if they had to pay 2J per cent, duty now, and another rate of duty a month hence. They do not know where they are when we are constantly changing the Tariff. What importers fear as much as the duty imposed is constant changes of duty, when they do not know how to arrange their prices. I suggest that the right honorable member for East Sydney should test the opinion of the Committee on his view of the procedure, and then, if he cannot carry his point, let us accept the proposal of the honorable member for Coolgardie as the only way out of the difficulty. </para>

                        <para>-  I submit that if it were declared that the word &#34;free&#34; should stand, it would still be competent for an honor able member to move that on and after a certain date a certain duty should operate. Similarly, if the Committee negatived the word &#34; free,&#34; we should still be able to do something else with the item. </para>

                        <para>-  It occurs to me that there is another way of meeting the difficulty, and one which I think would be in order ; that is, to modify the wording of the question, and take a test vote at this stage as to whether the item should be free or not. I submit that it would be quite in order for me to move the omission  of  the word &#34; not &#34; from the question to be put from the Chair&#39;, in order to tesi the whole question, whilst leaving the rate of duty to be dealt with hereafter&#34;. The question to be put is that the request of the Senate be not made. I desire to move that the word. &#34; not &#34; be omitted from that  question. </para>

                    <para>. - On the merits of this question which have been somewhat overshadowed by the technical discussion which has taken place, I wish to make my position clear. I agree entirely with what the Treasurer has said with regard to the general character of the appliances covered by this paragraph of the item. As I understand it, regulating, starting and controlling apparatus for electrical purposes comprise very simple structural contrivances, such as small levers made of brass, or of blocks for insertion in holes. </para>

                    <para>.- In view of the fact that we have carried a duty of 20 per cent, in respect of dynamo electric machines of 506 horse-power, showing thereby our belief that they can be and are being made in Australia, it is strange that there should be any doubt as to the capacity of our manufacturers to make these small appliances. A duty of 2&#189; per cent, would be merely for revenue and not for protective purposes. If we can make in Australia dynamo electric machines of 500 horse-power, and are prepared to encourage the industry by a duty of 20 per cent., surely we ought to be prepared to support a protectionist duty of 20 for the encouragement of those engaged in the manufacture of minor electrical appliances. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to remind the Minister that the request we are now considering is more directly related to request No. 73, for the inclusion in item 160 of &#34;.High-speed Reciprocating Engines coupled with Generators or Dynamo Electric Machines to be used in mines.&#34; I hope that the Minister is acting in this matter with the advice of the Department; because I do not wish what we have done in connexion with the Senate&#39;s request No. 73 to be interfered with in any way. The steam turbine is a high-pressure engine, and we have agreed to include such machinery in item 160, paragraph  a,  at 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, and free from the United Kingdom. I am unable to say what relation this request has to requests Nos. 90 and 91. </para>

                    <para>On behalf of my company, I herewith enclose notification from Glover and Co. that it is the intention of the Senate to recommend duty of 25 per cent, be placed on gas meters. As the directors of my company feel that the imposition of such a tax is grossly unfair and unjust, and a great handicap in the competition between gas and electricity, in view of the intention to admit electric meters free. I may here state that as far as we are concerned there are no meters of the class we are using, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> cast-iron wet meters, made in the Colonies, and there does not seem any likelihood of their being made here even if a tax were imposed. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is the opinion of people getting their living at the business, and in the circumstances, we should have some explanation from the Minister of the proposed alteration of the duty from 5 per cent,  and free  to 25 and 20 per cent. According lo the information supplied to me, these meters cannot be made in Australia, and in the circumstances, the duties proposed must be regarded as revenue duties. They are otherwise objectionable, because they would apply not only to gas meters but also to  water  meters. The Committee should hesitate before it accepts the proposal made by the Treasurer. At any rate, honorable members on this side ought to insist on some reason for the jump from 5 to 25 per cent. -,  and I am sure my point of view will be supported by others.  </para>

                        <para>- The r.:-  -presentative of the Government in the Senate voted in support of&#39; the arrangement made here, but the request was carried against him by one vote. If the Treasurer looks at the report of the discussion in another place he will find reference made to the arrangement arrived at in the House of Representatives; but I merely allude to this in passing. Electric and gas meters- are each used by large companies, municipalities, and small companies in country districts ; and I contend that the same duty should apply to both classes of meters. If it is urged that gas meters can be made here, while electric meters cannot, I point out that all that is done in the case of gas meters is to assemble the parts- here, and the same could, be done with electric meters: No matter whether there be a duty or not, the fitting of the gas meters will be carried, on in Australia, owing to the extra cost of sending them here in their made-up form. This fitting was carried on in New South Wales under a free-trade . policy, and also under a duty of 12 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent., which applied to both meters and parts, because, as I have said, of the extra cost of carrying the completed meters, and the less risk of injury. In England, where the gas meters are patented and manufactured, the parts are manufactured- in some centre like London, and &#39; are fitted together in  the towns where they are to be used. This is found to be the more economical plan, although the distances are short, because in London there is the elaborate and expensive machinery for making the parts. From the stand-point of equality, I contend that the same duty should apply to both classes of meters. The industry here, so far as it is an industry, has been in existence for years in Victoria and New South Wales; and although, as I remind honorable. members, the parts bear the same duty as the completed meters. This assembling of the . parts is carried on by the Melbourne and other metropolitan gas companies, and by the Australian agents of the manufacturers ; arid it will continue whether or not there be p. duty. A comparatively small number of made-up meters for some of the smaller gas companies are imported ; and they are all of one make. </para>

                        <para>- I&#39; think that information must have been supplied by some firm who desire a higher duty, because I know that the figure quoted is absolutely wrong. To Sydney, for instance, no gas meters are sent made up, and the fitting employs some sixty or seventy men. Why should those who use gas be treated differently from those who use the electric light, seeing that both systems of lighting are carried out by practically the same class of people? </para>

                        <para>- The &#34; 5 per cent, and free &#34; would apply in the&#34; case of gas meters, as it does in the case of electric meters, to both the constructed article and the parts. I think I know where the advocacy of this dutv came from. It is one that would affect Melbourne possibly more than Sydney. I think the movement to secure the duty came from one direction, because a different class of meter is used to a considerable extent in Sydney from that used in Melbourne. The dry meter is mostly used in Melbourne, and the wet meter in Sydney. What suits one manufacturer may not suit another. When there are two illuminants provided by practically the same class of people, in some cases big companies, in some cases small companies, and in some cases municipalities - there is far more gas than electricity provided by municipalities and small companies - there ought to be equal treatment. I am sure the Government do not wish to give preference to one illuminant over another. Electric meters are dutiable at 5 per cent, and free, and gas meters were so when the schedule left this Chamber. Either of them can be put together here if the parts are imported, but no exception has been made in the case of electric meters, and now it is proposed to levy a tax of 25 per cent, as against the one illuminant only. </para>

But whilst he is a free-trader, I am a protectionist, and I am influenced by the fact that these articles can be manufactured here to a much greater extent than they are at present, while the Brassworkers&#39; Association assure me that if gas meters continue to be manufactured here the brasswork connected with them can also be made here. Consequently, even the importation of the parts will be done away with. The outside portions of the meters&#34; are made in Melbourne to a great extent. The machinery for cutting them is not as intricate as that used here for cutting and making tins. One company in Melbourne employs fifty-seven hands, and two other firms employ ten and five hands respectively in making gas meters. In New South Wales one firm employ seventy hands in making them. </para>

                        <para>- Although we cannot number those engaged in the industry by thousands, even the honorable member will admit that a fair number of men are employed. The increased duty should be agreed to, seeing that the question of the raising of the price hardly comes into consideration, and that the continuance of the work here will give rise to other employment in the manufacture of parts that are not made here now. The mechanism of meters is precisely the same as that of penny-in-the-slot machines and other devices that are now imported. Those could all be made here, so that the industry is capable of very wide expansion. The industry of meter making in Australia has been growing, but, . in common with other  industries, it has to meet competition which may be regarded from a commercial standpoint as fair, but which is nevertheless most injurious. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to see electric meters&#39; manufactured here also, but unfortunately we have lost the opportunity to deal with that question. At this stage we . can introduce no new item, but can only deal &#39; with the Senate&#39;s requests. I hope that the honorable member for Dalley will put up his umbrella on behalf of this&#39; particular request. I believe it is in his electorate that gas meters are made for New South Wales. This is an industry which could be extended in many directions. Besides the companies I have named there are many other companies which are making gas meters, either wholly or partially- I recognise that the gas companies in small provincial towns may be opposed to this request, but I believe that in time they will see their way to put together gas meters instead of importing them. In view of the possibility that this industry may grow in many directions, I trust that the Treasurer will adhere to his determination to accede to the request. </para>

                        <para>- They can be made in Dalley, because it has very competent artisans. The honorable member for North Sydney has made it very clear that the parts of these meters are assembled in Australia. If this request be acceded to the Committee will impose a tax upon the users of gas meters. It should be remembered that while the electric light supplying companies charge for the use of their meters, the gas-lighting companies supply free meters to their consumers, though, of course, they may make a bit afterwards by means of a big racing machine. 1 believe that I have a big racing machine in my establishment. As a matter of. justice and equity we ought not to impose a serious tax upon the makers of gas, whether they be large companies or small companies. Why should we put the makers of electric lighten a better position than the makers of gas? </para>

No doubt if we imposed a very high duty they would pass it on to the consumer, or charge rent for the use of their meters. Originally the Treasurer proposed to admit gas meters at 5 per cent. . from foreign countries and free when imported from the United Kingdom. His own protectionist inclination did not lead him to go farther than that. I think that he, as a protectionist, must see that the claim made by the honorable member for North Sydney is irresistible. I ask him not to be a glutton in the case of this item, as he has been in the case of other items. He should accord equal  treatment to the importers of both kinds of meters. I shall vote against the Senate&#39;s request. </para>

                    <para>.- On behalf of the residents of country towns, I appeal to the Treasurer not to press his motion. He knows that in his electorate there are many country towns which would benefit from the establishment of gas companies. A high duty on gas meters would press most heavily, not on the wealthy gas companies in the cities, but on the small gas companies in country towns, and indirectly upon the consumers. . Whatever contributes to the happiness of the people of a town should be encouraged. If anything improves the appearance of a town and promotes the comfort of its inhabitants, it is the establishment of gas works and gas lighting. I also appeal to the Treasurer on behalf of the coal miners. He will realize that the more gas companies are established the more work will be given to coal miners. I also appeal to the honorable gentleman on behalf of the carters, the ironworkers, and the clerks. Seeing that originally he agreed that the duties on gas meters should be5 per cent, and free, I see no reason why we should accede to the Senate&#39;s request, and thereby impose an unnecessary hardship upon the people. Let us endeavour as far as possible to encourage a system of thrift, and no one can deny that a penny-in-the-slot gas meter is a savings bank on a small scale. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot support the Senate&#39;s request. This item deals with electrical and  gas appliances, particularly with gas meters. Whilst it affects the large companies in the cities very closely, still it is the small country towns which will be affected very seriously if we agree to duties of 25 and 20 per cent, on gas meters. When this item was first proposed by the Treasurer, I received from the municipal council of Molong a communication, upon which I regret I cannot lay my hand at the present moment. They pointed out to me how adversely it would affect their interests and limit the consumption of their gas. They claimed that it would not only limit the consumption, as it would prevent a number of persons from using gas as they are now doing, but also increase the cost of the article to the consumers. The communication pointed out how the council would be very seriously affected by the duty inasmuch as the gas works carried a very heavy debt. I do not remember how the loan for their construction was raised, but the council is responsible for its repayment, and is paying interest out of a particular fund. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with my honorable friend that pretty well every country town which supplies gas to its citizens would be affected by the high duties requested by the Senate. 1 remind honorable members that not only Molong, but many other country towns are already heavily handicapped; inasmuch as their coal has to be carried for a considerable distance by railway. The nearest point from which the Molong council can procure its coal is Lithgow. To towns such as Forbes, which also has a municipal gasworks, the coal has to be carried for &#38; very much greater distance. All this adds to the cost to the consumer, and yet we are now asked in the interests of a prospective industry which can attain only very small dimensions to place duties of 20 and 25 per cent, upon gas meters. I trust that the Committee will see the wisdom of disagreeing with the request of the Senate in this connexion. </para>

I had intended to submit a motion under which gas meters imported in parts would have been made dutiable at 5 per cent., and the completed meters at the higher rate. I find, however, that I should not be in order in- adopting that course, because the wording of the paragraph has not been altered by the Senate.

I cannot do that, however, because the wording of the paragraph has not been amended. My hands are therefore tied. If, however, I did not move to disagree with the request of the Senate, the same duty would continue to be levied upon the meter parts that is charged upon the completed meters. That would be a disadvantage, because it would prevent the assembling of the parts from being undertaken locally. </para>

The Senate has requested a duty of 25 per cent, upon gas meters under (he general Tariff and of 20 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. I think that we might modify that request by admitting gas meter parts at 5 per cent, under the general Tariff and by making them free under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly no member of the Committee can interpret the Senate&#39;s action. I ask the honorable member for Darwin, who, as a representative of a constituency named after the author of the <inline font-style="italic">Origin of Species,</inline> may know what is in the Minister&#39;s mind, why the requested amendment is to be made. - I am drawing attention to this matter, not because the request is in itself of any moment, but to show how ridiculously the Committee is., behaving. Anything that the Senate chooses to ask for is granted with or without reaspn. No reason is given in this case by the Minister, simply because he knows that honorable members wish to get into recess and get away from their work, and that they are willing to knuckle down to the Senate every day in the week. I do not blame the Minister very much for not giving reasons in this instance, because no explanation can be given. Very often he is unable to give explanations with regard to these matters. I say so advisedly. </para>

I do not think that the Committee is aware of what they are.

                    <para>.- remind the Committee that in the northern part of Australia it is impossible to build railways without steel sleepers. We have no hope of opening up that part of the country without them. The Pine Creek Railway is made with steel sleepers. Many honorable members who have been in the Northern Territory know how bad the white ants are there. Steel sleepers must be used, because white ants eat the wooden ones. The duty covering steel rails is quite high enough for steel sleepers also. It is only reasonable that the sleepers should be included in this item at a lower rate of duty. I shall vote against the Minister&#39;s motion. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the proposal of the Treasurer is an inconsistent one. Why should steel sleepers be at a different rate of duty from steel rails? If steel sleepers are to be at 30 per cent., steel rails ought to be at the same rate. I think that the amendment requested by the Senate is a proper one, because rails and sleepers are both goods of the same description. To draw a line between rails and sleepers seems to me to be ridiculous, and to make a difference of 100 per cent, between the duties on them is no- justifiable. </para>
