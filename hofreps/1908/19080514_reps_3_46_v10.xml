                        <para>- When this request was last under consideration I moved a modification providing that kerosene and other refined petroleum oils n.e.i. having  a flash point of not less than 102 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the Abel-Pensky close test - instead of 97 degrees Fahrenheit, as requested by the Senate - should be free. I then stated that I proposed that modification at the suggestion of an honorable member of the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>- I quoted the whole list. The Senate has requested that the flash point should be fixed at 97 degrees Fahrenheit, and I should not have proposed to make it 102 degrees if at the time I had been possessed of information as to what would be the effect of that alteration. I think that a flash point of 97 degrees will accomplish all that is required. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson</inline> says that if kerosene possessing a lower flash point than 97 degrees Fahrenheit were denaturated it would not be used for lighting purposes. </para>

                        <para>- No, they were still imported. I now propose to substitute a flash point of  97  degrees for  102  degrees, and to insert in this item a provision requiring that oils possessing a lower flash point shall be denaturated in such a way as to afford the public adequate protection. I wish to make that statement at once, so that no debate may take place upon the proposal to fix the flash point at  102  degrees, as I find that that is not the best close test that we can provide. </para>

                    <para>.- Bv way of personal explanation, I should like to make a statement in connexion with the re marks of the Treasurer. I did suggest to him the desirability of increasing the flash point of these oils to  102  degrees Fahrenheit, which would be equal to a fire test of  1.50  degrees Fahrenheit. But upon making an investigation on the following day, I found that that would be an unjustly high test to fix, and I, therefore, suggested that the Treasurer should alter the flash point to  97  degrees. I understood from the remarks made by honorable members, when this item was previously under consideration, that the proposal of the Treasurer had been made with a view to assisting the Commonwealth Oil Corporation - which, I believe, will ultimately be very successful - without unduly penalizing the consumers. </para>

                        <para>- That will have to be dealt with separately, and I am opposed to it. I thought it necessary to make this explanation, because the Minister is quite accurate in saying that I supplied him with information which at the time I believed to be correct, but which, on closer examination, I found likely to lead to injustice to some importers. </para>

                    <para>. - I raised no objection .to the amendment of the motion, because to have done so would not have attained the end. I have in view. I must say, however, that I am staggered that the Prime Minister should have proposed -to deal with this item to.-day, and still more astonished that the Committee should have permitted him to do so. It was only on Friday morning last, after, on the previous day, the item had been postponed on the motion of a private member, that the ' Treasurer, in answer, to the leader of the Opposition, said that the Prime Minister would make- a statement on the matter this week. That statement has not yet been made, and we are now told, in a childish way, that it will be made to-morrow after we have voted on the item. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the desire of honorable members is to have this item dealt with, and I gather that they are pretty well satisfied with' the suggested modification as originally presented. A week to-day, the Committee deemed the position serious enough to justify a postponement of the item, not only because of what the Treasurer had said by way of interjection, but because of the fact that a charge has been lying against honorable members, and has not yet been investigated, since the Tariff was originally placed before us. It is all very well for the Treasurer to shake his head ; but there is more in this than the mere passing of an item. No doubt it is desirable to dispose of the Tariff, but we have more to do, namely, clear ourselves of a slur in the public eye. Two or three months ago, a charge was made against honorable members by an important newspaper, the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin;</inline> and, to put myself in order in discussing that matter, I feel compelled to move - </para>

                        <para>- In consequence of some statements made in connexion with this and another item, a Select Committee,' called the Parliamentary Privileges Committee, was appointed ; and at the time I suggested that the Prime Minister himself ought to suggest the proper course of procedure, seeing that he would have to introduce the necessary legislation to bring about investigation. It may be said that the Committee have not yet been able to meet on account of the adjournment of the Senate; but that is. the very weakness in the procedure I pointed out when I opposed the appointment of the Committee. I may say that I do not believe there is one tittle of evidence in support of either what the. Treasurer said, or what the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bui-, letin</inline> said. </para>

                        <para>- However, I ask which is the better course - to make speed with the Tariff, and leave this slur on Parliament, or have a statement from the Prime Minister and a proper investigation ?! suppose that the Prime Minister has been busy during the last few days, or the matter  has escaped his attention ; but, at any rate, he ought t'o make some statement to the 'Committee. Reflections have been cast upon us in connexion with both the kerosene and the piano items. In regard to the latter, a. constituent of my own was charged ; but if he be guilty, he ought to be dealt with in the same manner as we should deal with the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin.</inline> A Select Committee has been appointed, but, as I say, there is as yet no report ; and, therefore, I urge that there ought to be a postponement. Was the Treasurer acting only in sport last Thursday, when he supported my proposal for a postponement, or with the intention of having further inquiry, according to the statement he made on the following morning? I regret very much having to use the machinery of Parliament in this way in order to attain the object I have in view ; but there is no doubt that  the matter ought to be threshed out ; and I ask the Prime Minister to, as early as possible, state his intentions to honorable members. </para>

It appeared, however, to convey a serious imputation to some of them; and as soon as that fact was brought clearly home to the Treasurer, he absolutely withdrew it ; that is to say, he pointed out that he had no such intention as was ascribed to him. The honorable gentleman was speaking of the pairs and the prospect of the vote. </para>

If no one appears to prefer the supposed charge immediately before us and no one supports it - there appears not to have been any intentional charge - and the supposed charge is abandoned by those who were believed to have made it, what is there to inquire into ? </para>

                        <para>- It appears to be perilous to rely upon information! in this matter ; but I have been informed that the statements in question were referred to the Select Committee on Privilege. I believe that we carried a resolution to that effect in this House, and, indeed, that it was done on my motion. The only thing that I am doubtful about is whether the same proposal was carried in another place ; but in this House we certainly did refer the statements to which allusion has been made to the Select Committee. </para>

                        <para>- The resolution refers to " recent allegations." The allegations now referred to were quoted in speeches made upon this subject in this House. Attention was specially directed to them. Therefore they were referred to the Com-   mittee, for inquiry., as recent allegations. No limitation was placed upon the Committee, because, as I have said, it was inferred during the debate that some other newspapers had published statements which might also be worthy of being inquired into. </para>

                        <para>- Another point is that an endeavour was made by this House, when it appointed this special Committee, to arrive at a means by which, in future, we should be able to deal promptly with this class of attack, so that in future cases of the kind the immediate action to which the right honorable member for Swan refers could be taken. These very charges were brought up, and were referred to the Committee, for it to take such steps as were necessary. Now we have had what appeared at first to be another charge, but which now appears not to have been a charge at all. After running through the debate, all that suggests itself as practical in the present instance is, to invite the same Committee to take into consideration what has been termed by some canvassing, and by others lobbying, which occurs in relation to certain proceedings in this House. I must say, however, that the more one considers those practices, the more difficult it is found to draw a line - or will be found to draw a line - between legitimate means of making information available for members of Parliament, and the illegitimate pressure sought to be brought to bear upon them by paid agents, who have a direct interest in that kind of work. I was not prepared, within the leisure at my command, to endeavour to draw that line of demarcation. But </para>

                <para class="block">I think that after the Select Committee have dealt with the . matters which they, have in hand, it would be well if they would also take into consideration - particularly in connexion with Tariffs, when we have opposing parties making representations to members of Parliament which will sooner or later come before the House -whether information of that kind should not be conveyed to us in some more formal fashion, and whether individual members should not be protected against the intervention of persons who may have an interest in making those representations other than the interests of the persons whose business would be affected by the particular proposals under consideration. It would be very hard indeed to close the doors of Parliament against those who are to be affected, either as importers or manufacturers, by any particular measure before the House. What the House wants, as a House is knowledge: We have spent a large sum of money, and some of the members of this House have given months and years of their time, to the acquiring of knowledge with regard to certain items dealt with in the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- I have not said so. I previously pointed out that at present the' only weapon within our power is that of summoning these people to the Bar of the House. But we all know from our experience in the States Parliaments, that by that means, nothing results except advertisement to the offenders. It was because we recognised our present helplessness, while Parliament, as a body, though possessed of the highest authority, being without the necessary mechanism or the necessary means of dealing with such questions,! is unable to take effective action, that, to cure that helplessness, we appointed a Select Committee to take the subject into consideration as a whole. That Committee has met, and has been proceeding with its work. It will recommend the wisest course to be adopted to enable direct action to be taken to prevent slanderous statements. Beyond that, it appears to me, we cannot go at present. I saw nothing in the debate to which reference has been made, to encourage me to propose any addition to the tasks intrusted to the Select Committee. But that is a matter for the House. If the House, or if the Committee itself, desire that any other matters shall be referred specifically to the Committee, it is within its competence to sav so. </para>

                        <para>- And it is for such innuendoes that the Committee will recommmend a remedy of a simple, effective, and expeditious character. The procedure must allow of our acting in such a way as will make the offender remember it. The present system leaves an offender in the possession, of a certain amount of notoriety, but with no punishment commensurate to the injury he may have done to the House or to individual members. I shall be gratified at any time to accept and further any proposal for the more effective suppression of those campaigns of slander to which Parliament is occasionally subjected, by putting a proper responsibility upon the proper shoulders, and teaching those concerned to use the English language with due caution when referring to public affairs, as the law obliges, them to do when referring to private affairs. There must be a wider range allowed, of course, in connexion with public affairs, but even that has its limits. </para>

                        <para>- I was replying to interjections, which were, perhaps, a little wide. My consideration of the debate the other evening shows, of course, the necessity for guarding our own language more carefully and avoiding any reflection, even by implication, upon any persons whose interests we happen to be considering. But until there is a direct charge made, and supported by somebody, I fail to see any steps the House can take at this moment, or, indeed, until the Committee shall have advised us. Then we must take action upon its report, so as to protect ourselves against unwarranted slanders - I cannot say from within, but certainly from without - though I hope we shall add some restraints upon slanders from within. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member did not, and this has taken me by surprise; but since the item has come on, I quite admit that the stage which the Tariff has reached makes it impossible to hang it up until this matter of slanderous ' statements is investigated. I do not for " a moment depart from the original position that I took up, that we have got beyond" criticisms in connexion with the honour of Parliament of which no notice can be taken. We should be very slow to take notice of any "criticisms affecting Parliament in any shape or form, unless they reach the point of definite imputations of actual bribery and corruption. When that point is reached, however, it is not a question of whether this or that member is pointed af. It is a question of the honour of the whole House. Surely when a direct statement is made that two or three honorable members of one of these Houses have received a sum of £2,000 or .£3,000 from a notorious Trust which is interested in some item in the Tariff, a point is reached at which Parliament cannot keep silent? If the two or three particular men hinted at were indicated, that would be, perhaps, a less grave imputation than a general charge which may be fixed by people outside upon any or every member of the. House. Let the press be as free as air in its criticisms of us individually or collectively, but the moment it publishes a direct imputation of the offence of bribery and corruption in the exercise of our distinct duties in connexion with a matter of public business, that becomes a question that affects the honour of the House. </para>

                        <para>- Just so, but still there are  some charges which, although vague as to the individual, are so definite in other respects that they do amount to a reflection upon the honour of Parliament. I have thought over the question of keeping this item open, but I feel that it is impossible to do so, and that the Tariff must go on. Personally, I do not believe there is a scintilla of truth in these imputations against any -member of this or the other House. </para>

                        <para>- But, as this matter was really referred- to the Select Committee on Privilege by the House itself, the person who publishes any charge of that sort ought to be brought up before some such authority, not so much for the purpose of punishing the individual - that is a very secondary and insignificant part of it - but to afford him an opportunity to repeat or withdraw those statements before the Committee. It might be an equally honorable course for the persons who made the charge to say, " We very much regret that we were led into making those statements. We believed them at the time we made them, relying upon authority which we believed to be true, but we find that our authority is unreliable." Who wants to punish a man of that sort who has been misled ?  His  error then becomes an error of judgment, in relying too much upon information received. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but the dominant idea in our minds is, I am sure, not one of revenge" or punishment, but one of preventing a style of journalism which will make of public life anything but a pleasant arena in which men can 'endeavour to discharge their duties to the public. We must try to put down any imputations of that sort. If there is any truth in this particular charge, it is time that we knew it. It is time that any person who accepted a bribe was banished from this House for ever. It appears that the Committee upon Privilege has had this matter referred to it, because I know that we do not stand on punctilio in matters of this sort, and the resolution read out by the Prime Minister seems to point sufficiently to the charges that I have in my mind. When the Treasurer made his unfortunate remark, the recollection of previous imputations spread like wild-fire. The Minister now says that he had no idea of making any charge of that sort. </para>

                        <para>- Whether that was' so or *not, here was a sinister remark made by a Minister in charge of the Tariff, that seemed  to support and, in effect, repeat the slanders to which public attention had been drawn. A more lamentable mistake was never made by any Minister in any Parliament in the world. But I do not want to dwell on that. It is over. In view of the reference that has been made to the Committee, the Committee ought immediately to take some steps to ask the editor and publisher of the newspaper in question . to appear before it and give the information upon which they made the charge, or some explanation of how the charge came to be made, and the grounds .upon which it was made. </para>

The .Committee might well, on the reference made to it, take immediate steps to bring the persons concerned before it, not with a view to punishment, but to ask those who make these infamous statements, affecting the honour of the House, for their authority. Other proceeding might, of course, follow. </para>

                        <para>- Might I suggest that if the members of the Committee invited the attention of the editor of the newspaper mentioned to the definite charges referred to, and invited him to come before them to give some information about these charges, and he failed to do so, that would be to a certain extent significant. I admit that it would then be necessary for the Committee to consider what powers they had to bring him before them. But if .he will come voluntarily, the Committee need not be concerned about its powers to force him to come. If he is not ready voluntarily to come before the Committee, it will then be time to consider what powers should be conferred upon the Committee to enable it to bring him before it. If the editor of this newspaper will come before the Committee without the exercise of any sucn powers, why not let him do so? </para>

                        <para>- I know nothing about the other statements which are referred to. I speak only of that about which I do know, and the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> paragraph is the most distinct charge of the kind that has come under my notice. Surely the members of the ' Committee could put that paragraph into the hands of the editor of that newspaper and ask him for some information on the subject? Let them, go on considering what powers should be given them, and, if he refuses to give the information for which he is asked, the necessity for giving the Committee ample powers to deal with such matters will be made the more apparent. But do not let us stand on etiquette as to the way in- which a man shall be brought before the Committee. If he is willing to come at once before the Committee, let him do so. To drag this affair on from month to month will not add to the dignity of Parliament at all. Proper means of procedure should no doubt be considered, but the matter before us should be dealt with promptly. To my mind, it would be worse than useless to have the members of the Committee sitting for months to decide the procedure to be adopted in bringing a man before them in order that ha might be asked questions. I suggest, with great deference, that too much time should not be devoted to the question of procedure, but that some early step should be taken with a view to asking the particular authorities to whom I have referred to appear before the Committee in reference to these statements. </para>

But it will be recognised that both statements went far beyond the item before the Committee. </para>

I point out that even if the debate should continue on the lines so far adopted, the Committee can do nothing in the matter, which is purely one for the House to deal with. The debate is drifting into a discussion, not of the duties to be imposed on kerosene cil, but of the procedure to be adopted by a Committee appointed to inquire into certain charges. </para>

But to permit a discussion of the details of the procedure of the Committee, the way in which it should conduct its business, and the powers with which it should be intrusted, would be to open up a debate which might occupy the whole day, which would be entirely out of order, and which could have no practical result. In the circumstances, I ask honorable members to confine their remarks to the motion of the honor-able member for Dalley that the item be postponed. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is entirely foreign to the particular and definite subject with which the Committee referred to have been asked to deal. The Committee have been asked simply to suggest to the House what steps, in their opinion, ought to be taken to protect the honour of the House against charges made against it. It would probably hamper and delay the Committee very much in the performance of that simple and definite task if, as the Prime Minister has suggested, they were to attempt to deal with a matter which would probably require very much more lengthy consideration. We are not placing ourselves or our parliamentary methods on trial ; but are endeavouring to discover some simple way by which we may protect ourselves and our independent action from such assaults as have recently been made. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the honorable member for Dalley will not persist with his motion. I cannot see that to do so would serve any good purpose. We have threshed out this matter, and to continue to deal with it is like flogging a dead horse. I feel with the honorable member that something should be done to protect the honour of members of  this House. I regard any reflection made upon the honour of a member of Parliament as a reflection upon the Parliament to which he belongs. If at any time I heard a member of this Parliament accused of bribery and corruption, I should deem it my duty, when the House next met, to publicly state that I had heard such charges levied against a certain member, in order that they should be either sheeted home or refuted. The Treasurer has made every amend for his stupid remark, and I do not think that anything can be gained by deferring the consideration of the item before the Committee. In connexion with other honorable members, I desire that we should get rid of the Tariff. I have had quite enough of it. I am sure that if we heard that it would be possible to close up our proceedings to-morrow, every member of the Committee would be pleased. 1 again ask the honorable member for Dalley, in view of the remarks made by the Prime Minister, and in view of the way in which the Treasurer has humbled himself, to withdraw his motion, and let us get on with the business of the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- I am. aware of that, and I am careful not to transgress the ruling of the  Chairman.  This Parliament is still in its infancy, and I know that many honorable men in the United States went to their graves stigmatized as scoundrels who had sold themselves to boodliers, because when such charges were levied against them they passed on, not dreaming that the charges would affect them later. If the evil resulting from the slanders of the men who make these charges died with them, we could at least extend to them the grace of forgetting them: But the evil does not die with them. </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend to do so, sir. How is this thing done? Certain men come here to lobby in just the same way as men used to go to the Capitol in the United States. Honorable members find that their principles are in harmony with the ideas of the lobbyists, and vote in that way. Those persons then go back to their principals, and, in order to get a certain amount of money, they say, " It cost me a lot," and by implication honorable members are charged with bribery. </para>

                        <para>- I have listened to honorable members opposite for days, without saying a word, and although they hold great social positions they will not make me sit down. I have risen to have my say on this question, and I intend to carry out my intention. No amount of talking will make any difference to me. This Parliament is in its infancy, and it is time that honorable members understood that the strength of a chain is only the strength of its weakest, link, and that if this Parliament is charged with  an offence every one of its111 members is deemed to be guilty. Let it not be thought that one member can escape from the accusation simply because he exalts himself, and thinks that he holds a position too high to be assailed. He simply goes with the crowd. He is one of the people while he is here, and he is no more than the smallest or humblest man in the Chamber. </para>

                    <para>- I should have preferred to approach this matter with a little preparation rather than to speak, as it were, on the spur of the moment. It is a matter in which I have taken up a certain position, and on which I feel very strongly. I might remind you, sir, that it was I who first brought before the House the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> paragraph out of which this question has arisen to-day. And in regard to that paragraph, I notice that the shaft was not shot until the House had adjourned for the Christmas holidays, and we had not an opportunity of taking immediate action. Had we been able to do so, I believe that the result would have been more pregnant with good than it has been. The Prime Minister has very justly said that we are the custodians of our honour. Before I entered the House I endeavoured to build up for myself a reputation, and I mean to try to retain it. </para>

                        <para>- And what is more, I encourage criticism if it is fair. But I object to these slanderous statements, which at present we have no method of answering. The only method by which we can answer such statements is by drawing attention to them in the Chamber, and doing what we can to refute them. In this particular instance the slander which has been uttered applies to every one of us. What are we doing to prevent the circulation of such slanders? I believe that there is a tendency to encourage them. I have been frequently told that certain members ot the House to which I belong are open to bribery. </para>

                        <para>- No, I will not, sir. The reply I make is, " If you will bring a specific charge and proof of it I will dc my best to have it investigated, but failing that, I listen to no slanders of that description." I consider that the Treasurer was most unwise in the remark' which he made. I think that his altitude - if the information I have received is correct - is not right. He seems to encourage information from those who think as he does, "and is inclined to refuse to listen t'o those whose opinions differ from his. </para>

I am not satisfied with his action so far. I think that a man of his character could have taken very much stronger action than he did, and I sincerely trust that he will now do his best to so arrange matters that if such slanderous statements are repeated their authors shall not be encouraged, but shall be brought to book. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that it is necessary to speak, simply because I intend to vote against the oil duties. Seeing that I have pretty consistently supported the Government proposals and was returned to the House as a strong protectionist, the statements which  were made by the Treasurer, and, unfortunately, by some of the newspapers, could, if any one liked to apply them, easily be applied to me of all people. The Opposition vote, as a matter of course, against all duties, but I vote, from conviction, against these particular items. I . believe that every honorable member is so conscious of his own integrity that he does not take the slightest notice of slanderous assertions. I promised my constituents that I would rake every opportunity to get them the cheapest and best oil. On every occasion when an oil dutv has been' submitted I have voted with the Opposition, and shall continue to do so. </para>

My object is to get the best and cheapest oil for (he consumer. It was most improper for one of the great Melbourne newspapers to state that protectionists not voting with the Government in this matter have clearly been wrongly influenced. I believe that that statement has been made to " rope in " protectionists, so that they will vote with the Government; but I shall not vote against my convections or my promises to my constituents.

                        <para>- I know it; but that need not be ; it is the fault of Parliament when such a thing occurs. There has not been a series of direct charges, and, as the honorable member for West Sydney has pointed out, direct charges are not made in these cases; but there have been innuendoes and what are referred to bv the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> as " disquieting rumours," which do much to kill the reputation of Parliament. When a number of such innuendoes are published, amounting in the aggregate to what is practically a direct charge, Parliament should take steps to clear itself of the imputations on its honour. What are the facts ? In the first instance, the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> published the allegation that£2,000 had been spent to bribe members, and next day the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> declared that the reference was to the Freetrade Opposition. Following that brutal twist, came, other innuendoes from this newspaper, which supports the Prime Minister so cordially. Parliament should be protected from such, statements. If other newspapers have erred, let them be brought to book, too. There has been a series of implied charges, culminating in the foolish statement made by the Treasurer the other night. As the Prime Minister has, to use a vulgarism, practically thrown up the sponge, at least, the Joint Committee should investigate the charges, and report to Parliament concerning them. The Committee's powers may be limited, but it can ask those who have slandered us to come before it, and, if they do not do so, the public will draw its own inferences. The helpless attitude  of the Prime Minister amounts to an invitation to newspaper proprietors to continue their slanders, and I object to that. The sooner these statements are sifted, the better it will be for the honour and dignity of Parliament. Almost every <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> leader dealing with the Standard Oil Trust contains some insinuation, and the public will not be long in coming to the conclusion that the practices of the Trust in regard to this Parliament have been similar to those alleged in connexion with other Parliaments. We should nip this slander in the bud, acting, not hysterically, but sanely, wisely, and firmly, so that our traducers will see that we are not to be treated in this way. </para>

                        <para>- That would enable the Committee to do its work more speedily. It is necessary that Parliament should be cleared at the earliest moment of the imputations against it; but the first thing to be done is to draw up a system of procedure. The appointment of the Committee is a recognition by Parliament that the existing procedure has had farcical results. Speaking for myself only, I think that one meeting of the Committee, after we have settled our position, should be sufficient for the devising of effective procedure. </para>

                        <para>- No. To my mind it would be absurd to bring before the Committee the proprietor of every newspaper in which charges have appeared, requiring him to prove their correctness, because there are journalists in Australia who would be ready to print slanderous statements every week, if the only penalty were the coming before a Committee to withdraw them. We all recognise the need for more effective procedure, and I am not disposed to make the Committee the laughing-stock of Australia by allowing it to act before such procedure has been devised. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt, but that is a matter which each honorable member must consider for himself. I give the remark no 'personal application. I agree with the leader of the Opposition that we must not be too squeamish in the matter of criticism. Hostile criticism certainly tends to strengthen the average public man. My complaint, however, relates, not to hostile criticism, but to a definite charge of corruption associated with the name of a company which in the United States of America has the reputation of resorting to corrupt practices. The reputation of the company causes the public to attach some importance . to such a charge. I am an  observant man, having acquaintances in all walks of life, and I have no hesitation in saying that the average man attaches great weight to any statement appearing in the </para>

                <para class="block">Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> or any newspaper of like importance. When mud is thrown, some of if always sticks. As to the honour of this Parliament, without desiring to be patronising, I say unhesitatingly that if I were to retire from political life to-morrow, one of the happiest memories that I should carry with me would be the recollection that the Commonwealth Parliament' had ' passed unsullied through two Tariff struggles. I have no reason to believe that either in connexion with the first Federal Tariff or that now under consideration, there has been any element of corruption associated with this Parliament. But, knowing as I do that the public are disposed to attach much importance to such a charge as that made by the Treasurer, I think that the Prime Minister would' have done well had he invited the Committee to agree to the postponement of this request until the remaining requests had been dealt with, so that an investigation might be made by the Privilege Procedure Committee. Either too little or too much has been said in connexion with this matter. Had the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> definitely stated to whom a certain sum of money had been paid, as alleged by it, to secure a certain vote, we should have been able to take action. On the other hand, if it has published too much, relying merely upon rumour, the sooner it withdraws its statement the better. Public men show their courage by withdrawing statements which they have ascertained to be incorrect, and leading newspapers should be prepared to withdraw a statement as soon as they find that it was ill-advised. I am satisfied that neither the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> nor the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> would publish mere rumours. A keen-witted man like the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> would not publish such a statement as that of which complaint is made, unless he believed that he had something behind him to support' it. And so with the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> It is because I hold that view that I think that this charge should be investigated. </para>

                    <para>.- There has been a good deal of misunderstanding in regard to this proposal. I appeal to the Committee, as a protectionist body, to agree to the request made by another place, and to reject the modification' proposed by the Treasurer, although I may say that if we cannot secure the protection advocated by the Senate we shall regard as preferable to no protection at all the provision that oils of a lower flash point than 97 degrees Fahrenheit close test must be denaturated to secure free admission. </para>

                        <para>- From a commercial point of view it is absolutely one of protection ; but from a humanitarian stand-point it is very necessary that oils below a safe flash point test shall be denaturated, so that they may not with risk to human life be put to a use for which they are not intended. If the shale deposits of New South Wales are to be successfully mined, we must take care that the industry is protected so far as it is capable of supplying the demand for oils for motive-pov/er purposes. It is laid down that oils of a flash point test of 97 degrees Fah. and less are useful for motive-power purposes, and, as a matter of fact, they are in general use. Such oils are produced in New South Wales, and oils of a flash point test of more than 97 degrees are also imported and used for oil engines. That being so, in urging that the Senate's request should be agreed to, we are not even seeking fora monopoly for the local industry in respect of these oils. </para>

                        <para>-  Oils of a considerably lower flash point test are so used. There is a difference of opinion, even amongst vendors of oils, as to what is the necessary test for an effective engine oil. Many experts, however, declare that the higher the test the more economical is the oil for engine use, the explosive force being correspondingly greater. </para>

                        <para>- The point is that oil of the higher tests cannot be sold at the price at which the lower-class oils are vended. That being so, the Standard Oil Company is not likely to supply its high-test oil for engine purposes. The British Imperial Oil Company, in addition to the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, is already supplying oil of 100 degrees Fah. close test for engine purposes. Messrs. Alexander Cowan and Sons,  agents for the Otto and Crossley engines, which are known all over Australia - and which I have repeatedly used - unhesitatingly recommend the oil supplied by the British Imperial Oil Company for use in those engines. The flash point of that oil is over 97 degrees, so that we are not asking for an exclusive market for the Commonwealth Oil Corporation. Messrs. Alexander Cowan and Sons write - </para>

                        <para>- I merely wish to exclude oil that is now being dumped here. By raising the standard we shall secure to the local industry a measure of protection which all protectionists should be prepared to give. I am pointing out, for the information of free-traders, who, on principle, are opposed to protection, that the test proposed by the Senate will not prohibit the importation of all oils. If it be agreed to, there will still be 2 market in Australia' for the British Imperial Company's oil over the, 97 degrees test. The  testimonial  given to that Company by Messrs. Hornsby and Sons is on similar lines to that given by Messrs. Alexander Cowan and Sons. I quote them because they have been given by" firms representing practically the only class of small oil engines in use in Australia. Free-traders should have no hesitation in granting this measure of protection, more especially as in doing so they will incidentally guarantee a measure of safety to the users of oil. As bearing on the risk attaching to the use of lower grade oils, I wish to read the following letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> M.' Hamlet, F.I.C., F.C.S., Government Analyst for New South Wales - </para>

                    <para>In reply to your's of the 1st inst., and in confirmation of my opinion sent to you by telegraph through' the secretary, I beg to say that I approve of 97 degrees Fahrenheit as a flash point for kerosene. Some time ago, when this matter was under consideration at a Conference, of which I was Chairman, a flash point of 100 degrees Fahrenheit was suggested. This was opposed by the American importers, who wished to put it at 73 degrees H. Fahrenheit. After considerable discussion we came to a compromise, and 85 degrees was recommended. Since then, legislation has been in favour of the higher test, and I do not think any hardship would be entailed by adopting 97 degrees Fahrenheit as the standard flash point throughout Australia. It certainly ought to be uniform or else oil that was refused admission in one State could be introduced in a State where the limit was lower. Kerosene or mineral oils can be manufactured that will test up to 100 degrees and over, and a high test will have the beneficial effect of shutting out inferior low-test oils that may be potentially dangerous. The Standard Oil Company of America, I believe, are the people who are fighting hard for the low 73 degrees test, and from what I know of the trade, they could readily turn out a higher test oil if demanded. Kerosene is tested by the Abel close test which is, strictly speaking, not recognised by this Act, which places the test at no degrees by the open test, equal to about 88 degrees Fahrenheit close test. </para>

                <para class="block">That communication, I contend, discloses very fair reason why this Committee should support fixing the flash point at 97 degrees Fahrenheit. I desire to see the request of the Senate adopted without any modification. If the provision relating to denaturation which has been proposed by the Treasurer be inserted in that request, the industry chiefly concerned will receive no protection whatever, because it will be possible for large producers, such as the Standard Oil Trust, to  denaturate  their oils in bulk, and, indeed, they have already signified their willingness to do so. </para>

                        <para>- I am merely stating my own opinion. I may also add that I have not been approached by any representative of the Standard Oil Company. The only company which has approached me has been the Commonwealth  Oil  Corporation, and I am bound to say that it did so in a perfectly proper manner. .Its representatives stated their case, I listened to what they had to say, and I have given their representations every consideration. The honorable member for Macquarie has said that that Corporation is prepared to produce oils of a certain quality, and in sufficient quantity to supply the entire needs. of the Commonwealth. I am not in a position to say whether or not his statement is accurate. But, upon a former occasion, this Committee deliberately decided that kerosene should be admitted free, and I see no reason why we -should depart from that decision. I do not see my way to support the request of the Senate. e It is not a Government proposal, and, while honorable members doubtless pay every respect to proposals submitted by the Government, they have a perfect right to exercise their own judgment in determining whether any ' request by another place ought to be entertained. I intend to vote- as I did upon a previous occasion. </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable member will admit that representatives in another place are at least endowed with a little intelligence. In my opinion, they have endeavoured to improve upon the work of this Committee by protecting the public from imposition by dishonest traders. We know that in country districts it has not been an uncommon thing to find storekeepers selling oil possessing a lower flash point than 70 degrees Fah. for illuminating purposes. The result of using this oil for lighting purposes has been very unsatisfactory. It is our duty to protect the public from imposition of that kind. In agreeing to the request of the Senate, the Treasurer is acting in the public interest. I voted for the free admission of kerosene, but I now intend to go one better by insisting that the article which is sold as kerosene shall be of a quality that will guarantee satisfaction to the users of it. We all know that the use of inferior oils has been responsible for serious damage in some of the homes of this country. The want of Government control in the past in connexion with kerosene has resulted in many serious accidents. </para>

Surely it is not suggested that the Government should refuse to accept an amendment, because they did not happen, at a prior stage, to have realized the advantage of such an amendment. It is a patent fact that there is much danger and considerable damage arising from the use of inferior oil, though the fault is not always laid on the oil, but is attributed to the use of a cheap lamp. I hope the Committee will accept the reasonable request of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- It is refreshing to hear the pearls of wisdom which fall from the honorable member for Gwydir, who is now posing as an authority on kerosene and the bursting of lamps. When I asked the honorable member how many such accidents had come under his observation, he merely replied, " Quite a number," and, as usual, he is as evasive as possible. If the honorable member possesses all this wisdom in relation to kerosene, why did he not give the Treasurer the benefit of it when the Tariff was previously before us? </para>

                        <para>- According to the honorable member, if this requested amendment be not made, all the lamps in the Commonwealth are going to burst, with the result of wholesale destruction of life. But is the honorable member " game " to vote against kerosene coming in free? I venture to say that 99 per cent, of his constituents use kerosene as an illuminant; and there can be no doubt that the Government are supporting this proposal as a cloak to the imposition of a duty of 6d. per gallon. The Treasurer desires that this requested amendment- shall be .made in order to give greater security to life and property ; but it will be observed that his able supporter, the Government Whip, was able to point to only one fatal accident within his knowledge throughout the Commonwealth. Every day in the newspapers we see accidents caused by the use of pea rifles ; but would the Government propose to forbid the use of such rifles on that account ? I have known people die in their beds, but I do not suppose that the Government would propose to put  a  tax on these domestic articles. As a matter of fact, it is not the inferior kerosene that bursts the lamps, but the defective character of the lamps themselves. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with the Treasurer. However, I should like to know why the honorable member does not admit that this proposal means a tax on kerosene, instead of allowing the honorable member for Macquarie to " give the show away." The honorable member said that if the proposed duty were imposed, the Australian company might be able to manufacture kerosene of low flashing point, so as to compete with the imported article. </para>

For the motion which I have indicated, I claim the vote of the honorable member for Gwydir, on the speech he has just made. If the honorable member is true to what ha said a week ago, to the effect that if words, showing that the oil had to be used for oil engines only, were stencilled on the cases he would be. willing to let oil in free, he will vote. with me, and I now give him a chance. How many people in the bush buy less than a tin of kerosene ? </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to stand by the information. I am told by Messrs. Hornsby and Company, who have 2,000 oil engines at work in Australia, that nearly every one of them is working with high-test kerosene. The opposition to the proposal of the Treasurer is in the interests of the Standard Oil Company. What did that company do recently ? The Treasurer brought down the Tariff on the 8th August, imposing a duty of 3d. per gallon on kerosene in  tins. .In New South Wales the Standard- Oil Company collected £13,350 extra from the public, whilst they paid in duty only £50. In Victoria they collected £13,000 extra and paid in 'duty only £10. In Queensland they collected . £8,000 extra. </para>

                        <para>- The largest oil engine working in Australia to-day is at Broken Hill. It is a 66 horse-power engine, and is worked with high-test kerosene. As a' matter of fact the Standard Oil Company does not desire to import low-test kerosene for oil engines at all. All around Sydney and Melbourne this stuff can be seen marked up " Best American kerosene - Royal Daylight " ; and it is going into the homes of the poorer people. Why should we allow the Standard Oil Company to import kerosene of low-grade quality whilst every other country in the world insists upon a high test? In Sweden and Denmark the flash point is 104-; in Ohio, whence a large quantity of this oil comes, the flash test is 98 ; in Canada it is 96.95 ; in Columbia 120; in New Mexico 105. Before Federation the flash point was 83 degrees in Queensland. As a matter of fact there was no need for the Treasurer to bring this matter before the Committee at all. He could have dealt with it bv regulation. It has been said that no accidents have occurred through the use of low-test kerosene; but there have been two cases this year. In one of them a lamp exploded, and a woman was burnt to death. Each of the cases occurred in Ballarat; and, strange to say, it is only within the last four months that low -test kerosene has been introduced to Ballarat. The effect of rejecting the Treasurer's proposal will be that the poorer people who cannot afford to buy their oil by the tin, but purchase it by bottle, sixpennyworth at the time, will have to put up with inferior oil. I remind honorable members that there is an Australian company carrying on business in New South Wales that is capable of supplying all the requirements of the. Commonwealth in regard to oil for oil engines. Yet we find protectionists who are not prepared to protect that industry. I venture to say that' if it were a Victorian industry there would be no doubt about its protection. The Victorian members would see to that. But the representatives of New South Wales seem to be afraid to demand protection for an industry in their State which will afford employment to thousands of men. I hope that the Committee will not be led away, with the cry that a low test is in the interest's of people who use oil engines, because as a matter of fact it does not pay them to use low-test kerosene. </para>

                    <para>-- As a member of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission I was a party to a recommendation that kerosene in tins of 10 gallons should be liable to a duty at 3d. per gallon. That was a straight-out protectionist duty, and I am prepared to' vote for it at the present time. But the Committee in its wisdom, refused to entertain that proposition, which was made for the purpose of encouraging the tinning and packing in Australia. The House decided practically that kerosene should be absolutely free, without any condition attached to it, and the item left this Chamber in that shape. The Senate, on some process of reasoning, decided to ask the House to introduce" a flash test. I do not know whether that is intended to operate as a protective duty or condition, or whether it is intended for the protection of the public. As the proposition has been sent down to us, it appears that kerosene above 97 degrees flash test is to be free. That leaves kerosene below that test liable to a duty of 6d. a gallon. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the Treasurer has proposed a modification. I will come to that presently. The effect of the Senate's proposition renders liable to a duty of 6d. per gallon all the low-grade kerosene used for industrial purposes in oil engines, and so on. I have received the strongest protests from various parts of the country against that proposition.  1  fail to see how it' would have any protective incidence or benefit of any kind whatever. I am, therefore, not prepared to accept it. I am prepared to revert to the original proposition of the Tariff Commission, and place a duty of 3d. per gallon on tinned kerosene, with a view of promoting the local tinning and packing, because I believe that would result in giving a considerable amount of local employment. However, that proposition is now past and gone, and we are faced with a proposal from the Senate for which I do not think the Government are responsible, and which emanated from a private member. Every honorable member, therefore, has a free hand, and ought to exercise his deliberate judgment in the matter. I should be prepared to support any duty that would have a protective effect or result, but the Senate's proposal will mean a burden of 6d. per gallon on industrial oil, and will do no good whatever to the development of Australian industry. That being so, the Treasurer now proposes to amend the Senate's proposal by providing that low-grade kerosene, below 9.7 degrees test, shall be free so long as it is. denaturated. That means that the whole ' of the low-grade kerosene, whether introduced in bulk or in tins, will, before it is admitted into the Commonwealth or placed upon the market and made accessible to the- public, have to be unginned or unbulked, and placed in separate receptacles for the purpose of being denaturated That, I believe, would mean a considerable amount of trouble and expense, involving, in all probability, a burden equivalent to a duty upon industrial oils. I fail to see, therefore, in the circumstances, what is, to be gained by it. The Treasurer's proposal imposes the obligation of denaturating the low-grade oil before it can be admitted, and, therefore, it will, have no protective incidence or benefit whatever upon the Australian shale oil industry. </para>

                        <para>- I have not sufficient information as to how the denaturating is to be effected, under what conditions, who is to do it, and when it is to be done, or what expense will be involved. The proposition as it stands is very inchoate. Everything seems to be left to chance. Everything is to be settled by regulation. The denaturating process may be cheap or expensive. I am inclined to think that it will be expensive. By that I mean not so much the ingredient as the treatment and manipulation to which the oil will have to be subjected. Therefore, ,as the proposition now put forward by the Treasurer will have no protective effect, but will certainly be burdensome to industry, and is one of those matters which should be dealt with by a separate Bill. I cannot support it. It is doubtful whether we can introduce into a Customs Tariff Bill anything but the imposition of Customs duties. It might afterwards be held that this provision is not a Tariff provision, and that it comes rather within our general power of dealing with trade and commerce.- If this Parliament desires to restrict or regulate the importation- of kerosene, to impose a flash test, or to insist upon the denaturating of low-grade kerosene, the matter ought to be specially; dealt with by a separate Bill. Otherwise, the question should be left to the States Parliaments to deal with as one of domestic legislation. The States Parliaments can deal with it more effectively than we can, because, although the Federal Parliament may pass a law providing for the act of denaturating at the ports of entry, the Federal control ceases immediately the article goes into consumption, and it is doubtful whether this Parliament could pass a law pursuing the oil after it leaves the Customs House. It is quite possible that some process of destroying the denaturating ingredient might be resorted to afterwards. I am doubtful whether this Parliament can deal effectively with this important subject in the manner suggested by the Treasurer. In those circumstances I feel disposed to vote straight against both the Senate's request and the modification proposed by the Treasurer. </para>

                    <para>._I have inquired into this matter, and" it seems to me that the reduction of the flash test from 102 degrees to 97 degree'swill not effect any good purpose. In India, which has a hotter climate than any part of Australia, the flash test has been fixed at 76 degrees, and I am advised, after inquiry from some of the highest, authorities here, that a flash test of 76 degrees is perfectly safe for lighting purposes, provided that the right kind of lamps are used, and that kerosene tested up to 102 degrees or 97 degrees test is no better for lighting purposes than that tested up to 76 degrees. In England, I think, the flash test is 73 degrees,, and no country has thought fit to fix as high a standard as is proposed by the Treasurer. </para>

                        <para>- Where ? None of the Russian oil comes up to 100 degrees flash test, and therefore the effect of the Treasurer's original proposal would really have been to grant a monopoly to the Standard Oil Company. Theirs was the only oil that would have come in free. Every other oil would have been charged the duty, and it would therefore have meant larger profits to that company at the expense of the community, and the shutting out of other oils. The Treasurer then proposed that oil below the flash test suggested should be denaturated. I am advised that kerosene oil cannot be denaturated, except in such a way as to destroy all its lighting power and render it absolutely useless for oil engines or any other purpose. There is, therefore, nothing to be gained by attempting to make any such provision. The proper course for the Committee to take is to disagree with the Senate's request, and leave the oil free for the benefit of the consumer. If the Treasurer wants to impose a tax simply for revenue purposes, let him say so straight out. It has been suggested that it will be in the interests of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation. That company was started when oil was free. They relied upon their shale oil, and knew that there was no duty on imported kerosene. There is a large number of companies in Scotland that make oil from shale. At the present time, although they are closer to the American market than we are, and both American and Russian oils can be sold cheaper there than in Australia, some of those companies are making something like 40 per cent. profit. If they can do that with a lower percentage of oil from their shale than we have in Australia. I think the Commonwealth Oil Corporation should be able to pay their way well on their shale oil, without any duty being imposed upon imported oil. Is the Committee going to penalize the people in the country ? The proposal affects the poor people, because this oil is used for lighting purposes by the poorer classes in the community. The people that live in towns have electric light and gas. They are not dependent upon kerosene in the same way as are the miners and farmers and others who live away from the large centres. In the back country of every State the people have no other light than kerosene, and to impose a tax of  6d.  per gallon will be to tax those people at a very high rate for an article that they cannot do without. </para>

We could have got the timber free but for this piece of ingenious finesse.

                    Lyne (further consulting the list) said his intention was that the duty should be the same as it was before. If they had not paid the increased duty before the Tariff was brought down they would not have to pay it now. There was no doubt as to what his intention was.

                    with a relieved air, said that if this was the case there was no necessity to argue the matter further. He again drew attention to the anomaly by which they were compelled to pay as high a rate of duty for three-eighths of an inch as for the. full inch.

My view is that duties should be fixed specifically by Parliament, and that the departmental authorities ought not to be allowed to go behind Parliament and as a result of apparently wilfully distorted interpretation of Parliament's intentions, make regulations doubling, trebling, or even further increasing imposts. That has been done in many directions. An item making dutiable at the one rate timber of different thicknesses necessarily creates anomalies. Those who use3/8-inch thick timber should not have to pay duty on it as if it were inch timber. </para>

The timbers on which it is imposed are used chiefly by the wage-earning classes, men of small means, who require them for flooring boards, weather boards, match linings, studs, sashes, skirtings, and architraves, in the erection of dwellings. Those who can afford to pay for high-class dwellings do not use baltic to any extent. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall not speak at length on this subject, Because I do not think that any vote will be altered by what may be said in regard to it. I regret, however, that the Treasurer did not stand by the proposal of the House of Representatives. We should have' some explanation from him as to why the Government supported an alteration of the item in another place. Had it not been Ibr an arrangement made between the Treasurer and some of the members of the Committee, much of the timber coming under this item would have been made free. One or two of those who supported that compromise say, that, as the Minister has broken it, they do not feel bound to support it any longer, and under the ruling of the  Chairman,  it is possible to have a vote on the question whether certain timber shall be made free. I shall not, however, press for that. I think that it would be fairer if we adhered to the compromise which was arrived at here when the item was last under consideration, and that was to levy an all-round duty of 6d. per 100 superficial feet. I regret very much that the Minister should now want to place a duty of 6'd. on Oregon, and a duty of1s. on all other timbers.  His  proposal will suit my constituency because it is mainly interested in the use of Oregon. But I do not. think that it is fair for the Minister to differentiate in that way. I shall certainly support his proposal so far as it relates to Oregon, but immediately after it is carried, as I believe it will be, I shall support the imposition of a duty of 6d. per 100 superficial feet on all other timbers. I believe that it would save time if the Minister, instead of proposing this modification with regard to the duty on Oregon, would frankly propose a duty of 6d. on all the timber included in the item. Not only would it tend to save time, but I think that it would be the more honorable course for the Minister to pursue, in view of the compromise which was arranged here, and in which I was not concerned. I voted then to make Oregon free, and, therefore, I am not affected in any way. But at least the Treasurer should explain why, behind the backs of those with whom he entered into the compromise, his colleagues in another place departed from it. Of course, I should like oregon to be made free, because there is no doubt that the duty is a tax on a big industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wainwriglif,</inline> secretary of the Mine Man- agers'  Association of Broken Hill, has, in reply to an inquiry from me, forwarded this telegram- </para>

                        <para>- A duty of 6d. per 100 superficial feet represents an annual tax of £5,000. That was the rate under the old Tariff, and it was continued in this Tariff, so that as far as timber is concerned this House has imposed no fresh burden upon the consumer. The Senate's request if made means practically an additional burden of £5,000 to the mines at Broken Hill. I have the idea that the miner has as -much right to be considered as have other people. I do not ask that he shall receive any special consideration. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want to say much about that question at the present time. The men say that their wages have been reduced. At Broken Hill there is a system of contract work underground. 1 presume that the  honorable  member knows something about mining, and therefore he will understand that if the men have their work set to them on contract there is a big possibility of their wages being reduced. As regards the .surface men, an understanding was fixed up at a time  when things were booming at the Hill, but its term will soon expire, and  the whole question unfortunately will have to be reconsidered. I do not want to give a vote, nor should I like this House to give a vote which would make the work of fixing up the wages any more difficult than it is likely to be. On other, occasions I have spoken at considerable length on the timber duties, and therefore I do not want to speak at much length now. I am assured that wherever the' mines can use colonial timber they do so. I do not suggest that they are actuated bv patriotism or any spirit of that kind. The managers want to run the mines on commercial lines, and for some of the work they find that it is advantageous to use hardwood. </para>

On the 2nd July, 1907, an order was given for 8,083 superficial feet, but the timber is not yet to hand. On the 6th August, 1907, an order was given for 210,700 superficial feet, but it is not yet fulfilled. I trust that the Committee will adhere to its previous decision, and if it does that will satisfy me for the time.

                    <para>.- The honorable  member for Barrier has set a very good example. He has pointed out that on a previous occasion we had a long debate  Oil  this item, and there is not much evidence that further discussion is likely to influence a vote. He has expressed his surprise that the Minister is not resisting the request, and adhering to the decision of the Committee. On a previous occasion I fought to get timber admitted free, but I do not wish to tell you, sir, the reason why the proposal for. a duty of 6d. per 100 superficial feet  was  carried. That occurred through a. misunderstanding. Even now, if I thought that there  was  a possibility of getting timber placed on the free list, I should submit to  you  a modification of the Treasurer's proposal. So far there has been no evidence given, either to-night or last week, that there is an inclination to go in that direction. Apparently the Treasurer desires to pick out  Oregon  for a duty of 6d., and to levy a duty of  is.  on baltic and kauri pine. That is manifestly unfair to various trades which use those two classes of timber. It will i&gt;e a very severe impost indeed to them. Oregon is largely used by ship-builders in fining and ceiling boats, and kauri is the best class of wood that can be used for deck planking. The mere imposition of a duty on kauri will not force other timbers into use for that purpose. It will simply be an increased burden to the user. If the Treasurer wants to encourage an industry  such  as ship-building, he is proceeding in the wrong way to achieve that object,  because  kauri will continue to be used for deck planking. It is just the- same with baltic pine, which, as honorable members know, is used for making ships' spars and in other ways. I admit that baltic pine in the rough is admitted free. A duty on baltic pine is a serious matter to engineering establishments, in which it is used for pattern-making". Under this Tariff the engineering trades have been treated very badly, arid surely it is not necessary to subject them to a further impost ! If honorable members compel heavy charges to be paid for kauri and baltic pine they will strike, indirectly, a severe blow at the engineering fraternity, who, I repeat, have been- badly treated under the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. For pattern-making they need a timber which is free from knots, so that if a duty is imposed on baltic pine it will be an additional tax upon them. As regards the large timber \ards, the honorable member for Lang has put the position fairly, and as they all happen to be in my electorate I wish to emphasize what he has so well said. As regards the measurement of timber I cannot understand the action of the Treasurer in reverting to his original proposal. It was rejected here by honorable members, and now the Senate has requested its restoration. Its absolute want of equity has been pointed out by the honorable member for North Sydney and others. The Treasurer has not yet intimated how he intends to treat the request, but I hope that he will adhere to the decision of this Committee, and will not advocate the fanciful method which the Senate has recommended. The method which we adopted is far more favorable to those who have to build small houses. If, however, the Senate's suggestion is adopted the timber merchants will pass on the duty all right, and the effect will be to hamper building operations in the various States. In New South Wales it will probably mean to an artisan a question of building or  not building a house with his small savings. I do not know whether it is the case in Victoria, but certainly in New South Wales the main desire of an artisan is to be thrifty so that he may acquire a home. In the majority of cases a workman's home is mainly composed of timber. I cannot conceive that any argument can be adduced in support of the Senate's method, except that it is in favour of the saw-millers. But the woods which artisans use do not pass through the hands of the saw-millers. I have heard the representatives of Queensland put in a claim on behalf of its timber. That' is a line of action which I have taken up, and. therefore I do not blame them for doing the  same thing. They say, " We want to force an Australian industry." For instance, take the honorable member for Maranoa. On the last item he was a free-trader, but on this request he will vote as a sturdy protectionist. I have my changes, but I do not ring them in too rapidly. Queensland timber cannot replace imported timbers used in the ship-building yards in my electorate, nor can it replace those used for house building there. The forests of New South Wales are rapidly becoming denuded of good timber, and I am one of those who believe that it would be wise to refrain, as long as possible, from encroaching upon our forest reserves. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I have travelled through what is known as the Big Scrub country, and -have no hesitation in  saving  that there is no better timber than that which is growing there. A lot of it, however, is almost inaccessible, and an enormous expenditure will be necessary to open it out. The timber reserves in some parts of New South Wales have been spoliated. The scarcity of timber all over the world is becoming serious, and if Australia preserves her supplies she will secure for future generations a marvellous asset. Our importations of baltic, kauri, and  Oregon  are not competing with Australian timbers ; they are used for special purposes. I should like all timbers to be free, and would vote for a modification to that effect. Failing that, I do not think that the timber duties, as passed by this House, should be increased. I fail to see why the Treasurer should select Oregon for special treatment at the expense of kauri and baltic timber. Either make all those timbers free, or make them dutiable at the same rate. The Treasurer's attitude suggests that he has been calculating the varying interests ' in this Chamber, and finds that the number of honorable members in favour of making oregon free is greater than is the number desiring a low duty in respect of timber generally. If Oregon is to be dutiable, I shall vote for the retention of the duty of 6d. per 100 super, feet, as originally passed by this House, and shall endeavour to have a similar duty imposed in respect of other items now dutiable at higher rates. But if any honorable member moves a modification providing that these items shall be free, I shall vote for it. </para>

To use an expressive phrase, the honorable member for Kooyong, on that occasion, dropped all of us "in the soup " by making the compromise in question. I hope that the Treasurer will at least determine to stand by the original compromise agreed to by him, and revert to the measurement proposals passed by this House before the Tariff was sent to another place. </para>

                    <para>. - I feel that whilst the intention of another place in making this request was good, its proposal, if adopted, would not carry out the object which it had in view. The Senate undoubtedly desired to encourage the use of Australian timbers. I have a similar desire, and, as a protectionist, should have supported a request to make a corresponding increase in all the other timber duties. I recognise that when this item was before the Committee ©n a previous occasion, a compromise was arranged, and in dealing with this question I must take into "consideration the effect which the duty on oregon may have upon workers engaged in our saw-mills. Some consideration must also be extended to the timber merchants who have invested large sums of money in the timber trade, and who must  certainly  obtain some return on their investment if they are to pay their workmen the wages  that I desire them to receive. The point that I wish to make is that if we agree to the request to increase from 6d. to is. per 100 superficial feet the duty on undressed timber, in sizes of 12 inches x 6 inches, and do not make a corresponding increase in the duties on smaller sizes, we shall encourage the introduction of small cuts, and consequently lessen employment in the saw-mills. We shall not stop the importation of the smaller sizes dealt with more particularly in paragraph  d  by increasing the duty in respect of paragraph </para>

                    <para>.- I think that by this time the Treasurer must have recognised that, in agreeing to a compromise in respect of the duty on  Oregon,  he secured no equivalent gain in respect of other classes of timber-. It is an admirable bargain only from the point .of view that it makes it easy to reduce the duty in respect qf paragraph  a,  and much easier to reduce the duties relating to other paragraphs ! The honorable member for Lang in speaking this afternoon seemed to take up the position that this item affected only Queensland pine. I would remind the Committee, and especially the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, that it covers every kind of timber entering Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; into nearly every port. We have on one side honorable members who declare for a revenue duty, and on the other a majority declaring for protection for Australian industries ; yet the timber industry, which is a native one, will secure neither a revenue nor a protective duty. It is because the timber industry happens to be native to Australia that it is not supported. The ordinary citizen will want to know why ; and I venture to say that most honorable members will find it difficult to give a reasonable explanation. The only explanation I can  offer  is that it has been in the interests of importers rather than to the advantage of local producers that timber has been free. Fortunately or unfortunately, our large centres of population are on the sea-board, and. in many instances, the cost of conveying to them timber from other parts of the world is much less than is that of conveying timber from our forests to them. </para>

Our forests are being stripped of good timber, and yet the trade is unprofitable because the local industry receives no encouragement from this Parliament. It seems to be  the determined policy of honorable members not to extend to the timber getter the protection that has been extended to every other native industry in Australia. For instance, raisins and dried fruits have been subjected tq heavy duties, and yet those industries do not employ one-fifth of the hands that are employed in the timber industry. Similarly, butter and cheese have been highly protected. </para>

                        <para>- When I was arguing this question upon a previous occasion, some honorable members said that they did not object to a duty upon log timber. " Put it on," they exclaimed. But when, at a later stage, it was suggested that the item should be made dutiable, those honorable members - including the honorable member for Wimmera - said, " Oh, no. That is. quite a different matter." </para>

                        <para>- I will undertake to say that that industry will produce sufficient timber to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth in a shorter period than any other industry can supply our needs in the matter of its own productions. It will produce sufficient timber to supply the requirements of the whole Commonwealth before  bur  woollen mills are in a position to produce sufficient woollen goods to supply our needs. What is the use of the honorable member talking nonsense of that sort? I have always understood that a protective policy is based upon the assumption that it is necessary to nurse our industries during the initial stages of their existence, and that afterwards they will be able to stand alone. </para>

                        <para>- When we adjourned for dinner I was pointing out that it was quite a mistake to assume that the proposals before us affect only the soft woods of Queensland ; and I should like honorable' members to discuss the question, not from the point of view of that State, but from the larger Australian point of view. After all, valuable as our soft woods are, I believe that the hardwoods of Australia will ultimately prove even more valuable; and the sooner the hardwood forests are developed the better it will be for the Commonwealth as a whole. I recognise that, unfortunately, any discussion is unlikely to alter the result. The large centres of population are on the seaboard, and the people there can, apparently, get their timber supplies from oversea cheaper than they can from inland owing to the cost of carriage,  so  that it does not seem to matter whether  or  not timber is partially destroyed  or  railways are built  in  order  to  open up timber country. The fact that this is a typical Australian  industry,  which gives employment to large numbers of people, and assists in the  development of the country, does not seem to influence the majority of honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- I am only pointing out the fact that, while every exotic industry is protected, the timber-producing industry, which I venture to say employs some 80,000 people, is left to face the competition of the world. I can only account for this by the fact that it suits the large centres of population, especially on the seaboard, to import their timber supplies rather than agree to impose even a revenue duty in the interests of the timbergetters. The people who make large fortunes are those who handle the timber from oversea ; those who have endeavoured to develop the native timber industry may in some cases have done well. Log timber is in every instance free, and, with that concession, I think that a duty of is. might well be imposed in the case of the item before us. Of course, if the majority of the Committee are otherwise minded, I am content to leave the matter as before. I admit that there seemed to be some kind of compromise arrived at on the previous occasion ; and it is for the Minister to decide what he shall do in the position in which he finds himself. It is proposed that the duties in the case of Oregon shall be reduced ; and it would be an anomaly if other timbers were treated differently. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to see all these timbers made free. When these items were before us on the previous -occasion I moved that the timber imported for butter-box making, from New Zealand especially, ought to be made free in the interests of the great dairying industry of Australia. It appears, however, that there is no possibility of having pine, Oregon, and other timbers placed on the free list ; and, therefore, I suppose  Ave  must endeavour to have the duty made as low as possible, which will in all likelihood mean the rate already passed by this Chamber. I was rather surprised at the speech of the honorable member for Wide Bay. Before dinner that gentleman pointed out that on one side of the Committee are protectionists and on the other side are those  who favour  revenue duties, and the result,  between  the  two,  is that the timber industry, which is  native,  not only to Queensland, but to other parts of the Commonwealth is likely to receive very .poor treatment. The honorable member also submitted that those  Who  vote for revenue duties do so  in  the interests of importers - that it is very hard to find any other reason for their votes. </para>

                        <para>- My votes are not given in the interests of importers, but in the interests of the great producing industries of Australia, especially the great mining industry, which employs  over  125,000 men, and the great dairying industry, which has been to a large extent the salvation of some of the States, especially of Victoria during the bad times of the 'nineties. I am, of course, prepared to give importers "a fair deal." I do not regard them as they, apparently, are regarded by some honorable members. The honorable member for Wide Bay, ' as the leader of the Labour Party, if he does not consider the farmer and the miner, ought, at any rate, to consider the  working  classes,  who  use this  wood  largely in the building of their small homes. Every penny of duty imposed on some classes of timber presses hardly on those classes, adding to the cost of the erection of their homes, and to their necessary expenses, thus, to that extent, reducing their wages. </para>

                        <para>- When the honorable gentleman gets high duties imposed on harvesters, wire-netting, and other commodities required by the farmers in his constituency, it appears to me that he must be verv much more of an artist at humbugging the electors than I am. I remind the representatives of Queensland that, speaking for myself, the votes cast on this side are not given with the object of injuring the timber industry of that State. </para>

                        <para>- At the present time, the Queensland timber industry has a. magnificent market in Australia; but those engaged in it cannot supply even the local market of Queensland. The honorable member for Darling Downs will bear me out when I say that those engaged in the great dairying industry of Queensland are obliged to import pine from New Zealand for butter-box making, although the Queensland pine is claimed to be splendid for the purpose.. As a matter of fact, a large quantity of the pine used in Queensland is from the northern rivers in New South Wales. It is well known that, not only in Sydney and Melbourne, but elsewhere, timber merchants are unable to get their orders for Queensland pine fulfilled. I am not speaking entirely from my own experience, although the dairying industry is one with which I am pretty well acquainted in my own district ; but I have here letters from merchants in Sydney and Melbourne to support the position I am taking up. Here is a letter from a well-known timber merchant, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Thorpe, of Normanby-road, South Melbourne, whom, I am sure, is known to Victorian representatives. </para>

                    <para>Referring to the supplies of Queensland timber now being discussed in the House, we beg to inform you that Queensland is quite unable to deliver sufficient quantities for our requirements. During the season, we use over 1,000,000 feet of butter-box timber; we asked Queensland mills to quote for 500,000 feet, but were informed that all we could get would be 5,000 feet per week, which would only keep us going for about three hours per week in the busy season .

                <para class="block">So that this gentleman, says that, so far as he is concerned, the supplies that he was able to obtain from Queensland would keep him going only three hours per week in a busy season. When supplies are forthcoming in that insufficient way, it would be. absolutely impossible to keep a large timber mill in full work. </para>

                        <para>-  The honorable member for Maranoa was very strong in his statement that timber merchants in the big cities of Australia, while prepared to take what are known as the " butters ". from Queensland, are not prepared to take the off -cuts ; and he said that that was the great difficulty that the Queensland timber people had. Here is what this gentleman says on that subject - </para>

                    <para>With regard to the statement that Victoria will take their "butters," but will not take their " off-cuts," we are quite prepared to enter into an arrangement to take all the Queensland mills can supply us with for 12 months; with reasonable deliveries, provided the price is the same, or even1s. higher than New Zealand. </para>

                <para>So that this gentleman was prepared not only to take butter-box timber, supplies of which he could not obtain, but also what is known as the off-cuts or waste, and that at a price even1s. higher than the price of. New Zealand timber. </para>

I have known them for a number of years, and I am aware that this has been a common complaint. It is not a. new thing, but it is the common experience in dealing with the Queensland timber merchants, that they are unable to maintain a regular delivery of orders. </para>

                        <para>- There is no dead set against it on the part of the merchants whose representations I have been giving to the Committee. Personally, I wish well to the Queensland timber-getters, and hope that their industry will prosper. I know that they have a magnificent industry, but I also know that they cannot supply orders. The Sydney timber merchants would be perfectly ready to use Queensland timber if they could get regular and sufficient supplies of it. But the dairying industry would be absolutely blocked, not only in connexion with the local trade, but also in regard to the export trade, if a ready supply of pine for butter boxes were not always forthcoming. What a nice position the Victorian dairy farmers would be in, with their exports of £16,000,000 per annum of butter to the markets of the world, if they were not in a position to get timber for the making of their butter boxes, or if they were only able to obtain it at such a high price as must seriously handicap them in their trade? I feel sure that' even the Queensland representatives, interested as they are in the prosperity of the dairying industry and of mining, would not, in a cold-blooded way, injure the large number of persons engaged in those industries. I wish to refer to some further evidence which I have in my possession in connexion with this feature of the matter. Messrs. Binns, Wadge, and Brown, who are large merchants in Sydney, and who use every kind of timber, write to me under date nth May, 1908. </para>

                        yours of the9th, we beg to state that we have no contracts with any of the Queensland  firms,  as we found the business so unsatisfactory through the delays and unbusinesslike methods of the Queensland firms, that w.e had to drop it and buy locally. They kept us waiting for months for timber, so we decided to place no more orders with them.

                        <para>- The honorable member for Brisbane wants fo pin these men down to pieces of a measurement which meets the requirements of the butter-box trade. But I can assure him and the Committee that the inability of the Queensland timber people to supply orders applies to all kinds of timber. I have also a letter from. Messrs. S. A. Burns and Company, general timber merchants, Goulburn-street, Sydney. ' In documents handed to me they give particulars' in connexion with classes of timber which they ordered, and for the information of the honorable member for Brisbane I will read some of the sizes. </para>

Hyne and Son write us with reference to the order we placed before them for hoop pine on your account, that at the present juncture they could not accept your' order at rates specified," and state - " We are faced with yet another increase in price of logs, and a probable strike with our men for less work and more pay per day, so at present we would not entertain the order. Moreover, seeing we deliver on his wharf, we reckon now that the quality of our timber is known that we should get more benefit for this service." </para>

                    <para>Dear Sirs, - We have to-day received advice from Messrs. Hyne and Son that they prefer not to quote for orders - </para>
                </quote>
                <para>So it is not a question of supplying at a price fixed by the people who want the timber, for it is stated there that the firm preferred not to quote for orders -  for some little time, or until their log supplies look brighter - </para>
                <para>They were not in a position to get the log supplies to fulfil the contract -  than they do at present. We are, therefore, referring the order to Brisbane, and will advise you their reply. </para>
                <para class="block">I have similar evidence with me to which I could refer, but I think I have quoted sufficient to prove that the people in Melbourne and Sydney, at any rate, who want supplies of Queensland pine, and have given orders, not only for the big sorts, but for the smaller sorts as well, and are prepared to take not only what is known as the butter timber, but the off-cuts or " rubbish," as the honorable member for Maranoa characterized it the other night, cannot get supplies from Queensland. One timber merchant was prepared to take all that could be supplied for twelve months. I think I can fairly claim that Queensland is not in a position to-day to supply anything like the requirements of the Commonwealth. I hope that State will some day be in a position to supply the whole of our requirements, but, in the meantime, while the Queensland Government have hysterically  rushed railways through the State Parliament, in the teeth of the opposition of the Labour Partv, in order to open up these forests- </para>

                        <para>- I have made the statement, and am prepared to accept the correction of the' honorable member for Maranoa, or of any other Queensland labour member. What could be fairer than that? If they, assure me that I have made a nasty insinuation, I withdraw it, but that does not affect the position at all. The fact remains that Queensland to-day is not in a position to supply anything like the requirements of the Commonwealth. I go further, and say that Queensland is not in a position to supply anything like one-fourth of the requirements of the particular industries I have mentioned. In those circumstances, the Committee would be acting prejudicially to some of the great industries of Australia, and prejudicially to the interests of the working classes particularly, who are compelled to use a number of imported timbers in connexion with the little homes that they build for themselves, if it agreed to impose the heavy duties suggested by the Senate. I sincerely wish that these timbers could come in free, but, in the circumstances, I am compelled to vote for the duties as passed by this House on a previous occasion. In doing so I feel that we are still placing a handicap on some of our big industries. If we acted with wisdom, and with a view to the development of the mining, dairying, and other big industries which are making the wealth of Australia, and practically keeping our big cities going, every inch of this timber would come in absolutely free. As we cannot hope to make it free, I trust that we shall place it under as low a duty as possible. </para>

                    <para>.- It is stated in one letter read by the honorable member for Illawarra, with regard to the supplying of orders from Queensland, that  the logs were not coming forward. That letter was dated, I think, April, 1907. I have information of much more recent date. I am informed that since that time the logs have been, coming in so fast that they could not be unloaded. </para>

                        <para>- I am barracking for the associated saw-mill owners and timbergetters in Queensland - for the men who are pioneering the country. In the electorate of the leader of our party, there are men at work opening up the country for civilization and selection, and surely if some of the workers in Melbourne and Sydney are to get a measure of protection, the protectionist members of this House will not deny the same protection to those men. I do not know much about the protectionist theory. I am only a novice at it, but since I came here I have learnt a lot. The only protection that my electorate asks for is to be left alone. I have heard honorable members on this side of the chamber, and in our own corner, denouncing combines and trusts, and condemning them in no measured terms. Here, in Melbourne, there is a Timber Combine second to none. Talk about the Confectionery Combine and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company ! This one is on the Yarra bank, in the electorate of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. There are half-a-dozen men in it, and the great bulk of the timber imported into Victoria is imported in one man's name. There are two lists in the Combine. One is called the white list. Those on it are the insiders. They are the fellows that get all the picking's. On the other side, there is what is called the pink list, and the pink listers have to pay 15 per cent, more for their timber than those on the white list pay. To prove what I am saying, I will read a letter that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> this morning from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> J. Moore, of 17 Queen-street. That is not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> the big timber merchant, but the agent, I think, for one of the Queens land firms.

                        of Tuesday : - " Hitherto I have kept out of this controversy, but I cannot allow your correspondent's statements to go unchallenged. I have had six years' experience in Queensland timber in Melbourne, and) in reply to allegations about combines, my experience is that one of the biggest combines in the southern hemisphere is to be found in the Melbourne timber business. The Melbourne timber merchant does not want local timber, for anything local, as a rule, kills combines. When they order Queensland timber they always demand our best, and best only. When they buy kauri or New Zealand white pine they must take everything out of a log, or pay for the privilege. From Queensland everything is wanted, and no privilege. ' Timber Merchant ' challenges

                        statements regarding the cutting of pine. I will not dispute the point; but will ask ' Timber Merchant ' to explain why a Melbourne buyer,- who is neither 1 white nor pink,' has to pay in Melbourne 33 1-3 per cent, to get his logs cut up. Now that I have come into the open, I should like 'Timber Merchant ' to come to the front, and expose his name, so that we may fight on fair ground."

                <para class="block">There is the whole thing in a nutshell. Because it is not a Victorian industry - because the timber is not growing on the banks of the Yarra, or in the backyards of South Melbourne, or up and down the avenues of Collingwood - the timber industry is to have no protection. Like everything else Victorian, the idea is one-eyed. If one attends a football match or a cricket match in Victoria, he will find that the " barrackers " while seeing nothing but faults on one side, see none on the other. Honorable members know the weeping and wailing there was the other day because the New South Wales crew beat the Victorian crew in the boat race. One Victorian, I believe, went so far as to say that he thought some of the Victorian crew had been " dosed " by New South Wales supporters. I ask representatives of Victoria, who advocate protection from the public platform, how they can reconcile voting for protectionist duties to assist a Victorian industry with their refusal to give the same measure of protection to a Queensland industry? We have known some of them to shed crocodile tears because they did not consider a 50 per cent, duty sufficiently protective for a Victorian industry. The honorable member for Batman last night was wailing about a 50 per cent. duty. </para>

It does not matter how much advantage might be gained by giving a vote for a' lower duty, those honorable members are unable to see it. There is no doubt that they are one-eyed protectionists. But there are other members of the Committee who, to hear them speaking, would sacrifice everything rather than give a vote against protection, but who are not prepared to vote for the protection of industries that are not established in Victoria. </para>

                <para class="block">I wish to be quite fair with the Committee in dealing with these timber duties, and, therefore, I mention the fact that some twelve or eighteen months ago I saw a statement in a newspaper to the effect that a quantity of white pine had been imported to Queensland for the manufacture of butter-boxes. I made inquiries in Brisbane as to the reason for this importation, and I was told that sufficient Queensland pine had not come to hand, and the Queensland millers could not execute the orders they received, because the butter industry of the State was growing at such a rapid pace, that they could not keep up with its requirements. That appeared to me to be a valid reason for the importation of white pine at the time. </para>

                        <para>- They are not valued more highly by his constituents than mine are by the people  .1  represent ; but, of course, comparisons are odious. The statement is made that the superiority of Queensland flooring, lining, weatherboard, and other timbers for the trade is acknowledged, and dare not be contradicted, i must say that I have heard no member of the Committee contradict it. . The Queensland timbers are of the finest quality. I admit that the honorable member for Illawarra was very fair in his criticisms, but what we object to is that timber merchants in Melbourne - I cannot speak as to Sydney - require the heart of the log. They must have timber from 12 to 24 inches wide, and as much wider as they can  get it. If a purchaser every time he enters a shop buys only the best of the stock, and leaves the inferior goods on the shopkeeper's hands, how is he to replenish his stock? </para>

I want to tell the honorable member for Illawarra that every one of the railways which are being constructed into the timber districts of Queensland is State-owned, and that the land which they traverse - it is some of the best land to be found in Queensland for agricultural purposes - will be taken up for agricultural selection after the timber has been cleared. The railways to which he referred are in northern Queensland. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that we ought to take a wide view of this question. Throughout the world, the price of timber is rising, and apparently the forests are becoming somewhat denuded. If the States of Australia are wise, they will begin to conserve their forests. I dare say that a good man}'' of the imported woods could be grown here if the States' Departments would only make an effort in that direction. In my opinion, the duty on oregon, New Zealand white pine, kauri, baltic, and other soft wood's which are imported, should be a light one. Those woods are not grown here, But they are wanted very much indeed. If honorable members force the people of Australia to use other woods for the purposes for which the imported woods are now used, the heavy burden which they will impose will not be counterbalanced by any employment which may be given locally? </para>

                        <para>- In Tasmania, we have a number of good woods, but they are not used altogether for those purposes. If  a  heavy duty is imposed on baltic timber, it will still be used in that State  in  the construction of the poorer class of houses, and at greater cost ; but the local timber industry will not be benefited to any extent. The people will still have to use kauri. </para>

                        <para>- I do not dispute the Minister's statement, but  it  does not, in any  way,  interfere with my argument. The Tariff Commission recommend that white pine should be placed on the free list, but this Committee decided that it should be dutiable at 6d. per 100 superficial feet. If it cannot be made free, that is, I think, quite enough duty to levy. It is chiefly used in the making of butter boxes. Surely if there is one industry in Australia that deserves to be encouraged, it is the butter industry. It is one of the greatest wealth-producing sources that we have. It has developed naturally, and its potentialities are very great. It is a short-sighted policy which will attempt to hamper a valuable industry merely for the sake of benefiting the community generally in a small way. I do not doubt for a moment the statement that Queensland pine can be used for making butter boxes, but the butter trade is a big one. There are many purposes to which this wood can be put. Surely the market is good enough to encourage the Queensland people to send down their wood without getting further encouragement ! Undoubtedly a big demand exists, and if they are in earnest they ought to try to supply it. If a duty is imposed it may help Queensland, but it will not help the community very much, because probably the greater proportion of the pine - it is a wood of superior quality, and well fitted for making doors and other things - will be used for other purposes than the making of butter boxes, so that the butter industry may be hit, and no one appreciably benefited. It will be remembered that we gave a good measure of protection, I think unanimously, to the Marbut carving industry. The Marbut Carving Company found it very difficult to get a supply of Queensland wood. Firms in that State would not take orders to supply the wood at a definite time, and many orders still remained unfulfilled. The result was that the company were forced to get the timbers they required from America, New Zealand, and other places. If Queensland cannot keep up a regular supply of the small quantity of timber required by that industry, how can it supply the big demand of Australia? What benefit will our protection be to the Marbut carving industry, and other industries, if we impose a heavy duty on their raw material ? </para>

                        <para>- I think that in the general interests of Australia it is quite enough at the present time. It must be remembered that, although a duty will benefit the timber industry, it will hit very much larger industries. I do not think that it is good business to do that. The price of timber, I repeat, is rising. The honorable member for Illawarra has stated that if we impose a duty it will not stop the importation of Baltic and other cheap woods which are now introduced so freely and used so largely by all sections of the community. Nowadays pretty well every house in the country contains a lot of baltic pine. If it is seriously taxed, it. will still be  imported, and poor users penalized to that extent, without the timber industry being benefited. It is said that, although there is a good market, Queensland cannot supply the orders which it receives from timber merchants. Why is not the timber sent down ? Possibly it is owing to the forests being so difficult of access and the freight so heavy. If that is the reason why Queensland timber is not placed on the market, why should we impose a heavy duty on other woods that Australian people must have? If a duty is imposed on Oregon, it must still be imported largely for the people of Australia. I do not see that it comes much into conflict with Australian hardwoods. The latter are used freely in mines, but the Barrier mines will have Oregon at any price. Having regard to the large employment that is afforded on the Barrier, and the low price of metals, at the present time, I think that honorable members will be taking a grave step indeed if they increase the price of Oregon' materially. A great many of the mines in Broken Hill might shorten hands, and we should have done more harm by causing men to be thrown out of employment than good by giving work, by compelling the mine-owners to use Australian hardwood. There is a good market here and abroad for both Australian and imported timbers. As a matter of fact, most of the Tasmanian hardwood is exported to London and elsewhere, where it finds a ready sale, and I do not think that the duty would be of much assistance to the local timber companies. At any rate, there is nothing to justify the imposition of high duties on the timbers which I have mentioned. As to the measurement question, I cannot see why timber half-an.-inch thick should be charged as if it were an inch thick. Duty should be proportionate to the number of feet in the timber; it should not be charged by superficial measurement. The price of the cheaper kinds of wood will be enormously increased if superficial measurement is adopted. The proposed rule of measurement is illogical and unjust, and I hope that the Committee will not agree to it. </para>

                    <para>.- It has been stated repeatedly, by the honorable member for East Sydney and others, that this is a protectionist Committee, and I hope that honorable members will remember that in dealing with the timber industry as they have when dealing with other industries.

                    that in a certain division I voted free-trade; but that is one of the mistakes which that journal makes. Throughout the consideration o"f the Tariff, I have- remained on the protectionist side whenever a proposal involving a fair and reasonable protection has been at stake. A. great deal has been made of the statement that the Queensland timber-getters were not able to supply all the orders sent to them just about the time the Tariff was introduced, when merchants in Sydney and Melbourne forwarded large orders, thinking that duties would be raised. In one of the letters quoted by the honorable member for Illawarra, it is stated that certain timber firms refused to execute orders at the prices quoted ; but it often happens in business that a firm to which an order is offered at a certain price will not accept it. Besides, in every new industry, if business is growing rapidly, there are times when orders cannot be executed. The present Tariff will last, I hope, for at least ten years, and are we, in framing it, to penalize the timber industry of Australia because one or two firms could not execute orders when there was a rush last year?

                        <para>- It has been said that in Tasmania we would not use Huon pine for flooring. We have a better timber there for the purpose. It is known as Tasmanian oak, and there are not three members who could distinguish a polished sample of it from a sample of English oak. As the Commonwealth possesses such fine timbers, we should protect the timber industry. A great deal has been said about the need for cheap butter boxes ; but surely the poor farmer who, instead of burning all his timber, sends the good logs to market, should be protected,. Queensland pine is suitable for butter boxes, and there is a good supply of it. If a duty of 6d.  were imposed on butter-box timber, the extra cost per box would be only about £d., and as each box contains. 56 lbs. of butter, that would be very little per lb. of butter. We should impose timber duties for the protection of the men who work harder and for longer hours than the employes in any city industry. The honorable member for Maranoa, spoke of Victoria' as one-eyed. I thought that to-day, when I saw displayed in Collins-street a number of pictures of our beautiful gorge at Launceston, with nothing to indicate the locality, whereas a picture of Victorian scenery \va&gt; labelled " Blacks Spur." </para>

                        <para>- We have such good timber in Tasmania, Western Australia, , and Queensland that we should give the timber industry protective duties of 10 or 1.5 per cent. We have given other industries duties running up to 30 and 40 per cent., and I, as a protectionist, believe in protecting every industry against the cheap labour of the outer world. </para>

                    <para>: - This question has been so thoroughly threshed out on this and previous occasions, that I have very little more to sa.y on it now. We are constructing a most complicated Tariff. The object of appointing a Tariff Commission was to provide for the remedying of anomalies ; but this Tariff will be even less scientific than the last. lt is divided into such a multiplicity of items and sub-items, and gives so much scope for departmental interpretation, that the Customs experts, who are keen and alert for the protection of the revenue, and; incidentally, for the protection of local industries, will have a great deal to do in deciding what rates shall be imposed, and there will be a conflict of opinion which will lead to endless confusion. While the Tariff is yet in the process of making, it is already having this effect. Only last night warm words were exchanged over the table because of an occurrence of the kind. In respect of timber, we are framing a Tariff which, I venture to say, is of the most complicated nature, and will lead to equally reprehensible results in the matter of interpretation.. I should think that the most scientific way of constructing a Tariff, from a protectionist point of view, is to make it as simple, and not as complicated, as possible. </para>

                <para class="block">It is useless to belabour this aspect of the question if the Minister has made up his mind, but  I  complain again that there is  a  great want of straightforwardness, in the conduct of this Tariff, on the part of those who have charge of it. We are actually going to enact that timber shall be rated as being an inch thick when, in reality, it is not. We are enacting that things are precisely what they are not, and all this will eventually lead to endless trouble. Why, is it being done? The answer is simple: it is being done in order to impose protective duties under cover of complicated arrangements. In some instances, we are taxing goods two or three times over. I mentioned last night a case in which a duty of 20 per cent, or 30 per cent, has been imposed on an article of manufacture, and pointed out that on the top. of that duty, but in a different part of the schedule, we indirectly impose further duties by taxing the labels and packages. Thus, although the main product appears in the schedule as being dutiable at 20 per cent, or 30 per cent., it may be found, in actual practice, to carry a duty of 40 per cent, or 50 per cent. It cannot be said that a Tariff so arranged is scientifically constructed. It is simply an ingenious method of piling up duties which would not be assented to if they were put before the Committee in a clear and straightforward way, as I think that they ought to be. I refer to this instance ' as being- typical of many other items with which we have dealt during the. course ot the Tariff through this Committee. The position in regard to the timber duties is resolvable into a very plain statement of fact. The protectionists say that until we can satisfy our own requirements protective duties must be taxes. They assert - and wc may admit, for the purposes of this argument, that the statement is correct - that the moment we are able to supply our own requirements such' a duty is no longer a tax that it is simply a protective impost as distinguished from a tax. Accepting this reasoning of theirs, how does it apply to timber?  Those who advocate most earnestly and urgently this duty on timber admit that we are not able, by any means, to supply our own requirements. The <inline font-style="italic">Official Year-Book</inline> for 1901-7, just published by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> shows that our total imports of timber during 1906 were 250,000,000 super, feet, and that our exports for the same period were 155,000,000 super, feet. Here is a curious example of the inability of any tax to control the trade in matters of this kind. lt is curious to observe that in this, as in many other cases, we are exporting nearly as much as we import. </para>

Then comes New South Wales, with a production of  t  19,337,000 super feet, whilst Queensland is third with 82,801,846 super feet. These figures represent the quantity of local timber sawn or hewn in 1906. Victoria is next on the list with 51,103,000 super, feet, so that all the other States are equally interested with Queensland in the arrangement of these duties. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that is the case; but do the representatives of Queensland think it is fair to tax the primary industries of Australia on the mere off-chance that, at some time or other, railways, opening up the forests of Queensland, will be constructed? Honorable members will admit that until we can supply our own requirements this duty will be a tax, and that it will fall upon the primary industries of Australia - industries which, of all others, derive practically no advantage from this Tariff. . </para>

                        <para>- I heard the statement made, and by a Queenslander, too. When these duties were originally imposed, I know that in my own electorate the price of fruit cases was .increased by 2d. per case. Whether that increase was justifiable I do not pretend to say. I am merely stating a fact. The same thing happened in connexion with butter boxes. It is true that their price was subsequently reduced somewhat, but to-day, as the result of the operation of the timber duties, these boxes are costing more than they did previously. Am I to vote in favour of  imposing taxation upon the primary industries of Australia, when there is no. immediate prospect of their being able to get their timber requirements supplied locally and equally reasonably? There seems to be no reason why Queensland or any other State should not be able to compete with New Zealand - which may be regarded as almost our only competitor in the supply of pine for butter boxes and fruit cases - upon even terms. </para>

                        <para>- Why is it not as cheap? I suppose it will not be denied that the expense of getting timber in New Zealand - so far as the cost of labour is concerned - is quite as much as it is in Queensland. We have been told that tetter wages obtain in New Zealand than in Australia - that it is the ideal State to which our Australian democracy must look to see all the conditions that should obtain in respect of industrial and social welfare. Why we are unable to successfully compete with New Zealand I am at a loss to understand. But my chief point is that at present we are not able to supply our own demands in the matter of timber. Until those demands can be supplied locally, the existing duty must, on the reasoning of protectionists  themselves, act as a tax, and therefore must fall as a heavy imposition on the primary industries of the Commonwealth, which can ill afford to bear it, seeing that they have to compete oversea in the markets of the world. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Colonel FOXTON</inline>
                    (Brisbane) [9.28].- At the risk of repeating what I said some days ago in the short address which I then delivered, I desire to make a few observations in reply to what has fallen, not only from the honorable member for Parramatta, but also from the honorable member for Illawarra. But before dealing with any other phase of this question,I wish to point out that a very grave misapprehension exists on the part of a number of honorable members - protectionists and free-traders alike - as to. the extent to' which the duty upon this item would act as a protective impost. A duty of1s. per 100 superficial feet represents a protection' of7½ per cent. and a duty of 6d. per 100 superficial feet consequently represents a protection of only 3¾ per cent. One would imagine from the debate which has taken place that the whole of the trades which are dependent upon obtaining a sufficient supply of timber would be penalized if a duty of1s. per 100 superficial feet were imposed upon it. Could anything be more absurd? What would some persons engaged in our secondary industries - which are practically hot-house plants - think if a paltry protection of only3¾ per cent. were offered to them ? The honorable member for Illawarra certainly gave some rather remarkable statements and figures; and I can only say, as I said before, that these, as well as those previously quoted, are in strong conflict' with the facts and figures supplied to me by the timber-getters and saw-millers of Queensland. Mention has been made of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross,</inline>
                    the accredited agent in Sydney of the Queensland Associated Saw -millers. That gentleman was, I understand, appointed on his representing that he could secure orders for 6,000,000 feet per annum; but the Associated Sawmillers are complaining bitterly of his being unable to carry out his undertaking. This, of course, conflicts with the statements made here to-night. I asked specially for the dates of the orders which have been given, and are alleged not to have been fulfilled, and I find that they were early in last year. I am told that the saw-millers association was formed about a year and eight months ago; and I understand that since then no orders have been received from Sydney or Melbourne for anything under 12 inches or 24 inches in width. It would appear that the orders referred to by honorable members to-night were given before the formation of the association, for since then all orders are recorded, and none of the kind have been received. One order was so small that it is almost' absurd to quote it, even if it were not fulfilled, as proving that Queensland saw-millers are unable to supply the market. One item was actually 24 feet of a certain class of timber!

                    <inline font-style="italic">on</inline>
                    the ground that it will mean taxing the primary industries. But the industry on which will fall the impost caused by this paltry protection, if it be afforded is the building industry, which I do not regard as primary, but one which should pay its fair share of protection on the timber consumed; in the same way as it pays for protection in regard to tiles, slates, iron, and other material. We have in Queensland what is admitted to be very superior pine; . and yet not a solitary foot of it can be seen in any building in course of erection in Melbourne or Syd-, ney.

                <para>Colonel FOXTOX.-A Queenslander, accustomed to the beautiful pine to be seen in the buildings in that State, observes with surprise the exclusive use of gnarled and knotted imported pine in Melbourne buildings. I know that it is useless to attempt by any arguments to change the vote, because I believe that every honorable member has made up his mind. But I ask the Committee, haying regard to the importance of the timber industry to the State from which I come, to bear with' these few words in favour of imposing a duty which, after all. from the protectionist point of view, is less than paltry. What sort of protection is that to offer a primary industry such as this? </para>
                <para>Mr.MALONEY (Melbourne) [9.40].- I desire, as a Victorian representative, to offer my support to the views enunciated by the honorable member for Wide Bay. I do so; not only because the duty under consideration is one for the benefit of a primary industry, but also because I consider that we Australians have not hitherto shown that we understand the value of timber and the potentialities of our magnificent forests. I am glad to say that Queensland is in some respects leading the van in the direction of an appreciation of the importance of forestry. No less than one-tenth of the surface of the earth is covered with forests. Europe is richer in forests than any other part of the world in proportion to its size. Russia has an area under forest of  426,000,000  acres ; </para>
                <para class="block">United States, 456,000,000 acres, and Germany and France, which lead the  world  in this respect, have respectively 32,000,000 and 22,000,000 acres under forest. It is calculated that an acre under cultivated  forest  in Germany will give a greater yield than ten acres in the wild state. The destruction of timber in Australia has been largely due to the fact that in the past we have had bad land laws, which compelled settlers to go out into the heavily -timbered country. In Victoria, . thirty or forty years ago, men who wanted to obtain land upon which to settle had to go into the dense forests of  Gippsland and carve homes for themselves. Some of the most magnificent trees in the world have been destroyed in this manner. One famous tree, which' was said , to be the biggest in the world, was called the Baron tree, in honour of the late Baron Von Mueller. That, in common with other enormous trees, has been destroyed. In Europe, I need hardly remind honorable members, great care is taken of notable and historical trees. I might instance the famous oak which was the means of saving the life of King Charles the Second, owing to the fact that he took refuge in its branches after the battle of Worcester. The timber of the forest is the finest crop that will ever be garnered from the land. No' other crop which can be planted can equal in value a crop of good timber. I need scarcely remind honorable members that it takes sometimes from 200 to 300 years for some kinds of timber to reach perfection.  The  honorable member for- Parramatta quoted from a. book, which I held in my hand while he was speaking, .to show how the output of Queensland timber has decreased. That is to be explained by the absence of railway accommodation into the parts of the country where the forests are most dense. I may quote with advantage from <inline font-style="italic">Mulhall,</inline> a statistical ' authority, highly regarded by all economists. He mentions the plantations made  by three British noblemen - the Duke of Athol, who at Dunkelt planted 28,000,000 trees' on 16,000 acres; the Earl of Seafield, who, at Inverness, planted 60,000,000 trees on 40,000 acres; and Lord Powerscourt, who, at Wicklow, planted 3,000,000 trees on 1,000 acres. It  is estimated that the  last-mentioned nobleman, who planted in 1869 at an outlay of 66s. per acre, will, bv the  year'  19 15,' possess a plantation worth .£50 per 'acre. " We have' to remember that Australia is poor in respect of 'her forests in comparison with some other countries in the world, as honorable members will find on turning to the official year-book of the Commonwealth by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs.</inline> I must, in passing, compliment that gentleman on the splendid way in which he has produced this volume, which is a book of statistics that will be valued wherever statistical information is studied in any part of the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> says, comparing the relative value of forest land in Australia with other countries in the world, that the Australian Commonwealth can claim a total forest area of 167,245 square miles. The United States, however, has a forest area of 1.000,000 square miles, and Canada possesses 1,248,000 square miles of forest. So that it behoves us in Australia to be very careful of our forests. Although a Victorian protectionist, I have never claimed for my State what I was not prepared to concede to every other State in Australia. No honorable member can point at me and say that I have been willing to vote for protection for Victoria without being willing to concede the same to every other State. On page 377 of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs'</inline> volume, the revenue derived b,y the Forestry Departments of the States is shown. New South Wales leads in this respect. In 1900 its revenue from forests was £14,421, and in 1906 this revenue had increased to .£50,937.. The greatest credit must be given to New South Wales in that respect. The revenue in Queensland has increased .from £7,608'. to £14,560 in the same period.' No one can gainsay the potentialities of Queensland forestry. Many honorable members have seen for themselves the splendid timbers growing in that State.  We have fine forests -in other States' also, notably in Tasmania, with her fine fiddle-back blackwood. But, as I said before, our forest possessions have been sadly sacrificed in the past.  I point out that if we. are- to have . a scientific Tariff, we ought tq recommit item 363, paragraphs c and  d,  the duties on which ought to be raised from 2s. to 2s. 6d. to 3s. and 3s. 6d., so as to prevent th&lt;* smaller stuff from coming in. We should as far as possible prevent cut timber from being' imported, and therefore it is my desire to increase the duties on the item 'I have mentioned. To show the importance of some kinds of timber, I may mention that <inline font-style="italic">Le Ptf.it. Journal,</inline> which has a circulation of 1,500,000 copies per day -the largest circulation of any newspaper in the world - is said to eat up a pine forest every year ; the paper upon which the journal is printed being manufactured from wood pulp. I may make another allusion from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs'</inline> volume, page  382.  The imports of dressed timber from Norway, in  1906,  amounted to  43,712,732  superficial feet, of a value of  £273,546.  Of undressed timber, which would give our workmen a chance of obtaining employment, we imported from Norway, in the same year, only  1,284,969  superficial feet, of a value of  £6,987.  We therefore imported  £273,000  worth in a prepared state, as against  £6,900  worth in an unprepared state. No honorable' member will say that the Australian workman is not able to do the work of preparing that timber. If we had had a scientific Tariff, we should have made it almost impossible for dressed timber to come into the Commonwealth, while making undressed timber absolutely free. That has been allowed only in regard to logs. From the United States, the other great timber exporting country, we received, in  1906, £19,982  worth of dressed timber, and of undressed timber  £549,534  worth. That shows the advantage that it must have been to have had all that quantity of undressed timber coming from the United States prepared in our midst. My vote will be given with the honorable member for Wide Bay. I trust that will be an answer to some of those who have been pointing the finger at Victorian members and saying that they were not consistent in their votes for protection. I do not know a single protectionist in the Labour corner who has not been consistent in his votes on every item in the Tariff. If any honorable member cares to challenge that statement, I will ask him to quote any division where a Victorian Labour protectionist gave a vote for free-trade in any direction whatever. The votes of those honorable members have been straight for protection throughout the length and breadth of the States, taking no cognisance of parochial ideas, and recognising the needs, not of the particular State of which they are representatives, but of the Commonwealth as a whole. </para>

                    <para>. - If I am to judge the feeling of the Committee by the result of the division just taken, it does not appear to be the desire of honorable members to alter in any way their previous decision with respect to these timber duties. I wish, however, to explain in connexion with the Senate'srequest for the insertion of the words " and red beech," that the information given me is that this timber has been imported into the Commonwealth during the past four years. It was first used for making picture and room mouldings, but later it has been imported for the manufacture of furniture, including bent-wood chairs. It does seem to me that there should be a duty on a timber which so directly competes with timbers which we have in the Commonwealth suitable for these purposes. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman would make everything free and injure the country as he did New South Wales for so many years. That State is fifty years behind what she would have been but for his action. It appears that this red beech is coming into keen competition with some of the most beautiful woods that we have in the Commonwealth. If honorable members are protectionists at all they should protect timbers which are largely used for the manufacture of furniture, picture frames, and for like purposes. Not long since I visited in Adelaide probably the finest and most up-to-date furniture manufacturing establishment in the southern hemisphere. I was shown by the owner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Matthias,</inline> an immense quantity of Tasmanian wood which he had imported, and was keeping, in order that it might be seasoned, for the manufacture of the class of furniture to which I have referred. He told me that it was some of the finest timber for the purpose that could be obtained in any part of the world, and that after it was seasoned no other timber could be compared to it for the purposes for which he required it. I think that such timber should be protected in some way. The existing duty is 6d. per 100 superficial feet, and the Senate recommend that it should be increased to1s. If I am to take the result of the last division as an indication of the feeling of the Committee it would seem almost useless to try to secure protection of any kind for Australian timbers. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say anything of the kind, but I do think that honorable members should display some common-sense, and agree to protect timbers suitable for the special purposes to which I have referred. The difficulty of securing suitable timber for the manufacture of butter-boxes does not arise in connexion with the item before the Committee. I am dealing now with timber required for" the manufacture of furniture and picture- frames, and the Tasmanian timber to which I have referred takes as fine a gloss and polish as any timber I have ever seen. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to inform the Committee that the Senate has requested the insertion of the words " and red beech " in this item for a reason which is quite opposed to that which the Minister has stated. This red beech comes from New Zealand, and is undoubtedly avery fine timber. It is the only timber imported that can be used for the manufacture of bent-wood chairs. The reason the Senate desires that it should be specially included in this item is that if it is not so included it will come under another item; where it will carry a heavier duty than1s. per  100  superficial feet. I have that statement from at least half-a-dozen members of the Senate. This red beech comes from New Zealand. The lower the duty we impose upon it, the better another place will be pleased. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking from practical experience. During the last few weeks I have seen stacked up in the factories of Queensland tons of butter for which boxes could not be obtained. In this matter we ought to be fair to both sides. My object is to try to protect, as much as I can, the timber industry of not only Queensland, but Australia generally. I believe that it needs some protection, but when the mill -owners say that they do not want the butter-box trade, and the dairying industry is going to suffer to such an extent, I submit that we should take into consideration the two industries. </para>

It is far superior to Baltic pine and other timbers which are being used for building purposes here, but it will not be taken by the southern States from the mill-owners. I propose to move the deletion of red beech, so that it may fall into paragraph c or d of item  303. </para>

I certainly want to get the highest duty that I can, and therefore I am quite prepared to adopt the suggestion of the honorable member and to disagree with the alteration of the wording of the item.

                        <para>- But honorable members have gone back on a number of things in regard to which there were agreements. To my mind, it' is reasonable to reduce the duty on door stocks from 2s. 6d. to 2s., to allow those in the joinery business to get their raw material more cheaply. Of course, if honorable members have made up their minds, it is useless for me to make a speech on the subject; but I hope that the Committee will make the requested amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that the Committee will not agree to this request. Tasmania's position in this House is neither apologetic nor defensive.  Her  representatives have on every occasion assisted -the manufacturers of Victoria and New South Wales to secure a high Tariff against the outside world, even at the expense of their own State, and yet, when they ask the Committee to stand by a duty that will enable the mill-owners of Tasmania to secure the investment of more capital in their industries, so that they may carry large stocks and thus have an opportunity to season their timber, they find that most of the protectionist representatives of Victoria and New South Wales are prepared to accept only that' which suits themselves. We find them combining against the interests of the small State of Tasmania. We have in that State blackwood, redgum, peppermint, ironbark, fiddleback,  and tallow-wood - we have timbers that have been described by experts in all parts of the world as superior to any grown in the rest of the Southern Hemisphere. The honorable member for Kooyong will admit that Tasmania furnishes timber for the Mount Lyell mine superior to any that Queensland can produce. </para>

                        <para>- Some honorable members are prepared 'to cling to anything that suits their own interests. Talk about statesmen who are going to build up a new nation ! Heaven help the nation that has to- depend on such men as the honorable member for Fremantle,  who talks only for his own interests. It is time we brought a missionary here to preach salvation to such honorable members. I do not wish to say unkind things, for I recognise that the polish has not yet left the Pagan. Each generation simply tells the tale of its civilization, and many honorable members who came here as protectionists are, so to speak, not yet civilized. There is a day of judgment coming for them. This is an item of serious interest to Tasmania, the gem of the Southern Hemisphere, which entered the Union without asking for any favours at the expense of the other States. She said to the people of the rest of the Commonwealth, " Take freely of all that our land and our waters can give," and yet we find honorable members not prepared to support a duty that will enable those engaged in the great timber industry of that State to secure capital to extend their interests. Financiers in Australia will not help this class of men, and are not likely to do so until my national bank scheme is in operation. They will help only those who have the Universe behind them. Many years ago, I should have been crushed in this country but for the honorable member for Balaclava. I was a stranger in a  strange land, and he was a Christian. Having had that experience, I can fully sympathize with small men engaged in saw-milling, who have to fight great combines outside Australia, consisting in  many  cases of men who are directors of banks, and are able to utilize the people's money in their enterprises. Such combines ship to Australia thousands and thousands of feet of timber to glut the local market and crush out the small man in the industry here. I appeal to honorable members not to agree to this request. </para>

The Treasurer proposes that this request be not made, and I wish to ask him whether he is prepared to stand by the whole of the timber duties, as -passed by this House. If he is, we can save a great deal of debate, and arrive at practically the same result. </para>

I think that they are entitled to quite as much consideration as are the persons upon whose behalf the honorable member for Darwin made such an eloquent appeal. </para>

                    <para>.- I am inclined to think that the Treasurer has made up his mind in respect to this item in the absence of special information as to the reasons prompting the request of the Senate in respect of door stocks. The position of those engaged in the door trade is that, while the duty upon doors has not been increased, the duty upon the raw material of which they are manufactured has been increased. Consequently, instead of the protection which has been afforded proving a benefit to the Australian workmen, it is operating in the other direction. If the Treasurer really desires to protect this class, I think that he should give the Committee his view upon the matter in the light of the statement which I have just made. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Treasurer will also recollect that the duty which he proposes upon timber re- presents a tax of from 6d. to 8d. per door, and that the door manufacturers already enjoy a protection of 7s. 6d. per door. If it be right to protect the joiner in the .workshop, it is equally right to protect the timber-getter, who was referred to by the honorable member for Darwin. I believe in protecting the bush worker equally with the city artisan. I should like to ask the Treasurer, who is to follow this timber with a view to seeing that it is used only for door stocks ? </para>

                    <para>.- If the motion moved by the Treasurer be agreed to, it will mean that elm hubs with metal bands will be free, while those without metal bands will be charged is. each ; in other words, the article on which the greatest amount of work has been expended will be admitted free, while that which has been subjected to the smallest amount of work will be made dutiable. It may be that there is some patent hub metal band which some importers desire should come in without being subject to duty ; but, in the absence of any information on the point, this seems to be a most left-handed kind of protection, and if a division is taken on this question, I shall vote against the proposal of the Minister. </para>

                    <para>.- The Committee apparently is not in a temper to debate the matter, but I am of opinion that the Senate has interpreted the Tariff in a better sense than did the Committee on a previous occasion. I state, as a matter of fact, that in Queensland it has always been a trade custom, when timber was dressed, to charge any portion of one inch as an inch. </para>

                        <para>- That is a misleading statement. The Treasurer under the duress of numbers has agreed to the largest sizes coming in at the smallest possible duty. Now it has been proposed that the work upon this timber should be performed in the cheap labour countries. That is a mistake from my point of view. </para>

                        <para>- It is a very small increase, and not nearly enough. Although the debate has ranged round softwoods, in my opinion, sooner or later the most important timber trade of Australia will be in respect of hardwoods and the value of that timber will ultimately be enormous. The cutting of it will be a very important industry. It cannot be denied that a certain amount of labour will be performed in the countries from which this timber comes. The people who do that labour do not do it for their health's sake. It is done abroad because that labour is cheaper. </para>

                        <para>- That may or may not be the case. I hope that it will not be long before the Australian workman will be paid as much as the New Zealand workman in the timber trade. A country which produces more wealth per head than New Zealand does can surely afford to pay as high wages as are paid in New Zealand. The honorable member for North Sydney has given the best' reason for insisting on the measurement being included in the Tariff. I venture to say that we shall not have heard the last of the timber duties to-night. The settlement of this question will not be determined by the vote about to be given. This will be one of the first' items of the Tariff to be attacked. What we are about to do will lead to a reopening of the Tariff at the earliest possible date. I believe that Parliament has made a. mistake. . Honorable members seem determined to maintain that mistake, and, of course, numbers being all powerful, it is futile to resist the inevitable. </para>

                    <para>.- This note refers to paragraph s of item 303. I should like to see some note inserted to define the term " super face," but perhaps the Committee are not aware that the Customs Department are charging duty on all the dressed surfaces of the timber, and in this way the duty is increased in some instances to two or three times more than it was the intention of the Committee to charge. On a board like the one I hold in my hand, for instance, the Department measure the planed edges as well as the two planed sides. It was the intention of this Committee that a board like this, which is one foot square, should pay duty on one square foot. The amount now being charged by the Department on that board is1¼d. It was the intention of the Committee that the duty on it should be about½d. The rate in paragraph s is 2s. 6d. per 100 super face, but under the departmental reading of the term "super face," the duty runs to about 6s. per 100 super feet. The Department say that the duty is not on the timber, but on the dressing. </para>

If the Committee think that 5s. per 100 super, face is  a reasonable duty on dressed timber, I am quite prepared to vote with them, but I am not willing to vote for putting upon the work of the Committee an interpretation that the Committee never intended it to bear.

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Moreton seems to have a grievance because duty is charged upon both sides of the dressed timber. I ask him to remember, as a good protectionist, that it is the desire of the majority of the Committee to protect the workmen of -Australia against competition from outside. If a duty is to be imposed in respect only of the dressing of timber on one side, the honorable member for Moreton must see that we shall be only half protecting Australian workmen. Is it not a fact that any one who wishes to use timber dressed on both sides, must pay for the work of dressing it on both sides ? If the honorable member were a worker in timber, would 'he agree that those to whom he supplied timber dressed on both sides should pay for the dressing of it only on one side? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Corangamite has shocked my nervous system by his statement that a board can be planed on both sides in Melbourne. If this work can be done in Melbourne, that is the best argument that could be advanced for the imposition of the duty, and if it is true that this work can be done in Melbourne, I am satisfied that the duty will be carried. The honorable member for Moreton said that the people interested in the export of butter are waiting for the timber in Queensland to grow, that they mav use it for the manufacture of Butter-boxes, but I venture to say that if he will give Queensland saw-millers an order for butter-box timber to-morrow, they will be able to execute it with despatch. If he wants timber for the manufacture of butter-boxes, the honorable member can get it if he is willing to pay a fair price for it. If, as a manager of a butter factory, he received timber for butter-boxes dressed on one side only, I have no doubt that he would send it back quick and lively at the saw-miller's expense. Those who wish to import timber, planed on both sides, should be willing to pay. a duty to cover the dressing of the timber. </para>

                    <para>.-I think it only fair that I should reply first of all to the insinuation of the Treasurer, when he said that I spoke only in the interests of those who require timber for the manufacture of butter-boxes. A great deal of the argument that has been used on the other side, has been merely theoretical. As a matter of fact, we do not get dressed timber for butter boxes. There is not a foot of dressed timber imported for that purpose. I exhibited the board in my hand this evening, because it was a foot square. I tried to impress upon the Committee that its intention was not being carried out by charging one foot of timber as two feet. With reference to the remarks of the honorable members for Laanecoorie and Maranoa, those honorable members asked me if I would accept a board dressed on one side only as a dressed board. This note refers to timber dressed, or partly dressed.' Therefore, if a board is imported with only one surface dressed, it comes under the definition. I intend to press my amendment, and if the Committee decide that both sides of a board should when dressed be charged duty, I shall be prepared to accept its decision. But I object to the Department putting a wrong interpretation upon bur intention. </para>
