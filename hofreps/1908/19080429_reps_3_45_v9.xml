                        <para>- I let the Prime Minister know last night that I should to-day ask him a question with regard to the purchase by the Government of an article which appeared in the first issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Lone Hand</inline> magazine. I ask now what was the price paid for that article, what steps the Government took to insure the purchase of the best article obtainable from the press of Australia, and when the arrangements for its purchase were made? </para>

                        <para>- It slipped my memory until a few minutes ago, that the honorable member intended to ask the question. I have had to obtain the information by telephone. Speaking from memory, the purchase was made about the beginning of  1907,  the conditions being that we were to be supplied with copies of the article before it was published, and to pay  , &#163;120  for  10,000  copies and all the plates&#39;. These copies were circulated throughout . the Mother Country, and, as press cuttings show, gained a great deal of notice. The figures, diagrams, and pictures which were given, illustrated the great resources of the Commonwealth more vividly than any other publication with which I am acquainted. </para>

                    <para>.- Various speakers last evening stated that cotton goods are not, and cannot, be made here; but I am now in a position to say that they can be, and are, made here. When theTariff was first introduced some sixteen machines were imported for the purpose of making cotton stockings. Several hundreds of pairs were made, and, at present, one. firm has 2,000 lbs. of cotton yarn waiting to make up into these goods. Last year we imported 56, 000 worth of them. They are made to-day in Victoria under conditions which are not to be&#39; excelled in any part of the world. </para>

Since the Tariff Commission sat, the industry has been started. I am surprised at the honorable member for Melbourne saying that we cannot make goods as well as the Germans can. I am prepared to produce three samples this afternoon, and I will undertake that the honorable member for Melbourne cannot distinguish the Australian-made from&#39; the German article. </para>

I am surprised at honorable members who represent the cause of protection, stating that we cannot make cotton stockings here. It is absurd to say that the most progressive people in the world are not equal to such a small detail as the making of their own stockings. I. hold in my hand an Australian stocking, made under conditions insured by Victorian factory legislation, under which a girl of seventeen years of age can earn 24s. a week at the work. This other stocking was made under conditions where there is no restriction of the hours of labour, and where a girl gets only 7s. a week. Is that the kind of stocking that members of the Opposition want us to import into Australia? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member would not go to the source to which I went to get the information. . He stands aside and says, &#34;  I  shall not be convinced unless I see it for myself.&#34; The honorable member can see for himself to-morrow morning what the source of my information is. He can see the girls working the machines; and the conditions of their employment. If we can produce the article here at the same price for the poor people of this country, we should do so. One honorable member opposite claimed that he was standing up as the representative of the masses of the people, but does he represent the masses, when he is prepared to allow the sweated goods of other countries to come here to&#39; enter into competition with the products of our own labour? If these stockings can be made here&#39; under fair conditions, and be retailed at the same price as the imported - 6d. per pair - why should not the local manufacturers have the protection proposed ? Why should we not give employment to hundreds of people in this industry ? I appeal to all protectionists, and particularly to the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, to vote for the duty. That honorable member was under a misapprehension yesterday. Like several others, he was not aware that these stockings were being made here, and that the work will give employment to thousands of. people. The paper which I hold in my hind isa part of the industry. Two tons of it are ordered at a &#34;time, to wrap the stockings in. The boxes I have here are also produced under Australian conditions, &#39; so that all round the industry gives employment to thousands of people. </para>

                        <para>- This is, I think, a most cruel imposition. It will be remembered that we had a long and animated debate on this item, and that, . Out of consideration for the feelings, to say nothing of the pockets, of several honorable members who felt that they were personally interested, the good nature of honorable members prevailed, even over (heir protective proclivities in many instances, and the duty was reduced from 30 to 20 per cent. But now the Senate has made a request to re-cast the item, and to impose different duties. Honorable members ought not to be called upon to give a vote unless they know what switches are. The. Treasurer ought to state why they should be subjected to a duty of 5s. each, or 20 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> whichever returns the higher duty. So far as I know, a switch is a bunch of hair unattached to the head but superimposed on the cranium to give the effect of abundance where abundance is not, and thus - to&#39; artificially increase the natural adornment of a woman. It is one of those contrivances to which ladies have recourse to enhance their charms, and set off their headdress in a more artistic way. It is really a tax on art. We ought to encourage the free introduction of everything which makes&#39; for aestheticism, and appeal&#39;s to the artistic sense, and, therefore I think that a very strong objection ought to be made to  the motion of the Treasurer to subject the ladies of Australia to this unnecessary tax. </para>

                    <para>-i should like to know what test marks are in existence in the Mother Country in connexion with double-barrelled guns and rifles. The suggestion is that we should make these duties applicable to guns bearing the British or other approved test mark. Is there a British test mark? </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to know what is meant by the words &#34; or other approved test mark.&#34; For instance, a lot of Belgian double-barrelled and single barrelled guns are imported into the Commonwealth, and they are very good weapons indeed. There are other guns and rifles imported from Germany, Sweden, and America. Under this proposal, we are asked to grant the Customs authorities power to say that these weapons shall not be imported unless they bear a test mark approved in their country of origin. It seems to me that that is altogether too wide a power to confer upon the Customs authorities. </para>

                    <para>. - Those words mean a test  mark equivalent to the mark used by the British Gunmakers&#39; Association. It may be the mark of the Gunmakers&#39; Association in some other country. This proposal confers power upon that association - if it possesses the approval of the Government - to place a mark upon these guns and rifles, which is considered to be sufficient. It will permit of some mark other than the British test mark being placed upon these weapons - a mark which can be approved. </para>

                        <para>- But in the Tariff as it vent from this House to the Senate we were satisfied to allow dealers in guns to continue their- business as they had been doing it. To make a sudden alteration in the conditions would be to do an injustice to those who are obeying the law. I have no personal interest in the matter; I merely desire to see justice done. When the Treasurer considers the point, he will, I think, see that it is reasonable to provide that the new conditions shall not apply until the1st October. </para>

                    <para>.- I am sorry that an interjection of mine, which was simply a repetition of an argument used by the honorable member for North Sydney, should have upset him. The honorable member was speaking in regard to the request of another place, and he said that we were taking advantage of people whose goods were on the water by imposing a condition with which they could not comply. Such a construction cannot be placed upon the proposition before us. I confess that I should like to see guns which are not properly marked absolutely prohibited. I do not even approve of the&#163;5 duty. My opinion is not based upon fiscal principle, but is induced by my own experience of an imported gun which caused a very serious accident. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I was referring to the notorious Abrahams case which cost those concerned an enormous amount of money, from which I am afraid they got very little satisfaction. We should have here a means of testing unstamped guns now on the water, so that if they can pass an approved test they will be admitted at the ordinary rate. We can, of course, save a lot of. money by accepting what is a well-known and recognised test mark in other parts of the world, but I think that my suggestion would meet with &#39; the approval of the honorable member for North Sydney, and that such tests would be a. guarantee to the public that inferior guns could not be sold under the conditions I described a few moments ago. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is all very well that honorable members should be anxious to protect the. public in this matter, but I am inclined to think that we are asked to go to an unnecessary extreme. This proposal means a prohibition against the introduction of the cheaper class of guns, such as are used by orchardists for discharging blank cartridges with the object of ridding their gardens of sparrows and other bird pests. There is a good deal of faddism indulged in with respect to this approved test mark question. Many gun accidents have certainly occurred, but most of them, I am inclined to think, have been due more to the inexperience or carelessness of the man behind the gun than to faulty barrels. We ought not to overlook the fact that many people are obtaining a living by fruit-growing, and that they are&#39; being&#39; constantly retarded in. their operations by the adoption of all sorts of fads. A cheap gun is quite as good as a gun costing <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5or&#163;7</inline> for the discharge of blank&#39; cartridges, and many orchardists buy a cheap one solely for that purpose. Why  should they be compelled to use expensive guns? The adoption of this proposal will mean that orchardists must either allow their fruit to be destroyed by birds or purchase an expensive gun. Another point worthy of consideration is that we are asked to rely upon tests over which we have no control. The British test may be constantly used in the interests of special gunmakers in the Old Country. If we are to have a test, by all means let it be made under our own supervision, so that the prohibition of  inferior guns will be absolutely within our own control. We should not provide that guns, in order to come in under the lower rate, shall bear a mark showing that they have passed a test fixed anywhere outside Australia. If we are to insist upon a test, let it be made locally. </para>

                    <para>. - The suggestion that we should have a local test appeals to me, since its adoption would mean that an imported gun offered for sale in Australia had. passed a satisfactory test. The honorable member for Boothby has mentioned that orchardists use a cheap class of guns for the discharge of blank cartridges, and we know that accidents often occur through such guns being charged with ball or shot cartridges. If the Minister were prepared to provide that guns not bearing an approved test mark should be tested in Australia; he would meet the wish of the Committee and gain the approval of the public. The honorable member for North Sydney has suggested that guns now on the water should be excluded from this provision, but as its object is to protect life and limb, I do not think that we ought to adopt that proposition. Our desire is to secure the importation of barrels that are not likely to burst. It is true that orchardists use cheap gun&#39;s for discharging blank cartridges to frighten birds that attack their crops. </para>

                        <para>-Cheap guns purchased for that purpose sometimes pass into the hands of men who charge them with cartridges for duck shooting and so forth, with the result that they explode. Then there is the pea rifle, which I dare say has caused more loss of human life than did the naval battle at Manila. Accidents occur from the use of these rifles because, being light, they are put into the hands of children, and are used for firing . ball cartridge. They are not the rifles referred to by the honorable member for Boothby, who desires the importation of full-sized rifles with gas-pipe barrels to be used for discharging blank cartridges to frighten birds. </para>

                        <para>-  I could not accept the amendment in the form suggested. It would make it doubtful whether those exporting the rifles would be compelled to have them tested before exportation. I have no objection to accept the amendment if its application is limited to the period up to October next. To make it of general application would, I think, be unwise. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DUGALD</inline> THOMSON.- I do not see how it could be considered unwise.&#39; Naturally rifles would not be sent out on speculation in the hope that they would pass the test here. Those exporting them would see that they were tested before they were shipped, so that they might not have to bear the expense of having them returned. </para>

                    <para>- Are we to understand that, after deliberation, the Government are prepared to permit the alteration of their Tariff to the extent proposed by the Senate&#39;s request? This matter was fully considered in this House when the Tariff was first before us, and various rates of  5s.  6d.,  5s.9d.,  and  2s.  6d. were agreed to. Are we now to be taught our business by the Senate? It is ridiculous to suggest that we should impose a duty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> each on these articles. Surely members of the public . can be trusted in purchasing a gun to ask for some reference as to the quality of the article they propose to buy ? In my opinion, the way in which time has been wasted in this national Parliament in dealing with the Tariff is something disgraceful. If some man would use a Winchester rifle in the Senate he might do good work in the interests of the community. </para>

                    <para>. - The proposal of the Minister to make the amendment requested by the Senate again draws attention to the differentiation made in the Tariff between various industries for the carrying on of which machinery .is essential. Ministers seem to have made up their minds that agricultural, horticultural, and viticultural machinery should not bear duties higher than 20 and 15 per cent. ; but they have* imposed duties pf 30 and 25 per cent, on mining machinery, although for the successful conduct of mining it is necessary to buy some machinery in a wider market than that of the Commonwealth. In my judgment, either the duties on mining machinery should .be reduced, or those on other machinery should be increased. It is now proposed to reduce the duty on cane unloaders and cane harvesters, machines used in the sugar industry, to the maintenance of which the people of Australia already contribute largely. I do not say that there is no justification for assisting the sugar industry ; . I merely point out that, while- other industries are assisted by bonuses, and by a low duty on necessities, the mining industry is heavily taxed.- The Ministry ought to show some strong justification for this proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - As a matter of fact, the highest machinery duties are 25 and 20 per cent., but those rates are imposed only in two instances, most of the machinery coming under the Tariff being dutiable at 15 and 10 per cent., though there is also a 12 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent, rate and, in connexion with electrical  appliances, a 5 per cent. rate.

                        <para>- The highest duties imposed on any machinery are 25 and 20 per&#62; cent. It is a remarkable thing that the duties on hats and caps, &#39; and apparel and attire, range from 40 to 120 per cent., and yet the local makers of machinery have to be content with duties of 15, 12J, and 10 per cent. The object of the Minister is to make road-making ploughs dutiable at 20 per cent. As there is a scramble to secure protection for industries, I do not see why I should not get what I can for the engineering industry. Of all manufacturers, those connected with engineering have most to grumble at in connexion with the Tariff. Even rigid free-traders- must admit that they have not been too well treated. In regard to many items, duties of 15 and 10 per cent, are spoken of as revenue duties. The leader, of the Opposition referred to road-making ploughs as tools used by municipal bodies. As these machines are used, not by private individuals who are dependent on them for their livelihood, but by municipal bodies, large contracting firms, and the Governments, of the States, the im,porters can afford to pay duty on them. If I were a protectionist, I should begin by protecting the iron industry and subsidiary industries, and I am sorry that the Senate ha* not shown an inclination to increase duties for that purpose. I cannot now move for higher rates, and, therefore, shall support the motion. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not know why the duty on such useful machines as road-making&#39; ploughs should be increased. Th.ey are practically horse road machines, since they are used on the roads, and drawn by horses. I do not appreciate the argument that, because they are used chiefly by municipal bodies, they should be heavily taxed. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; because whatever duties are imposed will have to be paid by the unfortunate men on the land. These ploughs are used chiefly by shire councils,1 to make roads for the carrying on of traffic from farm to farm, or from farm to station, and to tax them is to tax the primary producers. Another, evidence of the loose manner in which the Tariff has been framed is to be found in the fact that road-making ploughs are classed as agricultural implements, whereas, of course, they are not used for agricultural purposes. </para>

                    <para>.- It would be more convenient to deal with the requested amendments separately. I have  something to say with regard to new paragraph  b.  I desire the Committee to accept the Senate&#39;s request to make the hand-pieces of sheep-shearing machines free, whatever may be done with regard to paragraph  a.  I am authorized to say that this amendment meets the views of all the parties interested. There is a firm in Australia making the flexible shafting, and some of the other parts. . Those will come under the head of machinery, and be subject to duty, but the Senate&#39;s request is to put the hand pieces on the free list. The hand pieces are very important to the largest industry in Australia. A shearer&#39;s earning capacity depends entirely on the quality of the machine he handles. The men cannot and will not use an inferior machine. If any machine made, in  Australia  is not a good one for doing the work, the men cannot use it. This part of the machine is not being made in Australia yet. One particular class of machine which is now being used somewhat is made in America; but the favorite machine, the Wolseley, is made in England. That is the one that the men generally ask for. This matter is of the greatest importance to the pastoral industry. There is no reason why the employers should be taxed; but I am not putting the case from their stand-point. A duty on the hand pieces is purely a revenue duty, and increases the cost of the article. The machine turned out by one maker has been installed somewhat largely, but even this year the men practically went on strike, and absolutely refused to use it. The quality of the machines is one of the big troubles in the shearing industry. &#39; The contractor who had the shearing of that station in Queensland had to send, out a box of the Wolseley machine hand pieces before the men would start work. So far there has not been made in Australia a machine that meets the requirements. Until it is made here, it is useless to impose a duty. There are a great number of articles affecting the farming industry in paragraph  a,  which the Senate desires us to place upon the free list, and which I think might very well be made free. There may be some difference of opinion about those. Some honorable members may desire them to bear a duty., and still favour putting cream separators and the hand pieces of shearing machines on the free list, and therefore it would be well to divide the question. The combs and cutters are not involved in this proposal. They are already on the free list elsewhere, while the other portions of the&#39; machine now made in Australia come under the heading of machinery and have a measure of protection. I hope the Government will accept the requested amendment in paragraph  b.  I was very anxious previously to have hand pieces exempted, and I think they were made dutiable by mistake. </para>

                        <para>- But there was first of all an impression that the Sydney firm were making the complete machine. I have heard that they propose to do so, but the fact remains that they have not done so. If the machine is made here, it must be one that can do the work or the men will not use it, because they must have a good quality of machine to enable them to earn their money. They &#34;will have the imported article in this case, even though it costs more. Under present circumstances the imposition of a duty of 10 per cent. on the hand pieces is simply a tax on the industry. </para>

                    <para>The hand-pieces of shearing machines &#39;being of such delicate mechanism, the quality of the material and of the workmanship must be of the very highest standard to insure practical efficiency. The present condition of efficiency has only been reached by the experience of manufacturers and workmen over a period of many years, and it would require a similarly lengthy experience and painstaking for locally-made machines to be of practical value, and to command the confidence of the workers. The latter is a most important point, for inferior machines mean harder and slower work for the shearer, who gets .paid according to the number of sheep he shears. </para>

                    <para>.- Although honorable members who have spoken so far have dealt only with paragraph b, I strongly support the Senate&#39;s request to make a new paragraph a, and place the articles included in it upon the free list. A large number of those articles are just as much the tools of trade of the farmer as shearing machines are the tools of trade of the shearer. We have put on the free list an enormous number of tools of trade for all the town industries. As the schedule left this Chamber we put all the articles in this paragraph on the free list if they come from the Mother Country, and so the only effect of the Senate&#39;s request is to make them free also if they come from other parts of the world. Many of these agricultural machines are specialities in the United States. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has not done much looking out for them. This is a case where the Senate has been, looking after the farmers better than we have. We might fairly accept the  request,  which only enlarges our own free list, in order to give to the farmers the benefits of the best machines iu the world. It is only a question between making them free altogether or free only when they come from the Mother Country. </para>

                        <para>- I believe a large number&#39; of them are. I am not thinking of where they come from, so much as of the interests of the people who have to use them in Australia. The farmers are struggling against all sorts of -natural difficulties, such as drought&#39;s and various pests, in many parts of Australia, and I think that we&#39; might fairly follow the Senate in this matter. With reference to sheep-shearing ma-&#39; chines, I agree with every word which the honorable member for Darling has used. Some time ago I happened to acquire a large knowledge of these machines, and it is a fact that, although they bear a very simple name, they are very complex pieces of machinery. Unless they are of the best quality, the shearers are greatly hampered in their occupation, and the work is not done so well for the employers. I wish to give the shearers the benefit of the best machines which they can- get, and, there-, fore, I cordially, support the proposal of the honorable member. </para>

                    <para>.- It is rather peculiar that in the case of the articles included .&#39;in paragraph a, a preference of 10 per cent., should be given to British imports, when the average preference has been 5 per cent. This seems to me to be simply a revenue duty. I am quite willing to give a preference of 5 per cent, to the United Kingdom. </para>

                    <para>.-I wish very briefly to repeat the protest which I made when we dealt with this item previously. Obviously, 10 per cent. is only a revenue duty, and it simply falls upon one section of the community - the farming class. With regard to the preference, I think that practically all these articles are made in Canada and the United States. &#39; Most of them are patented, and require special machinery for their production. England makes very few of them, and for that reason a. preference of 10 per cent. would be of no use. To impose a duty of 5 or 10 per cent. is simply to levy a duty upon one section of the community only. </para>

                    <para>.- When we were dealing with items affecting the textile trades, honorable members on the other side shot up like mushrooms in defence of the duties. &#39; The honorable member for New England was amongst those who jumped up on every occasion to plead for protection. It is indeed singular that machinery manufacturers have very few friends here to advance their claims to protection. That satisfies me that machinery manufacturers are not so ravenous as are other manufacturers in Australia, that their lobbying work has been worse done, or that they have fewer advocates here. I believe that if protection is required it is required in the case of machinery items. </para>

                        <para>- We shall see presently whether the articles can be made here. If the honorable member believes in the protection of local industries, surely the machinery trades require as much assistance - if not more - as do many of the trades which have been more than liberally assisted here. In this Tariff the honorable member has already voted for duties of 20 and 15 per cent. to encourage the production of machinery which required the application of motive power, and he was able to say without a blush that it could be made here. But now he asks, Can we make lucerne bunchers, maize harvesters, horse rakes, potato raisers, root cutters and straw stackers? All these are small machinery items. The Committee has, I repeat, voted duties of 20 and 15 per cent. on the most intricate pieces of machinery which can be named, but the honorable member for New England now asks, Can we make a maize binder or a potato raiser? This paragraph embraces articles which if protected would benefit the village blacksmith - that is, the small man in the community. </para>

                        <para>- I did&#39; not vote for the articles .to be made free. I want the Committee to retain the duty of  10  per cent, on foreign imports. When we were dealing with the- textile trades, the Government proposed fixed duties on the cheaper articles, but in this case they do not ask for. a fixed duty. I notice that when honorable members are dealing with items that concern their own districts they are protectionists, but that when an item concerns my district they are free-traders. If other items had been treated fairly well I should not have been found fighting against the Senate&#39;s request in regard to paragraph  a  of this item. </para>

                    <para>. - This paragraph mainly covers the smaller implements which are used in the agricultural, horticultural and viticultural industries. Under the previous Tariff all these articles&#39; were on the free list. In the case of this Tariff the proposal of the Government was to admit them free from the Mother Country and at  10  per cent, from foreign countries, but the Senate desires them to be admitted free from all countries, and thus bring the Tariff into harmony with the previous one. I want honorable members to understand clearly that paragraph  a  includes a large &#39;number of light implements which are used by agriculturists and viticulturists. The implements have to be made of special material, because lightness combined with durability is a very important consideration. In their production special manufacturing operations are required. There can be no hope of the articles being locally produced in the near future, so that, notwithstanding the imposition of a duty, importation must take place in order to supply local wants. Another point to be considered is that very small importations come from the Mother-  land. Most of these implements are imported from America and Canada. When protection is advocated here a heavy duty is asked for, and therefore in this case, the whole object of the Government is to levy a revenue&#39; duty of  10  per  cent. That would mean placing an additional burden upon the agricultural and viticultural community .without conferring . any. advantage &#39;upon &#39; the manufacturing interests&#39; of the Commonwealth&#39;: . &#39;For that reason&#39; T trust&#39; that the Commit! ee- will- recognise the wisdom of agreeing to. the request of the S&#38;n3,t </para>

                    <para>.- Whilst I should like to see the articles enumerated in this paragraph  placed upon the free list, I think that the farmers are to be congratulated upon the fact that this Committee has imposed a duty of only  10  per cent, upon them. One of the features of this Tariff is that everything used by the producers of Australia is taxed by- considerably  more  than  10  per cent. Those engaged in our primary industries therefore have reason to congratulate themselves, because some of the articles enumerated in this item- may be manufactured within the Commonwealth. If the articles specified in this paragraph are imported from the United Kingdom, they will - assuming that the request of the Senate is agreed to - be admitted free, whereas if they are imported from Canada they will be dutiable at  10  per cent. The duty is merely a revenue impost, and under all the circumstances I do hope that the Treasurer will give way, and consent to these articles being placed upon the free list. </para>

                        <para>- My suggestion was prompted by a desire to assist the Government. We all know that the use of cream separators and sheep-shearing machines is confined to two very important  industries. In the dairying industry cream separators play such an important part that the dairyman who is satisfied to adopt old methods cannot hope to successfully compete with the individual who is using up-to-date implements. These implements come largely from the Continent. There are patent rights connected with them which frequently preclude their manufacture in Australia for a. number of years. It is essential that those engaged in the industry should have the advantage of the very latest improvements in machinery. In the matter of sheep-shearing machines, I recollect that the original proposal of the Government was that they should be placed on the free list. At the last moment, however, the Treasurer proposed that a duty should be levied upon them. In one of the rooms attached to this building a sheep-shearing machine was exhibited and a hand piece shown around the chamber which we were led to understand had been manufactured in Sydney, and that&#39; was regarded as a sufficient reason why it should be protected. </para>

The Senate has had the advantage of considering the matter with more detail than honorable members of this. House had. We were taken at a disadvantage, because until the Minister rose the assumption was that the proposal in the schedule would stand, namely, that these lines should be upon the free. list. Honorable members had not time to get information bearing upon the production of these machines. The Senate did not labour under that disadvantage; and while it is a Chamber in which protectionist principles predominate, yet the members, after looking carefully into the question, came to the decision that these machines could not. be reasonably produced in Australia, and therefore decided to place them upon the free list.

If, as there is every reason to believe, they cannot be successfully made here at present, a duty will impose a tax on the primary producer and worker without conferring any benefit on the manufacturing interests. In any case, seeing that the great majority of the shearing sheds have already been fitted with imported machines, duplicate parts thereof for replacement purposes will necessarily have to be of imported make, and their cost will be increased by the duty. </para>
                <para>If it should be found that shearing machines can be made here, they would necessarily cost&#39; much more than the imported article, seeing that the raw material is not producible here, and the increased expense would, of course, have to be borne by the consumer, while, as the number of hands engaged in the manufacture would be comparatively small, there would be very little compensating advantage in the way of extra employment. </para>
                <para>The hand pieces of shearing machines being of most delicate mechanism, the quality of the material and of the workmanship must be of the very highest standard to ensure practical efficiency. The present condition of efficiency has only been reached by the experience of manufacturers&#39; and workmen over a period of many years, and it would require a similar lengthy experience and painstaking for .locally-made machines to be of practical value and to command the confidence of the workers. The latter is a most important point, as inferior machines mean harder and slower work for the shearer,&#39; and, consequently, lower earnings, seeing that he is paid according to the number of sheep he shears. As regards this aspect of the case, I would refer you to the remarks by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> G. Spence  (President of the Shearers organization, the Australian Workers&#39; Union)  when the item was previously before your House, on which occasion&#39; he opposed a duty on the ground that it would militate against the interests of the shearers. (See <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> 6576, et. seq.) </para>
                <para>In submitting the above facts for your consideration, I am directed to express the hope that you will favour the placing of shearing machine hand pieces on the free list. </para>
                <para class="block">Here we have the Pastoralists&#39; Union of New South Wales, through its secretary, making the statements which I have just read ; and the honorable member for Darling, the  president  of the Australian Workers&#39; Union, representing the great body of employes interested in the use of these machines, has also placed before the Committee their position. The only request which the Government have considered comes from the one firm of MoffatVirtue. The firm have placed&#39; upon the market an implement  in &#39; connexion with (which they hold certain patents. Part of their mechanism is manufactured for them in America. But the great pastoral industry uses other machines also. The Wolesley  machine is used largely in New&#39; South Wales; and another machine which is used to a great extent is the one placed upon the market by the firm of  Burgon  and Ball. These firms will be greatly disadvantaged if the Senate&#39;s request is not accepted, because  the parts of their machines are not readily interchangeable with those of Moffat.Virtue. I have received1 a communication from the firm of  Wolesley  and Company on this very matter. They point out that they endeavoured to start manufacturing in the Commonwealth, but found that their raw material and other requirements necessitated the establishment of a factory in England, and they have continued to manufacture there for that reason. All these large firms will be penalized if they have to pay this high duty,&#39; inasmuch as they could not use Moffat-Virtue parts. , Many sheds are already fitted up with the machines manufactured by the  Wolesley  Company and by  Burgon  and Ball, - and they have to keep on hand a supply of duplicate parts to replace broken or worn-out parts of this complicated mechanism. The duty would thus be a heavy penalty, whilst not conferring any considerable advantage upon any large number of working people within  the Commonwealth ; because the number engaged in the manufacture of these machines is very small compared- with the thousands who are using them. I therefore hope that the Committee in its wisdom will see the advantage of not penalizing this industry, and will accept the suggestion of the Senate by placing sheep-shearing machines upon the free list, and thus enable this primary industry to hold its own in competition with the whole- world. </para>

                        <para>- I quite understand the ruling ; but one might easily sup-  pose, as the honorable member for Maranoa and I did, that cream separators were also affected. What I have said with regard to those implements will, &#39; however, apply equally to machinery used in shearing, because the cheaper selectors are able to &#39;buy their shearing machinery, the more land will be put under cultivation for mixed farming. Take the case of a farmer who keeps  a small flock of sheep. He requires to have his sheep-shearing machinery cheap. Small sheep farmers find great difficulty in getting shearers at the proper time of the year, unless there happens to be a fair number of holdings in the district. Shearers will not go- where there is only a very small amount of work for them to do; or, if they go, the owners have to pay higher prices than are paid on large stations, where the work is more considerable, and </para>

                <para>Extends  over a longer period. So that, by enabling&#39; the farmer to get his machinery cheap, we shall facilitate settlement in the back country. We should, therefore, follow the advice of the honorable member for Calare, and adopt the Senate&#39;s request. The small settlers in Australia are innumer-able. Every year additional areas are being taken up by small men,  and  by cheapening the machinery which they must use, we. shall increase the wealth produced by them, and thus benefit the community. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Committee will make the requested amendment. It is only the imported hand parts of sheep-shearing machines which have been found to be quick, and efficient, and in the shearing of sheep expedition is of the utmost value, not merely to sheep owners, but also- to the shearers. I have known it to be necessary, because of the weather, to delay sheep-shearing for weeks, and once this operation is begun, it. is important that it should be finished as soon as possible. - </para>

I have no enthusiasm for mere revenue duties such as. this now proposed by the Government. If an article can be effectively manufactured in Australia, a protective duty should be placed on importations. </para>

                        <para>- My point is that the Treasurer is not treating us properly. Neither he nor the Minister of Trade and Customs is now present, and the substitute whom they have provided does not know what is in their minds, so that it is almost useless to make representations to him. The bearing of the Minister of Trade and Customs yesterday compares very favorably with that of the Treasurer to-day, being all that could be desired. As a consequence, business was expedited.&#39; But no sooner does the Treasurer return than trouble begins. </para>

No one knows better than you do, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> what rapid strides have been made with machine shearing in -western Queensland. There are few sheds nowadays in which the shearing is done by hand. Yet the Treasurer wishes to impose a duty of 10 per cent. on machinery necessary for the carrying on of our chief primary industry. As a pastoralist, he must know the effect of the duty. If the honorary Minister now in charge of Government business were to agree, in the absence of the Treasurer, to make the amendment requested by the Senate, he would obtain a name for himself which he will not have another chance to gain. </para>

All connected with the pastoral industry would pronounce the honorable gentleman to be the only sensible man in the Ministry I feel sure that the Committee will make the amendment requested by the Senate. Our wool has to be sold in the markets of the world against the keenest competition of producers elsewhere, and protectionists, who, no doubt, sympathize with us, will not be sacrificing any principle if they go further and vote for the Senate&#39;s proposal. </para>

                    <para>.- Under the previous Tariff, the definition of shearing machines adopted by the Customs Department, included the flexible tubing and bevelled friction-gearing, leaving the shafting to be included as general machinery. A change in the definition was made, but subsequently the original definition was reverted to. When the Sydney firm referred to started the manufacture of the flexible tubing and overhead gearing referred to in the Senate&#39;s requested amendment, with the object of carrying out the Government policy, I used my influence to have the matter dealt with in the way proposed by the Senate, in order that the duties might be imposed on the flexible tubings and overhead gearing, leaving the hand-pieces to be admitted duty free. These parts of the shearing machine have really been successfully manufactured only by the Wolseley Company. They have developed their machine after long years of experience of its working. They have acted upon reports of shearers and pastoralists; they use only the very best steel, and have succeeded better than other manufacturers of shearing machines in avoiding the great heat which arises from the rapid movement of the parts. The shearing machines turned out by other manufacturers do the cutting all right, but the hand-pieces become so hot as to&#39; blister the workmen&#39;s hands. As the result of a recent award in the Federal Arbitration Court, the employers are now required to provide &#39;their shearers with efficient machinery. In some cases recently stated, men complained that they could not work with the machines with which they were supplied. As a consequence, a number of shearers provided their own machines ; but as they cost&#163;3, it is unreasonable that workmen should be asked to supply such a tool of trade. The decision of the Court requiring the employer to provide efficient machinery, has had the effect of throwing out of use machines of inferior&#39; make. The makers of shearing machines other than the Wolseley Company, have tried for years to develop and improve their machines, but they have found that it is not so easy to make any material improvement. It is clear that protectionists are unable to contend that this is an article which can be made satisfactorily in Australia. We know that one firm in Sheffield has practically a monopoly of the manufacture of hand shears. They are made by men who, in succeeding generations, have been specially trained in their manufacture, and understand exactly the tempering of the steel- required. Even in the United States, manufacturers have not succeeded in making hand shears that can compete with the Sheffield shears. Shearing machines are now displacing hand -shears to a very great extent, and even settlers engaged in the pastoral industry on a small scale are getting their shearing done by machine shears. All these considerations make this a very important matter for the pastoral industry. I have been surprised at the opposition of the Government, because I am in a position to say that all parties interested in the matter are satisfied with the amendment requested by the Senate. Under it, the firm that is manufacturing the parts of the machine proposed to . be made dutiable, will receive sufficient protection, and at the same time, those engaged in trite pastoral industry will be able to obtain more cheaply than they otherwise would, the: shearing machines which they must buy. Whether we impose a duty on the hand-pieces of shearing machines or not, the Wolseley machines will be imported and purchased, as so far no other machine has been  invented that is a satisfactory substitute for it. .It should not be forgotten that the Wolseley Company have protected their manufacture by patents. Moffat- Virtue, and the representatives of Wolseley Company, are satisfied with the requested amendment, and the Government would do well to accept it. </para>

                    <para>.- I am very pleased that the Senate has submitted this request. I was glad to hear, the explanation of the matter given by the honorable member for Darling. No one in Australia is more competent to speak on this subject. As the honorable member has pointed out, it is of the very greatest importance to pastoralists to be able to. obtain the best possible shearing machinery. If any of the machinery used. in a shearing shed breaks down, it must be sent, a long distance to be repaired, and this leads to very inconvenient delay. Shearing, unlike other work, cannot possibly be delayed. It must be done in fine weather. If it is delayed beyond a certain time, as one honorable member pointed out, grass seeds are apt to get into the wool. Shearers look for employment in a- number of sheds in succession, and if, by a break in the weather, they are delayed in one district, they may be too late to secure employment in another. Many small farmers are now co-operating in this matter. They bring all their sheep to one shed and have them shorn by machinery. They are deeply interested in consequence, in avoiding any delay in the work of shearing. The&#39; honorable member for Angas pointed out that the Pastoralists&#39; Association o&#39;f South Australia is in favour of the amendment requested by the Senate. It will not be denied that the members of that association take a keen interest in the business, and we may assume that they are prepared in .this matter to recommend what is right, and what would be in the interests of pastoralists and shearers alike. </para>

                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Ministers in refusing to accept an amendment the fate of which is perfectly obvious. The amendment requested by the Senate on this item is absolutely in line with the principles of the Tariff as sub,mitted by Ministers themselves. I refer honorable members to item 167, under which machine tools, as prescribed by departmental by-laws, are admitted free. Under item 169, tools of - trade used by artisans and mechanics, and tools in general use, as prescribed by departmental by-laws, are also admitted free. Under these two items thousands of tools of trade used in town industries are admitted free of duty. Why should -the shearers of Australia be singled out for specifically unfavorable treatment in this way ? The shearing machine is a tool of their trade, and it should not be forgotten that they are able to use it only for a limited period in each year, whilst the artisan engaged in a town industry is able to use his tools of trade all the year&#39; round. As the honorable member for Barker has said, if the state of the weather interferes with the work of shearing at a&#39; man&#39;s first shed, it is very likely that he will find himself thrown out of his second shed, and he may have only four or five weeks&#39; work at shearing in the .year. It came under my notice in the cases I have referred to that frequently a shearer may have to travel over 100 miles to his first: shed and then should rain set in find himself thrown out, of a chance of employment at a second shed. -That is an acknowledged risk in the shearing . industry. I admit that in Queensland the shearing season extends over a longer . period than in New. South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- The interests of the industry are of vital importance to the shearer,, and there are thousands of men who follow the industry of shearing in Australia. Although, as the result of some recent arrangement, the employer may be required to provide shearing machines, I know that shearers used at one time provide their own shears. On principle, I do not see why a manufacturer should be able to obtain the tools of trade required by his workmen free of duty, though they can carry on their work all the year round,  whilst  a pastoralist who is required to provide tools of trade that are used only a few weeks in each year should be singled out for special taxation. In my opinion that is against the principles of the Tariff. I am sure that no man has a greater sympathy with the country industries than has the Minister of Trade and Customs, and I appeal to him now to accept the requested amendment and do a good action -at the same time. </para>

The honorable member for East Sydney referred to the number of tools of trade on the free list ; but the honorable gentleman might also have stated that the general community is very heavily taxed in respect of the productions of the industries in which these tools of trade are employed, whilst there is no way in which we can give assistance to the pastoral industry by imposition of protective duties upon its products. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I can speak on this matter as a shearer, although in my time shearing was principally done by hand. Machine shears were not very, largely used, and were not a very great success. The reason for . this has been pointed out by the honorable member for Darling, and it arose from the difficulty of keeping the hand-pieces of the shearing machines cool. . 1 think there ought to be no hesitation about the acceptance of the requested&#39; amendment. There is no question of the imposition of a protective duty in this case. When the driving gear is protected, we should allow the hand-pieces, which cannot be made in Australia, to be admitted free of duty. </para>

                    <para>. - When I addressed the Committee in the first instance, the list had been sent to the Government Printer, because I had promised to circulate it with the other lists; and I never touched them afterwards. In regard to this particular item, I said, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report, that this was a case in which there might be some variation; but that duties of 15 and 10 per cent. were suggested by the Senate. The present duties are 20 per cent. and 15 per cent., and those duties the Government desire should be continued. Under the Tariff of 1902, cutlery, if plated, was 20 per cent, and, otherwise, 15 per cent. ; so that if the Senate&#39;s request be granted, the Tariff will be considerably lower than the first Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- No; experience has shown the reverse. I cannot see that the Government would be justified, under any circumstances, in reducing the duty 5 per cent. below that of 1902. When I first addressed the Committee in reference to the requests, I felt that it would be unwise and unfair to have such a reduction and, therefore, I made the reservation to which I have already alluded. I intend to stand by the item as it left the House of Representatives. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer, I understand, is merely claiming the right to &#34; change his. mind &#34; ; and I think we all have a certain sympathy with him, because, if we had his mind, we should wish to change it as soon as possible. The long explanation which the Treasurer made when introducing the requests, and the qualification he then thought fit to impose, do not really touch the question before us, because, since then, these lists have been issued. Why did the Treasurer not include this request in the list of those to be accepted? </para>

                        <para>- That is the suggestion which I was about to make; because it is quite evident that honorable members are not prepared for the change of attitude on the part of the Government. If the Treasurer desires to have any reputation for straightness and fair-going, he will consent to the postponement of this item, because the list that was issued was undoubtedly regarded as a true reflex of the Ministerial intentions. </para>

                        <para>- Then this Ministerial &#34;change of mind &#34; is not isolated? This seems to me a most extraordinary way of bringing about increases in the duties. If the Treasurer will not stand by the bargain, as circularized, which he made with the. House to accept the request, he ought to postpone its consideration so as to give honorable members some notice of his change of intentions. </para>

                    <para>.- I trust that the Treasurer will stand by his proposal to reject the request that the duties in respect of this item be reduced to 15 per cent. and 10 per cent. As a protectionist I object to mere revenue duties being imposed in respect of such an item as this. I express no opinion on the question of whether or not the Minister should have given notice of his determination to resist this request, but I distinctly remember a statement made by him, when outlining the intentions of the Government, that &#39;there were some requests in respect of which he had not made up&#39; his mind. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that this request will be rejected. It would be a farce to impose a duty of 10 per cent. on an item including such articles as plated cutlery and manicure sets. Surely if it is reasonable to expect those who use woollen socks to pay a duty upon them for the sake of protecting a local industry, it is fair that those who use plated cutlery and manicure sets should be required to pay the duties which we have imposed upon them. </para>

In this case we find that the Senate has requested the insertion of words bringing within the item certain machinery and engines which were not included in it as the Bill left this House.I say nothing on the question whether the requested amendment would be advantageous or not ; my point is that the Senate has no power to. request an addition to an item bringing under it lines which were not included in it as passed by this House. My opinion is that another place has exceeded its powers in requesting the House to make this addition to the item. </para>

                    <para>- It is not for me to say whether the Senate was or was not in order in making this requested amendment. The words which we are asked to add to. the item may have appeared in some other item in the schedule as passed by this House, and so far as I know the request may involve a reduction and not an increase of duty. It would therefore be most difficult for me to give a ruling. In the circumstances, I can only accept the requested amendment as it comes to us from the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- A very desirable re-arrangement of the machinery items was made at the suggestion of the Treasurer when the schedule was first considered, in order to separate electrical from ordinary machinery. Apparently, the Senate&#39;s request gives these machines a more accurate trade description, and puts them in a better situation in the schedule. As the Tariff left this Chamber, we included &#34; Generators for direct coupling to steam turbines &#34;in item 177. </para>

                        <para>- Then the Treasurer, with the aid of his officers, should explain to the Committee the real effect of the request. Will it destroy the separate classification of electrical and ordinary machinery? Unfortunately, we get no explanation at all from the Minister. Of course, he cannot be expected to carry all this detailed information in his head, but he has the assistance of his officers, who are there to guide and help him, and the Committee certainly requires assistance from some authority in order to understand why these changes are made, and how they affect the arrangement of the schedule as a whole. If they destroy the admirable re-arrangement of these machinery items, we should be told so. </para>

                    <para>.- It is interesting to receive that information from the Treasurer ; but I understand now that the Senate makes this proposal in order to make sure that these machines will come under a nominal duty in the general Tariff, and be free from Great Britain. The Treasurer proposes to disagree with the request, but he has made no effort to reply to the arguments previously advanced in this House for giving this kind of machinery preferential treatment, or to the arguments which led the Senate to make the request. I do not say that the Minister is not in possession of some facts that might justify him in seeking to obtain a higher duty, but it is certainly due to the Committee, before we agree to his motion, to receive some information from him as to the reason which actuates him. </para>

I hope that the Minister will accept the Senate&#39;s request in the interests of the mining industry of Australia, because, while some mines pay large dividends, the great bulk of them are struggling between shutting up or going on. There are thousands of men employed in mining, and a very arduous, dangerous, and uncertain occupation it is. Machinery of this kind is very similar in the case of mining to the tools of trade that artisans in the town get free. The amendment cannot involve a large amount of revenue. </para>

                        <para>- In regard to this Tariff the Minister has adopted towards the mining ventures of Western Australia an attitude not altogether in keeping with his usual custom of considering industries. It does not matter to me where the proposal came from. This Committee has already deliberately included in this item flue-heated economizers, mechanical stokers, steam traps, and steam turbines, because it was demonstrated beyond doubt that they were not being made in the Commonwealth, and that there was no reasonable prospect of them being made here for a considerable time. The Senate, acting on additional information, have added to this list &#34; high-speed reciprocating engines coupled with generators or dynamo electric machines to be used in mines.&#34; I have no objection to the removal of the words &#34;to be used in mines.&#34; According to the information I have obtained, the high-speed engines which are coupled with electric machines and at present in use  throughout  Australia, are not made within the Commonwealth.. That view must have influenced the Senate in making this request. In the case of this highly-technical machinery, which is on a par with the machines already included in the paragraph, the Minister might well agree to the request, in view of the big duty which has already been agreed to upon mining machinery generally. If machines of this description had been removed from the general machinery items and placed on the free list in the first place, I believe that the Treasurer could have secured a higher rate of duty on general machinery when the schedule was before us previously. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that we shall not allow our prejudices against mining companies to influence us in our judgment when dealing with mining machinery. The fact remains that the mining industry in Australia is one of the greatest, and one of the best payers to its employes. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, very often. The expenditure which is required in obtaining information in order to keep pace with the times, particularly in regard to electrical development, is so great that none but the most powerful companies could possibly engage in the industry. Here is a proposal which I think should commend itself to any reasonable man. Some honorable members say that they cannot vote against it, because that would seem like giving a vote against protection, and an industry which might be. built up hereafter. Very likely the industry will be established in time to come. Let us give a substantial protection to any industry which can supply the necessities of established industries, but do not let us injure a valuable existing industry such as gold mining is to Australia in an endeavour to establish another doubtful industry of much less proportions in the distant future. </para>

As it stands, the paragraph means that when the machinery is electric the -duty is not to apply. </para>

                    <para>.- I should be the last to place any limitations upon the capacity of our Australian manufacturers to produce motive power machinery, because I am well aware that some of the undertakings with which I am associated possess splendid machinery - the very best - which has been made in one or other of the engineering establishments of the various States. In Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland there are firms capable of undertaking very fine work indeed. But I venture to suggest that the reason why our manufacturers cannot turn out high-speed reciprocating engines at a remunerative price is because of. the absence of a sufficient demand for them. That is the whole secret of the matter. . It is a well-known fact that engines of this class cannot be successfully manufactured in the Commonwealth so&#39; far as materials and workmanship are concerned. That is the statement of a very high authority upon the subject. &#39; One of the large firms which manufacture this class of high-speed engine in Birmingham, England, has turned out  3,500  engines, representing a capacity of  650,000  horse-power. It is hardly likely that any Australian manufacturer of this class of engine would be able to compete with &#39;establishments of that size and with their resources, seeing that there &#39;is only a very limited demand for such&#39; engine&#39;s here. </para>

                        <para>- I would rather not give it, although the letter which I hold in my hand is accessible to any honorable member who wishes to peruse it. I submit that the duty of  . 20  per cent. originally proposed in. respect of this item would fall as an extra charge upon the users of this special class of engines. I should have voted for that duty if I thought for a moment that these engines could be successfully turned out here by the firms who from time to time have manufactured high-speed reciprocating engines of a class. But the truth is that they have neither the skilled workmen nor the appliances which would enable them to do it. The Government, therefore, will not inflict any injury upon the local manufacturer by accepting the request of the Senate which undoubtedly received careful consideration at the hands of that Chamber. I note that it is suggested that these engines should be admitted free only when they are to be used in mines. I. should have preferred no such limitation to be imposed, because if they can be successfully manufactured for other purposes there is no reason why they should not be manufactured for &#39;mining enterprises. As a matter of fact; these expensive engines are used only by some of the larger undertakings. The smaller concerns cannot afford to. incur the expenditure involved in their purchase. I respectfully submit that we are justified in accepting this request of. the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- I am rather surprised to find myself in agreement with the Treasurer in this matter. If honorable members look at item  177a,  and item  177b,  in the Tariff, they will find that generators and dynamo electric machines were originally charged duty at  30  per cent, and  171  per cent., according to their capacity. If the language of the Tariff were, left in the form in .which it is in the Senate&#39;s , suggestion, &#39; the benefit of this particular exemption would only apply to this particular class of reciprocating engines, provided they were- actually coupled with generators on importation. I think th&#60;&#62; object of the Committee is to give the benefit of the exemption to this particular class of motive .power, whether, coupled with generators or separate from them ; and I am inclined to &#39;think that the wording of the modification moved&#39; by the Treasurer is more effective for that purpose.- </para>

                        <para>- The shaft is the connexion, but the honorable member will see that the general duty on steam-engines under item 160is 20 per cent. That is the general duty on all motive power machinery. The object of this particular request is to exempt one particular class of motive power machinery, taking it out of the 20 per cent. list, and making it dutiable at) 5 per cent. But that has nothing to do with generators and electrical appliances. It merely means that if you have a rapid reciprocating engine the duty is reduced from 20 to 5 per cent., but that that great advantage will only be given under the Senate&#39;s suggestion as it stands to those engines which are attached to or connected with electrical machines. Now, we want to make the item wider than that. The whole point is that these high-speed reciprocating engines cannot be made in this country effectively, because the demand for them is not sufficiently great. </para>

                        <para>- I consulted with him, and pointed out how complicated the item would be as proposed to be amended by the Senate. All my previous remarks were directed to the difficulty there was in getting high-speed reciprocating engines manufactured in Australia, because of &#39; the limited demand for them. Now the Minister proposes to meet that difficulty, and to give the item a wider application than the Senate proposes. The suggestion is an excellent one, and I trust that it will be accepted. </para>

                    <para>.- I  should like to be quite clear as to whether we could accept the Senate&#39;s request if we wanted to do so. The first part of the item under consideration uses the words &#34; except electric &#34; - namely, except electric machinery and appliances. As we have accepted the words of the item up to a certain point, we have also accepted the fact that the item exempts electric machinery. . So that it could not include a dynamo or an electric machine. It seems to me, therefore, that unless we accept the Minister&#39;s proposal, we cannot agree to what the Senate proposes. </para>

                        <para>- I think not, because the first part of the item excepts electric machinery and appliances. It seems to me, consequently, that we could not include electric machinery and appliances, even if we wished to accept the Senate&#39;s suggestion as it stands. Would it not be better, then, to accept what the Minister suggests, especially as he agrees to leave out the words &#34; to be used in mines &#34; ? It has to be remembered that these engines are used in many other places which are just as important as mines, and in connexion with which it is just as essential that they should be used. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. I do not know of any place in Australia where high-speed engines are made. In fact, they are covered by so many patents that I doubt whether it would pay any one in Australia to make them. I trust that the Committee will accept the Treasurer&#39;s suggestion. </para>

                    <para>. - The request of the Senate is evidently intended as a concession to the mine-owners. The Senate intends both high-speed engines and electric machines to come in free when imported from the United Kingdom; because, if both did not come in free the dynamo would pay either 20 or 12&#189; per cent., according to its size. So that the Minister very shrewdly says, in the modification which he has moved, that these engines may come in on the easier terms for a certain purpose - not that the electrical machinery shall come in on those terms, but that the engines shall come in at 5 per cent. and free when coupled with electrical machinery. These generators and dynamos are dutiable under another item at 20 per cent. and 12&#189; per cent., and the Treasurer is actually opposing the request made by the Senate that that class of electrical machinery when used for mining purposes shall come under this item. I hope that the Minister will agree to the request made by the Senate since it will undoubtedly be a concession to the mining industry. </para>

There seems to be some doubt as to whether reciprocating engines, when coupled with generates or dynamo electric machines, will be subject to one general duty. </para>

I have asked the  Chairman  whether, seeing that we have agreed to a paragraph providing that electric machines and appliances are excepted from this item, it would be in order for us to agree to a requested amendment which would have the effect of bringing electric machinery under it.

                    <para>.- The question raised by the honorable member is not so easy to answer as it seems at first sight to be. The interpretation placed upon these words by the honorable member for Laanecoorie would be right if we were dealing with a Bill&#39; which had not yet been sent to another place ; but we are dealing with requests made by another authority. That authority has a right to make these requests, for there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent it making any request that it pleases. A requested amendment may be thoroughly inconsistent with the context; but the Constitution does not provide that in such circumstances it shall not be taken into consideration. The power to request amendments having been conferred on the Senate, there is no authority in this House, on any rule of construction, to efface a request, although we may reject it. </para>

                        <para>- I contend that if the Senate had requested an amendment which had nothing whatever to do with the item we should be entitled to consider it, leaving it to the Minister in charge of the Bill subsequently to re-arrange the wording so as to bring it under its proper heading. The main question is whether the words which the Senate has requested us to insert could be limited in any way because of the context by any rule of interpretation. I say that they cannot. If we do not like the wording of the requested amendment, we  may modify if or reject it altogether, but the request having been made, it is in the hands of the Committee whether it be relevant or irrelevant. Our difficulty is to understand what this request really means. I am prepared to accept the assurance of the Treasurer that his amended proposal will do everything that the Senate proposed by its requested amendment. If it will, we need waste no further time over its consideration ; had it been made long ago time would have been saved. . I am rather doubtful whether the Treasurer&#39;s proposal will give us what we have in this request ; but as he has pointed out, we occupy a perfectly safe position, because if the Senate quarrels with the modification which he proposes on the ground that it does not embody what it, requested, it will be open to it, on the understanding that we are now making- </para>

                        <para>- I do not want to, but does the Minister think that he is dropping something which is covered by the words of the Senate&#39;s request? Does he think that under his new proposal some machine or appliance will come under a higher duty than it would do if the request were adopted ? If this is a conundrum he can give it up. </para>

The proposal made by the Minister is that high-speed reciprocating engines &#34;. for direct coupling,&#34; not&#34; coupled,&#34; shall be admitted free. The question is whether, if expressed in that way, the item would cover such engines coupled with generators. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that, in the circumstance&#39;s, the Minister will use the words referred to, as we never know what interpretation may be put upon an item&#39; by the Department, It would be absurd to propose that these engines, if intended to be coupled with generators or dynamo-electric machines, should be free, and if actually coupled with such machinery should be dutiable. Under the wording adopted by the Minister, some difficulty might arise through the interpretation which might be given to the item by the Customs Department, or through the view of the matter taken by a Court. I suggest that, to remove all uncertainty on the point, the Minister should use the words which have been referred to - &#34; coupled or for direct coupling. &#34; </para>

In those requests, the Senate ask - that dynamo-electric machines up to the capacity of10-horse power shall be dutiable at 20 per cent., and if over the capacity of 10 horse-power shall be free, instead of being dutiable at 12&#189; per cent. If the Minister does not agree to those requests of the Senate, we should oppose this present proposal. </para>

                        <para>- Then if we knew what modifications the honorable gentleman intended to propose, we should know better what we are asked to do now. We should not accept an amendment which would take an article out of the item at present before the Committee, in which it is dutiable at 5 per cent. and free, if under item. 177 it is to be made dutiable at 20 per cent. or 12&#189; per cent.  The Minister proposes that high-speed reciprocating steam engines for connecting with electrical dynamos shall be free, whilst the dynamos are dealt with under item 177, and may be dutiable at 20. per cent. or 12&#189; per cent. We are somewhat in the dark as to what we should do until the Minister says what he proposes to do with respect to the Senate&#39;s requests Nos. 90 and 91. In the circumstances ; that is, if the Senate&#39;s arguments as mentioned are to be accepted, I am prepared to accept the proposal of the Minister in this case. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see why we should not allow people who purchase these engines to decide for themselves the use to which they will put them. Why should we  tell people that they should use a high-speed reciprocating engine to run a pump? Pumps, are worked by beam engines and without engines at all. They can be run by a belt, directly by steam, or by electricity. I believe that men who require to use these engines for any other purpose axe just as much entitled to obtain them free of duty as are those who require to use them for coupling with a pump or dynamo. I  object to this Parliament telling a man who wants to pump water that he should use a certain class of engine if he wishes to escape the payment of duty. I am prepared, if necessary, to move that the words &#34;coupled or for direct coupling with&#34; be left out. </para>

                    <para>.- I direct the attention of the Committee to a significant recommendation in the Senate&#39;s request: No. 94. . They -have requested the omission of paragraph g of item 177, electrical machines, &#34; Generators for direct coupling to steam turbines.&#34; Reading that request with the words in the requested amendment now under consideration, &#34; coupled with generators or dynamo electric machines,&#34; I think we have a good indication of the intention of the Senate. The steam turbines referred to in the Senate&#39;s request No. 94 are high-speed engines, and there may therefore be something in the contention that the Senate desired that these high-speed reciprocating engines should be dutiable at 5 per cent., and free, whether coupled with generators or dynamo electric machines or not. I feel sure that honorable members, while agreeing with the proposal of the honorable member for Fremantle to leave out  the words &#34;coupled with generators or dynamo electric machines,&#34; in the requested amendment immediately  under consideration, would not be disposed to accept the recommendation contained in the Senate&#39;s request No. 94 to omit generators for direct coupling to steam turbines from item 177. I agree with the honorable member for Fremantle that the wording adopted by the Senate for the item now &#39; under consideration involves a limitation for which no sufficient reason has been advanced. As I ventured to represent in my first remarks in connexion with this request, these engines should be treated on their own merits,, and we should not impose a duty on them, since they cannot be made here at present because of the limited demand for them. I ask the Treasurer <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> compare item 160 with item 177, when he will see that, taken together, they have a significance as indicating the intention of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- We have a very difficult problem to solve, owing to the manner in which this suggested amendment has been submitted; but it is clear that all the Senate can achieve by this request is the admission of high speed engines for a particular purpose, though I have my doubts as to whether that was all that was intended. In my opinion, the proposal of the Minister makes the matter much clearer, while it does not take away from the Committee the right to deal with &#39; the other matter when&#39; we come to the question of electrical appliances and. generators ; indeed, the proposal makes the item wider in relation to pumps. The question raised by the honorable member for North Sydney is whether or not the proposal before us will exempt engines already coupled, and not &#34; for coupling.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - I have carefully studied the debates in the Senate on this item, and I can see no mention of any desire to place electrical machinery under the lower duty. It is not in order to quote the debates in another place, but I may say that a motion was proposed in a much more restricted form, than that sent down to us, and that motion was enlarged until it reached its present form. Any one listening to the discussion here during the last hour must be perfectly satisfied that there is some ambiguity about the definition ; and I think we should adopt the suggestion of the Treasurer, knowing that if it is disagreed with bv the Senate, we shall be asked to alter it. In  reply  to the honorable member for Kooyong, I express the hope that high speed engines generally will not be placed on the same </para>

                    <para>. - The request of the Senate, if adopted, will make the item very much wider than was intended by this Committee originally. I think it was the honorable member for Kalgoorlie who caused the words &#34; patent &#34; to be included ; and there was a long discussion as to the advisability of including the name of the patentee. </para>

                        <para>- But the Senate has deleted the word, and made the item apply to all portable hoists for underground use. This I consider too wide, in view of the fact that portable hoists are made here to a very large extent. . In addition., there is the futility of trying to &#39; determine to what use a piece of machinery is to be put after it has passed through the Customs. </para>

                <para>Because of certain information received when the Tariff was being dealt with by this Committee before, I promised to allow the free introduction of log band saws of a certain size, and, on the 13th December last, pending the consideration of the item in the Senate, and our subsequent consideration of the Senate&#39;s requests,&#39; an instruction was issued to the&#39; effect that duty should riot be charged on these saws. Consequently duty has not been charged on them since that date; but the modification which I have moved is necessary to legalize what has been done. </para>

                        <para>- What has that to do with the question ? When&#39; the honorable gentleman agrees to a thing here, either .he. means to stand to it or he does not. When he makes an agreement here, and his colleague immediately undoes it in the Senate, . we are justified in doubting his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> in making such a proposition here. If it had been wrung out of him after a long wrangle or debate I could understand his action. When the proposal was made bv the honorable member for Wimmera it was instantly accepted by the honorable gentleman, but his colleague in the Senate did not hesitate to undo his work here. That is conduct which I hope will not be repeated .in the history of responsible government. I venture to say that parliamentary history, no matter how far back one may go, will not disclose a similar case. I cannot help criticising it as disgraceful conduct on the part of the Treasurer to play a trick with the Committee in that way. </para>

Does the right honorable gentleman think that because I did not press &#39; for a division I accepted the proposal ? No. I acted as I did, because I had ascertained from the comer what it was going to do. </para>

                        <para>- I had&#39; ascertained beforehand how most honorable members in the corner were going to vote. Of what use would it have been to delay the Committee for hours and hours ? Heaven knows we had had enough talk and delay. On some occasions if ,1 knew that I was go&#39;.ng to lose a dirty I was very glad to let it go without calling for a division. But am I to be brought to task for doing anything of that kind whilst honorable members on) the other side have been trying to destroy the Tariff? I am pleased to be able to say that- they are finding that in Sydney, their beloved freetrade has gone by the board, and that some of them will have a job to get reelected on that question. They realize that they are being shaken up. I am not going to be bound in! any case where I was compelled to agree to a reduction of the duties on an item. </para>

                        <para>- My word is not doubted by any one who appreciates honest intention. It is only doubted by those who measure other people by  their  own standard. In the case of this item I was very anxious to get the duty which I proposed, and it was only under compulsion and to save time that I did not press for a division. On more than one occasion a large number of protectionist members blamed me&#34; for not forcing a proposed duty to a division. There are some honorable members sitting here now who blamed me because I did. not&#34; stand by the Tariff as introduced on every occasion. It would have been only wasting time to do so if &#39; I knew that I was going to be beaten. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members who are accustomed to the methods of the Treasurer will not be surprised at him seeking to cover up his tracks in an avalanche of bluff. He has not touched the subject at- issue. He made a definite arrangement, and he tries to excuse himself for going back upon it by saying that at the time it was made he did not intend to go back upon it. He is in the position of the man who said that he would be virtuous if he were not tempted. He has been tempted, and has fallen, and now he is trying to cover up his tracks in an avalanche of bluff. </para>

                        <para>- When we refused to admit &#39;.&#39; blowers, n.e.i.,&#39; &#39; free, I had some doubt as to whether they could be produced in the Commonwealth. Now, however, I have abundant proof that &#34;blowers, n.e.i.,&#34; can be produced here even if they take the form of Ministers of the Crown. </para>

                    <para>._I have no hesitation in saying that the Treasurer has deliberately gone back upon the com-. promise which was arrived at in this Chamber when this item was previously  under  consideration. As a matter of fact, quite a number of duties were agreed to at 5 per cent, and 10 per cent, higher than would have been the case, but for the action of the Treasurer and the Government Whip in going around the House and arranging compromises. Honorable members who were present when the 1902 Tariff was- under consideration cannot fail to be struck by the contrast between the action of the Treasurer, who is in- charge of this Tariff, and the conduct of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner and the right honorable member for Adelaide, who had charge of the old Tariff, and who hon.orably respected the arrangements arrived at in Committee. For the Treasurer to go back upon compromises made in this Chamber when the Tariff was formerly under  consideration here is not creditable to him. When I noticed that his colleague in another place was time after time deliberately moving to restore the duties originally proposed in this House I was astonished. There is not the slightest doubt that in respect of this particular item a compromise was arrived at. If we had&#39; a Minister in . charge of the Tariff like the right honorable&#39; member for Adelaide or <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, every one of these compromises would have been loyally observed. But it seems to me that in order to obtain increased duties the Treasurer will stop at nothing. Have we not seen Ministers endeavouring to&#39; pull honorable members across the Chamber in order to gain their support ? Is there any dignity attaching to such a proceeding ? From the very first it seemed to me that the Treasurer  was prepared &#39;to grasp anything - that he was willing to put aside all his honorable undertakings - in order to obtain increased duties. I should not have risen but for the position which he has taken up.. Simply because an attack has been made by honorable members upon the other side of the House he says that no arrangement was arrived at in respect of this item. I say  deliberately that a compromise was arranged and that it is his duty - seeing that the request of the Senate would violate that compromise - to reject it. I shall support the original arrangement arrived at in this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that &#39; the leader &#39;of the Opposition in the Senate invariably respected the arrangements made in this Chamber. In departing from the compromise arrived at on the item under consideration the Treasurer has taken a very unhappy course. That compromise was not one which was forced upon him. The official record shows that the honorable gentleman is under a strange delusion in reference to this matter, because the arrangement was first&#39; suggested- by the honorable member for &#34; Wimmera, who holds the same fiscal faith as do the Government. It was not pressed by the honorable member in any extreme way, and the Treasurer himself,&#39; without any pressure and without debate- </para>

When the Treasurer representing the Government makes a statement of that sort in a deliberative assembly- when he says- that he is willing to accept duties of -25 and 20 per cent., he: is speaking . not merely for himself but- for the whole of the Ministry. </para>

                        <para>- But surely a code of honour is hot varied in a- given number of weeks. The statement of the Treasurer applied to &#39; this Tariff. That statement I am willing to accept. It did not mean, &#34; I am willing te- accept the arrangement on Monday, and go behind it on Tuesday.&#34; That is not the way in which Ministerial statements are to be read. .1 do not for a moment suggest that the&#34; Treasurer went to Ministers in the Senate, and asked ,them to make this alteration. I do not suggest that at all. But I do say that the Treasurer should have instructed, his colleagues in the Senate to honour an arrangement made by the Government in this chamber. There is no .sort of solidity or sanctity in any arrangement made if; this chamber if it is to be ignored and varied, and the&#34; Minister himself is to get up here and act in direct contradiction to his own compact.  </para>

I do not wish to import any heat into this debate at all. I&#39; know why the .Treasurer is indignant.  His  own con: science is tearing at him. That is what is making him &#39;so- miserable. He feels that he -is. not acting up to the high standard that . invariably actuates him - on rare occasions. . He feels annoyed with himself ; he feels disgusted with himself ; and I think that he might even  now . repent and come back to his original understanding honorably made in this chamber. Whilst We ought to receive suggestions from the Senate, and&#39; accept them when we think they are right- &#39; </para>

                        <para>- It is really a pity, I think, apart from this matter altogether, that the Government, as represented by the Treasurer, should come to an arrangement in this chamber, and that his colleagues somewhere else should set to work to vary that understanding. The Treasurer, perhaps, was not responsible for that personally, but he makes himself directly responsible for that act of his colleagues in now doing the very tiling that Ministers did in the other chamber. The Minister might say : &#39; &#39; My colleague, acting on his&#39; own discretion in the Senate, made this proposal.  I was not told of it, and did not tell him what our arrangement here was, but now I will keep faith with this Chamber, and stand by the arrangement made here.&#34; That would be a proper course to take. I do not &#39; want to import any heat into this <inline font-style="italic">matter at</inline> all, but if understandings are arrived at, they should bind both sides ; and in this case the Treasurer must admit that he did volunteer an agreement. </para>

                        <para>- Of course; but when you say, &#34;We are willing to accept 25 and 20,&#34; and when we trust the Government on that assurance, accept the arrangement, and bring the debate to a conclusion, I say that the Government are bound by it. Whatever our fiscal views are, it is a matter of agreement then, not a matter of fiscal policy. There should not be any jesuitical reservation about an honorable agreement. The Government should not append, as a sort of postscript, &#34; We are agreeing to this thing with the intention of <inline font-style="italic">throwing</inline> it over if we get a show some other time.&#34; Because if the Treasurer had said, this arrangement having been made, &#34;Do not believe me; do not rely upon my word; I am going to break my promise at the earliest opportunity,&#34; even my honorable friends in the Ministerial corner would have gone for a Royal Commission at once to inquire into the actions of the Government. If the Treasurer had said, &#34;I will not agree to duties of 25 and 20 per cent., and if you carry them we will go out of office &#34;- no, I do not mean that, but, &#34; We will adjourn the House for a week and bring the Governor-General down from Mount Kosciusco &#34; ; if he had said that, the position would be different. Ministers might have taken up that attitude. But when the  Treasurer  says, &#34;I&#34; - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, the man who never was doubted in the lightest word he said - &#34; am willing to accept duties of . 25 and 20 per cent.,&#34; I have a right to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne to honour his own bond, and perform his own agreement in the presence of the men with whom he made it. That is a simple appeal. I make that appeal in regard to the action of an honorable member, as to whom there has never been even &#39; the slightest suspicion of a failure to perform an honorable obligation. </para>

It is only by experience that we can thoroughly anil fairly gauge the effect of a Tariff. &#34;When we first dealt with the Commonwealth Tariff in 1902, a great deal of what we did was necessarily guess work. But in constructing the present Tariff, we have to be guided by the experience gained in the meantime. We have also the experience of nearly twelve months under the new Tariff. We are therefore able to  see  how the duties  on this particular item are affecting those whom we desire to assist. </para>

                        <para>- I can assure the leader of the Opposition, with regard to this item, which is one of the most important in the whole Tariff, that there are strong complaints from a number of industries which have&#39; not received the assistance to which they are entitled. &#34; Manufactures of Metals &#34; is an item which affects a large number of industries. In other cases we have been dealing with one industry at a time. Under this heading, we are compelled to deal with a large and important group of industries. There is first the bedstead manufacturing industry. It is not a Victorian industry only. In the mother State of New South Wales it is assuming very large proportions, and is gradually capturing the trade of the continent. Then there is the  fireproof  safemaking  industry, and the sheet metal industry, which employs an enormous number of men in its various branches. The tinware trade also employs a large- number. I point out that in Victoria, under our Wages Board system, for certain classes of tinware, the employes are actually receiving more in wages than the imported article costs. I would specially appeal to honorable members in the Opposition corner to remember that under the Wages Board system in operation in Victoria men are paid more for making tinware, and a number of other manufactures of metal, extending over a very wide range,, than is actually charged for such articles when imported. </para>

                        <para>- So long as the importer keeps up prices, the local &#39; manufacturer working on a small scale is able to make a living, but as &#39;soon as he is squeezed by the importer resorting to dumping, the  position is different. The japanning and galvanizing trade, and many others, are also covered by trie item relating to manu- &#34;factures of metal. All these industries are worth cultivating. We desire to have our own iron and steel .industries, and surely we ought to be prepared to assist those who invest their capital in enterprises with the object of supplying Australia with all that she requires in respect of these manufactures ? </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer has been subjected to a fairly severe roasting, and it is not my duty .to apply any glycerine. Honorable members of the Opposition appear to be troubled because some compromise made when this item was originally under consideration in this House has been disregarded. If a robust fight had been made against the attempt of the Senate to increase taxation I should have been glad to take part in it, and to have assisted in roasting not only the Treasurer but the Ministry for permitting the Senate to usurp powers  of taxation. I should like to see the -leaders of the different parties in this House put up a strong fight on that question. On less important matters an appeal has been made to the country by States Governments. </para>

                        <para>- It was only as the result of a compromise that the Convention agreed to the insertion in the Constitution of the provision that the Senate should have the power to make requests. We ought to be careful to reserve to this House the power to impose taxation, and the time will come when the Government of the day. will have to take up a strong stand on that question. Coming to the requested amendment I do nor hesitate to say that if other industries had been refused similar increases I should probably have been found voting against this request. Requested increases of duties relating to &#34;the manufacture of blankets, hats, caps and other branches of .the textile industry have been agreed to, but a request that a duty relating to what I have described as the black trades - the engineering and iron foundry trades - is singled out for different treatment.  There&#39; are thousands of persons engaged in industries to which this item relates, as against dozens employed in industries which at the suggestion of the Senate were granted special treatment yesterday. Industries which have received this special treatment have been for the most part peculiar to the southern States. This item, however, relates to an industry in which New South Wales is interested. I recognise that it is not statesmanlike to dead with questions of this kind from a provincial stand-point; but I have seen honorable members over and over again supporting a proposal because it was advantageous to an industry in their own electorate or State, and I have come to the conclusion that in the circumstances I ought to do the same. This item has an important bearing on men engaged in various manufacturing industries in the State of which I am a representative, who certainly ought to be granted the assistance of the additional 5 per cent, duty proposed. Manufactures of metal include stoves, safes, grates, and1 other articles which are essentially the work of the moulder, for whom no one has yet had a word to say.&#39; I should expect protectionists to be prepared to extend the most favorable treatment to the moulding industry. </para>

                        <para>- I was &#39;satisfied with the proposed duties of 25 and 20 per cent., as the Tariff left this Chamber.,&#39; but since that time a good deal of water has passed, under the bridge,&#39; and when, at the request of the Senate, .the Committee has agreed to increase the duties proposed for the protection of those engaged in - other industries, I am not prepared to sit here like an innocent Willy, and refuse to do anything to assist the foundry industry. When I find honorable members prepared to vote for <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties as high as 120&#39; per cent, for the protection of hat and cap manufacturers, I am not going to baulk at such a hurdle&#39; as an increase of 5 per. cent, for the protection of an industry in which many of my constituents are employed. With the Treasurer&#39;s observance of a compact in the matter, I am not concerned. The honorable gentleman&#39;s sins in that respect -must be on his own head. The proposal now made is one which affects people employed in industries carried .on in my electorate, and I am prepared to take advantage of it. I admit that two years ago on the election platform I made use  &#39;Of  an- ugly expression, and said that if there were any loot to be had I would see that my constituents got their share of it, and I asked them to give me a free hand in these matters in view of my past experience of the way they  i  were treated. I have less objection to increased duties to-day than- I had three1 or four years ago in view of the introduction  of  the policy of the new protection. This is a new star which has arisen in the Commonwealth firmament. </para>

                        <para>- I hope it will be an Australian star of the first magnitude.&#39; If it is effective, it will certainly overcome many of the objections that I, in common with others, have to a protectionist . policy.  1  always looked upon protection as intended *o tax the many for the benefit of the few. If I&#39; thought that by supporting the proposal to increase these duties by  5  per cent. I should be assisting to take money from the pockets of people who require to purchase stoves, grates, fire heaters, and such articles i&#39;i order to put it into the pockets of the owners , of factories, I should not support it: . But if, under the policy of new protection, the workers in the factories are to benefit by the increased duties in the payment of - higher wages, and the improvement of the conditions under which they are asked to work, a . very great deal of my objection to the imposition of a protective duty will have been met. </para>

                    - I mean no disrespect to the right honorable gentleman in speaking of him in the way I have done, because, in my opinion, it is a compliment to a public man to be known as I say the honorable gentleman has been known. Throughout the consideration of the Tariff I have fought to secure the imposition of the lowest possible .duties on the necessaries of life, but, finding that increased duties have been proposed time after time for the assistance of other industries, I am. prepared to avail myself of this opportunity to .afford the foundry workers some increased assistance.. I should like, at the same time, to say that if in connexion with this, request we were asked to decide whether this House . or the Senate should rule in such matters, I should consider an additional  5  per cent, for the benefit even of foundry workers to be too great a price to .pay for admitting the right of the Senate to increase the burdens of taxation. In my opinion, it is monstrous to contend that the representatives of South Australia, Western Australia, &#39; and Tasmania should have the same power in regard to taxation as the representatives of Victoria and&#39; New South Wales. As we have already&#39; accepted amendments involving  increases of duty at the request of the Senate, I intend to support the Minister in- accepting the. Senate&#39;s requested amendment in this item.

                    <para>. - I should like &#39;to remind -the honorable member for Dalley that,, although at the present time the three&#39; States to which he has referred may not have a population equal to the population of Victoria and New South Wales, their potentialities are such that it is impossible for any one to say whether in. the future&#39; they will&#39; not have teeming millions of population in excess of the population of Victoria and New South Wales. Judging by the death rate, Queensland possesses the finest climate of any of the. States, and we may  look forward to a time when the population of that State will exceed the population of New South Wales or of Victoria. I intend to vote for the amendment requested by the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- The words &#34;compact &#34; and &#34; compromise &#34; appear to be the only words which honorable members opposite can utter. We have heard of nothing but compromise from the shriek of the honorable member for Parramatta to the dulcet Oxford accents of the honorable member for Wentworth. &#34;Compromise&#34; is nothing but &#39;the sacrifice of principle, and I am sick of hearing the word. The friends of honorable members opposite, in the Senate, did all they could to reduce duties. Where they were successful in carrying requests for reductions of duties, we heard no howling of the word &#34; compromise,&#34; and no shrieking of the word by the honorable member for Parramatta in tones so bitter that one might think the honorable member had been . sucking a Seville orange. This conduct on the part of the acting leader of the Opposition is. getting very sickening; and it would be well if he followed the splendid example of his leader in the way of genial courtesy. In another place, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> moved that the duty in the first column should be reduced to  20  per cent. </para>

The question then arises how we are to obtain revenue; and there is no way except by direct taxation. Does the honorable member for Lang agree in that view.? The </para>

                        <para>- But the leader of the Opposition may make a mistake; and in his experience of legal and political life, he must have regarded some compromises with contempt. The question is really one of the interests of the workers ; and the honorable member for Dalley alluded to moulders and ironworkers generally, who, in my opinion, have hardly been dealt with fairly in the matter of factory legislation. We all know that when Solomon was going to give a prize to the calling which had done most good, and, when he drew aside the curtain of his throne, he found there an iron worker. When he asked the iron worker why he had taken that place, the latter replied, &#34; Do I not make tools for the worker to reap the . harvest and build houses and temples? &#34; Then Solomon, in his wisdom, gave the iron worker the pride of place; and certainly those connected with the iron industry follow the hardest, and, perhaps, one of the most unhealthy of callings. I am sorry that the Senate has increased these duties by 5 per cent. instead of by.  20  per cent. Compromise is merely sacrifice of principle, and if there is one party which has tried to avoid compromises it is that to which I belong. </para>

                    <para>.- The argument of the leader of the Opposition seemed to me sophistical. It was that of the professional pleader.. He seemed to  seek to take advantage of the situation. But no matter how syren-like his speeches may be, the Committee is not to be. deceived into believing that the Minister has broken a pledge. I do not share the antipathy of the honorable member for Melbourne to compromises; but they should be resorted to only when neither of two contending parties can get what it wants. That was the position in regard to this item. The Minister did not renounce the intention to get the duties increased later on, if that should be possible. </para>

                <para class="block">He had to compromise at the time, for fear of getting still lower duties. But in making&#39; such a compromise, a man cannot be justly accused of abandoning his principles, nor is it right to say that he must forego all future opportunities to gain his ends. The charge made by the leader of the Opposition against the Treasurer was not just. In any case, what was done by the Minister does npt bind the Committee. The Committee would not be bound even had the Minister promised the leader of the Opposition to make no future attempt to increase the duties. </para>

                        <para>- It is immaterial who moved for it ; what we are concerned with is that the request was agreed to by a majority of senators, and that it is for us to say whether the requested amendments shall or shall not be made. In my opinion, the duties should be raised. I have all along opposed duties which were ostensibly&#39; only revenue producing. </para>

                        <para>- I shall always vote for duties which I think likely to be mainly protective in their incidence ; but I have - never voted for duties which I thought likely to be merely revenue producing. Any duty is likely at first to produce some revenue, but when a duty is protective, that result is only &#39; temporary Seeing that Australia offers such a large field for the manufacture of metals, there is every justification for increasing these duties. Owing to the better market provided, Local competition has already become keener, and this _ has regulated prices. I have sufficient belief in democracy to think that the people will always see that they are not unjustly charged, and the  Legislature can better prevent impositions on the part of local manufacturers than it can control the operations of manufacturers abroad. I am prepared to give every encouragement to industries which  have a fair prospect of thriving here, more especially, as the Minister is pledged to give the Parliament the right to&#39; control conditions for manufacture, even if it should. be necessary to seek an - amendment of the Constitution to secure that right. If that promise is not kept,&#39; I shall be the implacable enemy of the Government ; but I hope that it will be kept. The Senate&#39;s request will have my support. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member said what he had to say, and I shall do the same. Under the 1902 Tariff the duty was only 20 per cent., which was the rate against importations from Great Britain in this Tariff as it went&#39; to the Senate. That body has requested an increase of 5 per cent, on the rates to which we agreed. That is not a large -increase. I am&#34; given to understand that last year something like ^10,000 worth of gas stoves were imported. Every one of those stoves could be made here. </para>

                        <para>- We are legislating, not for things as they are, but for things as we expect them to be in the future. The right honorable member knows that the new protection does not apply to-day, but he says he intends to see that it applies in the future. If we are to make these articles we must have sufficient protection. Honorable members opposite say that 10 or 15 per cent, is only a revenue duty, and have challenged honorable members on this side for voting for such duties. They have asked us whether 10 or 15 per cent, is protection. We say it is not protection. </para>

                    <para>. - W.e have heard a good deal about compromises, but are they to be made only between members of this House, or are we to make some of them with another place? I understand, that before we get the Tariff through we shall have to come to some compromises with that body. The Minister has already compromised to a considerable extent. If he and his supporters accept so many requests without question, it is only fair that another place should give way to us on some other items. I want as high a duty on these manufactures of metal as I can get, and I agree with the honorable member for Batman that even this duty suggested by the Senate will not give all the protection that the industry warrants. It has a great many ramifications and will afford employment in a thousand directions to all classes of tradesmen. </para>

We are dealing now, not with the production of the raw iron, but with its conversion into the manufactured article.

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Laanecoorie has, I regret to say, stated a fact in such a way as to mislead the Committee.

                        <para>- Order ! Honorable members will see that if. I allow this discussion of what took place in the Senate to continue, there can be no finality. I am afraid that I was rather lax in allowing the honorable member for Parramatta to make the statement originally. It has been replied to, and Ithinkit is only fair that this discussion should now be. dropped. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman is resorting to his usual bluff. It would take a great deal of bluff to cover up his position. &#39; There has never been a more disgraceful exhibition than he has given to this Committee in connexion with this item. The honorable member for Laanecoorie had better study the report of the proceedings elsewhere a little more before he brings up the matter again in this Chamber. </para>
