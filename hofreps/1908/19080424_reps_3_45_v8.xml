                        <para>The gentleman whose case had been cited came to the Melbourne University as a single subject man in 1905. He had never matriculated, had never passed the University&#39;s examinations in English, Latin, &#38;c. - subjects that were postulated in the matter of medical training ; and whatever work he did in Melbourne could count for nothing in their University. He had been just eighteen months at the Melbourne University, and none of the work he had done would count at tie University for the medical degree. After that eighteen months&#39; course he proceeded to America, and returned in July, 1907, with the degree of M.D., Boston. (Laughter.) The total from the beginning in Melbourne was two years and less than six . months, and yet the Medical Board had no option but to register him. </para>

If such gloves are not made here, I shall not vote for the imposition of a high revenue duty upon them. </para>

                    <para>.- This is a very fair revenue item. The honorable member for Newcastle is squeamish about taxing what he describes as the gloves of the poor, but when the item of blankets was under consideration the same feeling was not manifested, although blankets are of far more importance than are gloves to the poorer classes. </para>

I am pleased that the Treasurer is resisting the abolition of the duty requested by another place - which must be a swell House - having in view the fact that, while it favours the abolition of the duty on these gloves, it is prepared to put a heavy duty on blankets. </para>

                    <para>. - I fail to follow the honorable member&#39;s contention that this is a legitimate item for a high revenue duty. He holds that it is reasonable to impose duties of . 30 per cent, and 20 per cent, on harvesting, driving, housemaids&#39;, and gardening gloves, whilst dress gloves are dutiable at 15 per cent, and 10 per cent. The honorable member holds that it is reasonable to impose lower duties on gloves worn purely for ornamental purposes. </para>

I could take honorable members to a factory within fifteen minutes&#39; journey of this House, where they are being&#39; made, and since the manufacturers have to use certain imported leather in respect of which a duty is levied, I do not think it would be reasonable to allow the finished article to come in free. </para>

It is the desire of the Department that we should insert after the word &#34; materials &#34; the words &#34; not coming within item 326&#34;. Item 326 covers &#34;fancygoods,&#34; and the object of that suggested amendment is to exclude from this item cricketing and other sporting gloves. </para>

In the circumstances, it is not unreasonable to ask persons who can afford to wear decent gloves to pay a fair duty on them. </para>

                    <para>.- This item left the House of Representatives as a specific duty - one of the few in the Tariff - and it is now returned with an alternative duty. The feeling right through the debate in this Chamber was against composite duties, and during the consideration of the first Tariff, the evils of such duties were distinctly shown, and they were abandoned, even after a strong. appeal made by the then Minister of Customs. Apparently, the intention of the Senate is to tax the cheapest articles the most heavily in the interests, I suppose, of one particular factory, or several factories in Australia. But if we treat the hat making industry in this way, why not treat all industries similarly, seeing that every industry produces cheap articles? I am strongly against any such step; because I regard such duties as a distinct levy on those who can least afford to pay high prices. The duty of 16s. per. dozen means a tax of 150 per cent, on some of the cheaper hats; and if the public, who purchase these articles, were aware of that fact, they would lose much of their enthusiasm; on behalf of this industry. </para>

                        <para>- I  withdraw any reflection which my words may appear to cast upon the  Chairman.  There is no doubt, however, that the item, as it left this House, imposed a specific duty of 16s. per dozen; and all the Senate has done is to suggest an alternative duty. In my opinion the words &#34;16s. per dozen,&#34; which appear in the Senate&#39;s request, are a printer&#39;s error. If the Senate had not suggested an alternative duty, this item would not have been before us ; and no one knows that better than does the honorable member for Flinders. </para>

                        <para>- I admit it was, perhaps, through a little energy which I put into the question, knowing, as I did, the unfair tactics adopted by importers in buying up the end-of-the-season goods made in the Northern Hemisphere, and shipping them over here in time to catch the opening of the season. The competition which the Australian manufacturers have had to face has been decidedly unfair. </para>

It was decided to impose a fixed duty, mainly on account of the position that the industry was put into through the hat trade being a season trade. The shapes and fashions this year will not prevail next year,, and, therefore, the manufacturers in Great Britain are glad to dispose of their stock at less than it cost. them to make. It was to cope with that unfair competition that the fixed duty was agreed to. &#39; I know that stock is dumped here at less than it costs to make. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Yarra always speaks with very great authority&#39;; but he certainly makes statements at times, and has made one this morning, which may have a great effect, upon honorable members&#39; votes, but which are not correct. .1 stand now in, front of a gentleman who knows something- of the hat trade, and I say, in his presence, that there* is no such thing as buying up the end of a season&#39;s stock of the particular class of hat with which we are now dealing. They are never out of date ; they do not lose their value ; and the shapes hardly alter. The common hat- to which these rates refer is now almost prohibited from importation, and all those people who wear felt hats are thrown back upon whatever class of article the. Denton mills happen to prefer to make. I refer to the Denton mills with all respect, because, notwithstanding the higher rates of duty now operative, they have not found it necessary to make any, addition to their prices. </para>

                        <para>- It shows that the effort which was made to bolster those mills up by &#39;giving them an increased rate of duty on felt hats was quite unnecessary. On the hat known as the bowler, which is worn . by a very large&#39; number of people, and manufactured in England, possibly, at&#39; from 8s. to 10s. per dozen, a fixed duty of 16s. reaches the 150 per cent, referred to by the honorable&#39; member for Flinders. I hope honorable members will disabuse their minds of the idea that there is any possibility of large quantities of hats being dumped here by reason of their being unseasonable at Home. Nothing of the kind ever occurs with respect to felt hats.  </para>

                        <para>- Probably they, are sold before they are made. If they are not sold during one month they will be sold during the next month. It is- just like selling so much bread and butter. Hats are sold every day, and there is no question as to a change. A very small change in the shape of a brim is very easily made, but even that does not affect the question. We are now dealing with only wool hats, and the next item deals with fur hats at a higher rate. </para>

                        <para>- They are very presentable wool hats which the great, masses of the working classes in Melbourne would wear if they could get them. But. this Tariff imposes such a high rate, that if compels men to pay 3s. or 4s. or 5s. for a hat which they had been in the habit, of buying for about 2s. I remind honorable&#39; members that the Denton Hat Mills here do not want a high duty,&#39; as they have indicated by not having increased their prices. I repeat that there is no such thing as dumping a quantity of these hats here towards the end of a season by reason of their having got out of fashion in the Old Country. </para>

                        <para>- My experience teaches me that unless this duty be retained it will mean disaster to the Australian hat mills. I speak without any interest, except that of an Australian who wants the work to be done here. I can assure honorable members that previously the factories were working only half-time, and that under the old Victorian Tariff two out of five factories were closed down. If .this duty be retained there will be not one but half-a-dozen successful mills in Australia, and no one will be- injured. The working man can get as cheap and good a hat as he requires. </para>

It is a simple case of contradiction. However, that is neither here nor there. I was surprised to hear the honorable member for Yarra make the statements which he did. I happen to know a little about hats. In the  Old  Country, I have relatives who are engaged in making this class of hat, at Denton, in Lancashire. I venture  id-  say that they have had very much more to do with the industry than has the Postmaster-General. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly npt under sweating conditions. The honorable member will not find any sweating going  on at the Denton mills in Lancashire. The honorable member for Yarra will not contradict my statement. It is true that the workmen in- those mills are not &#39;paid as much as the workmen here, but considering the relative values of money, I venture to say that the former are getting very good wages indeed. A good hat-maker in the Denton mills to-day will get from 35s. to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> a week. The honorable member for Batman will not deny that statement, and, therefore, it is idle to suggest that the hats are made under sweating conditions simply because they happen to be cheap. It is the poorer class of hats which are most heavily hit by this specific duty. </para>

                        <para>- That is the plain English. It is not a question of sweating, but a question of what people can afford to pay. On the poorer, inferior class of hats, which axe being imported, this specific duty will fall very heavily, In some cases, it will amount to 100 or 120, or 130 per cent. There is no sense in imposing a duty of that kind. It is not required, because of the difference in wages or conditions. A moderate duty of, say, 2 5 or 3&#176; Per cent., would make up for every difference which can be imagined in regard to wage rates or conditions. Why honorable members should want to impose this prohibitive duty, I am at a loss to understand. It seems. to me to be protection run stark staring mad. I hope that&#39; ve shall do what we did on a previous occasion - fight this matter as best we may. </para>

                        <para>- Whatever my proposal was, honorable members voted against it, not because the duty was high, but because it was too low to suit them. Whatever. I .proposed they were against. They did not want a high percentage duty because they knew that they were covering up a very much higher rate in the fixed duty. We are indebted to the Senate for having afforded us an opportunity to review this duty, and I. sincerely hope that the Committee will be content with a moderate rate, that is, from the stand-point of protectionists. We are accustomed now to say that a 30 or 35 per cent, is a moderate duty, but I call it a high one. I am prepared to vote for a duty of 35 per cent., and even of 40 per cent., on hats. The man who is not satisfied with those rates is a fiscal glutton. </para>

He appealed to me to substantiate that statement, but, on looking up the record - page 5973 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the current session - I find that ten members neither voted nor paired, all of whom might have reasonably been expected to vote against the rates of duty that were agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- I wish that I could think that the invoices of importers were honest.; but I cannot think so. Even supposing that they are, if hats can be bought for 10s. a dozen, or  10d.  each, and 100 per cent, profit is .allowed, that brings their value up to is. 8d., and a duty of 16s. per dozen, or is. 4d. each, would make their price 3s. each. How many working men in Australia buy hats at that price? Seeing that we grow wool in Australia, and work it up into the fabric out of which hats are made, we should do more for our working men if we .made it certain that the hat which they bought at a cheap- price was manufactured of pure wool grown here instead of the rubbish and shoddy which must be used in making cheap hats in foreign countries. </para>

                    <para>. - I am surprised that any honorable member should abuse his position as the honorable member for New England has done in the speech which he has just made. Knowing that he is safe from legal proceedings, he has ventured to assert that the great majority of the traders of Australia, and of the exporters from other parts of the world, are rogues and thieves. An honorable member who will make such a statement, without bringing forward irrefutable proof of its correctness, in my opinion abuses his parliamentary position- </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that the Minister will not support the statement. I agree that there are cases of under-valuation, and it is because <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties give an opportunity for dishonesty that  I  object to them, though I do not see how they can be avoided under a protective system. But to say that, as a rule, invoices contain under-valuations is to make a statement absolutely without foundation, and one which no honorable member should use his privilege to make, unless he can bring forward irrefutable evidence to support it. As regards the duty itself, we have had some very contradictory statements. It has been denied that&#39; it is as high as it has been said to be, yet the Postmaster-General, who knows a great deal about the hat business, admits that locally made hats are sold retail at1s.11d. Those hats cannot cost the makers less than1s. <inline font-style="italic">4d,</inline> and therefore the duty is equivalent to  100  per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.How</inline> can the most ardent protectionist justify such a rate? It has been said that it is necessary to prevent dumping. But if,&#39; as has been stated by one speaker, hats are sometimes sold for  50  per cent, below cost, the users of the better-class hats have to pay only  171/2  per cent, in duty, whereas users of low-priced hats have to pay a duty of nearly  300  per cent. I agree with those who think that there is no need for so high a duty. The difference in wages is more than covered by a duty of  35  per cent. , which would be a perfectly safe duty to adopt, even from the protectionist standpoint, and one which would prevent the charging of unduly high prices under cover of practically prohibitory rates. I think that when the honorable member for New England reconsiders the matter, he will withdraw his charges, which I hope have been made thoughtlessly. Unless he can substantiate them, they should be withdrawn. They constitute a serious charge against, not only importers, but also the Customs Department, and even himself. </para>

                        <para>- So far as I know, there have been only two or three such cases in Australia, and on those cases is based the charge that the great majority of the importers of the Commonwealth are dishonest, and pass false entries. Would the honorable member for Wannon like such a charge to be made against all engaged in the same business as himself, because three or four, or  300  or  400,  had been sent to gaol for dishonesty? Would it be honorable to make such a charge ? If the honorable member for New England believes what he said, his words are a reflection on himself, for if he believes that as a rule invoices contain under-valuations, he has no right to vote for <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with this particular item alone. The honorable member&#39;s statements had general application to importers in all lines of business, and if he believes them to be true, he has no right to support <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties, against the interests of the revenue, and of honest trading. Yet he has throughout supported <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties. I trust that honorable members will realize something of their responsibilities, and not make charges against any section of the community unless they have evidence to bring forward in support of them. </para>

I have some evidence in my possession - not sufficient to prove the accuracy of my suspicions. But I am suspicious that a majority of the invoices presented to the Customs Department are for amounts below the actual value of the goods to which they relate. The honorable member for North Sydney has twitted me with having supported the imposition of <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties. I was bound to do so because that has been the practice hitherto followed. I do not profess to be able to tell the Minister of- Trade and Customs how he should frame his Tariff, or that he should absolutely alter the character of the duties which have hitherto been operative. </para>

If the honorable member for North Sydney would only pay a visit of inspection to the hat factories here, and see the . beautiful long threads taken from Australian wool, and &#39; woven into hats, and if he would compare those threads with the tiny atoms cemented together which are to be found in the foreign shoddy, I am sure that he will not have much admiration for the latter. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Sir PHILIP</inline> FYSH (Denison &#91;12.10I- The Treasurer has had sufficient, experience of his office to enable him to say whether there is the slightest foundation for the suspicion which the honorable member for New England has expressed, in regard to <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> invoices as a whole. It is true that we do read from time to time of certain fines .being imposed upon importers by the Comptroller-General of Customs. Let me give three instances in which such fines have been imposed. In the first place, honorable members will recollect that the old Tariff .practically exempted wadding from duty. I well remember the discussion which took place in this &#34;House upon the matter. It was considered that wadding should be admitted free because it was the raw material of some manufacturers. What happened? A merchant imported wadding and was fined, because the Minister controlling the Customs- Department had,1 in the interim, declared by regulation that wadding came within the category of cotton piece goods, and was, therefore, liable to duty. In that case a small fine was necessarily inflicted. Another case had reference to stitched hats. Any person who has had experience of felt hats knows that the felt hat, which was made liable to duty under the old Tariff, contained a large amount of stitching, together with certain ornamentation. But, one day, the Customs authorities opened a case of goods and took out a number- of girls&#39; hats trimmed with liberty silk, and bound round with wire that had been stitched into the rim. The Collector of Customs immediately declared that these goods &#34; were &#34; stitched &#34; hats, and therefore liable to -duty. In this case a fine was also inflicted. The third instance which occurs to me relates to a piece of cotton gingham, one side of which had been passed over a hot roller, with the result that the fluffy appearance had been taken off. The other side had not been so treated, and, consequently, there was an apparent &#34; scribbling &#34; of the cloth. This gingham was described in the invoice as cotton piece goods, but the Customs authorities declared that it was flannelette, and accordingly a small fine was imposed. These are typical instances. </para>

These are the only two cases which have occurred during the past forty years. My association with Customs Department extends over many years. Until fifteen years ago I was a large importer. I had a great deal to do with various commercial houses in England, and Isay that anything like a desire to defraud has been the exception during all these years. If one dared to approach the English or German houses with a request that he should be supplied with false invoices, the idea would be scouted. </para>

                        <para>- There is a Commission of Inquiry every morning in the Department of the Minister of Trade and Customs. He has his experts up and down Flinders-lane daily, with a view to accurately ascertaining the value of goods. He has experts connected with every branch of trade, and very often the Customs authorities know a great deal more about invoice values than do the importers themselves. The honorable member for New England ought to justify the honorable member for North Sydney&#39;s statement that practically there are no cases in which absolute fraud is committed. Of course, I know that some &#34;time ago a case occurred in which a parcel of goods imported from the East was seized by the Customs authorities, who deemed the consignment to be undervalued. They accordingly exercised their power of adding  10  per cent, to the declared value of the goods, and seized them, with the result that when they were sold a large profit was made upon them. But what were the circumstances of the case? A merchant who resides in Japan spends the whole of his time in travelling throughout that Empire and purchasing goods at local prices. He sent the consignment in question to Australia, invoicing them at the price paid for them in Japan. The Customs authorities were unable to prove that they were not invoiced at their value at the place of export, but, having a suspicion that they were undervalued, seized them. It is seldom, however, that an instance of that kind occurs. Upon the whole, business is conducted upon the lines which have led to English-speaking merchants being regarded all over the world as merchant princes and honest gentlemen. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not think that there is any necessity for me to discuss the ethics of importers at this stage. I do not believe that cases of fraud amongst that class are more numerous than they are amongst the manufacturers. I wish to intimate, however, that my opinion in respect of the duty upon hats has undergone a change since the item under consideration was dealt with by this Committee last year. I believe that the general desire of our manufacturers is that we should impose a fixed duty upon hats, so as to keep out goods of inferior quality, and, therefore, I intend to support it. I, also believe that the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty which the Senate has proposed as an alternative to the specific duty agreed to by this Committee is a reasonable one. The fixed duty will have the effect of excluding the cheap manufactures of Europe and Asia, whilst hats of the Woodrow class - which will be required to pay 35 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem -</inline> will not be affected by it. If we are going to encourage Australian industry, I know of no industry which is. worthy of greater encouragement than is the hat industry. We possess both the fur and the wool necessary for the manufacture of hats of all descriptions - from the cheapest grade to the highest I see no reason whatever why there should be any importation of hats into the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- If we compare the wages paid in Italy, which are about1s. per day, with the wages paid in Australia, where they range up to  10s.  a day, it will be seen that that rate of protection is not so very high. We also know that the <inline font-style="italic">freight</inline> from continental countries <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> Australia is no greater than the freight on any of our Australian railways, in the case of journeys of 100 to .200 miles. Therefore, 35 per cent, is not a large protection against the cheap kind of hats that are &#39;imported to Australia. It is true that-  1  voted against what I considered to be a high duty on woollens, because most of our woollen goods come from Great Britain, and there is reason for giving consideration in that respect. </para>

                        <para>- In 1906 we imported &#163;501,000 of hats and caps, of which amount no less than &#163;145,000 came from Europe and Japan. In 1907, the importations increased to &#163;550,000, of which &#163;150,000 worth came from Europe and Asia. So that the total proportion of importations in competition with what should be a truly Australian , industry, is very great, and certainly the proportion of importations from Asia and continental Europe is altogether excessive. For these reasons I am prepared to support the fixed duty proposed in the schedule. &#39; </para>

                    <para>.- One who was absent during the previous discussion is at some loss to appreciate the changes of view of a number of honorable members. The honorable member for Wimmera based, a good deal of his argument for supporting these inordinately high duties on the belief that there is a great difference between the wages paid in foreign countries and those paid in Australia. I should like to ask him whether he has any information in his possession to show that the difference between- the wages paid in Australia and in Europe has increased during the last six months ? If the difference has not increased, the honorable member should surely record the same vote to-day as he recorded six months ago. Every one of the other arguments used by the honorable member was equally applicable six months ago, unless it can be proved that some change in conditions has occurred. Therefore, those honorable members who intend to change their votes really have no right to do so, unless they are prepared to confess that their former votes were based upon wrong views. . I presume that the honorable member for Wimmera was satisfied that the vote he gave on a former occasion was based upon .a right conclusion, inasmuch as he sat&#39; up all night to support the opposition to high duties. My information is that the natural protection on hats is very high </para>

                        <para>- There is one special objection to this item, and that is that it provides for taking whichever rate of duty returns the larger amount. That will undoubtedly involve a burden upon the users of cheaper kinds of hats - the working classes. I submit that for the consideration of those honorable members who are anxious not to oppress the poor in any way. It is obvious that a fixed duty upon hats becomes greater according as the class of hat imported becomes cheaper. Honorable members are deliberately imposing a prohibitive specific duty upon the cheapest hats imported into &#39; Australia. The Minister of Trade  and Customs has been asked to make a statement which, in common fairness to the commercial community, ought to be made. - Statements have been made by the honorable member, for New England of a very injurious character concerning the commercial classes. I think that &#39;most honorable members regret them. It is inadvisable that those statements should  remain unanswered by the one man in this chamber who is best fitted to make an answer, namely, the Minister. I think- that it would be unfortunate if the honorable gentleman did not make some statement. </para>

                    <para>.- My reason for remaining silent was that I thought there was very little to answer.- I think that the merchants of this country do not require that any man should stand up in Parliament and say that they are honest. We know them to be so. and as a matter of fact, apart from their desire to be honest, if pays them to be frank and open in dealing with the Customs. The assistance which merchants give to the Customs is really invaluable. We receive every aid from them largely Because &#34;they themselves are placed in a difficulty if they have to compete against the dishonest trader. Of course, there are bound to be some dishonest traders whose operations we have to deal with occasionally, and when a question arises as to whether certain goods should be imported under a&#39; duty of 10 or 15 per cent., an importer is naturally disposed to believe that he ought to pay the lower rate. As to false invoicing, the honorable member for Denison has explained the operations of the Department, and what he has said is quite correct. Invoices generally come from reputable, honest traders in other parts of the world who would not knowingly make a mis-statement. Generally their invoices may be accepted, and indeed have to be accepted. It would be impossible for the Customs officers to examine one-twentieth part of the goods that are imported, and we have to depend to a large extent upon the assistance given by merchants themselves and the fact that, as no one can tell which box or package may be opened and tested, there is consequently always great risk in misdescription, undervaluing, or attempting to cheat the Customs. Of course, when any fraud is at tempted to be perpetrated the merchant is punished by being brought before the courts. But when mistakes are made, and we consider that no fraud is intended, a small fine is inflicted. In -such&#39; a case there is no reflection on the honesty of those who make the mistake. We know that there are black sheep in every community, but as a rule the Customs Department is very well treated by the merchants, and evidence of that fact is afforded by the circumstance that we are working with such a small amount of friction between the Department and the mercantile. community. </para>

                    <para>.-&#39; The manner in which these duties on hats were pushed through originally- deserves some comment. A certain member of the Government was aware that I had in my possession a document of a very important character, bearing on the conditions enforced by some manufacturers . of hats in Victoria. I left the House on the 13th November, with the assurance that the hat duties would not be put through at that sitting. But the House yielded to the pressure applied by the Treasurer, and passed the duties before adjourning. </para>

                        <para>- The Civil Service Cooperative Store is a wholesale house, supplying retailers as well as ordinary customers. The business of the Denton Hat Mills is conducted in such a manner that a little clique of merchants in Flinders-lane are enabled to get 15 per cent, on every transaction, although they do not handle the goods supplied to retailers. This is how the matter stands. If a firm like the Civil Service Co-operative Society of Victoria, which deals in a wholesale way with hats and other commodities, applies to the Denton Hat Mills for  &#163;1,000  worth of hats, the operation is performed in the following manner :  - The order has to go through Flinders-lane, but the hats are sent direct from the mill to the Civil Service Co-operative Society. This process enables a few individuals in Flinders-lane, who have never handled the goods, and have never had anything to do with the transaction at all, to get 15 per cent, on the whole consignment. </para>

                        <para>- It really does not matter who makes the profit; the public are penalized. It is an improper way of doing business, whether the profit is made by importer or manufacturer. My point is that if the Denton Hat Mills, or other hat manufacturing firms, can afford to pay middlemen 15 per cent, for the transmission of consignments in this way, they can afford to return that amount to the people, and to carry on under a duty reduced by 15 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Very likely. Are we to give that company the advantage of these enormous duties in order that it may make concessions to a few middlemen? I ask honorable members who are wavering to consider whether we shall be justified in taking out of the pockets of the people an additional 15 per cent, in order that the Denton Hat Mills, and other hat manufacturing firms, may distribute money in the way I have mentioned. My contention is that it. would be easy for them to arrange for the distribution of their goods in some other way, and so avoid the payment of 15 per cent, to middlemen. I regret that it should have been necessary to bring this matter forward, but I think that the duty was sneaked through the House in a most improper way. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> shows that the House adjourned at 4.36 a.m., immediately after dealing with the duties on hats. It had been sitting continuously since 2.30 p.m. on the previous day. I have no desire to accuse any one of unfair dealing, but, having regard to the progress which had been made during the sitting in question, prior to the item of hats being called on, it seems to me that whether because of the transaction in which the Denton Hat Mills figured, or for some other reason, the decision of the Committee was forced on in a somewhat suspicious way. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The honorable member for Coolgardie may have shown certain Ministers the document to which he has referred, and I think that, knowing that I had served my time at the trade concerned, he might also have shown it to me. There is a good deal to be said for as well as against the practice adopted by some manufacturers of selling direct only to the wholesale warehouses; but that point should not be allowed to obtrude itself into the discussion with respect to this particular duty. Why should every hat manufacturer be Called upon to suffer simply because one or two refuse to sell direct to retailers? As a matter of fact, the same system is followed in the woollen industry and the boot manufacturing trades. Many boot manufacturers refuse to supply retailers direct. </para>

                        <para>- I am not suggesting that they do. I pointed out, on a former occasion, that manufacturers in England who had been supplying retailers direct had gone out of the business. Those who adopted the same system here would have to keep a number of travellers on the roads, and to incur advertising and other charges, whilst they would also find it necessary to keep a watchful eye on the financial position of their customers. One manufacturer in Victoria commenced to supply retailers direct, but the Civil Service Co-operative Society - for which, by the way, I . have every respect - did not come to his assistance. It could buy caps to-day direct from the manufacturers, but it prefers to purchase them through the warehouses. I fail to see why the whole trade should be penalized because of any practice on the part of the Denton Hat Mills, of which the honorable member for Coolgardie disapproves. I appeal to honorable members to dismiss from their minds what he has said, and to vote on the merits of the question of whether or not the proposed duty should be imposed. I trust that the Committee will agree to the request, and so grant the industry an adequate measure of protection. </para>

                    <para>. - The arguments urged against the last request apply with equal force against this, but apparently it is of no use to present arguments to the Committee as at present constituted. A majority of honorable members appear to have made up their minds to back up the Government in every proposal that is made. We have a well-compiled schedule before us, but apparently only honorable members on this side are bothering about it. They desire to secure reductions of duties suggested by the Senate, or at least to retain the duties as the Tariff left this House. I am here defending the work already performed by this House. I ask honorable members opposite why they do not adhere to what was done when the Tariff was previously before the Committee. If they do not do so it will be because some of them are prepared to go back upon the votes which they previously gave. The honorable member for South Sydney as an ardent protectionist may be delighted with what is taking place, but I certainly am not. Either honorable members in the earlier consideration of the Tariff had not sufficiently considered the questions on which they expressed an opinion, or they are now shamelessly going back on what they previously did. Apparently, the Senate has only to make&#39; a request, and honorable members opposite immediately bow the knee. I have heard the claim made here repeatedly, that this is -the people&#39;s House, and is intrusted with the protection of their interests. </para>

It is all very well for honorable members to stand on the platform and declare that this is the people&#39;s House ; but if we make the suggested amendment, we shall be allowing a Chamber, in which the smallest State is equally represented with the largest, to increase the taxation of the people by imposing exorbitant duties on articles of common wear. It would appear that, for the sake of an increased duty, the Treasurer is prepared to surrender to the Senate this power to impose taxation. </para>

                        <para>- Of course the Treasurer looks upon his own child as without blemish. When the acting leader of the Opposition was complimenting the Treasurer on the completion of the first consideration of this Tariff, I objected, because, after a scramble, the Tariff had emerged much more unscientific than was the Tariff of 1902 ; and I have seen no reason to alter that opinion. The friends of this particular industry seem to have been able to marshal enough forces to upset the decision; arrived at by this House a tew months ago ; and I should very much like to know the reason for the change of front on the part of some honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- That is another question with which I shall deal at the proper time ; but I remind the Treasurer that I can distinguish a motor lamp, for instance, as quickly as he can. I did a little scrambling when the Tariff was last before us, and had openly expressed my intention of doing so ; but I never pretended that I was voting for &#34;scientific&#34; protection. On the present occasion, honorable members are scrambling in the interests of what is distinctly a Victorian industry ;. but they have not the pluck to admit the fact. For years&#39;, the honorable member for South Sydney has been before the public as a democrat ; and I ask him whether he is prepared, for the sake of protection, to allow the Senate to be supreme in matters of taxation ? </para>

                        <para>- Let me inform honorable members who are so squeamish that the adjective figures most prominently in some of   our greatest works ; and, if honorable members are not aware of that fact, I regret their lack of classical culture. I can only repeat that legislation of this character is damnable. If we feel strongly on an)&#39; question, we cannot use rose-scented sentences; and the people, who have to pay these duties, have no time to be mealy-mouthed, especially when they know that the duties are imposed practically in the interests of one flourishing manufactory. The honorable member for Coolgardie has shown that the particular company to&#39; which I refer is able to give away 15 per cent, per annum to its shareholders, so that it cannot be said that these duties are necessary to rescue a languishing concern. It is common report that those connected with this Victorian manufactory have openly boasted on each occasion that they knew how the numbers stood in Parliament; and I must say that they seem to have very successfully piloted these items through the Senate. I know that it would be useless for me to submit an amendment, and, therefore, I can only enter my protest. It is most remarkable that there should be a duty of 2s.1d. on a hat that may possibly cost only10d ; and such duties are calculated to make any one angry. I am particularly astonished at the action of the Labour Party in this connexion. It will be observed that the engineer and the ironworker is not favoured with any composite or alternative duty, and does not enjoy protection to the extent of anything like 35 per cent. I have voted all through for the lowest possible duties on the necessaries of life, and I shall continue to do so. It is not the desire of the workers that tax should be heaped on tax. </para>

                    <para>.- The argument put forward by the honorable member for Dalley is one which the Minister will find considerable difficult)&#39; in meeting, not that I think Ministers want to meet any argument, or to approach even the confines of argument, in bullocking the Tariff through this Chamber. One thing I noticed most forcibly this morning, when we had a unique opportunity of voting with the ayes, was that the Ministerial benches were denuded even of the schedules with which the Committee is now dealing. On this side of the chamber one sees the schedule everywhere, and honorable members attempting to deal with the business of the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- The Government whip ha. cast a serious reflection by interjection on a number of honorable members. I do not think he meant it seriously, but I cannot allow it to pass unchallenged. The Government have stated time and again that they would give every facility to members of the Public Service to attend the manoeuvres of the Defence Forces. The honorable member for Brisbane is away doing his country&#39;s work, and all through I have had to sacrifice the claims of other honorable members in order to find him a pair. The lack of interest on the part of the Committee in the passage of these items - and in that connexion what has occurred with regard to hats is very significant - explains to some extent the. extraordinary reversal of form shown by some honorable members. &#39; Every one regrets to see honorable members changing their votes unless they are able to show that that change has come about because they have better appreciated the facts, or because new facts have come before them. I have noticed that not one. of those honorable members who have reversed their votes on this question has seen fit) to give the Committee any reasons for his change of attitude. &#34;I challenge contradiction of that statement. </para>

If the honorable member regards it as a reflection to say that they have changed their votes without giving any explanation for their action, he is welcome to his opinion. Like the honorable member, they may refuse to be &#34; slaves to principle.&#34; But their constituents&#39; and this House have a perfect right to ask for an explanation, which has not been given, of the change of front about which I have complained. </para>

                    It will be fought out again. When, for his own convenience, the honorable gentleman asks honorable members to accept this request, he is extending to the Senate, which is not the people&#39;s House, the power to increase the duties fixed by this Chamber. I do not wish to repeat the arguments which were used in connexion with the previous request. I am really unable to find any words with which to express adequately the attitude of honorable members on the other side to-day. But the time will come when they will be found protesting against the exercise of such power by the Senate. I venture to prophesy that if this course be persisted in, the people of Australia will eventually be called upon to alter the Constitution.

                        <para>- Fancy the hat manufacturers of Victoria being so weak that they require a duty of 7d. on a sewn hat which is retailed at 8d. ! It will be a crime to impose a duty of that kind. How is it that the hat industry has so many friends in this Chamber and the Senate? How is it that it can marshal its forces so well? I do not know how true it is, but I am told that &#34;some members of this House are interested in the industry. I would not like to suggest that that is the reason for their votes. Surely we are not all shareholders in the Denton Hat Mills. </para>

                        <para>- What sort of a catch would I have if I caught the honorable gentleman - a very slippery eel. If I landed him in a basket, he would be out of it the next minute. From his interjection, one would have thought that he did not know that the Senate had not requested an increased duty. When I pursued the matter,&#39; he admitted that no such request  had been made. The machinery industry is more extensive in New South Wales than elsewhere, but. this, and other industries which are being specially treated, are located in Victoria. I do not wish to be a State protectionist, but merely to emphasize the fact that differential treatment is being applied to our industries. I hope that the Committee will reject this request of the Senate. It is easy to see that honorable members on the other side are colour-blind to-day. They are prepared to vote just as the Treasurer desires. All I can do is to place on record my strong objection to the increased duty requested by the Senate on caps and sewn hats. </para>

                    <para>.- There is a section of honorable members who are supposed to be on the moderate side of the fiscal question, and it is to them that we may hope to appeal. Certainly, it is of no use to appeal to the majority of my honorable friends opposite ; because they seem disposed to vote for any duty which will act in the way of prohibition. That is their goal, pure and simple, and, therefore, they are only consistent. But I venture to hope that there is a number of honorable members who, not being prohibitionists, will vote with us against the imposition of this monstrous duty on caps and sewn hats. From whichever point of view it is regarded, it is a monstrous .duty. It is one&#39; which particularly affects the poorer classes. </para>

                        <para>- If that is sweating, then I do sweat the worker, but that is quite as much as I can afford to give. With regard to caps and sewn hats, we are asked to agree to a duty of 7s. per dozen, or 35 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> whichever rate returns the higher duty. On the ordinary cap which a workman buys for is., that means a duty of from 100 to 120 per cent, at the very least. </para>

                        <para>- I have no antipathy to Australian manufactures, and have never said a word against them. On the contrary, I have made it the rule of my life to encourage them where that could be done legitimately, and the honorable member for Riverina has heard me say repeatedly that we should buy Australian goods when we can get them. But our makers of caps do not need the protection of duties equivalent to from 100 to 150 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> If there were something extraordinarily difficult or speculative in this manufacture,. T could understand the request for such rates, to give a fair insurance to the capital and skill requisite. But the manufacture is of the simplest description. Almost any one can make a cap. The Minister is piling on duties for the sheer love of doing so. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Much more complicated and expensive machinery, and greater skill are needed for the production of clothing than are necessary for the manufacture of caps and hats, and yet, while rates of 30 and 40 per cent are considered sufficient in the one case, in the other, rates from 100 to 150 per cent, are asked for. No one would object to a protection of 30 or 40 per cent, for the hat and cap manufacturers. Such duties would make up for the difference between rates of wages and conditions in Australia and elsewhere. There is no reason, justice, or equity, in imposing the rates which are asked for. On a cap for which a wearer pays about 3s., the rates will be only 35 per cent., but the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> percentage increases as the value of the cap decreases, so that the lowest priced cap, which, of course, is purchased by the poorest, will have to bear a duty of from 100 to 150 per cent. That is a monstrous inequality, and the irony of the situation is that these high rates are not necessary for the protection of the industry. I am at a loss to understand why the Minister persists in them. They are a disgrace and blot upon the schedule, even from a protectionist point of view, and I protest most strongly against them. </para>

                        <para>- I have risen to reply to the statement of the honorable member for Dalley that caps and hats of the particular class covered by the item are not being made in Australia. I find that they are being made by no fewer than seven firms in Sydney, and six in Victoria. Would it not be better, instead of sending abroad annually&#163;30,000 for the purchase of hats and caps, to let the money filter through our own factories, providing employment for our own people at good wages, instead of paying for sweated labour elsewhere. We can control the conditions of employment here, but we cannot control those which obtain upon the Continent. </para>

                    (Wentworth) |_312&#93;During the course of this debate we have heard a good deal of the benefit which the imposition of the proposed duty will confer upon the workers in the hat industry. We know perfectly well what it will accomplish for the manufacturers, and if I thought that they were entitled to the advantages which it will give them, I should not offer any  strenuous opposition to it. But, in my opinion, the protection which is already afforded them is &#39; exorbitant. However, I chiefly rose for the purpose of eliciting a little more information from those honorable members who appear to be absolutely certain that the workers will obtain their share, from these burdens being placed upon the taxpayers of the country.

The honorable member for Riverina stated that we can control the conditions of employment and the fixing of wages in this country, but does he not know that some time ago one of the largest manufacturers of agricultural implements in Victoria removed his works from one locality, where his operations would have been subject to the control of a Wages Board, to another locality where they would be free from such control ? </para>

This Committee has already imposed an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rate upon them, and I fail to see why its decision should be departed from. Of course, it may be said that in the last two divisions - in which I voted1 with the Government - I supported somewhat similar proposals. That. I submit, is not so, inasmuch as the fixed duties of 16s. per dozen and 25s. per dozen in those cases were the rates sanctioned by this House. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not like fixed duties to be imposed upon these articles. I should prefer <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates to be levied. Upon this class of goods specific duties are equivalent to very high <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates, and we know .that competition is most severe in regard to the lower  priced articles. I feel impelled to vote for the Government proposal, because a duty of 35 per cent, has already been imposed upon the raw materials from which caps are made. </para>

                        <para>- The same question might be raised as the objection to all these duties? Why not wear Australian-made caps? I repeat that we have to recollect that 35 per cent, has been imposed on the materials of which these caps are made. Consequently the proposal to levy a similar rate upon the completed article would afford it no protection&#39; whatever. I prefer an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> duty to a fixed duty, in order that the higher priced goods may pay more to the revenue. So far as the amount of duty is concerned, 35 per cent, does not seem to me to give any margin for the local manufacturers, bearing in mind the fact that the material from which the goods are made pays about the same rate of duty. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid that we cannot get that. If there is a proposal to make the duty 45 per cent. I shall support it. If such a proposal is made and lost I shall vote for the fixed duty, because I am not going to place the manufacturers at a disadvantage. We must consider the fact that under the 35 per cent, duty there was a very great increase in the number of hats imported. The imports increased from a few thousands ofpounds&#39; worth to over &#163;30,000 worth in two or three years. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that one may be excused for again drawing attention to the fact that we are yielding too much to the requests of the Senate. We are approaching some very important items, and we must remember that under the Constitution the Senate has not the power to initiate Bills dealing with taxation. But substantially the Senate is doing that very thing if the Minister comes down and accepts a great number of suggestions for in creasing duties, and, with the aid of a majority which has changed opinions, places them on the statute-book. If honorable members will refresh their memories by looking up section 53 of the Constitution, they will find that it sustains my view. </para>

                <para class="block">All that we have to do, however, is to push a little further the principle of suggestions, making it applicable to almost every one of the items in this Tariff, and we shall have the Senate acting as the controlling spirit in matters of taxation. The real privilege of the Senate lies in its power of negativing Bills in detail. That is different from the power possessed by the. House of Lords. The whole Budget - the whole scheme of&#39; taxation for the year - is submitted to the House of Lords in one Bill. We cannot do that under our Constitution. The great protection to the Senate against any domineering&#39; by this. House is that we must send up a Bill dealing only with one matter of taxation at a time. But it was never intended that the Senate should be enabled, with the aid of a Minister, to usurp the constitutional functions of this House in the matter of originating taxation. Again I remind honorable members of this fact. Suppose that a dissolution takes place on this question of the Tariff-. If we go to our constituents on what are we to rely? If the Senate say, &#34; We &#39;reject your Bill <inline font-style="italic">in toto,</inline> and send you to your constituencies for a fresh mandate,&#34; are we to go to our constituents on the question that was before this House before this Bill was sent to the Senate, or on the Bill after it came back from the Senate? A - pretty muddle we should be in if, having given our deliberate opinion upon a Bill sent to the Senate, we afterwards reversed that opinion, and went to our constituents, not for correction of our opinions as originally declared by our votes, but for the correction of the new opinions which we have adopted from the Senate. The thing is ridiculous from a constitutional stand-point ; and I call attention to it again, acknowledging that, while we are bound to consider suggestions from the Senate, we are not bound to consider  suggestions of a character which practically amount to the initiation of taxation by the Senate. </para>

                    <para>- I have heard so much about the powers of the Senate that I wish to say a few words on that aspect of the question, The Senate, as stated by the honorable and learned member for Angas, has made certain suggestions. The honorable member has complained that the Minister is asking us to adopt too many of those suggestions. But I would remind&#39; him that nothing can be done by the Minister if a majority of this House is opposed to the Senate&#39;s requests. It is the right of every citizen of the Commonwealth to approach this House, and ask for an increase or decrease of taxation. We have during our Tariff debates received requests in the form of petitions from manufacturers, merchants, and importers for the increase or decrease of duties. Surely the Senate ought to be able to make requests to this House as freely as outside individuals can do? Therefore, I think that these reflections on the power of the Senate to make requests are altogether uncalled for. </para>

                    <para>. - The suggestion that has been made by the honorable member for Boothby is one that the Committee might very well consider. There can be no doubt that we are here increasing taxation according as the value of the goods decreases. That is to say, we are imposing a far heavier tax upon articles worn by the poorer classes than on similar articles worn by those who have more money to spend. I intend to propose that the duties be 45 and 40 per cent. The Senate has accepted those rates of duty on other articles of apparel. </para>

                        <para>- No: the ruling to which the honorable member refers related to a case in which an alternative proposal was made. Here we have no alternative ; we simply have a proposition that the duty shall be increased from 35 per cent, to 40 per cent. I think that the honorable member for Franklin will find himself in a dilemma if he presses his proposal. Speaking to the general question, I would say&#39; that I have had some experience of that part of the great city of London where hats arid caps are manufactured. Any one who has seen the conditions under which work is carried on there, would hesitate to urge that they should be repeated here. </para>

                        <para>- I think that it is ; there are influences operating to keep the ready-made clothing trade in a better position.&#34; In the first place, the price of the material used in the ready-made clothing trade is somewhat higher than that used in the manufacture of caps, and consequently the sweaters in the clothing trade in the East End of London require some guarantee that those to whom they issue such material to be made up will return it. Then again there is greater supervision over the clothing trade than there is over the cap-making industry. I know that caps are made there under the most degrading conditions. I would therefore ask the Committee to agree with the request made by another place, with a view of excluding - and I frankly admit that I should like to see them excluded - these goods, which, both in the matter of manufacture and quality,&#39; are not such as to commend them to our better judgment. Some honorable members appear to think that because an article is offered at a low price it is necessarily cheap. It is well known that the cheapest articles often prove in the long run to be the dearest. </para>

                        <para>- The local article is very much cheaper. The best silk hat made in Australia can be purchased for 25s. ; but one cannot obtain a good &#34; Lincoln and Bennett &#34; for less than 30s. As the Committee has agreed to increase the duty on hats, it must, in order to be consistent, consent to an increased duty on caps. We should go even further, and make the duty higher. A great deal has been said about the increased cost which this duty of 7s. per dozen will involve. Do honorable members know that imported caps are invoiced at 4s. and 5s. per dozen? </para>

                        <para>- I cannot be blamed in the circumstances for saying a word or two on the question. We should not lose sight of the fact that these articles are made elsewhere, under conditions which we have no desire to see obtaining in Australia. They are landed at a very low cost, and the imposition of these duties would not increase the cost to the consumer. </para>

                        <para>-  I wish to make a personal explanation. The honorable member for Laanecoorie said he had seen the Government whip and the Opposition whip making an arrangement to keep the debate going until a Minister, who was absent, returned to the chamber. The Government whip is present, and I now call upon him to say whether the statement made by the honorable member for Laanecoorie is not absolutely devoid of foundation? </para>

As a matter of fact, however, it was not necessary that the honorable member should do- so, because the honorable member for Wentworth jumped into the breach and kept the debate going. </para>

We have already accepted amendments requested by. the Senate in connexion with duties&#39; on hats, and I venture to say that we are now dealing with a branch of the industry which is just as important. Last year caps were imported to the value of about , &#163;29,000. Some of these caps were made by persons who received wages of only 3s. per week. </para>

I ask honorable members opposite, and especially the honorable member for Parramatta, who only a few months ago stated that the manufacturers of hats in the Old Country did not sweat their employes-, but provided good wages and conditions, to say whether the same can be said for the manufacturers of caps. Are they not aware that in Great Britain to-day persons employed in this industry have to work from ten to twelve hours per day for 3s. per week ? . </para>

                        <para>- It is to increase the opportunities for employment afforded to people here. When it is remembered that people engaged in this industry in Australia receive&#163;1 per week for work which is paid for in the Old Country at 3s. per week, it will be admitted that they require some protection. I ask any honorable member who desires to put down sweating, and amongst others the honorable member &#39;for Parramatta, not to allow the sweated goods of other countries to be imported. </para>

The Tariff has had such! an effect on the prosperity of New South Wales that on Monday last the Sydney trams carried 580,000 people, or more than ever carried in a single day previously. New South Wales is prospering, and the people of that State are asking for more protection. </para>
