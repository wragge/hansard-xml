                    <para>.- This morning's cablegrams inform us of the decease of the distinguished man who, but a few days since, was Prime Minister of Great Britain. On his career, involved as it was with the. party politics of the Mother Country, there is no need to dwell ; his high character, . his genial disposition, his staunch sincerity were patent to all observers. This Commonwealth owes him a distinct debt, because, when the Constitution Bill was before the House of Commons, we had the advantage of his earnest support at every stage of the consideration of the measure. He, and several of those . who are now members of the Ministry which he so lately led, were ardent in their desire to further the growth of self-government in Australia. 'Again, last year, when there was considerable doubt as to the course which should be followed, he recognised the importance of the gathering of the representatives of the self-governing Dominions of the Empire, by attending the Conference in person and welcoming them in an opening speech which breathed the broadest statesmanship. Under these circumstances,I trust the House will forgive the fulfilment of what appears to me an obligation to the memory of a great man. </para>

                    <para>. - The Prime Minister did well to note the passing of the late Prime Minister of Great Britain. The death of a great Britisher -must always be a matter of concern to us, and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> CampbellBannerman was the embodiment . of the characteristics which make up a great Britisher. I cannot think of him without at the same time thinking' of another great Englishman who, too, has lately passed over to the majority. I. refer to the late Duke of Devonshire. Both loved their country intensely, both served it faithfully and. well for nearly forty years. We must remember that these  men were born to high station, and possessed all that goes to make life easy and pleasant ; but, in spite of these advantages and temptations, they devoted their best abilities to the service of their country, and served the Empire with a- rare devotion and a high sense of duty. There have been many men, perhaps/ more brilliant than the late Prime Minister; but he was a much bigger man than we were apt to think. When one read his speeches, one realized how sane, how wise, and how broad were his views,- and saw how much grit*, courage, and honour he possessed. He must be regarded as one of those who are very much greater than is disclosed by a superficial  glance  Many men have been able to appeal more strongly to the imagination of their countrymen ; but, in our time, &amp;.nd within our knowledge, no man has so firmly implanted himself in the hearts- and affections of "his fellows, more particularly within the last two or three years. The nation loved him, and did so because it came to see that he loved the people. So long as our Empire is as fruitful as it has been in the production of men such as the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Campbell-Bannerman, we need not doubt our ability  to maintain our pride of place among the nations of the world. </para>

                    <para>.- The passing of public men, especially of recent days, seems to indicate that the wear and tear of public life in modern times is more severe than it was in the past. Any one who had personal acquaintance with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Campbell-Bannerman  will cheerfully admit that he was a man of broader view, greater mind, and keener susceptibility to the wants of his own people, and possessed of a wider knowledge of the development of civil government in foreign countries, than perhaps any other Prime Minister, of recent date, except the late Right Honorable W. E.. Gladstone. I had the pleasure of meeting him, and' hearing him speak, and what impressed me more than anything else was his broad, general, human sympathy, and his desire, not only that the Government of his own country should be "broad based' upon the people's will,.", but that other countries should possess as liberal political institutions as they were 'able to conduct with advantage to themselves. The Prime Minister has mentioned what the right honorable gentleman did for this Commonwealth. May I be- permitted to allude to what he did for the sister colonies of the Transvaal and Orange River? I am almost tempted to name, too, a foreign country in regard to which .he said that, although its young Parliament might be dead, another would arise and establish itself on its ashes. A great man has passed ; one who, perhaps, will, in the future, appear greater than he seems now. He was one of those statesmen who had the people's benefit at heart, and his broad sympathies linked together the members of a party in the great Government which, under the lead of his successor now controls the destinies of the Empire. </para>

What I said was that we had caused certain) inquiries to be made, and that I had in my possession reports in reference to a number of trusts, showing that it was absolutely necessary for the Government to have larger powers than we possessed. I might add that, as a matter of fact, the doings of one of the trusts are at present under consideration, and the Crown Solicitor has the matter in hand. Beyond that, it is not wise for me to make any announcement. </para>

                        <para>- A recent interruption of the business of the House has required the concentration of the attention of my colleague' the Treasure? on fiscal matters to the exclusion of the financial scheme, which is already well advanced. I am not quite sure now whether, under the circumstances, we shall be able to place it on the table as early as anticipated. But the scheme is at that stage when, I think, I may say an outline of it will be placed on the table very shortly. </para>

                            <para>- I doubt whether there will be time for that, until it has been considered elsewhere. The scheme will be extensive, and involve directly and indirectly, a number of matters; and it would probably be an advantage to the House, and save time, if, when we proceed to consider it, we have before us the criticism of the State Ministries. I have in view the fact that we are pressed for time ; it might be otherwise if time were unlimited. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Riverina announced last night his intention to move that the duty should not take effect until after six months' time. I have thought the matter over, and see no great harm in accepting that proposal. I asked the officers this morning to prepare a motion, and they have suggested the following words: - "On and after 1st November, 1908, per cwt, is." If the honorable member for Riverina desires to move that I am quite agreeable to accept' it. </para>

                    <para>.- When this item was before us previously I took up exactly the same position as I am taking up now. The Committee then resolved to make these articles free of duty. The Senate has requested us to impose a duty of 1s.. per cwt., or 20s. per ton. Of course, as a protectionist, I should be found voting at all times for protective duties. But there are circumstances which alter cases, and those circumstances have arisen now. They existed when I spoke before and I am sorry to say have not yet passed away. </para>

Previously there was a possibility of getting fodder from Victoria, which then had an abundance, that could be landed in those remote parts at a reasonable price, but now Victoria is not able to supply it. There is no other State, not even South Australia, in a position to export it. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what has caused all the hilarity. The' honorable member who interjects has not stuck as close to principle as I have during my political career. Even my opponents will admit that I have been consistent. Some honorable members said there was plenty of grass in other States, but they know that that grass cannot be imported to Riverina. What is wanted is fodder in the shape of hay or some such commodity to keep stock alive. The drought period has, unfortunately, been protracted. My reason for asking for a suspension of the duty for six months is that I hope, and believe, that before that period expires the unfortunate settlers, large and small, in the parts I have mentioned will have grass with which to feed their stock, and will no longer be compelled to buy fodder at present rates. Will honorable members say that circumstances do not alter the case, and also the application of principle, when, ordinarily, good fodder can be bought for £2 10s. and  £3  a ton, whereas now those unfortunate land-owners are compelled to pay a ton for what is real rubbish? It amounts to positive cruelty. </para>

                        <para>- Of course I will. Have I ever refused to do so? On a previous occasion, when a suspension of duty was asked for, it could not be brought  about without the consent of all the other States. But. in this case it is simply a question of our determining when- a proposed duty should come into force. I am not speaking  without  knowledge in this matter, nor am I pleading only for my own constituents. I speak on behalf of a very large area of the Commonwealth, and of people who, while they, perhaps, have a little fodder to sell, are not .so inhuman as to desire the present oppressively high prices to continue. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Riverina repudiates the suggestion that he is a parochialist. The plea that he puts forward is that certain parts of New South Wales and Victoria, particularly the electorate which he represents in the former State, are suffering from a drought, and the stock-owners need cheap fodder, but he hopes that in the course of six months the drought will have passed away. He seems to forget that  there may be a drought in some other part of New South Wales, or' other parts of the Commonwealth, when there is no drought in Riverina. He was correct in stating that three or four months ago there was a very severe drought in the district I represent. Six months ago, I supported, if I did not move a proposal, that fodder should be made free. I hold exactly the same view to-day, for reasons which I do not wish to repeat. This duty can only be operative when there is a drought somewhere, and then persons in other parts of the Commonwealth are able to suck a little more blood out of their poorer neighbours when it can be least spared. In October last, the honorable member for Riverina pleaded for a suspension of the duty for six months. He told us then that he did not want a suspension of the duty for twelve months, because he felt quite sure that the shorter suspension would be sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- What I tried to point out to the honorable member just now, by way of interjection, was that he was wrong when he first asked  for a suspension. On a former occasion, he should have asked for a suspension of the duty .for twelve months, not for six months. Whether he is right or wrong in his estimate of the out-  look in his constituency, I point out that this duty can only operate at a time when it must press hardly upon stock-owners suffering from drought. That very fact alone should impel us to remove the duty. I. intend again to vote for its abolition. Although a large portion of the electorate I represent must profit by the good crops  which the rain has brought them, still in the time of their prosperity the farmers there should think of the hardship which ' is being experienced in other parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - When the Government proposed the imposition of this duty, there was a drought prevailing over part of New South Wales, parts of Queensland, and, . I think, the northern parts of Victoria, and in a moment of panic - prompted by the fear that the drought' might last for a considerable time, and that the price of fodder would become prohibitive - a majority of honorable members who previously had spoken in favour of a duty on fodder, decided to remit it. It seems to me that every argument which the honorable member for Riverina' advanced in favour of postponing the operation of the duty for six months applies with equal force against its imposition at all. He complains that the price of fodder is high. That means that there is a shortage. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, there will always be a drought somewhere in Australia, and, of course, this duty can only be operative when the price of fodder is high locally, that is, when there is a shortage. In other words, the duty can be operative only when a drought obtains in some portion of the Commonwealth. To suspend the duty because there is a drought in Riverina would be ridiculous, seeing that next year there may be a drought in Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- At the market price. In South Australia, the export price of hav ranges from, <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> 15s. to <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> per ton,, and that of chaff is about <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> per ton. These prices have not varied since the last harvest. It is absurd for us to attempt to legislate to meet local conditions in any particular portion of the Commonwealth. Next year a drought may afflict South Australia, and,- in .that case, fodder would probably have to be imported from Victoria or from the Riverina. The Riverina farmers would then obtain an advantage which other farmers are enjoying to-day. To my mind, it is perfectly fair to levy a duty upon fodder, and it would be absurd to remit it upon the only occasion when it can possibly be operative. If we are going to adopt a policy of protection, we certainly- ought to protect the primary producers. </para>

                        <para>-The honorable member's remark is applicable to this year, because, at the present time, fodder commands a fairly' good price everywhere. There has been an almost universal shortage, which has had the effect of maintain1ing prices. If we- are going, to adopt the policy of protection, is there any reason why we should depart from., the principle underlying it? The farmer may hav.e to pay a high price for fodder at the present time, but we know .that occasionally the manufacturer has to pay a high price for the commodities that he uses. I repeat that if we intend to adopt a protective policy i it ought to apply all round. The proposal of the honorable member is so manifestly illogical that I do not think it necessary to discuss it at any further length. </para>

                    <para>-- I see no reason why this duty should not. be levied upon hay and chaff in the same way that duties are levied upon all other like products. As a matter of fact, very little hay and chaff has been imported into the Commonwealth since 1902, when only £10,000 worth was imported. In 1903, the value of the hay and chaff imported was, approximately, .£3,400; in 1904, it was £168; in 1905, £135; in 1.906, £117; in 1907, £100; and in January of the present year, the quantify imported was only about 15 cwt.

                        <para>- That is so. Still, I think that we ought to be consistent, and that we should impose a duty upon hay and chaff, just ' the same as we impose a duty upon, similar products which are imported in large quantities. For instance, barley has been imported in large quantities each year, though in a lesser quantity since 1903 than was previously the &lt;:ase. </para>

                        <para>- As I have already said",, practically no hay or chaff is imported at present, but I do not -see why we should admit free of duty those commodities, seeing that bran, pollard, flour, oats, maize, and other similar articles are dutiable. In 1903 nearly £2,000,000 worth of wheat were imported, upon which duty was charged. I intend to vote for the proposed- duty, because I fail to see why we should treat hay and chaff differently from other similar products.1 </para>

                        <para>- It is perfectly safe to say that during that year £500,000 was paid in duty upon fodder with which to feed starving stock. As the honorable member for Boothby has pointed out, there is scarcely a period when some portion of this continent is not afflicted with drought. I was very much amused " to hear the dialogue, which took place this afternoon between the honorable member for the Riverina, and the honorable member for Wimmera upon the subject of fiscal principle. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad that the honorable member furnished us with cause for a. little merriment. He does not appear to be  very  merry himself over the consideration of this matter. I should like, therefore, to at once relieve his feelings by telling him that I- propose to vote with him. I shall vote with him to obtain a six months' suspension of the duty if I cannot get 'more, and I shall support its perpetual suspension if I can secure it. The honorable member, for Riverina has furnished the best of all reasons why we should not impose these protective duties on  fodder. He has told us that he wants a  suspension of the duties in the hope that when six months have 'elapsed, there will be food for man and beast in his electorate, and the adjoining districts. </para>

                        <para>- I do, most earnestly and heartily. But by the time the honorable member's electorate is in a position of plenty, there may be a drought 'in some other portion of the continent.  His  position is that as long "as Riverina obtains a suspension of these duties, "it does not matter a button about Queensland and other parts of New South Wales, which may be unfortunately circumstanced at any future time. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see how I can draw any other inference. The honorable member proposes that these duties shall be operative at the end of six months. But while in that time the honorable member's electorate may be in a favorable condition, some other district may be suffering. If he claims exemption for his struggling farmers during a .time of what he terms national calamity,  why  should he not consider the calamities of other people who, at some other, time, may be circumstanced as his constituents are now? </para>

But I recollect the fierce encounters that I had with the then member for Moira, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy,</inline> and he was such a bosom companion in fiscal matters of the honorable member for Riverina that I concluded that both must have been oh the same side. But the- proposal of the honorable member to-day is of the parochial or parish pump order. I cannot subscribe to it on that account. There is no federalism in it. -There is nothing but consideration <inline font-style="italic">ici</inline> the honorable member.' sown immediate neighbourhood, and an absolute callousness . concerning other portions of the continent which may be equally afflicted when at the end of six months these duties come into operation. </para>

On the Richmond River, they, will give him as much as he likes to take away. The trouble is that there are not sufficient trucks .to be got just -now. There seems to be a dearth of railway trucks; and there are many local circumstances attending a period of drought which always Operate to make the difficulties of settlers even greater than they would otherwise, be. Therefore, it is all the more necessary that we. should not impose duties which would inflict upon them a heavier burden.- I should like to hear from the honorable member for Wimmera what the principle of fodder duties consists in. </para>

                        <para>- It does none of these things, and it cannot. It cannot prevent dumping. If we put a duty of <inline font-style="italic">£i</inline> per ton on fodder, the farmer who wants it must pay that duty. The duty will not keep fodder out of the country, except to a limited extent. The effect will simply be to put up. the price to those who must buy. That is all the fiscal principle that I can find in this proposal. My honorable friend, the member for Wimmera, in his loyalty to fiscal principle, wants to enable one set of farmers to make extra profits out of the needs of others in a time of  calamity.  He wants to set our farmers on a cannibalistic attack on each other. </para>

                        <para>- Then these duties are to have an educational value? They  are to take ' the place of agricultural colleges, I suppose? After all that we have done for our agricultural societies and colleges, and for agricultural education, I learn for the first time that amongst the instruments of agricultural education must be numbered a protective Tariff on fodder. We are to live and learn, but I venture to say that the farmer whose stock is dying will not appreciate tha.t argument. He . will appreciate much more our placing at his disposal every facility we can grant him to supply his needs, to keep alive his stock, and to tide him over those great difficulties which seem so often to be threatening him. I shall vote with the honorable member for Riverina, because I fear that if we do not join with him we shall not have a respite of even six months from these duties. I want something more than that, however, and if the honorable member succeeds in carrying his amendment, I shall .vote against the motion, as amended, in the hope that we shall do as we did on the previous occasion when this item was under consideration. I trust that honorable members are not going to run away from the votes which ' they then gave. I see no reason why we should reverse the vote cast on a former occasion. I hope that honorable members will steadily adhere to a policy which is in the interests of the primary producers of Australia, and which affords them a measure of relief when they are  heavily  stricken by drought. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with the honorable member for Riverina that his electorate is in a deplorable condition, and sincerely sympathize with the farmers and graziers there. I travelled through part of his electorate a few days ago, and saw that it was in a very bad state; but I should not like to say that all Australia is suffering from drought, and that we have to go beyond the Commonwealth to obtain fodder for our stock. In the southern part of South Australia we are enjoying one of the best seasons we have experienced there; whilst throughout the northern part of that State the season has "been an exceedingly good one. Men from the north are visiting the southern districts to purchase cattle for their runs. Had they known that starring stock was so plentiful in the Riverina, I am sure that some of them would have gone there for their supplies instead of to Mount Gambier and other' districts in the. south-east of South Australia. I was informed by my brother, whom I met in Sydney a few days ago, that in his district - between Mungindi and St. George - the grass is over the tops of the wire fences, so that there, too, the season has been a good one: What we need is a ready means of conveying fodder from one part of the Commonwealth to another. It would rot pay to feed ordinary stock for any length of time on hay and chaff; only very valuable stock can' be fed in that way. I am sorry that the Riverina should be stricken by drought, but the. farmers and graziers there can readily obtain hay and chaff in South Australia at a very cheap rate. </para>

                        <para>- I think that it is less than that. When I left home a fortnight ago, chaff, delivered without bags, was offering at £3 10s. per ton. We have an abundant supply of fodder; all that we need is adequate means of conveying it: at cheap rates to the drought-stricken districts, or of taking the stock to . the districts where food is obtainable at reasonable rates. In the olden days when we had&gt;  so to speak, a free country, stock could be easily shifted by road from one district to another, but nowadays we need to push our railways into the drought-stricken districts in order to enable us to combat the evils of dry seasons. Fortunately, a very small portion of Australia is at present affected by drought, and I hope that we shall never have a repetition of. the drought of 1902. I agree with the honorable member for Corangamite that our farmers and graziers should make better preparation for dry seasons. I certainly thought that the drought of 1902 would teach them to make provision- for the maintenance of their stock in bad times. In my electorate, we have never had a drought, and I do not think that we shall ever have one. The more severe the drought in other parts of Australia, the more bountiful is the supply of fodder in the electorate of Barker. There one may see stacks of hay which have been kept for two or three years as a provision against drought, but, fortunately, we have not yet experienced one. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me that to specially exempt hay and chaff when we are passing a. generally protective Tariff is to give Australia a very undesirable advertisement. The principle that we have in view in passing a generally protective Tariff is that we should encourage industries and productions for which the Commonwealth is suited, and in respect of all such industries we impose stimulating duties. The special exemption of hay and chaff would be a declaration to the rest of the world that Australia was unable, in our opinion, to produce sufficient fodder for her own requirements. In other words, it would seem to indicate that the great primary industries upon which we pride ourselves, and for which Australia is held to be peculiarly suited are, in our opinion, so liable to periodic interruption that we are not prepared to extend to them the same measure of encouragement that we grant to other industries. That would be one of the worst possible advertisements that we could give Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member, in making that statement, is exercising his capacity for bluff, which, after all, is of not much value, since his bluffing is only superficial. I have said nothing that would warrant the honorable member's assertion ; I have said repeatedly that, even when an industry is well established, it may still be necessary to impose protective duties in relation to it, in order to prevent the dumping from abroad of products which are likely to undermine the local production. As long as .prices locally are not unduly inflated against the consumer, protective duties in such circumstances should be maintained. If those who oppose a protective duty on fodder are anxious to help the farmers, they should direct their energies to an effort to break ( up the rings that now control- the supply and distribution of fodder. That is the crux of the question. Australia can produce, and at the present- time holds, more than  the fodder necessary for the starving stock within her borders. As to the suggestion made by 'the honorable member for Wimmera respecting the educational effects of the last drought, one might reasonably have expected it to have a fair measure of influence upon our farmers. In my old electorate of Bland, which comprised a part of the Riverina, many farmers who suffered heavily during the last drought have learned a lesson from it, and. have conserved both natural and specially-grown fodder in ensilage pits, tub silos, and ordinary stacks. These men have not suffered in the slightest degree from the drought. In the case of one big pastoral property those in charge gathered together fodder, of various descriptions ' to such an extent as to insure the management against any loss from drought. My strong conviction is that there is not one beast that need go without fodder because of any scarcity in the supply to be obtained in Australia. It is only a matter of making proper provision for seasons of drought and of our farmers and settlers generally being educated to take advantage of the opportunities Providence has placed at their disposal, and, what is, perhaps, quite as important,- -of insuring that when a time of stress and scarcity arises a few people shall not be able to corner the market. That is what, at the present time, as well as during the last big drought, constituted the principal trouble from which 'those who had to provide for starving stock had to suffer. It was not that supplies were not available from farms in Tasmania or South Australia at reasonable prices, but that middlemen were, with the assistance of the shipping- ring, able to control the whole situation and prevent the farmer or squatter who had starving stock to keep alive from getting access to what should be their natural opportunities for relief. I 'have been asked what steps I would take to deal with the matter. The first step to be taken should be to' nationalize the coastal shipping service of Australia. We should nationalize the steam-ships engaged in our coastal trade, just as we have nationalized our railways, and in that way we should be able to transfer fodder cheaply from one part of the country to another. </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend to enlarge upon it, but it seems to me that a discussion of methods by which a scarcity of fodder in various parts of Australia might be prevented is quite germane to a proposal to impose a duty of is. ' a cwt. on hay and chaff. «I agree with the honorable member for Barker that the difficulties under which our settlers labour in various parts of the Commonwealth during times of drought could, perhaps, best be met by improving and increasing facilities for the cheap transport of fodder.  Of course, in addition, we should require to have farmers' co-operative associations to insure. that fodder from any district might be purchased without the intervention of too many middlemen, or- of rings that, getting control of supplies, put up prices unduly. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. Is the honorable member for Parramatta not aware that our farmers have already established a number of co-operative institutions, which are doing a very great deal of good ? I should imagine that the extension of their operations to the purchase and distribution of fodder need be but. a very small step' in advance. The nationalization of our coastal shipping might be a year or two ahead, but it should not be very many years distant. I dare say that even the honorable member for Parramatta has no objection to help on the millennium. With regard to the special exemption proposed by the honorable member for. Riverina, I do not think that the  suspension of this duty for six months would have any real effect in the direction the honorable member anticipates, because the only place from which fodder might be imported at the present time is the Argentine. Fodder is as dear in New Zealand as in Australia just now,, and we cannot, therefore, expect to get any from that Dominion. Whatever supplies we are to get must be obtained  'Within  the Commonwealth, and they might be obtained much more cheaply than they can be obtained at present if better methods of distribution were devised. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that whatever view we may take of the general question, the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Riverina is absolutely without any logical foundation whatever. Every reason which can be urged in favour of it is a reason in' favour of not imposing such a duty at any time. We all deplore the fact that there is a drought prevailing in the honorable member's ' constituency, and in other parts of Australia similarly situated, but those who support this duty in the interests of the farmers must remember that that very fact affords them an opportunity to avail themselves of the benefit of the duty. Why should we deprive the farmers of the benefit of the duty at the only time at which they can avail themselves of it? For my own part, I am  absolutely opposed to the proposed duty. There is one aspect of the question which has not been touched upon by any honorable member I have yet heard speak upon the subject. It must be remembered that every duty we impose upon an article produced by farmers must be considered from a totally new point of view, in the light of the policy of the new protection adopted by the Government, and which the Prime Minister has stated that he intends to give full effect to. Every farmer, or nearly every farmer, in Australia at some time produces more or less hay and chaff, and, therefore, if the duty, be carried, it may be assumed that it will bring every farmer throughout the length and breadth of Australia within the operation of the drastic provisions proposed by the Government in respect to the new protection. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily so. If a. duty is imposed on hay and chaff, one of the effects under the new policy of the Government, apart from the regulation of wages and working time, must be that the price at which farmers, will be allowed to dispose of their hay and chaff will be regulated by an Act of Parliament or by some body appointed under an Act of Parliament. This particular duty can become effective only at a time when people engaged in the most important industry in Australia are in dire distress and in absolute straits in their endeavours to keep starving stock alive, and if there be any possible time at which it would be justifiable to impose a restriction upon the price of any produce protected under the Tariff, surely that would be the time. </para>

The spirit which actuated the farming community at the time I speak of must cause it now not to seek a duty of which advantage can be taken  only  in times of drought by charging exorbitant prices to those who are suffering dire distress. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member, for Flinders made another statement without proper consideration. He said that the duty on produce is protective only in times of drought. I wish to point out that during an ordinary season in Australia there may be an extraordinary glut elsewhere, and any protectionist will admit that our farmers should be protected from the dumping of  foreign-grown  produce. The honorable member must know that produce can be brought here from the Argentine and California at lower charges  for carriage than have to be paid for taking produce from Melbourne to the interior of Victoria. </para>

It is not that one farmer is taking advantage of the necessities of another, but that nearly all the produce is in the hands of middlemen or speculators. I have travelled a great deal through Victoria recently, and know that, while there have been splendid harvests in many places, so that a great deal of produce is stacked up ready for market, it does not belong to those on whose land it is stacked, but to others who have been cute enough to anticipate a drought, and to secure and exercise an option upon thousands of tons of produce. As a result, those who need produce have to pay the prices asked by the speculators. If the, honorable member thinks that hay and chaff will be imported into Australia at prices which will reduce the cost of fodder to those who are compelled to hand feed their stock, he is not aware of the true circumstances of the case. The honorable member for Riverina is consistent, although the honorable member for Parramatta twitted him with inconsistency. </para>

I wish, therefore, to read, by way of personal explanation, a paragraph from an explanatory -memorandum in regard to new protection, presented by command, and ordered by the House to be printed. It is the_ only authoritative statement of the policy of the Government in this regard which we possess, and paragraph 16 reads as follows - </para>

                    <para>So far, reference has been made only to that aspect of the proposals -which is concerned with the protection of the manufacturer, on the one hand, ' and the employes, on the other. An essential part of the completed scheme, however, is the protection of the consumer by the establishment of machinery to prevent the undue inflation of prices. It is enough to say here that the Board will be charged with the duty of investigating the prices charged by protected manufacturers, and, if these are found to be unreasonable, of reporting that fact to the Minister. The Minister will then be empowered, with the assent of Parliament, to take appropriate action. </para>

The honorable member for South Sydney has stated that it would be a bad advertisement for Australia to admit to the world that she cannot grow the . produce which she needs. I admit that. It is a worse advertisement to say that we, who pride ourselves on our industries, require a duty of  20s.  per ton. The honorable member for South Sydney went further, and said that there are no starving stock in Australia .which cannot be provided with Australian-grown fodder. If that be so, where is the necessity for a duty? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for South Sydney told us that our competitor is not New Zealand, but the Argentine Republic. Three years ago .we on this side asked for a suspension of the fodder duties on the ground that, at that time, the whole of New South Wales was suffering from  severe drought, while Victoria was blessed' with plentiful seasons. However, the House refused to suspend the duties ; and now when the position is reversed, and it is Victoria that is suffering, I am still in favour of perfect freedom of importation. It was not the farmer or the producer who reaped the benefit of the excellent harvests in Victoria three years ago, but, as has been admitted, even by the honorable member for Riverina, the advantage then and now is gained by some shipping or; other ring. Why should I- vote in order to- increase the present or future profits, not of the farmer or producer, but of the middleman ? Whether we are freetraders or protectionists, representatives of the city or of the country, why should w'e, to the extent of  20s.  per ton, assist any ring to keep up prices? I can understand legislation with the object of restricting the operation of rings, but I cannot understand a proposal to fiscally assist them. Allow me to say a word on behalf of the people in my electorate. , </para>

But if free admission of fodder he good for six months, it must be good for six years ; and I cannot see why, at the end of six months, we should extend the proposed assistance to any ring. I have not heard one argument that convinces me that the proposed duty is necessary from, any point of view ; but I intend to -vote with the honorable member for Riverina, in the hope of ultimately having fodder placed on the free list. </para>

                    <para>.- I intend to support the Government in this matter. I should not have spoken had it not been for some startling statements made by the honorable member for Flinders to the effect that it is desired to give an opportunity to people to take advantage of the difficulties of farmers in one part of the country by charging exorbitant prices for fodder. Such a suggestion is both cruel arid unjust; and could only be surpassed if it be true as stated, that English officials in high positions protested to the Viceroy in India against charitable people in England subscribing money to save starving millions in our Eastern Possession. The honorable member for Flinders said that men had offered their fields for starving stock; but I guarantee that for one acre given free, nine acres were charged for, and very heavily. </para>

                        <para>- I know that some men were noble enough to give their paddocks for the use of starving stock ; but the facts are as I have stated. The object of the proposal is to prevent undue inflation of prices, and when we grant protection, it is right that we should have some power in this respect over the industry protected. The soundness of this view is shown in the case of the harvester industry ; and we know that in High Court proceedings of the kind, the splendid abilities of the honorable member for Flinders may be utilized at any time if he is retained. It was a great truth uttered by Charles Sumner that for the betrayal of a country or a great cause, one had not to go far to find a friend ready made in any lawyer we came across. We have heard how the honorable member has argued to-day ; but we know that to-morrow, if the Combine were to retain him, he would argue the other way ; and his legal twisting of the case against the honorable member for Riverina is unworthy of him. If human beings may be punished, it cannot be said that starving stock deserve . any punishment. Our cattle are confined within fences, and are powerless to roam in search of pasture ; man only can assist them, and, in any such cause, my vote shall be found on the side of the helpless. </para>

                    <para>. - I was surprised a little while ago to hear the Treasurer say that he would accept the amendment of the honorable member for Riverina. A few months ago he strenuously opposed any reduction or postponement of the duty. The Committee remitted the duty, but the Senate now wisely requests its restoration. I did think that the Treasurer would seek to have it restored at once, especially as, according to the printed statement which has been circulated, the Government have agreed to accept this request ; yet the Treasurer now wants the. operation of the duty postponed for six months. The duty was imposed in the first Federal Tariff, and has always been retained until now. Seeing that Australia has decided for protection, I do not see why the farmer, as well as the other producers of the community, should not receive some meed of it. </para>

                        <para>- I always voted for moderate protection, when I did vote in that direction. I believe that Australia, when it says that it is protectionist, means that it is so in a moderate degree, and is  not so extreme in its views as to indorse the propositions that used to come from the Government benches. We have heard a good deal about the callousness and hard-heartedness of the farmer in trying to wring these high prices from the poor pastoralists, but, on occasions like the present, when the drought is so extreme, I do not think that the farmer receives the extra <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> per ton supposed to result from this duty. ' As the honorable member for Boothby says, chaff can be obtained in Adelaide at about  £5  per ton. I believe it can be obtained for less than that in Tasmania, and in other places which produce fodder. It is more likely that when the fodder reaches New South Wales it goes into the hands of a ring which, as the honorable member for Riverina said, controls prices. That ring is helped by the fact that New Zealand, which in ordinary years would be the chief competitor with the Australian States, has this year apparently no hay and chaff to export, as the prices ruling in the Dominion will show. That gives the ring a much better chance to corner all the hay and chaff that enters the port of Sydney. The excessive price, when there is a shortage, as at present, is due, not. to the dutv, but to some intermediate body, such as a ring of. middlemen. I do not see why, on that account, the farmers should be penalized. I am sure that the farmers of Australia would be prepared to remit the . duty when prices are as high as they are now, the object of the duty being to protect them in normal seasons. In those times New Zealand might be a competitor, and to give the Australian farmers something like a reasonable price for their produce this duty is imposed, New Zealand should not? be placed in a position to flood the Australian markets. Those are about the only times that the duty will 'prove of actual benefit to the farmer. I take it that we are legislating more for ordinary than for extreme seasons, and, seeing that we are here to give protection, why should we not give fair protection all round? I hope that the Treasurer will move to impose the duty at once, as requested by the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the Committee will carry the is. dub, on 'fodder. We have heard a good deal from the Opposition about the terrible burden which the primary producer would have to bear by paying duties on other articles for the good of other industries, and now, when a dutv is proposed for the benefit of the farmer, surely the members of the Opposition should give him a vote. Like the honorable member for Wilmot, I believe that the main protection which the farmers will get out of this duty will be against New Zealand competition, and not when fodder is very high in price either. When prices are more moderate, the protection will be very useful to them. As for the new protection, and the bugbear raised by the honorable member for Flinders, who tried to drag a red herring across the trail, and raise a scare amongst the farmers, I do not fear that one iota, be-  cause the prices obtained ' to-day by the actual producers are a long way below those paid by the consumers. There is such a large margin of difference -that I feel that a long time will elapse before the new protection is- applied to the farmers. The  amendment of the honorable member for Riverina does not seem very effective. A six months' suspension does not mean much in a great problem like this, but the honorable member has my sympathy. When the stock belonging to one's electors is eating dead rabbits, and there is not a blade of grass to be seen, and the owners of the stock are very much incensed at the position, as they naturally would be, even a small modicum of assistance might be grasped at by an honorable member, and from that stand-point we should sympathize with ' the honorable member for Riverina.  The honorable member for South Sydney has voiced all that I wished to say with regard to distribution, except that the farmers have not co-operated nearly to the extent that they might. I believe that there will be no rational or radical solution of the problem until distribution is undertaken by the Government. The Government undertook the distribution of seed wheat in New South Wales to those in want. The only way to solve the problem as between the producer and the consumer, to insure that the consumer shall pay a reasonable price, and that the producer shall get a reasonable return for his product, is the adoption of a scheme of national distribution. </para>

                    <para>.- The question of a duty on hay and chaff naturally affects my district very closely. I suppose that in my constituency <inline font-style="italic">there</inline> is a larger area of country requiring rain than in any other part of Victoria, but, as a protectionist, I cannot consistently vote for the remission of this duty. I .look upon protection to the agricultural community- as a principle that should apply all round. If the duty of is. per cwt. on hay and chaff is likely to assist the southern farmers, it is the duty of the northern farmers to be loyal to the principle of protection, if it is to apply all round. The retention or remission of this duty will make no material difference to the price. I do not think that there is any reasonable chance of importations from abroad. The price of chaff in New Zealand is about the same as in Australia. The Argentine, so far as I can learn, does not do a great deal of exportation at low prices, so that whether the duty is retained or struck off it will make very little difference to the retail price of chaff. It is very largely a sentimental question, but if the duty is retained, it gives the farmer a sense of security in respect of his future production. For that reason alone, it is necessary that it should be retained. The question of the operation of the new protection might well be discussed by itself. We are dealing now with the question of an import duty on hay and chaff. It will be for us to deal with the new protection when it comes before us. It is not desirable to mix up the two questions. I had intended to go into some figures, but at this late stage of the debate, I do not think that that is necessary. For the last four or five years our exports of hay and chaff have been greater than our imports. In 1906, we imported only 895 cwt. of hay and chaff altogether, and up to the present this year only a small importation has taken 'place. 'From information published from time to time, there is every reason to believe that there is plenty of hay in the southern districts of Australia to supply the requirements of those who can afford to pay a reasonable price for it. When hay reaches <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> a ton, it becomes altogether too dear for people to buy to feed sheep on. </para>

At any rate, I am not discussing present prices, but the prices that people can afford to pay to feed starving stock. When hay reaches £$ a ton, it is already too dear to feed stock on, unless it is for valuable dairy herds or stud stock. The question of the fodder, duties has, therefore, anything but an important bearing on the question of starving stock ii: Australia. As a matter of consistency, and for the sake of the retention of a duty which will apply all round to the agricultural community, I am prepared to vote for the adoption of the Senate's request. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly- still in portions of Victoria and of New South Wales there is a very considerable deficiency, and the exorbitant price of about £&amp; per ton is demanded. I venture to say that the practical effect of this amendment, if made, would be <inline font-style="italic">nil.</inline> Since October last hay and chaff have been on the- free list, but in spite of that fact an abnormal price is demanded. The amendment of the honorable member for Riverina simply proposes that hay and chaff shall be continued on the free list for a further period of six months. To what extent is that likely to affect the price ? I cannot conceive how the remission of the duty for six months is likely to be of the least advantage to the unfortunate persons who are now paying an abnormal price. Too much regard to peculiar circumstances should not be paid in a measure which has to deal with general circumstances. Although we may have a prolific season to-day, still in the course of a year or two we may have a drought, and then it would be impossible to make a special arrangement to meet the situation. We cannot place the people of the Commonwealth on all-fours. We have to look at the question not from a local point of  view, but from a national stand-point, and that must take account of the benefit of Australia as a whole. I voted in favour of placing hay and chaff on the free list not only because of the special circumstances which then existed, but also for a broader reason. I venture to say that if a tax on hay and chaff is likely to be effective in an ordinary season, it is our bounden duty to confer that measure of protection, but normally hay and chaff are sold at such prices that there is no possibility of any importations being made to compete with the local produce. Consequently our farmers have nothing to fear, and so far as they are concerned, the contention that they are benefited by the duty is only a fallacy. </para>

                        <para>- The obvious fact is that a duty on hay and chaff has no protective effect. Some honorable members want to impose a duty for protective purposes, although they know that it is not likely to be effective. They might as well talk about protecting the labour of the miner or bricklayer. That cannot possibly be done. If honorable members put on the. statute-book a duty which seems to give protection, and yet does not, they are only deluding the farmers into the belief that they are going to derive some advantage which cannot possibly be conferred upon them. I am opposed to that method, and for that reason I am prepared to renew the vote which I gave previously, and to vote against the Senate's request. </para>

I cannot call to mind a single season when it has had any practical effect so far as the producers are concerned, and if it has operated on one or two very rare occasions I venture to say that the sum total of the disadvantage altogether outweighs the seeming advantage which the farmers might have derived from its imposition. </para>

It seems to me, therefore, that the duty only becomes operative in a period of great severity, when our own people are suffering. It cannot be shown that when' normal conditions prevail the duty has been operative. I thoroughly support the representations which have been made in opposition to it. Not only will I support the amendment of the honorable member for Riverina, but if the opportunity is offered I shall certainly vote against the continuance of the duty. I hope that the Committee will extend its sympathy to those persons who axe suffering great distress in many portions of the Commonwealth, and that, as a result of this discussion, the duty may be eliminated. </para>

                    <para>- Before a division is taken. I wish to offer a few remarks in . reply to several honorable members. . The honorable member for Flinders went so far as to broadly assert that no one could deny that the fodder duties were only operative in a time of severe stress - that is, during a drought. I interjected that I for one did not subscribe to that view, and similar interjections were made. As a matter of fact, the duties are operative at the very time when the honorable member declared that they were not. Let me cite one instance to prove my contention. We are now dealing with a duty on hay and chaff only. We have dealt with the duties on all kinds of cereals and root crops as fodder for stock, and there is no opportunity of reconsidering our decisions on cereals. Stock-owners of all classes know that cereals are used very largely for keeping stock alive. . ' Dairy farmers know that it is very much more profitable to use cereals and root crops for their herds than to give them dry fodder. Prior to Federation, New South Wales was the one State into which fodder of all kinds could be imported free of duty. In Victoria there was a duty of 2s. per bushel on wheat. The result was that wheat was imported from California and landed in the stores at Sydney for 10s. per ton - that is less than one-half of the price which the local farmer would have to pay for the carriage of his produce to the metropolitan markets. And what happened in New South Wales would happen throughout the Commonwealth if its ports were thrown open to the world in that respect. </para>

                        <para>- Well, my experience is different from that of my honorable friend. To my personal knowledge chaff and compressed fodder have been dumped upon the wharfs of Sydney from New Zealand, Argentina, and California. The effect of those importations on, the local market for cereals was that the millers withdrew their country buyers, snapped their fingers at the farmers of New South Wales, and said to them, " We will not buy your wheat unless you accept our price, because we can buy wheat abroad at so much less than you want, and the sea carriage costs 50 per cent, less than the land carriage." In normal times the duties on fodder do affect, and beneficially affect, the local producers. Some honorable members appear to think only one class of the community is suffering - the pastoralists - and that the farmers are going to rob them. Now it is the farmers who are suffering to-day, and it is for them I am pleading with honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- That is honest. I want honorable members generally to understand what is sought to be done. I claim the votes of those who think that it is better to. suspend the duty for six months than not at all. I ask them to stand by me and to resist the attempt to repeal the duty. I desire to remove one impression which the honorable member for Flinders left by his speech, and I am glad that the honorable member for Gippsland is here to corroborate my statement. There is a strong sympathetic feeling between the farmers of Gippsland and those of the mallee country. Why ? It was because the Gippsland farmers having been visited by a disastrous fire, which practically destroyed their homesteads, the Wimmera farmers extended them a helping hand by saying to them, " Send us along your stock, and we will provide it with grass until you recover from the effects of the calamity which now affects you." As a result, when the Mallee farmers in their turn were suffering from a severe drought, the farmers of Gippsland extended to them reciprocal treatment. . That period; however, has passed. Can the honorable member for Flinders point to a single individual in Victoria who has provided free grass for starving stock this year? </para>

                        <para>- I am merely replying to the statement of the honorable  member  for Flinders that there was no necessity to suspend the operation of this duty, because those who possessed stock but had no grass were always invited by those who had grass to place their starving stock upon it. As a matter of fact, I was in Gippsland during the early portion of this year - the honorable member for Gippsland is in a position to vouch for the accuracy of my statement -and whilst there a paddock was pointed out to me which was under lease for six months to a Riverina grazier who was paying 30s. fin acre for it. Everybody knows that extremely high prices are being asked for the use of such paddocks.' Only last week I was interviewed in the parliamentary buildings by a ruined dairy farmer, who informed me that, after having paid for a considerable period the sum of £8 per ton for chaff with which to feed his 100 head of dairy cattle, which had cost him£6 each, he was obliged to put them in the saleyards, where they  realized only 25s. per head. I recognise that the members of the Opposition intend to support my amendment, but I am sorry that I shall  receive only their temporary assistance, inasmuch as they subsequently intend to vote in favour of placing hay and chaff upon the free list for all time. </para>

                    <para>- I shall vote for the amendment of the honorable member for Riverina. I frankly confess that 1 am unable to see that a duty upon hay and chaff ever becomes operative. During the past six months these articles have been free of duty, and yet not a ton of them has been imported. But this Parliament, having deliberately adopted a policy of protection!, it should be applied fairly all round. We have piled up duties upon almost every article used by the farmer, and I do not see how we can consistently refuse to sanction the imposition of a duty upon hay and chaff. Of course, we all recognise that in ordinary years such a duty will be entirely inoperative. But, when a drought comes along, I do not think that we ought to give the primary producers in one State an advantage which in some cases leads to the absolute impoverishment of farmers in other States. The claim of the honorable member for Riverina, that there is one portion of Australia, suffering from a drought, whose special requirements ought to be met, is, I think a fair one. </para>

If it be a good thing to suspend the operation of a duty for six months, would it not be equally ' a good thing to suspend its operation entirely? Irrespective of what action honorable members may take in accordance with some compromise, of the terms of which I am not cognisant, I wish to say that a majority of this Committee is opposed to the duty which it is now proposed to levy upon hay and chaff. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite true. There were five members absent who were not paired, four of whom would have voted in favour of placing hay and chaff upon the free list. If, upon that occasion there were a majority of four members in favour of the adoption of that course, that number has increased to eight or nine now. Upon a question of this kind - seeing that we definitely know the opinions of honorable members - it is only fair that every absentee  should be "paired." I am sure that in these democratic days, honorable members do not wish to take advantage of the difficulties which occasionally result in some honorable members being absent unpaired to sneak through something which is not in accord with the expressed opinions of the majority. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member occasionally does not keep his bargains, though he often makes them. If he suspects that I have the numbers, let it be proved by pairing up the whole Committee. I cannot understand his action in refusing pairs, unless it be due to a determination to sneak through this duty, notwithstanding the popular objection to it. If Ministers take advantage of the temporary absence of some honorable members, they must salve their own consciences. I give them warning that this is not the last that will be heard of the matter, but that the question will be tested again later, on a proposal to recommit. I understand that it will be possible to move for a recommittal. I do not think the Government has acted fairly. </para>

                    <para>. - It is all very well for the Treasurer to say " Let it go " ; I wish to protest' against the action of the Government in treating us scurvily in the matter of pairs. The fact is that the Committee as a whole is opposed to the duty, but, owing, to unfortunate circumstances beyond control, the vote about to be taken is likely to go in favour of the. Government. Therefore I, for one, shall not be content with the result, and intend to take advantage of a subsequent occasion to. ascertain the mind of the Committee. There are six or seven members away, for whom we cannot obtain pairs. This is scurvy treatment from members who live in or close to Melbourne, seeing that many other members have to travel thousands of miles to get here. Incidents like this make one wish that Parliament was meeting far from Melbourne, so that members would have to share alike the inconvenience of travelling long distances from their homes to attend' its sittings. They would then have to meet us in a fairer spirit. </para>

                    <para>-  I regret that I was not present to vote against the proposal of the honorable member for Riverina to postpone the operation of the duty until November. It was most illogical for him to ask for a postponement of the duty merely because there is now a drought in the Riverina. A short time hence there may be a drought elsewhere. Either there should be no duty, or a duty should be imposed at once, as in the case of other articles. At the present time, owing to the recent bountiful rains and warm weather, abundance of fodder is obtainable on the New South Wales coast, the people there having, not only enough for their own requirements, but also plenty to sell. The honorable member for Riverina, however, objects to them making a fair profit by selling to his constituents, and has proposed the postponement of the operation of the duty until November, by which time he hopes that Providence, which is apparently overlooking his district now, will have sent  rain there. I emphatically protest against this postponement. The proposal to make hay and chaff dutiable is absurd, because any duty can operate only at the expense of pastoralists and dairymen who are suffering by reason of drought. The proposed duty, if operative at all, will be operative in favour of, perhaps, one State when some, or perhaps all, of the others are suffering. The Minister might fairly take up a more liberal attitude. It is upon the pastoral and agricultural industries that the prosperity of this country is becoming more and more dependent. Every year the amount of capital invested in dairying is increasing, and it is impossible to make dairying pay during periods of drought in the face of high fodder duties. The recent experience of Sydney is that scarcity of fodder increases the price of milk to the people. If those who are opposed to the duty are defeated on this occasion, and a recommittal is moved for, I shall vote for it. </para>

                        <para>- Such a label would', undoubtedly, be an advertisement, since it would refer to other than the actual manufacturers of the goods; The Department should have no difficulty in dealing with persons who attempted to evade- the payment of the proper duty by resorting to such methods. Any printed matter, in order to be outside the provision against advertising, must necessarily relate to the goods within the boxes. I agree with, the honorable member for North Sydney that, if we are going to make the requested amendment, we should give- reasonable notice, but I would remind him that if we provide that this amendment shall not take effect until 1st September next, the extra  duty that has been collected' under, the paragraph, up to the present time, will have to be refunded, since there will be no authority for its collection. I therefore prefer to stand by the Item as it left this House. </para>

T think that we ought to carry the paragraph as originally passed by us.

My desire is to meet the views of honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that the alteration of the wording would not take effect until the date fixed, but it would have no effect upon the operation of the duty. It has been suggested to me that to meet the objection raised by the honorable member for North Sydney we should add to- paragraph  d  of the item - as it passed this House the words, " and on and after 1st September,  1908,"  and then the words of the Senate's request. That would not affect the duty in any way. </para>

                    <para>. - That would not altogether meet my objection. This may be considered a small matter from one point of view, but from another it is very important. I point out, in addition to what I said before, that the proposed amendment would prevent a manufacturing firm printing its registered brand on goods imported to Australia. That is a most drastic step to take. We permit firms to register brands and print them on packets containing their goods, but the proposed amendment would prevent the printing on match-boxes of the brands by which the manufactures of certain firms have been known for years, if the goods are imported. The brand by which the matches made by certain manufacturers might be known might be a pyramid, a diamond, or a star, or any other device; but it could not under the proposed amendment be imprinted on boxes of imported matches: The proposal is that without a penalty nothing can be printed on the box but the manufacturer's name and address and a description of the article contained therein. That is an extraordinary Customs provision. </para>

                        <para>- I should say so ; and as such it would be covered by the form in which the item left this 1 House. There are of course two views as to whether it is desirable to prevent that kind of thing, but surely we do not wish to take the extreme step of preventing a firm that has been exporting matches -to Australia, for perhaps a score of years, . printing its distinctive brand upon the boxes in which they are contained ?I should say that no such proposition was ever before made in connexion with a Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- But I point out that the Minister does not want the revenue that would be derived in these cases. He is prepared to permit the importers to escape the payment of the duty proposed if they are careful to print only certain specific things on the boxes containing the matches, and to comply, in the case of the next request, with the provision as to the number of matches contained in a box. In the circumstances, I ask that the importer should be given fair notice of the altered requirements of the Tariff. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Minister will not agree to any proposal to revert to the wording of the item as it passed this House. Under that wording, the Customs Department found it impossible to carry out the wish of the House. Honorable members are aware that the intention was to prevent firms carrying on business here, and drawing from Australia virtually the whole of their returns, having  their advertising matter printed <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> other parts . of the world, in . such countries as Germany and Sweden. Some firms have found it possible to evade the wording of the item as it passed this House, by printing in front of the word " matches " the name of the particular commodity they had been previously accustomed to advertise in this way.I fail to understand why the honorable member for North Sydney should ask that these firms should be permitted to continue this practice for another three months. </para>

                    <para>- I feel that the Committee is about to do a very grave injury to a number of people who are trying to encourage local manufactures. There are people in Australia who are having the whole of their advertising matter printed in the country.' They will be placed at a disadvantage by paying more than others who have been getting around the resolution carried  in this chamber months ago. They : are to be penalized for six months. This is a question of principle arid consistency. I am sorry to find so staunch a protectionist' as the Treasurer giving way on such a point, and I regret- that a Government of which I have been a loyal supporter should adopt such an attitude. Perhaps I should receive more consideration if I were to sit on the Opposition benches, because it seems to me that to sit behind the Government is about: the surest way to have no notice taken of .what one desires. </para>

It is true that the boxes also have stamped on them, in accordance with the law.. " Made in Japan." The Japanese, according to official statist tics, make matches for less than id. per. gross of boxes. In consequence of their cheap production they have absolutely wiped out the Swedish matches on our eastern coasts. Iri England women and girls employed in making matches were paid' only 2jd. per gross of boxes; but even at that rate how could they possibly compete with the Japanese? I trust that .the Go,vernment will submit their proposal in such a way that no favours will be conferred upon persons who have their ' advertising done on these cheap foreign match-boxes.' . </para>

If a division is called for, I shall vote to give no more than two or three months' notice. . To give two months' notice would be quite sufficient, because those manufacturers who have sent orders abroad would be able to send cables cancelling them. </para>

                    <para>. - This is a matter which is not really of very vital importance. Under the Tariff as it left this Chamber, these duties have been collected ; and, presumably as the Tariff will have to go back to the Senate, these duties will remain in force for some time longer. The statement I have from the Department is that the practice complained of is being prevented as far as possible, and that, in spite of considerable difficulty, the efforts are to a great extent successful. During the interval the Department will have to do the best they can to deal with the few persons who are carrying on the practice. Bui from October the offence will not be possible. I cannot do more than agree to fix the limit at October. </para>

What I said was that there were shippers of matches who did not advertise other people's goods on their boxes, and, in reply to the honorable member for Melbourne, I instanced Messrs. Bryant and May and other firms. Now. the honorable member for Laanecoorie says that I stated that Messrs. Bryant and May would have to pay the higher duty under this item if their matches came in in the present boxes after the1st, October. I said nothing of the sort. </para>

                        <para>- I have repeated the statement I made. I do not know whether such would be the case or not; but if the honorable member will show me the boxes of matches I should be able to tell him. If Messrs. Bryant and May's boxes bear anything beyond the manufacturer's name and address, the trade mark, and a description of the article, they will be excluded from the lower duty after the1st October, although they advertise nothing else; and so with regard to the boxes of other firms who do not advertise other people's goods. This is an extraordinary condition to impose, and if it must be imposed let fair notice be given, so that firms who. do not print on their labels the very words prescribed shall not be penalized. Matches are usually shipped by sailing vessels; and I accept the notice suggested, though. I do not think , it is long enough. </para>

                    <para>. - In my opinion the new paragraph ought to be left just as it has been sent down by the Senate. I have no doubt that those manufacturers who have been supplying the proper number of matches are aware of what the Senate has been doing, and have taken care to see that their labels are all right. If we alter the date as proposed, we shall allow an extension of one month to those who have not been treating the public fairly. </para>

                    <para>. - This amendment, affords another example of what happens to a Government when they begin to give way to the Opposition. If Ministers had done what I begged them to do, they would have fixed upon the 1st of August as the latest date for the first paragraph to come into operation. Had they taken that course, they would hot have found the members of the Opposition' anxious to bring this paragraph into operation on the same date as the previous paragraph. It is pleaded that we should give to those who have not been putting a sufficient number of matches in their boxes further time to swindle the public. For that purpose we are asked to delay the operation of this paragraph for five months instead of four months, as requested by the Senate. I think that it was very liberal indeed in fixing upon the1st September as the date on which the new paragraph should come into force. </para>

                    <para>.-I trust that the Committee will not agree to the amendment proposed by the honorable member for North Sydney. This matter is quite different from that dealt with in paragraph d, which was only a question of new wording. In this case it is a question of imposing a new duty. I have been informed by the Department that, as soon as this proposal was carried in the Senate, the match importers communicated with the Department, and have made their arrangements to conform to it. They will practically have had six months by 1st September in which to do it. That ought to be long enough for them to make their arrangements for any alteration. This matter is in a different category from the previous one, because if they have been sending boxes which do not contain the correct number of matches- </para>

We have already imposed a duty of1/2d. per lb. upon mustard seed, which was previously admitted free, and as it takes 2 lbs. of seed to make 1 lb. of mustard, it follows that the manufacturer's cost of production has been increased to the extent of1d. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- I believe it to be an absolute fact that it takes 2 lbs. of mustard seed to manufacture 1 lb. of mustard. The duty on the mustard seed is therefore equivalent to1d. per lb. upon the manufactured article, and the proposal of the Senate, that we should extend a preference of1d. per lb. to Great Britain in addition, would have the effect of practically wiping out the protection afforded to this industry. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will refuse to agree to the request of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FAIRBAIRN</inline> (Fawkner) [8.5]. - I do hope that the Treasurer will not agree to the request of the Senate. In this case, the question of preference does not enter into consideration, because the value of the mustard imported from the United Kingdom is£41,445, whereas the value of that imported from other countries totals only </para>

                        <para>- It is perfectly hopeless to argue with the honorable member. Mustard seed - which is the raw material of this industry - was formerly admitted free, but under this Tariff it has been made dutiable at1/2d. per lb. As it takes 2 lbs. of seed to manufacture 1 lb. of mustard, it follows that the cost of production has been increased by1d. per lb. It is only fair, therefore, that we should increase the duty which was formerly operative upon the manufactured article from 2d. to. 3d. per lb. In other words, we should place the manufacturers in the same position that they formerly occupied. I trust that the Treasurer will stand to his guns. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that there is some principle of vital interest involved in the question of the duty upon mustard. Apparently the whole important principle of preferential trade rests upon it. The chief contention of the honorable member for New England was that small interests, demanded consideration if they were to thrive. If he applies that doctrine in the present instance, he must vote in favour of extending a preference to the United Kingdom. It has been shown that the imports of mustard from foreign countries are exceedingly small, and if the honorable member is prepared to encourage such imports by refusing to grant a preference to Great Britain, they will eventually assume quite as large dimensions as those from Great Britain. </para>

                    <para>. - The argument of the honorable member for Wentworth, in this case, completely falls to the ground, because the  principle of preferential trade should be applied only in cases where the importations from Great Britain have been, or are likely to be, superseded by those from foreign countries. In the present instance, the United Kingdom already commands practically the whole of the trade, so that the principle of preferential trade is not involved. </para>

                        <para>- The Comptroller-General's memorandum does not clear up the difficulty. What he says is quite right, where a duty is fixed to become immediately operative. The difficulty arises when we determine that the date when a duty shall be operative shall be, not immediately, but some time ahead. The governing resolution which we passed last night provides that the duty shall commence from the date of an amendment being made by the Committee ; not the date which is fixed by the Committee, but the date of the amendment being made by the Committee. That is the difference. Immediately after passing that resolution, we proceeded in several cases to fix dates for the operation of duties' three or six months ahead. What we are now doing is in direct conflict with the resolution we passed last night. </para>

                        <para>. - The amendment requested by the Senate, in this case, would, if made, be attended by very serious consequences. With a duty of 3s. 4d. per cental on uncleaned rice, it would pay rice merchants to import cleaned rice under a duty of 4s. 3d. per cental rather than to import uncleaned rice at 3s. 4d. per cental and clean it here. One hundred pounds of uncleaned rice yields 70 lbs. of cleaned rice, the balance being waste and rice meal. The duty of 3s. 4d. per cental on uncleaned rice would, therefore, apply to the 70 lbs. of cleaned rice obtained from that quantity, and would be equal to 4s. 9d. on 100 . lbs. of cleaned rice, or 6d. per cental more than the Senate's proposal in respect of imported cleaned rice. Another  point is that it costs about1s. 3d. per cental to clean rice here. It is, therefore, important that the duty on the cleaned rice should be restored to 6s. per cental, to preserve the local industry of rice cleaning.. As soon as this amendment was requested by the Senate, persons engaged in the trade or connected with it pointed out to me that its acceptance would be attended by serious consequences. In the circumstances, it ' is my duty to urge the Committee not to agree to the request. I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>. - The Senate in this case request that the weight of the packets be reduced from 20 lbs. to 5 lbs. The reason I fixed the weight at 20 lbs. in the first instance was to provide for a package which would be just under the weight of a quarter-chest of tea, so that there might be no opportunity afforded for an evasion of the intention with which this item was introduced. I should not object to fixing the weight at 19 lbs., but I do not agree to' the request of the Senate, and. I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>. - I congratulate the Treasurer 'upon the very generous concession of 1 lb. in 20 lbs., which he announced his willingness to make in the reduction of the weight of packet tea subject to this duty.- I prefer the reduction suggested by the Senate. Honorable senators seem to have taken a reasonable view of this matter, and I regret that the Treasurer has moved that the requested amendment be not made. Really, there is no reason in the honorable gentleman; and I am afraid that we. must permit him to go his own way. So far as I am concerned, he can have the 1 lb. he offers. I do not want it. </para>

                        <para>- The intention of the Committee in agreeing to the item originally was to insure that the packing of tea in i-lb. and J-lb. packets should be done in the Commonwealth. Some tea has always been imported to Australia in 10-lb. and "20-lb. boxes of wood lined. with lead. These are not ordinary packets, such as are the i-lb. and J-lb. packets, which it was intended to make dutiable if imported from abroad. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, the less tea is exposed the better. The trade done in packing tea in the Commonwealth is not affected by the importation of tea in these 10-lb. and 20-lb. boxes. The tea packed. in Australia is tea imported in bulk, in 40, 60, and 80-lb. chests. It is packed in i-lb. and J-lb. packets, and not generally in boxes  containing  10 lbs. or 20 lbs. </para>

The 10-lh. and 20-lb. boxes of tea to which I refer will continue to be imported, because tea is required packed in that form. On that tea the consumers will have to pay the duty of id. per lb., so that we are really imposing a duty on tea, whilst professing that we  have no wish to do so. </para>

                        <para>- I think the Minister will find that he is wrong, because machinery is not used to pack tea in 10-lb. and 20-lb. boxes, whilst it! can be used effectively for making up1/2-lb. and 1 -lb.' packets. The reduction of the weight of the packages by 1 lb. is a very slight concession, and I repeat that under this  item we are really imposing a duty on tea. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Minister will adhere to his intention to fix 19 lbs. as the weight of the packet of tea liable to duty under this item. The honorable member for North Sydney has been misinformed when he says that the only packing business done here is the packing of tea in1/2-lb. and1-lb. packets, and that machinery is used only in putting up tea in packets of that size. Machinery is at present being used in putting up tea in 14-lb., 20-lb., and 28-lb. packets. </para>

                        <para>- There is another drum for blending. It is possible that tea merchants may wish to import special teas in packages for blending, but importers of teas worth, perhaps, a guinea per lb., can well afford to pay a duty of1d. per lb. if they import if in packages. I am concerned only in protecting the interests of the general consumer, and that end is gained by allowing bulk teas to be imported free. </para>

This is an industry which ought not to be allowed to die .out in Australia, because, in* my opinion, we ought to be able to manufacture corsets as well as import them.

' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MALONEY</inline> (Melbourne) [9.18]. - I hope the Committee, will not agree to the motion of the Treasurer. If the honorable . gentleman had made any inquiries from ' officers of the Department, and others, he would have found that corsets, in the proper sense of the word, are not made in Australia. The so-called very low-priced corsets made here are really not corsets, but are what are known as " ribbon band stays," which any clever girl, with a certain machine, can make. Corsets, in the proper sense of the word, are the result of the labours of gene-, rations of workers, particularly in France, with which country this industry is most closely associated. I presume that the Treasurer refers to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. White,</inline> the manufacturer in Sydney, as having had to close his works. It has been said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. White</inline> had a thriving industry, and, while I wish that were the fact; the  newspapers of the last few days tell ' us that he has voluntarily sequestrate.d his estate. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the reason. Fashions change, and, as they change, the figures of women are moulded by the kind of corsets used. Four or five years ago there was a change in the fashion, and large stocks of the older sort were left in the various warehouses, and had to be got rid of somehow. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. White,</inline> I am credibly informed, purchased large quantities of those stays at a minimum of cost, and altered them for the market by removing the bones and steel, shortening them, and so forth. That was altering and mending, not making corsets. It was stated that something like 365 hands were employed in the factories in New South Wales, but that is absolute rubbish. In 1905, under a Tariff of 25 per cent., which", with costs and charges* ran up to about 40 per cent., there were, four makers in Victoria, employing forty-four workers, and making stays at from <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 2s. to ,£15 15s. I am endeavouring to obtain a lower duty so that the wives and daughters of the workers will not be continually made to pay a higher price. With the active work which they do, their stays will not last so long as would higher-priced pairs made to order. They purchase stays at 2s. nd. The existing duty has raised that price to 3s. 6d. That class of article wears out very much quicker, owing to the amount of stooping necessitated by constant house work. I am perfectly certain that the average stays made by Madame Masseran will run to ^3 3s. or <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> 4s., and up to <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> 10s. and <inline font-style="italic">£12</inline> 12s. per pair, according to order. With suspenders added, the cost would be even more. It is impossible for the wife of a worker to obtain a garment of that kind. The makers of Such high-priced articles would not care if a duty of even '200 or 300 per cent, were imposed, because their customers would obtain them from them no matter what the duty was. I have a friend who has lived in England for the last eight years, and who still orders his boots from Collins-street simply because the Melbourne maker suits his requirements, and makes to his order. I was informed that Madame Masseran has clients travelling on the Continent who send to her for their stays, as she has their measure. In Bourke-street ribbon band stays can be purchased for is. 1 id., but they are simply bands of ribbon which any girl with a proper machine can make. They are not corsets. The making of corsets seems to have gone entirely into the hands of the French. America, ' when its population was 30,000,000, endeavoured to establish .the industry. It made no mistake about the duty, for it charged no less than 60. per cent. After considerable loss of time and money the industry was established when that wonderful increase of population that has distinguished America took place. It was aided by the quick transit between America and European ports, and by the natural acumen and ability of the American manufacturer, who will select his workmen from any part of the world, and take them to where he wants them. But when an American proprietary company endeavoured to start, and laid down .works and machinery at Plymouth, in England, they found the greatest difficulty in' educating the supposed highly trained English workmen. It is acknowledged throughout the world that this work is a specialty, oftentimes running through generations of one family, and France seems to hold the key to it. When in Brisbane during  the recent election, I made inquiries about the matter. The managing director of Messrs. Finney, Isles, and Co.,- a very large firm, who is a personal friend of my own, assured me that they made corsets only at from 35s. That gentleman is perhaps one of the keenest business men in Australia. He added' that corsets used in surgery were made by them, some at a lower and some at a higher price. This duty is purely a revenue one, and I, as a protectionist, object to it. If there was a chance of these articles being manufactured here, I should vote for a protective duty. If the Government honestly intend to encourage the industry, they should start a Government factory, and then, people would know that the prices would be according to sample. The Treasurer cannot look, rae in the eyes and say that this is anything but a revenue duty. </para>

                    <para>- - I thought that the Treasurer, out of his kindness of heart, would concede  this point. But I see that he is still a bar of iron, or a Roman father, and will not give in. I may be charged with slipping on stays. The moment a protectionist objects to a duty, he is told that he is slipping. I agree with the honorable member for Melbourne, that this is simply a revenue duty. I should like to make these articles free, but I' will not risk taking that step. The corsets manufactured here are high  priced.  I am certain that the Treasurer has been misinformed in regard to a firm in Sydney, making them for 3s. 6d. The whiteworkers of Australia are paid low enough as it is. In this trade they must be paid still lower at those prices, out of which it would be impossible, considering the amount of work that would have to be done, to pay a living wage. Seeing that there is no 'possibility of the greater number of these articles being manufactured here, the Committee should agree to -the Senate's request. Honorable members who are  protectionists  cannot possibly be charged with abandoning protection by taking that course, because this is. simply a revenue, and not a protective, duty. </para>

                    <para>.- I know very little about this subject, and, therefore, I speak with the greater freedom. I hope the Treasurer will see his way to agree to the Senate's request. The increase which he proposes is somewhat trivial. </para>

                    <para>. - In this Chamber, the Treasurer agreed to the duties of 35 and 30 per cent., but in the Senate he set his colleague to work to undo that to which he had agreed here. After an unsuccessful attempt on my part to reduce the original duties of 40 and 35 per cent, to 25 per cent, the Committee, at the instance of the honorable member for Melbourne, agreed to duties of 35 and 30 per cent. That  proposal was agreed to by the Treasurer without a division. </para>

                        <para>- I think that it was disgraceful for the honorable gentleman to. agree to a proposal in this Cham'ber, leading us to believe that he was in concurrence with us, and then behind our backs to undo what we did through the agency of a Minister elsewhere. That is a disgraceful proceeding on the part of a responsible Minister. </para>

                        <para>- I ought not in the Treasurer's presence. For one Minister to deliberately undo the work done in another Chamber by his colleague, with that colleague's concurrence, is without precedent in the history of responsible government. It is a piece of deception, such a» I hope will not be indulged in again. I trust that the Committee will give the Treasurer his answer to-night by reverting to the duties which were agreed to in this Chamber. </para>

                    <para>. - More than once the honorable member has used language in regard to myself for which he knows perfectly well there is no justification whatever. Honorable members are aware that when the Tariff was under consideration in this House there were dozens of occasions upon which I did not divide the Committee, because I knew that I could not get the duties that I desired. At the same time, I did not concur in the' decisions arrived at, and I repeatedly said so. Did 'the honorable member imagine for one moment, that 'the Tariff was to be forwarded from this Chamber to another, and the work which had been done here was to be destroyed by the members of his party, whilst the hands of Ministers were to be tied ? He is taking an absolutely one-sided view of this matter. In regard to this particular item,. I knew nothing whatever about the intention of the Senate to increase the duty upon it until after it had been increased. I never spoke to my colleagues in the other Chamber about it. </para>

                        <para>- They supported almost every reduction. If a private member in another place submitted a request for an increase of duty which Ministers thought they should support, why should not they be at liberty to support it ? So far as I am concerned, I never upon one occasion agreed to a duty upon an item here, which was afterwards interfered with by Ministers, in the Senate. Honorable members know the difficulty that I experienced in piloting the Tariff through this Chamber, and they know that' when I found it was not possible to secure the duties which I desired, I  had  to bow to the inevitable. . But I did not concur in the decisions arrived at. </para>

                    <para>. - Upon a previous occasion this question was decided in comparatively a full Committee, and it is to be regretted, that an attempt should be made in rather a thin Committee to upset the decision which was then arrived at. I do not think that any useful purpose is to be served by obstructing the passage of this item, because, as honorable members all know, we shall have an opportunity of seeking the recommittal of it at a later stage. I think that we require a full Committee to determine whether an honorable understanding ought, to be departed from. I do not think that such a. departure is ' one which the Committee will tolerate. </para>

But I think that after the statement which he made yesterday, and the statement which he has made to-day, every member of this Committee will regard anything in the nature of an acceptance by the Government of any proposal put from the Chair with considerable suspicion. Whatever view the Minister may submit, I understood the arrangement made to be a compromise. </para>

I point out to the Minister that after the decision in question was arrived at, we passed various other duties ; and having reduced the duty on apparel and attire by 5 per cent., it was represented that we should make alterations in those other duties in keeping with that reduction. We did so. Now the desire is to disturb entirely the relationship between the duties. </para>

                        <para>- But the Minister must remember that after we had reduced this duty it was urged as a reason why we should pass other items at particular rates, that this reduction had been made.. Therefore we are now asked to go back on what we did at the Minister's request. We are asked to change this duty and to leave the other duties as they are. </para>

I was sorry to hear the strong, . and, I think, the unjustifiable language which has been used. The honorable member for North Sydney has said something with respect to certain duties being subsequently fixed so as to harmonize with the duty adopted in connexion with this item. I am assured, on very good authority, that one of the principal considerations that: induced a very large majority in the Senate to adopt the suggestion sent down by us, was the wish to secure greater harmony. That decision was arrived at by a majority of fifteen to nine. </para>

                        <para>- It was nearly a two to one decision. I believe that the most potent factor which actuated the majority in another place was the desire to make this duty harmonize with other duties which had been carried. As a matter of fact, the duties of 35 and 30 per cent, did not harmonize with the other duties which had been carried by this Chamber. I have it on very good authority that that was the view of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- Those engaged in business hold also that opinion. Under our present system, cases have to be broken open, and importers are put to a great deal of trouble, and to loss in some instances. If the duty were carried as suggested by another place, this trouble would not be necessary, since all the duties would be on the same level. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not desire to enter into the somewhat heated controversy which has arisen as to whether there has been an actual breach of faith in this matter or not. But I have a pretty clear recollection of what actually took place on the occasion in question. As honorable members will recollect, for some days before the vote took place on this very important item there was a good deal of discussion amongst honorable members on all sides, as to the rate of duty which should ultimately be adopted. Some were in favour of a duty of 35 per cent. ; some favoured 30 per cent., and some 25 per cent. It was understood that, in any case, the Government proposals would be reduced. </para>

                        <para>- I was about to say that I do not think the Government made a public statement to that effect in, at all events, the early stages of the debate. My recollection is that the honorable member for Melbourne moved - and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> shows that he did - that the duty in the general column be reduced to 35 per cent. The honorable member for Parramatta then moved, as a prior amendment, that the duty be reduced to '25 per cent. That proposal, after being debated, was lost by a majority of seven. The honorable member for Corangamite then moved that the duty be 30 per cent., and' my recollection is that it was at that point that honorable members were given to understand that if they would agree to. the duty under the general . Tariff being reduced to 35 per cent., the Government would not oppose the reduction. No public statement was made to that effect, but I have a clear recollection that there was such an understanding. </para>

The honorable member for Wimmera was among the number. I must confess that I do not remember any </para>

If the Treasurer admits that that is correct, then I think that the honorable member for Parramatta has a very strong case in asking the Government not" to agree to the Senate's request. </para>

                    <para>.-I propose to refer, not to any understanding entered into, but to the fact that it is not in accord with the spirit of the Constitution for the Treasurer to support any request by the Senate to increase duties passed by this House. The Constitution not only provides that the Senate may not amend Bills dealing with taxation, but contains an express provision against its so amending any Bill as to increase a burden or charge upon . the people. The Senate is entitled to make suggestions, but we should have some ruling for our guidance. Taking the wording of the Constitution for my guidance, I think it is almost incumbent upon the Treasurer to ask the Committee to refuse to agree to requests by the Senate for increased duties. Only a Minister may propose these additions. Take the case of a State having twenty or twenty-five representatives in this House, eighteen or nineteen of whom are free-traders. Is the will of the people of that State expressed by those eighteen or nineteen representatives in this House, or by two or three of their representatives in another place? It would be absurd if the rates of duty were to be determined by the views of three or four members of another place, who cannot possibly represent the masses of the people of the larger States: In imposing Customs duties, we are dealing with matters affecting the people in the mass. These views certainly influence me. We are entitled, having regard to section 53 of the Constitution, to pay a good deal of respect to requests by the Senate that duties be decreased ; but there is an express prohibition against the Senate so amending Bills as to increase a burden or charge upon the people. Taking that as my guide as to what requests we ought to accept, I think we should vote against every request to increase the duties in the schedule as passed by this House. </para>

                    <para>.- The proposal to restore the duty under the general Tariff to 40 per cent, would not be in keeping with the duty under the general Tariff on item 106, which the Government proposed should be 45 per cent. The duty under the general Tariff, on item <inline font-style="italic">106,</inline> was reduced from 45 per cent, to 40 per cent., and to 35 per cent, in the case of imports from the United Kingdom. A corresponding reduction of 5 per cent, in the duties under item 107 was then made. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. By that reduction the difference proposed by the Government between the duties on items 106 and 107 was preserved. There is no doubt that the Government agreed to that arrangement, and I certainly think it is unprecedented for the Government to have one opinion in this House and another in the Senate. I also agree with the honorable member for Angas that it is monstrous that we should be considering requests by. the Senate for increased duties. I argued this point yesterday, and I think that the honorable member for Angas has strengthened my contention. The honorable member has discussed the question raised by me from another and very important point of view. Allowing that the Senate has the right to submit requests for increases of the burdens of the people - which I do not admit for a moment, although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Speaker</inline> has ruled that the Senate has. that right - there is no reason whatever why this House should accept such requests. ' Honorable members of this House should maintain its privilege to alone possess the right to impose burdens upon the people. . </para>

                    <para>. -I should like the Minister to move the insertion, after the word " flour," of the words " salt, gypsum, and manure." That would allow of the free importation, not of bags, which are made in the Commonwealth, but of sacks, which are imported. There was some confusion in regard to the matter, and the Minister agreed to have things set right in the Senate. But that was not done. It is impossible to prevent the use as salt, gypsum, and manure bags, of corn sacks, which can be imported free, and therefore we might as well allow sacks to be imported specifically for such use. </para>

I am sure that the Committee does not wish to do an injustice, and. therefore point out that manure imported in bags is admitted free, including the bags. As no protection is given to the local manufacturers of manure, they should not be put on a worse footing than the importers by being made to pay duty on their bags. </para>

                        <para>- But sacks are quite a "different matter. At the first division, when this matter was previously before us, the item, including salt, gypsum, and manure bags, was carried in the form in which it appears. The next day it was struck out, but, instead of being struck out altogether, the word " sacks " should have taken the place of " bags." That was desired by the Committee, and by the bag-makers, who had no objection to offer in reference to the sacks, but took exception particularly to the small hessian and calico bags. If you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> rule that this modification cannot be moved, we shall have to see whether it cannot be made on recommittal. </para>

                        <para>-  I merely wish to refer to the point of order which has been raised, as it is rather important in the relation of one House to the other. I should be very sorry to urge the Committee to adopt any rule that would unduly curtail our powers. On the other hand, we may be in danger of adopting a rule which would place it in the hands of the Senate, by making some small suggestion, to give us a power of review which the Constitution would not give us if the Senate had not made such a suggestion. The point raised by the right honorable member for Swan is not only important, but I see no answer to it at the present time. The request which comes from the Senate is to include sugar sacks with a number of other sacks in the free list ; and all we can do is set forth in the following words in the Constitution - </para>

                <para>We can make the amendment which the Senate requests, or decline to make it, or, if we make it, it may be with modification. The essence of the request is that one particular article shall be included in this particular free list. Could it  De  said to be a modification if we replied, "Yes, we will include sugar sacks, but we will also include a lot of other articles?" In the next item, for example, there are words " Blankets (except of Rubber), Blanketing Flannels," and so forth. In that item the Senate suggests that the words " whether plain, fancy or printed " shall be inserted after " Flannels." </para>

It could not be suggested that we could take such a step.

                        <para>-  Perhaps,' that is so, but it is only a difference in degree. It would be rather dangerous to say that the Senate's suggesting an amendment, no matter how insignificant, in any part of the item, gives us the power to re-open a matter which, without such a suggestion, has been absolutely closed. </para>

                        <para>-  Yes, and thereby re-open a whole range' of subjects which have, by parliamentary rule, been closed. There must be some finality, and all  wc  do must be in reference to what the Senate has actually, done, which,' in this instance, has been to exclude every other kind of sack except sugar sacks. This is more than a matter of relevancy. It involves the well-known parliamentary rule, which has existed since time immemorial, and without which there would be no finality, to our debates, or to the consideration of any subject as to which differences of opinion existed. What the honorable member desires would be equivalent to the Senate initiating taxation, which they cannot do. The  President  of that Chamber ruled distinctly upon that point. He would not permit to be made any requests that would have th, effect of initiating taxation. </para>

                        <para>-  Saddlebag was somewhere else in the Tariff. The honorable member cannot find salt, gypsum, and manure sacks anywhere else in- the Tariff, and therefore the proposal of the honorable member for Boothby would be actually introducing new items which it had already been decided by both Houses to exclude from the schedule. If we do that we shall never reach finality. The point raised by the honorable member for Swan is a good one, and must stand as against the contention of the honorable member for Boothby. </para>

There is no duty upon their finished product, and they have to pay a duty on  their bags. ' Other industries, which enjoy the benefit of heavy duties, have free bags. I ask the Treasurer to consider this line of industry,' and if there is any method by which he can put these sacks on the free list to adopt it. </para>

                <para>Senate is the insertion of the word " sugar " in relation to the word " sacks." It would be quite in order for an amendment to be moved in this Chamber to provide that they should be  50-lb.  sacks - I understand that they are now 75-lb. sacks - or that they should be made of some particular kind of material. But it would be distinctly out of order, and be creating an entirely new item not relevant to the requested amendment, to include salt, gypsum, and manure sacks, as the honorable member for Boothby proposes. I rule that the honorable member's amendment is not in order. </para>
