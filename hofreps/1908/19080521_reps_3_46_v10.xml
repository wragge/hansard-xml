                        <para>- I have no official information, but .that from unofficial sources Is quite credible. British miners, working in territory beyond the Papuan border,, when asked by German officials for dues required of persons mining in German New Guinea, have paid them. As to the statement that a constable had been taken captive, the fact appears to be that he offered himself as a guide.&#39; In neither case has there been friction or aggression. As I informed the House a few weeks ago, we have sent a letter to the Colonial Office requesting it to ask the German Government to authorize the local Administration of German New Guinea to meet our representatives with a view to a final determination of the boundary. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask the Prime Minister - i. Has his attention been called to a cablegram in this morning&#39;s papers, stating that the attention of the Imperial Government had been called by question in the House of Commons to the &#39; unsatisfactory state of affairs existing in Papua&#34;? 2. Has his attention been called to an article in to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> dealing with the need for administrative reforms in Papua, and setting out the position thus : - (&#171;) The Minister for External Affairs knows &#34; little or nothing of the doings of the local nominee Legislative Council ; (i) Efforts have been made to secure the passing of Ordinances in Council favouring the compulsory acquisition of native lands, and the taxation of natives for enforced labour purposes? 3. Have the issues raised in this article received attention yet? What steps have been taken to place the Public Service and administration generally of Papua on a proper basis ; and can the Prime Minister say when an Administrator will be appointed? </para>

                            <para>- I am not aware of anything justifying the allusion in the House of Commons to Papuan affairs, because, apart from the difficulty which&#34; arose in connexion with the application for land-6, certain officials, there has been nothing to call for attention. Probably some exaggerated newspaper statement has given rise to the question. Administrative difficulties existed at the time of the land difficulty, to which T propose to make allusion at an early date, in view of a statement from the Director of Agriculture, which should be taken into account. There is no administrative friction now, so far as I know. </para>

                            <para>- So far as I can learn, it- is only those to whose .views effect has not been given who are dissatisfied. Even where there are not representative assemblies there are parties and the statements of neither side in regard to its opponents is to be received without qualification. Iri my opinion, the present administration of the Territory is satisfactory. What was proposed in regard to the native lands is a comparatively old story. The Government of Papua submitted a land ordinance, one of whose clauses contained ambiguous, terms as to the mariner in which land might be acquired from the natives. As the wording did not satisfy me, I sent back the ordinance, so that the clause&#39; might be expressed in terms which would put it beyond doubt that the native lands are not to be trenched upon. The proposal emanated from non-official members of the Council, selected to temporarily represent the white settlers ; but I hope that settlement&#39; will proceed so fast that the population will soon become large enough to justify some form of representative government. This will enable the views of the people, which are entitled to be taken into consideration, to be clearly expressed. I hope to provide for the appointment of Administrator in the course of the next three or four months. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister, in replying to the question put by the honorable member for Calare, said that the opinion that friction now existed in the Public Service of Papua was held only by what might be called the &#34;opposition party&#34; in the Territory. Does he regard the Anglican Bishop of New Guinea - who, when in Melbourne -recently, made strong statements bearing out the contention that friction does exist - as being numbered amongst the opposition in Papua, and will he take care that the appointment of an Administrator is made whilst this House is sitting and not during a recess ? </para>

                        <para>- I desire to elicit from the Minister of Trade and Customs some information about the sugar industry. Referring to the deputation from the Queensland sugar growers who waited on him yesterday with a view to secure his consent to a reduction of wages on the plantations, was a shorthand note taken of what transpired at the interview ? If so, will he cause a transcript of the proceedings to be laid on the library table ? Is it true that one of the deputation contended that 3s. 9d. per day was adequate payment for white workers on the plantations, or that the planters could not afford to pay more? Did the deputation deny the Minister&#39;s contention that the rate of payment for day work should be higher than when the worker is engaged by the week? What is the substance of the regulation to which the deputation took exception? .Does he intend to comply with the wishes of the deputation by so altering the regulation as to bring about a reduction of the wages of the workers engaged in this industry ? </para>

                        <para>- Without notice it would be difficult, as requested by the honorable member, to deal seriatim with the questions that he has put to me. A deputation waited on me yesterday, and as I had a shorthand writer present I shall be able to make available to honorable members a report of the proceedings. It was contended that the new rate for casual labourers fixed under the order issued this month - namely, 5s. per day and keep - was too high, and that the industry could not stand it. I felt that the evidence on which the order was issued was sufficient to warrant it, and I shall be pleased to furnish honorable members with a full report of what took place at the deputation, so that they may learn for themselves what representations were made and what answer was given. </para>

Further, will he take that report into careful consideration when arranging for the coinage of silver by the Commonwealth ? </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen the resolution to which the honorable member has referred, but the whole question has been brought prominently before me on several occasions. The matter requires careful consideration, and probably joint action bv Australia in regard to the decimal system should be concurrent with that taken by other parts of the Empire. The matter is being looked into in connexion with the question of silver coinage. I have given it consideration, and intend to discuss it with the Prime Minister before making any definite promise as to what is likely to be done. </para>

                        <para>- In any circumstances, at the next general election the Tariff will be submitted to the criticism of the electors by all candidates who choose to express their views upon it. I do not know that the interests of the Commonwealth would be served by submitting the Tariff to a referendum, which, after all, would have a merely negative effect. We could receive a direction to alter the Tariff without any clear indication of what alteration should be made. </para>

                        <para>- Referring to the Minister&#39;s reply that the Commonwealth rolls are being compiled with the assistance of State officials, I desire to ask whether the Department is confining itself to the information given by those officials, seeing that the franchise for the Commonwealth is of a more liberal character that the franchise for some of the States. I need scarcely point out that if the Commonwealth officials are confining themselves to the information supplied by State officials, many persons will be disfranchised? </para>

                            <para>- The answer which I gave was not that the Commonwealth officials were relying upon the State officials, but that they were acting in cooperation with them. So that wherever they could be so used, the rolls for both. the. State and the Commonwealth would be the same. Of course, in Victoria where adult suffrage does not prevail, the rolls must necessarily be different. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to direct the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to the fact that when speaking on the Electoral Bill, in 1902, I said that the States should be consulted with a view, if possible, to getting the State franchises assimilated with the Commonwealth franchise so that there could be one set of rolls for all the Parliaments. The only objection then urged to that suggestion had reference to the State of Victoria. I wish to ask the Minister whether he recollects also that subsequently two reports were presented by Committees in the same direction. </para>

But the consideration of those proposals in further detail, which I apprehend will be undertaken by this House, cannot be undertaken upon this side of the recess. </para>

                            <para>- I think so. The Surplus Revenue Bill stands upon a perfectly independent footing. It is associated - as every financial proposal must be associated - with all propositions which affect the financial position of the Commonwealth. But the Bill is, so to speak, a separable part so far as our financial proposals are concerned. </para>

                    <para>- I have the honour to report that the Select Committee upon Parliamentary privilege met to-day, and adjourned until  11  o&#39;clock to-morrow morning. It appears, however, that there is a standing order which prevents the Committee from sitting coincidentally with the House. . As honorable senators will be leaving for their homes to-morrow afternoon, we shall, unless we sit to-morrow, probably be unable to get a quorum before Thursday next. With the permission of tha House, I, therefore, desire to move - </para>

I previously informed honorable members that the House would be given all information they desired on the subject before final action was taken by the Government. When the Additional Estimates are under consideration to-night, I shall be glad to give that information. </para>

                    <para>I do not think I ought to apologize to the Committee for submitting this amendment, nor do I think an apology is expected. I have previously attempted to bring this matter under the notice of honorable members, but, through unforeseen circumstances,  was prevented from doing so. The session is drawing to a close, or so it is believed, and the time at our disposal is limited ; and my only object is to have a Select Committee appointed to inquire into the facts and mete out justice. It is not necessary, nor is it proper, that I should go into the whole of the facts, seeing that I am asking for an inquiry in order that steps may be taken to have justice done to those concerned. It is my duty, however, to advance some reasons for my opinion that justice has not been done, and to suggest a remedy. When Parliament passed the Post and Telegraph Act, giving the Postmaster-General power to act on his own initiative, honorable members thought that an action of such gravity as one involving interference with the liberty of the subject by preventing a business firm from receiving the correspondence of its clients, would not be taken unless approved by the whole Cabinet. Had the action of which I complain been the result of an Executive act, the position would be very different; but I believe that the House, like every other British Assembly, will declare that no punishment shall be meted out to an accused person until he has been given an opportunity to refute the charges brought against him. Quite recently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hood, of the Victorian Bench, laid it down as a principle of law that no person should be punished without trial, and the honorable member for Flinders, in dealing professionally with the case of the Rev. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> made a similar statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rentoul,</inline> too, as recently as yesterday, laid down the dictum that trial should precede punishment. But the Minister has not acted on that maxim. He has been content to act on the statements of one side without giving the firm affected an opportunity to reply to the charges brought against it. </para>

If the Minister is always ready to act on <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements, any business firm may be severely injured, if not ruined, through the action of evil-minded persons in making serious charges against it. During the past five months, I, and others, have repeatedly asked for an inquiry before any tribunal which the Minister may appoint, the members of the firm being convinced that such inquiry must lead to the granting of redress. The Minister has refused to grant an inquiry, or to give the firm an opportunity to get relief by going into the lawcourts. </para>

                            <para>- No. When the firm refused to be blackmailed, the papers - on which the Crown Law authorities of Victoria had refused to take action - were sent to the Postmaster- General. I shall not go into the merits of the case, resting my claim for an inquiry upon the position that redress should not be refused to any one claiming it from the highest Court in the land. I shall not refer to what was behind the application to the Postmaster-General. v He may know nothing about it, though I know something of the facts. I merely ask that justice shall be done. I am sorry that, the leader of the Opposition is not present to-day, because he is with me in this matter, and would have supported the motion for a committee of inquiry. All I ask is . that a committee be appointed to take evidence from all parties, and to report to the House. If such a report is made, and the firm is freed of the charges brought against it, so much the better; while if it is proved that the charges w.ere justified, I shall not attempt to shield it from punishment. I hope honorable members will recognise the justice of my plea. A decision of the High Court prevents the firm from going to law for redress, and, therefore, Parliament should give it an opportunity to vindicate itself. Since the Postmaster-General took action, he has had the opinion of three medical experts - Mr.&#39; Wilkinson, the public analyst of Victoria; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill,</inline> the  President  of the Analysts&#39; Society ; and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Amess,</inline> recently house surgeon to the Melbourne Hospital ; while three great legal luminaries - Messrs. Purves, Coldham, and Duffy - have expressed the opinion that he acted wrongly, and that the firm should not have been punished as it has been. In the light of this evidence there will be no loss of dignity if the Minister retires from his position, and I hope that he will do so, and permit a full and exhaustive inquiry by a committee of the House. </para>

                        <para>. - The matter which the honorable member for Riverina has brought forward is so. important that the House should be taken,, to some extent, into the confidence of the Postmaster-General. The Minister should inform honorable members of the grounds on which he took this drastic action. It must be recognised that in clothing the Postmaster-General with these extensive powers, Parliament intended that they should be exercised only when regard for the public welfare absolutely rendered it necessary to do so. They certainly ought not to be indiscriminately employed because of some complaint against persons trading in the Commonwealth. The Postmaster-General, in dealing with such cases, should exercise the greatest caution, and satisfy himself before using his far-reaching powers that he will be able to present to the House reasons that are amply sufficient to justify his action. I do not propose to discuss the merits of this case; but I hold that&#39; if the Postmaster-General took action on what he believed were sufficient grounds, the House should be so informed, in order that it may be able to deal fairly with the complaints of this firm. Possibly there lies behind the question a very grave issue. We know that the business in which this firm is engaged is of a peculiarly delicate character, involving the private domestic concerns of various sections of the community. It may treat its, clients in a proper way, and conduct its business on the lines indicated by the honorable member for Riverina ; but, on the other hand, in connexion with such a business, unprincipled men could blackmail those having relations with them. If the Postmaster-General took action after mature consideration, he must&#39; have had submitted to him evidence showing that this firm was not conducting a clean, honest business, and that it was not&#39; in the interests of the community that it should be permitted to utilize the postal conveniences of the Commonwealth to forward its interests. If that is so, then the tribunal which the honorable member for Riverina desires to be appointed could not properly sift out the facts. </para>

                            <para>- I am not sure that there is no other tribunal to which  this investigation could be delegated. If a Select Committee be appointed, it will be prepared to receive evidence on both sides. The fact that the persons primarily concerned do a large business through the Post Office, implies that their clients are distributed all over the Commonwealth. Whilst&#39; the members of that firm would be able to place their case in a most plausible way before the Committee, how would it be possible to bring before that Committee evidence as to any injury or injustice done by it? It seems to me that the case for the firm would go by default if the Committee were unable to thoroughly investigate the facts, and that a grave injustice might be done to a very large section of the community. As the result of its findings, this firm, as well as others, might be licensed to inflict an injustice upon many people. It is in this regard that I think that the honorable member for Riverina&#39; s proposals are weak. He must recognise how difficult it would be to obtain evidence on the other side, so as to place the House in a position to judge this case, and others of a similar kind, upon their merits. At the same time, I should not deny a fair investigation to the firm. Every individual against whom a charge is made should have an opportunity to meet and repudiate that charge. That is a sacred right. </para>

The firm should certainly have an opportunity to clear its reputation. At the same time, I desire to avoid the possibility of a tribunal being appointed of such a character, that instead of arriving at a true understanding of the position it might, unconsciously, lead to a big injustice being dope to the community generally, and to unprincipled firms being allowed to continue a business which is absolutely disgraceful. </para>

                            <para>- I am, as far as it is possible for any person to be unbiased who has had a similar experience to my own. Only the other day I heard a legal luminary declare that it was very difficult for any man to be unbiased, because his experience naturally inclined him either one way or the other. In the present instance, the action of a particular firm has been called into question by the Postmaster-General. The course which he has pursued may be either right or wrong. The honorable member for Riverina has submitted a motion with a view to righting the injustice to which he considers the firm in question has been subjected. I have nothing to say as to the conduct of that firm. I know nothing concerning it beyond that which I have gleaned from advertisements which I have read in the newspapers. It is true that a member of the firm endeavoured to interview me upon one or two occasions, but I declined to see him, because I desired to be able to deal with this question without any bias whatever. I am quite prepared to support any inquiry into the action of the Postmaster-General which is likely to be a thorough and satisfactory one. But I ask honorable members to consider whether the proposal of the honorable member for Riverina, if adopted, is likely to result in such an inquiry? In the first place, he merely proposes the appointment of a Select Committee, which has no power to take evidence upon oath. </para>

                            <para>- It is not one with which I could be connected and still consider myself a member of an honorable profession. I do not think it necessary to go into details in respect of the nature of the business which this firm apparently carries on. No medical men with any experience can be ignorant of the fact that persons have suffered untold injury as the result of illegitimate practice of the character suggested. Another objection which I would urge to the proposal under consideration relates to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Committee which the honorable member for Riverina desires. That Committee includes the names of the honorable member for Illawarra and the honorable member&#39; for Capricornia - both of whom sit upon this side of the House - the honorable member for . Kalgoorlie, the honorable member for New England, and the honorable member for Riverina, who sit upon the opposite side of the Chamber. I do not think that such a Committee constitutes a well-balanced selection of the members of this House. Personally, I should like to see a somewhat larger Committee appointed, and I think that it ought to include the names of one or two members of the medical profession who are also members of the House. I cannot understand why the honorable member for Riverina did not include members of the medical profession in his proposal. Quite recently, when the City Coroner proposed to sit alone upon an inquest into the Sunshine railway accident, we know that public feeling was aroused to such an extent that persons with technical knowledge were selected as a jury to assist him in his investigations. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall avoid as far as possible traversing my previous remarks, and confine my reply to the observations made this afternoon by the honorable member for Riverina. In the first place, I desire the House to distinctly understand, once and for all, that I have in no way discriminated. Up to the time the prohibition was made, this was the first case of the kind brought under my notice. Let me say, in passing, that during last week a considerable number of cases came up, and are now awaiting my consideration and decision ; and I take it that, if a Select Committee be now appointed, there will be demands for a Committee on each of the other prohibitions. Next, I desire to make it clear that neither in this case nor in any other case of prohibition - and there have been many - have I taken any initial steps to seek them out, or to have them sought out for me; they have been brought under my notice in such a way that they had to be dealt with, and I dealt with them, as I believed, conscientiously. . As I say, I have been charged with discriminating, but every case has been dealt with in order, and has been brought under my notice by the officials. </para>

The papers were submitted to  me through the Chief Commissioner of Police, on the minuted recommendation of the Crown Prosecutor, who stated that he could not recommend the State authorities to prosecute, not because he did not consider there was a strong case, but because it was necessary to prosecute an individual, as he could not prosecute a firm. </para>

                            <para>- For fraudulent practices; and, hot being able to find out the individual, the Crown Law authorities recommended that what they considered a strong case should be sent on to the Federal authorities to be dealt with under the powers of the Postal Act. I sent all the papers to the Commonwealth Crown Law officers, and got their opinion ; and after considering the. matter over and over again, and fortifying my opinion by consultation with the Prime Minister, I arrived at the decision which is now under discussion. But the House should remember that I showed plainly I had nothing to hide. Immediately another place commenced its sittings I placed the whole of the papers on the table there; and every opportunity has been afforded from then till now for the appointment of a Select Committee if so desired. Moreover, every opportunity has been taken by the firm interested to endeavour to get a Select Committee appointed but without success. However, I do not propose to go into the merits or the demerits of the case, but merely to state that my action was in accordance with my judgment and conscience. </para>

                        <para>.- I was prepared to agree entirely with the Postmaster-General until I heard the extraordinary announcement he made at the close of his remarks. We have a Minister of the Crown stating that, when a motion of this sort is proposed, asking the House to appoint a Select Committee to investigate the performance of a purely administrative act - an act of discretion - by him, the  Government have practically decided to accept it, if it be coupled with a slight amendment that somewhat . enlarges its scope. We have not yet, I think, arrived at the stage of adopting a system of elective Ministries, or any system, other than that on which we, and every other British community, have hitherto carried on responsible government. </para>

                            <para>- Absolutely ; and that is the point to which I propose to direct attention. This Parliament made provision in the Postal Act - whether wisely or unwisely it is not for us now to discuss or determine - vesting in the Postmaster-General a discretion. In my opinion., it was&#39; a. very wise discretion, whereby, without having any trial, if he became convinced that the machinery of the Post Office was being used for immoral, improper, or scandalous purposes, he could step in and, without inflicting any punishment, refuse to allow the Department to be so used. </para>

                            <para>- I am not now dealing with the arguments advanced by the honorable member for Riverina. Those arguments have been sufficiently answered, and I have nothing to do with them ; so far as that aspect of the case &#93;s concerned, my &#34; withers are unwrung.&#34; I am now dealing with the amazing position taken, up by the Postmaster-General, who says that when his act is challenged the Government are prepared to accept the motion provided there be an amendment which somewhat enlarges its scope. The Prime&#62; Minister asked me whether this was an act of administration. When a Minister of the Crown is given by Parliament discretion in the ordinary control and management of his Department,&#39; and allowed to say how its services may be used, is not the exercise of that discretion, by prohibiting their use for the spreading of .scandalous matter, in all respects an administrative act similar to any other? </para>

                            <para>- No; but when the action of a Minister intrusted with the responsibility of administering a Department is questioned, the challenge cannot be made in the courts of law. Unless you do away with the whole basis of responsible government, it must be made in Parliament. The only appeal is to Parliament, when wrong is alleged to have been done by an act of administration. I am not aware, in any community under responsible government, of any other appeal, from the exercise of his discretion by a Minister which has done wrong to an individual, than that provided in the right of every member of Parliament to ask the House to condemn the Minister&#39;s action. I challenge the Prime Minister to bring forward any case to the contrary. For. my part, I am of opinion that the Postmaster-General&#39;s action was justified by the facts of the case, and I was entirely with him until I heard his extraordinary statement, which showed his attitude and that of the Ministry to be subversive of the very principle of responsible government. </para>

                        <para>. - On this question I hold an opinion quite opposed to that just expressed by the honorable and learned member for Flinders. When Parliament conferred upon a Minister charged with the control of a Department power, without consulting the Cabinet, to take action which may affect the prosperity, and even the solvency of any private business or private citizen, it took an unusual step, and one difficult to parallel, though it might be to some extent illustrated by the powers conferred in other Acts. A decision such as that of the Postmaster-General can be taken at any time, whether Parliament is or is not in session, and it is in its essence judicial. </para>

                            <para>- They are minor matters ; every decision of consequence is subject to appeal to the courts. But in this case the appeal must be to Parliament. The courts are closed to the complaint. If the proposition of the honorable member for Riverina impugned the authority of Parliament or the responsibility of the Ministry, no one would be more prompt than I to resent it. The Postmaster-General in no way withdraws from his position. He states that he is satisfied that he has acted justly. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may regard this as a fit subject for merriment, but I feel it to be a very serious problem. If the course taken by the Government is not fair and reasonable, we wait for it to be impugned. Will any honorable member venture to say that, a judicial and severely punitive action having been taken, the Government could deal with the case more frankly, fairly, and openly than by trusting to the judgment of the House to appoint, or to decline to . appoint, a Committee to review the action of the Minister and to report? </para>

                            <para>- It is to be dealt with in the only way possible to meet the emergency, and when there is no time to do anything else. I concur that this power should be vested in the Postmaster-General and with his exercise of it, but I certainly cannot concur in a proposal to shut the door to a reasonable appeal on the part Of a citizen of the Commonwealth who believes that by the exercise of that power the Postmaster-General has done him a serious wrong. There should be a reasonable appeal against a decision that might involve the person concerned in heavy pecuniary loss. The case not being one that can be debated in this House, nor one that should be debated here even with closed doors, it must, like many others, be referred to a Select Committee, in whom the House has confidence, with a view to evidence being taken privately, and a report upon the merits being presented. But this Committee will not merely report on the merits of the case. If it were to stop there it would be insufficient. In reporting on the merits of the case it will criticise, either directly or indirectly, the action of the Minister concerned, and I repeat that for that action the Government accepts entire responsibility. </para>

                            <para>- If the Committee recommends that the suspension be removed it will be the duty of the Postmaster-General to advise his colleague&#39;s regarding the new evidence laid before them. If that evidence satisfies him that the suspension should be removed he will make a recommendation to that effect to the Cabinet. If it does not satisfy him he will make the opposite recommendation, and the Government takes the responsibility of accepting or rejecting the finding of the Select Committee. Although the Committee will be appointed as a Court of Appeal from the decision of the Minister, the responsibility of accepting or rejecting its finding will rest first Upon Ministers and then upon the House. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may think so; I hold a different view. We should never close the door to the complaint of any citizen who believes that he has been done an injury under an Act of Parliament. When such a complaint is made, it appears to me to be magnanimous, and outside of politics would be at once treated as magnanimous - although I hesitate to apply that word to any action of the Ministry - for the Government to step aside and to say, &#34; We throw open to you a Court of Justice. We do not even appear to plead against you. We are content with the papers disclosing the facts on which we took action, and are prepared to leave them to the judgment of the House.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sampson.-</inline> It is a magnanimity that is calculated to destroy the principle of responsible government. </para>

                            <para>- On the contrary, by its action, the Government leaves the responsibility for its action where it is content that it should rest, with the Government itself. No vote of the House refusing an inquiry will relieve my honorable colleague from the responsibility of the action taken by him months before this motion was submitted. In the circumstances, my right honorable friend will see that his quip , does not apply. We have  taken the responsibility for our action. Nothing that we can do will relieve us of that responsibility. </para>

                            <para>- Rather than cast our votes simply to uphold our own decision, so much confidence have we in it, that we are prepared to submit it to the strongest searchlight which can be brought to bear upon it, and afterwards to accept our responsibility in connexion with it. I admit that the course which we propose to take is a new one; but, so far from being unconstitutional, it is within the bounds of constitutionality, since it does not reduce our ultimate responsibility one iota. It leaves this House free to appoint any Select Committee that it may choose to inquire into a Ministerial action into which we are not only willing to permit inquiry, but actually invite it. Although it is a new departure, and one which I was called upon to take upon the spur of the moment, when this matter was brought forward, upon further consideration, I see no other course open to us. We have either to refuse an inquiry altogether or to postpone it indefinitely until the Post and Telegraph Act has been amended, or to take the course that we propose. Of the only three courses open to us, that which I have outlined is the least objectionable. It certainly is one which exposes us to the greatest risk of independent criticism- </para>

                            <para>- We must be content to act right, no matter how our action may be viewed. Of the three courses available, I ask honorable members to point me to a fairer one than to allow Parliament - which is the high court of justice in this country to which every citizen has the right of appeal - to decide this matter, and for the Ministry to put what it considers to be right first, and what it regards as constitutionally a new departure, second.I do not think that this is the best means that can be devised for dealing with such cases.I am of opinion that subsequently the House should be invited to supplement its own machinery in this connexion. That ought not to be dealt with as a party matter. </para>

                            <para>- I am perfectly prepared to answer to my constituents. The step proposed to be taken by the Government is new. I know of no case in my parliamentary experience which has presented similar features&#39; or demanded similar action. In order to meet the position at once we have improvised a course of action which I believe to be essentially just to the person complaining, and also just to those who are inclined upon the facts known to uphold the action of the Government. It is unjust to no person, and is not unconstitutional in any sense. Ministers are prepared to welcome the appointment of any Committee of Inquiry, no matter how searching it may be, and when that Committee reports they will accept full responsibility for dealing with its recommendations as they have accepted it for their past actions. </para>

                        <para>. - I had no intention of speaking upon this matter until it assumed a very grave aspect in respect of the practice of this House. The extraordinary announcement of the Prime Minister, however, has elevated it from a simple protest against the action of the Postmaster-General into a high constitutional question. The honorable member for Flinders has very properly pointed out that the course proposed by the Government is a complete departure from constitutional practice. The Prime Minister has admitted that he knows of no precedent for such a course, and that &#39;the whole movement has been improvised by the Government to escape from a situation which has no parallel in our Australian history. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to deal with the points connected with this case in my own way. The Prime Minister has affirmed that no similar case has arisen or could have arisen. But that does not get rid of the charge made by the honorable member for Flinders, that the Government proposal is a complete abrogation of their obligation to deal exclusively with matters of administration. Everybody with an elementary knowledge of constitutional practice knows that legislation is a matter for the Parliament and administration a matter for the Executive. As soon as the Government are unable to satisfy the House by their methods of administration they are called upon to take the opinion of honorable members as to their fitness to retain their positions. I am entirely in accord with the honorable member for Flinders in regard to the constitutional aspect of this question. But after sitting here for seven years I begin to look upon a regard for constitutional practice as being somewhat archaic. We have not had responsible government  since 1901. Can honorable members say that we had an exhibition of responsible government last night when the Treasurer- </para>

                            <para>- We have become so accustomed to this loose view of constitutional practice that even the Prime Minister begins to forget the guiding principles of that branch of knowledge. He now tells us not only that it is constitutional for the Postmaster-General to admit that his action should be the subject of independent inquiry by the House, but that when the proposal for an inquiry is about to be put from the Chair, he and the whole of his colleagues will leave the .House and express no opinion one way. or the other. Surely, if the Prime Minister thinks that the decision of the Postmaster-General is a just one, he and his colleagues should remain in the Chamber and assist to negative the proposal of the honorable member. If, on the other hand, they think it just to have his decision reviewed, they should support the motion. Certainly they ought not to run away. I agree with the Prime Minister that the occasion is somewhat unique, because under the Post and Telegraph Act we have placed unusually arbitrary powers in the hands of the Postmaster-General - powers which have never previously been vested in a Minister. </para>

                            <para>- We have permitted the Postmaster-General practically to stop the whole business of a firm which has no appeal. I charge the Government with moral cowardice1 in running away from this motion. 1 have always contended that this Parliament has nothing whatever to do with the morality of the contents of letters. If those contents touch the security of the King or of the Commonwealth, the Government have a perfect right to interfere. But, as carriers of letters, we have no more right to interfere in regard to the moral contents of letters than have the Railways Commissioners to inquire into the object of a man or a woman in travelling from Sydney to Melbourne. But since we have conferred this arbitrary power upon the Postmaster-General there must be some- safety valve in cases of injustice - otherwise we have created and perpetuate a veritable Star Chamber. It is a monstrous proposition that a Postmaster-General with &#34;goody goody&#34; notions such as are possessed by the honorable member for Maribyrnong, should be invested with the arbitrary power to place an- embargo upon the whole correspondence of a business firm without a right of appeal. I do not care what the letters may contain - there must in all fairness be a right of appeal on the part of that firm. All that is proposed now is that there shall be an inquiry, and the proper course for the Government, if the Prime Minister was so anxious to do justice, was to say to the people concerned, &#34; It is true that the Minister has decided against. you, but, if you will name certain persons whom we approve, we are perfectly willing to have an inquiry by an impartial tribunal, in order that we may ascertain in what way, if any,&#39; the Minister has gone beyond a reasonable exercise of his powers.&#34; To come to the </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. Only yesterday, there was a greater breach of constitutional and parliamentary practice, when the leader of the Labour Party peremptorily denied the Government the right to arrange the business of the House; and, if the honorable member for Flinders did not observe the incident, he missed a spectacle of importance. But constitutional practice is what we like to make it. We may carry on Parliament for years and make so many and constant inroads on recognised constitutional practice that at last the inroads become a part of our constitutional practice. I am perfectly satisfied to see an arbitrary power of the kind under discussion to some extent mitigated by the appointment of a Select Committee, in order that there may be an impartial inquiry as to whether those concerned have or have not received justice at the hands of the Postmaster-General. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree in the. main with the reasoning of the honorable member for Parkes. The position of the Government, as disclosed in the speech of the Prime Minister, is certainly the most extraordinary 1 have witnessed since I entered Parliament. I do not know whether the Postmaster-General had sufficient evidence to. justify the action he took; but I think that the Government, now that action has been taken, should know whether or not it is one which requires review, and they ought to have the courage to either support or oppose the motion. That appears to me to be the&#39; straightforward attitude that the Government ought to adopt. I do not agree with the placing of such extraordinary powers without appeal in the hands of the Postmaster-General,  who on <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> evidence might absolutely ruin the business of an institution or firm in.

                            <para>- I am opposing the continuance of such enormous powers in the hands of the Postmaster-General by means of this section of the Postal Act ; but, the power having been given, the section ought to be repealed, or the Government ought to be prepared to abide by the consequences of action under it. Those people who have had their mails stopped are denied the right granted to the meanest criminal in the land, of appealing to a court of justice. The Postmaster-General has admitted that he acted on <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> evidence, although the Prime Minister has endeavoured to show that the whole of the facts of the case had been presented. Such a power ought to be exercised only after the most careful inquiry, both for and against those who are accused ; but, in this particular case, only the evidence for the prosecution, as it were, appears to have been heard. I know nothing of the merits of the case ; and if the honorable member for Hunter is desirous to form one of the Committee, I am perfectly willing to make room for him. The <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Committee is a matter for the consideration of the House; and there should be no hesitation in striking out the name of any man whom honorable members may deem incapable of forming a correct judgment in accordance with the evidence. I think it would be most unjust to refuse to grant an inquiry, seeing that that is the only means by which it can be ascertained whether the persons accused or the Postmaster-General be right or wrong. It appears to me the position is developing into a farce. The Government are taking up the attitude that they are not prepared to say whether or not the Postmaster-General did the proper thing in taking action as he did on <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> evidence. </para>

                            <para>- In my judgment, the action of the Government and of the Postmaster-General is a sorry comment on all that has gone before. For months past the Minister has been receiving the approbation of the churches and various other public bodies throughout Australia. Resolutions have been passed approving of the manly and courageous stand which he has taken in the interests of morality ; but now it seems that his courage is oozing out of his finger ends, and that nothing is to toe done which will in any way imperil the position of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- The speech is a long one, and, of course, I cannot quote all of it; but the implication was that I was omitting something material. The Act leaves no room for doubt as to whether this is or is not a judicial act. In the performance of his ordinary administrative functions, the Postmaster-General -  may by order under his hand published  in  the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> direct that  any  postal article received at a post-office addressed to such person, either by his own or fictitious or assumed name . . . shall not be registered or transmitted or delivered to such person. </para>

                    <para>The Minister has exercised the power so conferred on him. He has decided that certain letters shall not be carried through the Post Office, and he says now that he believes that he did the correct thing. The Prime Minister, too, says that he did right; but he asserts that because the honorable member for Riverina has charged the Minister with maladministration, and party issues have been raised, there must be an inquiry. I ask the House whether, if the case had been brought forward by a member of the Opposition, the Government would have agreed to an inquiry? The request fora Committee would have been laughed at, had it not come from a Ministerial supporter about whose loyalty there was for the moment some doubt. </para>

                            <para>- I asked the Prime Minister whether he thought an inquiry necessary, and he said &#34; No,&#34; while the Postmaster-General has stated more than once that an inquiry is not necessary. The Prime Minister wishes to submit the administration of the Postmaster-General to a Committee of Inquiry which may condemn his action. Are future Minister&#39;s likely to accept full responsibility for their actions if they know that these may be reviewed and condemned by Parliamentary Committees? Will not the knowledge prevent them from performing the functions which they are appointed to perform? If it does, constitutional government will go by the board. </para>

                            <para>- Surely no Minister would consent to act under such conditions. I can conceive of nothing tending more directly to the undermining of independent administration. The Prime Minister tells us that there should be a Court of Appeal. The Act does not provide for that ; but, in any case, what advantage is there in having a Court of Appeal, if its findings are to be reviewed by the Ministry of the day ? There would be nothing judicial about such procedure. What the Prime Minister advocates is really a Court of Inquiry, whose findings may be flouted by Ministers. This is nothing more nor less than an attempt to placate a Ministerial supporter who strongly favours the appointment of a Committee. I candidly admit that I have not investigated the case, and know nothing concerning its merits. The honorable member for Riverina stated offensively the other night that I am prepared in all such cases to give a decision without investigation. I accept the word of the Postmaster- General that he has acted on what he believes to be sufficient evidence, and shall yote against the appointment of a Committee; that is, if I vote at all. But I am not sure that I should not follow the example of the Prime Minister. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member should appeal to his Prime Minister, who says that he is going to leave the chamber when the question comes to be decided. He will not vote on the amendment, although he tells us that if a Committee is appointed, and reports the result of its investigations, he will see what should be done. If I were selected to serve on such a Committee, I should decline to do so, in view of the possibility that its recommendations might be flouted by the Ministry. There would be more to be said for the proposal if the&#39; Prime Minister were to undertake to abide by the finding of the Committee; but he says, &#34;I shall commit myself to nothing. I do not see why T should be bound by the finding of this Court of Appeal, which- 1 say should be set  up. When the .evidence is presented, I shall determine what ought to be done.&#34;. </para>

                        <para>.- The proposal made &#39;by the Prime Minister has occasioned me great surprise. He admits that it is unusual, and I should say that it is almost without &#39;precedent. I see no difference between this criticism, of a member of the Government - and  incidentally of the Government as a whole, since it has indorsed the action of the Minister of which complaint is made - and an ordinary want of confidence motion. Trier are many statutes under which Ministers are vested with far-reaching powers, and these they are expected 16 exercise with discretion. Does the Prime Minister propose to lay down the rule  that when  an action taken by a Minister, by virtue of statutory powers conferred upon . him, 01 otherwise, is challenged, the Government are to leave the chamber in a body and not defend themselves? If that principle is to be adopted, it will probably lead the Government into a position of difficulty which they ought not to OCcUPY. \ hold that they are bound to defend, by their voices and their votes, every one of their administrative acts. I have no knowledge of the facts of this case, save that which I have gathered from the debate, but 1 certainly do not think that it was the intention of Parliament that the powers vested in the Postmaster- General should be exercised without careful investigation. It is only &#39;reasonable that persons against whom a charge is made shall have an opportunity to defend themselves. The intention of Parliament was that the Act was to be administered -with care, and that the powers vested in the Minister should be exercised only after an investigation of the case for as well as against the person or persons accused. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that the Postmaster-General, in dealing with the case, did not give the persons concerned an opportunity to be heard. He ought, in my opinion, to have heard them before arriving&#34; at a decision. I go further, and say that there is no reason why the Postmaster-General, on learning .that many persons, including members of Parliament, considered, that he had not acted fairly - that the accused persons had been wrongly re-  fused an opportunity to be heard - should not have re-opened the case. </para>

                            <para>- That explanation removes much of the objection that I had to the action of the Minister. It would be very inconvenient if every person dealt with under the powers conferred upon Ministers by Acts of Parliament could demand an inquiry by a Select Committee. Persons so dealt with must be satisfied to have their case heard by the Minister concerned. If they are dissatisfied with his decision, it is open to them to appeal  to Parliament,  which I am sure will grant them redress if they show that they hare suffered injustice. I contend that the action of the Postmaster- General was an administrative and not a judicial one. He availed himself of certain statutory powers vested in him, and the amendment involves a most serious charge against the Government The speeches made in&#34; support of it by th&#187; honorable member- for Riverina are a&#62; strong an indictment against the action o? the Postmaster-General as could be made, for he deliberately charged him with maladministration. That being so, it is very necessary that the Government should defend, not only by speaking, but by voting, the action taken. The Prime Minister&#39;s proposal that whenever the Government is attacked in respect of an act of administration, he and his colleagues shall not vote, means really that the Government are to shirk the full responsibility of their position. </para>

                            <para>- I regret to say I do not. It is by no means unusual for the action of a Minister or a Ministry to be questioned in Parliament. There are many statutory powers vested in Ministers. The Minister of. Trade and Customs, for instance, is given wide powers under the Customs Act, and he exercises those powers, I am sure, to the best of his ability. Some of. them are very arbitrary, but then exercise and the exercise of the powers conferred on the Postmaster-General wide the Post and Telegraph Act involve1 responsibility. The honorable member fo: Riverina has really made a direct charge o: maladministration against the Postmaster General, and if he succeeded in  carrying  his proposal, the Government would hav. no option but to resign. The  honorable  member alleges that the Postmaster-Genera has done an injustice to a certain firm and has denied redress to the injured per sons. No more serious charge could b levelled against an Administration, and i: his amendment be carried, the  Government must  vacate the Treasury benches. I regret the attitude taken up by the Prim Minister and. his colleagues. I  certainlhad  no intention of voting against them on the contrary, my sympathies were Wit them. It is true that, believing that th  Postmaster-General  had refused tq  give the  members of this firm an opportunity t&#62;  present their case to him, I felt very Strongly on this question; but I now find that they have been heard, so that my objections to .the action of the Minister on that score have been removed. </para>

                            <para>- I should have t&#62;een very loth to vote against the Government on a question of this kind ; but  1  dp not see why I should be asked to vote in support of an action by the Postmaster-General, when he himself is not prepared to do so. I fail to see why I should take upon my shoulders the responsibilities of the Government, when the Prime Minister and his colleagues decline to bear their part of them. This is not a party question on which there is. any desire to defeat the Government. If it were, and the House were, fairly evenly divided, it would be an act of magnanimity on the part of the Government to leave the Chamber and allow the House to determine it. The point is that a member of the Ministry has exercised a very great power vested in him, and that his action has been indorsed by his colleagues. That being so, they should support by their voices and their votes what they believe to have been a just act of administration. </para>

                        <para>. - I was not present when the Prime Minister made his announcement, and found it hard to believe that he should have decided to take up this extraordinary position. Since the Government as a whole believe, as they say they do, that the Postmaster-General has acted properly in this matter, I could have understood &#39;their supporting him by voice and vote. Had the Prime Minister and the Postmaster-General said that they were quite willing that a Select Committee should be appointed to inquire into and report upon this case, I should not in the case of this Government have been surprised, although I should have thought that- they were deserting their contention that the action of which Complaint is made was a proper one.- </para>

                            <para>- Only in the sense that- every Minister is a judge. How does that circumstance relieve Ministers of the .responsibility of supporting their own opinions by their votes in this House? Is not a Select Committee a judicial body? Are its members to be debarred from voting upon any report that they may submit to Parliament? Ministers must have a very weak case when they seek to shelter themselves behind such an argument. They are here to do their duty as members of the House, and ought riot to vacate the Chamber when a proposal affecting their position is being considered. </para>

                            <para>- The acts of the Government have been frequently questioned, but they have always taken the manly course of supporting their acts by their votes. Do they suggest that members of Parliament - who are equally responsible with themselves for the provision in the Post and Telegraph Act under which the Postmaster-General took action - should regard the position which they occupy as a judicial one, and that when the division is about to be taken they should leave the Chamber ? Or are honorable members supposed to vote upon this motion and thus relieve Ministers of a responsibility which they decline to accept? We want to see a little more backbone evidenced in our politics. Ministers may be right upon some occasions and wrong upon others; but whether right or wrong, if they are prepared to fight for their cause and to accept the consequences of their actions we can respect them, even if we assist to defeat them. But it was not anticipated that there was anything in the way of a reflection upon the Postmaster-General or upon the Government likely to result from this motion. It is not a party question, and that is why I was the more surprised when I heard of the extraordinary announcement of the Prime Minister. I know that upon this side of the Chamber, the votes of honorable members would have been divided. </para>

                            <para>- I wish that the honorable member could oil it, because the exhibition which we have witnessed this afternoon tends to degrade parliamentary institutions. The lightness with which the Prime Minister will tamper with established parliamentary . procedure is amazing. He possesses a good knowledge of constitutional procedure, and poses as a supporter of constitutional methods, but yet we find him - when a certain situation arises - permitting everything to go by the board in order that some little object which he has in view may be gained. To achieve his purpose all our constitutional procedure is to be changed. I do hope that the Ministry will not adhere to their expressed decision. If they do, their action will not add to their reputation, and if this sort of conduct is repeated we shall become the laughing stock of Parliaments. To me the position is almost beyond belief. The Prime Minister declares that he believes that the Postmaster-General was right in the action which he took. Obviously, then, it is his duty to support his colleague by his vote in this Chamber. </para>

Why has he not adopted that attitude upon other occasions? We do not want to see attempts to interfere with the ordinary procedure and precedents of Parliament whenever a little difficulty arises. But we do want to see Ministers boldly supporting their opinions and their positions by their votes. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that even that statement constitutes an argument&#39;. If the Government consider that the final power, resting, with the Postmaster-General, is unfair, and they desire to amend the law, which affects not only th&#39;is firm, but many others, the same opportunity of appeal should be afforded to all. But the Government support &#34; the Postmaster-General on the ground that fie has acted quite rightly. What could be weaker than the position of Ministers, who, while they do not object to an inquiry, declare that they will not vote for or against the motion? Such an attitude abrogates their&#39; position in Parliament, where they ought to be the leaders ; and it is an attitude which they would absolutely refuse to adopt in other cases where their action was- attacked. Does it make , any difference from which side of the House the attack comes? We, as the Opposition, attack the Government frequently, but they do not then propose to take any such course as that which has&#176;been indicated by the Prime Minister. In the. present instance, the Government have been attacked by a supporter, and they propose to&#39; do what&#39; I have never known any other Ministry to do under the circumstances - declare that they will be impartial, and that they will walk out&#39; of the House. </para>

                            <para>- Their colleague is left, to the wolves. If the Government do not object to an inquiry, why do not&#39; they vote for the motion ?f But they choose to adopt a mid- way position, and to abandon the Postmaster-General to the House without their support&#39;. The Government are refusing to accept the responsibility which rests on Ministers, and the position they assume is weakness personified. And all the time the people of the Commonwealth are waiting for some evidence of backbone in the leader of a Government. </para>

                        <para>.- According to the honorable member for Parramatta, who seems to speak with the general approval of his party, the Postmaster-General has acted quite rightly. So far as I can- see, the main complaint against the Government is that they will not vote on the motion. We are told by the honorable&#39; member for Flinders, the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, and the right honorable member for Swan, that it is simply unprecedented for the Ministry not to vote in support of a member of the Ministry. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Kalgoorlie and the honorable member for Flinders may not know the practice of Commonwealth constitutional law or the procedure of this Parliament, because they have not been here long enough, but the right honorable member for Swan is in a different position. On the 20th June, 1 901, when he was a member of the Ministry, he, with others of his colleagues, deliberately walked out of the House, and allowed honorable members to wore on a question, thus creating a precedent completely new to me. The right- honorable member said a few minutes ago - </para>

                            <para>- But surely the question under review was an &#34; act of administration &#39; &#39; ; and it was pointed out at the time that the position of Ministers was only that of temporary trustees. .As a matter of fact, the question affected the members of every future Ministry, and, therefore, became an act of administration, and of vital permanent interest. Honorable members in the Opposition corner seem willing to wound, but afraid to strike; they are anxious to grasp at every opportunity of weakening the position of the Government, and of giving rise to a motion of want of confidence. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is admitted right through the judgment. It is said that this is not a judicial proceeding, because the parties cannot be heard; but I point out that it would be simply impossible in many of the cases for the parties to be heard prior to the prohibition. For instance, if it were desired that the promoters of a German lottery should be prohibited from sending circulars throughout Australia, the Postmaster-General could not wait until they had been heard, because, :n the meantime, the country would be swamped with the circulars, the replies, and the lottery money sent, and the proper administration of the Act rendered impossible.  The prohibition should be declared, followed by an in (mediate demand on the parties to show cause why it should not be continued. Amongst the affidavits in the case I have just mentioned there is one from the present Minister of Trade and Customs, showing that he, as Postmaster-General, called on the people concerned to show cause ; and, although tha present Postmaster-General stated that he had the evidence before him, and considered the matter time after time,&#34; we are told that this is not a judicial proceeding. </para>

I object to the insinuations of members of the Opposition that the Government is trying to placate a supporter. In my opinion, the Prime Minister is too generous, and has too fine and over punctilious a sense of honour. I should have liked him to say that he would vote, as I shall vote, against the amendment for the appointment of a Committee. In my opinion, the Postmaster-General has given to the case all necessary consideration. If the amendment for the appointment of a Committee be carried, I hope six honorable members will support me in a request for a ballot, so that the case may be investigated by an impartial and independent Committee. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister seems to wish to miss this too, because he tells us that he is not going to vote on the amendment. The machine which he has devised flies back and strikes him like a boomerang. Now we are in this burlesque situation, that the Government indorses the action of the Postmaster-General, but refuses to vote for or against a motion to investigate it. The policy of the Prime Minister is a policy of &#34; skedaddle, scuttle away and vamoose; do anything rather than vote.&#34; We were returned to vote on the questions coming before Parliament. The Prime Minister is introducing a new idea in suggesting that when inconvenient questions are brought forward, honorable members should leave the Chamber without recording their votes. What electorate would choose a candidate who announced that he would shirk his responsibility in that way ? I have known members to get out of voting; but no one respected them for doing so; and, personally, I would rather have a vote cast against me than no vole registered. Am I to understand that the Prime Minister and the Postmaster-General are not going to vote, but that remaining Ministers and their supporters are to stay behind and do what they will not do? It has been hinted that it would be well for honorable members on this side not to record their votes; but I shall record mine. I shall take the part oft he Postmaster-General, although he himself may run away. </para>

                            <para>- If the Postmaster-General shirks his responsibility as a Minister and a member, that is no reason why  I  should shirk mine. I told the honorable member for Riverina, months ago, that I should oppose the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into this case. If the Postmaster-General exceeds his powers, Parliament should punish him. The friends of the honorable member for Riverina - Messrs. Freeman and . Wallace </para>

                            <para>- There is too great a tendency in Australian Parliaments to allow the appointment of Select Committees of inquiry, and I cannot understand how a Minister who thinks that he has acted rightly can agree to such an investigation. If it is thought that the Minister has done wrong, a motion of censure should be moved. The charge of maladministration brought against the Postmaster-General by the honorable member for Riverina is practically a motion of censure. If other honorable members followed the example which is going to be set by the Prime Minister, and refused to vote on it, the House would be counted out, which would be a convenience to those w&#39;ho wish to go to the theatre, though not tending to the advancement of business. The Prime Minister, who should lead the House, refuses to act on this occasion. There are many questions to come before us upon which it will be inconvenient to vote; but those who tried to avoid responsibility by abstaining from voting would soon be drummed out of public life. The Prime Minister says that he believes that the Postmaster-General had, good ground for acting as he did, and the Postmaster-General has stated that he heard the defence of Messrs. Freeman and Wallace. Therefore, the case has been dealt with on its merits. He says that he heard their counsel, and is still of opinion that justice has been done. Therefore, I am astonished that the Prime Minister should justify his inaction by the plea that every one should have his grievances rectified by Parliament. I do not care much for party warfare, nor do I indulge in mud throwing. Ministers are. bedaubing themselves with mud more thickly than the Opposition could plaster them, and Parliament would be a laughing stock if members generally, by refusing to vote, tried, as Ministers are doing, to escape their parliamentary responsibility. I could understand honorable members availing themselves of this opportunity to give notice of the most severe motion of censure that could be tabled against a Government.I could well understand the leader of the Labour Party, who wishes to speak to this question, concluding his remarks by moving a further amendment which would have the effect of a motion of censure. If I were a member of his party I should certainly avail myself of the opportunity to do so. If the Labour Party ever gets into power and refuses to accept responsibility for its administrative acts, the newspapers of the Commonwealth will quickly endeavour to hound them out of public life. They have now a splendid opportunity to table a most effective motion of censure that will, have the effect, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, of placing responsible government for all time upon its proper pedestal. If a motion of censure be tabled, I shall strongly support it. I cannot understand the attitude taken up by the Prime Minister, unless he is riding for a fall. The stand which he has taken upon this question, considered in conjunction with his attitude on another motion a few days ago, seems to suggest that that is what he is doing. Having regard to the Prime Minister&#39;s knowledge of parliamentary procedure and of the principles of responsible government, it is difficult to account in any other way for his action in inviting his colleagues to walk out of the House when this question goes to a vote. Seeing that he has indorsed the action of the Postmaster-General, one would have expected him to strongly support him on this occasion and. to fight for rather than to go back upon him. I know that the honorable member for Riverina is a solid supporter of the Government, and had no hostile intentions towards them in submitting this amendment; but I repeat that we ought to avail ourselves of this splendid opportunity to assert the principles of responsible government.. </para>

                            <para>- It would be better to ascertain what it is necessary to provide for the additional permanent assistance required for the Department. There can be no doubt that the Department is, and will be, a growing one, and that is an argument in favour of the appointment of more permanent officers. Just as temporary hands become acquainted with the routine work of a Department, and become adept in dealing with it, they have to make room for others. The whole process of training has to be gone over again, and only with the same result at the end. The unfortunate part of this business is that there is an inherent idea in the minds of applicants that, notwithstanding any notifications to the contrary, the fact of being temporarily employed -will give them a preferential claim for permanent employment when a vacancy occurs on the staff. I notice that the vote for incidental and petty cash expenditure is also mounting up month by month. In every Supply Bill, and all through the Estimates, we find substantial sums for that purpose. Although the financial year has . only six weeks to run, yet we are now asked to vote <inline font-style="italic">&#163;150</inline> under that head. These sums, small as they seem in their individual places, represent a very considerable total when added together. I think that there ought to be some indication as to the purpose for which this vote of &#163;150 is required. </para>

                            <para>- I congratulate the Government upon doing something in this way to further settlement iri Papua. One of the best things which can be done will be to provide a permanent and reliable mail service&#39; which so far the Territory has not had. When we realize the strenuous efforts that are being made&#39; by other nations &#39;to outdo us not only in Papua, but in other Pacific islands, I think that we must sympathize with any proposal which will promote &#39;settlement .there in favour of either Great Britain or this Commonwealth. I notice that &#163;20 is required for a paying officer at the Commonwealth offices in London. </para>

                            <para>- The Departments do not seem to recognise their responsibility to keep the expenditure within the votes. They incur additional expenditure, and then we are presented with Additional Estimates. It may be said that this particular expenditure does not amount to a great deal under each head, but it aggregates a very large sum, in addition to a very large increase in the Estimates-in-Chief. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know whether this is the time to ask the Prime Minister to explain his intentions with regard to advertising in London the Commonwealth&#39;s resources. I apprehend that I shall be in order in making a few observations on that matter, since it is connected with the Department of External Affairs, whose Estimates we are now considering. I take it that all outside matters come within the purview of the Prime Minister, and, therefore, as he is asking for an additional vote of over&#163;8,000, it will be appropriate to interrogate him about the methods pursued in his Department with regard to the dissemination of literature. Somehow pr other, it seems that some writers get his ear in a way which I think would be extremely gratifying and profitable to other literary men in Australia if they had the same access to him, and could persuade him to do the same thing for them. I am anxious to learn what was the realgenersis of this arrangement with the London <inline font-style="italic">Standard?</inline> What occurred to the honorable gentleman&#39;s mind to persuade him to subsidize it? </para>

                            <para>- It is a special payment, not for advertising in the ordinary sense, but for publishing literature relating to Australia. It is out of the category of ordinary advertising matter, and should not be so regarded. Does the. honorable gentleman know anything about the circulation of the <inline font-style="italic">Standard?</inline> Does he know where it principally circulates in Great Britain, and, if not, how came it that he selected that organ of all others to receive this money? There are many other journals in London with a larger circulation ; and it seems a coincidence of a very striking character that the honorable gentleman should have hit upon a journal which has a very moderate circulation, but which, at the same time, is the representative organ of the Toryism of London. </para>

                            <para>- If we are not to discuss the actions of the Minister of External Affairs in his Department in connexion with the departmental Estimates now under consideration, I should like to know in what other way they can be discussed. The general administration of the Department is so far ineffective as to require an additional vote of over &#163;8,000 to make it effective. Does not the application for that money bring under review all the acts of the Prime Minister in his Department ? </para>

All these things are taking place every day,- and we should have the opportunity to ventilate our grievances before voting supplies to the Department. </para>

The Committee is now considering Additional Estimates. The Estimates-in-Chief have been passed, and it is only in connexion with them that the administration of the various Departments can be discussed, unless, of course, the Additional -Estimates contain a  special item to which the honorable member takes exception. I must ask him not to discuss any matters which are not relevant to the items before the Committee. </para>

                        <para>.- We. get larger boats by the new contract, and they call, in addition to the places that were formerly called at, at Tulagi, Woodlark Island, and Yule Island on the outward voyage; and at Woodlark Island and nine or more ports in the Solomons, only some of which were called at formerly, on the return voyage. The smaller steamer of the two is larger by over 200 tons than the smaller steamer under the old contract. Both steamers are fitted with insulated space, refrigerating machinery, and electric light. We are getting a better service, with more ports of call, and with refrigerating space and other advantages. </para>

                        <para>. - The proposition that there should be a direct service from Cooktown to Port Moresby, in addition to what might be called the twenty-one all-round trips that take place during the year, in order that in between those trips the short run from Cooktown to Port Moresby might be made, has been favorably considered by us. But, so far, we have had no proposition from those formerly engaged in this trade, nor, so far as we are aware, is there any other . boat that can immediately take it up. I have already indicated that we are prepared to consider proposals for an additional service between the ports named. </para>

I admit that the&#39; amount is very small, and I did not wish to question in any way the expenditure on the Prime Minister&#39;s visit to London. Notwithstanding the magnificent service, which he rendered to the Commonwealth when there - as to the quality of that service there will be no two opinions in the House - I am not sure that he would not have employed his time much better if, instead of delivering political addresses as he did on several occasions, he had confined himself to the settlement of some of those outstanding questions that are pressing for finality. For instance, I may &#39; mention the matter  of the site on which we are to erect those palatial residential quarters for Australians when in London. We. were told some time ago by the Treasurer that this was a very urgent and pressing matter. The Prime Minister, when in London, might have taken an  opportunity of clearing  the matter up and settling once for all the question of &#39;the acquirement of that site. </para>

If I allowed him to discuss that question in the  way  he is doing, he could immediately turn round and say that the Prime Minister, when in London, might have employed his time better in arranging for some better newspaper in which to advertise than, say, the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Standard.</inline> By that means he could evade my ruling just as effectively as he is trying to do in regard to the question of the site of the Commonwealth offices- . in London. </para>

                            <para>- That may be, but I claim that I may, if I wish, complain  of the Prime Minister&#39;s action in connexion with any matter when he was in London1, and for which this vote is specially set down. If you rule that I may not do that, I do not see why these items are submitted unless it is for us to vote them in silence. The Prime Minister went to London ; here is a sum to cover his expenses whilst in London, and therefore anything he did, or failed to do when there, is a proper subject of debate., I am unwilling to dissent from your&#39; ruling, but I think -it is an extraordinary one. </para>

                        <para>. - The sum of &#163;555 does not represent the total cost of the representation of the Commonwealth at the Imperial Conference. It is in addition to .&#163;670 already voted, bringing the total up to &#163;1,225. I merely mention that, as perhaps some of the pre- &#39;vious vote was not used for purposes which the Prime Minister mentioned. </para>

                            <para>- This money is not being wisely expended- It has come to the knowledge of several honorable members, and, I think, to the knowledge of the Government, that some of it has been utilized, not for repatriating Australians who went from here to South Africa, but for sending to Australia persons of undesirable character who were never here before. I  think I myself have drawn attention to the statements appearing in the press in regard to that matter. Some of those undesirables have already come under the official notice of magistrates in this country &#39;in a not too creditable way. It is about time we put a stop to this kind of thing, especially as it is now proposed to spend. another sum for the repatriation of other Australians who have gone to New&#39; Caledonia and other places: There does not appear&#34; to have been a careful watch kept over this expenditure, in order to see that it was applied only to the- purposes for which it was voted, and that the necessitous people who wished to be brought here had actually been residents previously of Australia. We ought not to vote this sum. </para>

                        <para>.- During the general discussion on these Estimates last night, I observed that as most of the money had been expended, any attempt to reduce a vote would be only so much wasted time. All we can do now is to avoid occupying the time of the Committee longer than is necessary. I rise to make suggestions to the Prime Minister as to matters which he may have overlooked in regard to External Affairs. We start on . this page with &#34;other printing,&#34; and end with &#34; Shackleton.&#34; It is difficult to get anything out of .those items, but I know that the Prime Minister is only too glad of suggestions, no matter how humble the quarter they come from, for the improvement of his Department. The Department of External Affairs is one which is not usually very much in evidence at question time, but it controls- matters of the greatest importance to the Commonwealth. I find that there is a vote of &#163;20 put down for a paying officer in London. I assume that the salary of this officer was really passed in the General Estimates. </para>

I am anxious to obey the Chairman&#39;s ruling, though I may appear to be trying to evade it. We have passed no better legislation than that covered by the Immigration Restriction Act if&#39; it is properly administered, and none that will be more freely canvassed if the Act is not properly administered.. The reverse of immigration restriction is immigration encourgement,  and whilst it is the duty of the Department of External Affairs to prevent the introduction of undesirable immigrants, I am afraid that the Department is not as active as it might be in encouraging the immigration of desirable immigrants. We know that at the present time there is a vast stream of emigration from Great Britain to other parts of the world. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure that the Prime Minister sees the difficulty in which the honorable member for Parramatta and I are placed. The honorable gentleman&#39;s well-known affability is of great advantage to him in the passing of the Estimates of Departments of which he has charge, and I trust that he will find a means in replying to the observations which have been made to afford information on the matters which have been referred to, both with respect to immigration and the course to be adopted in the future in making arrangements for advertising the Commonwealth. The sum of &#163;550 is set down in connexion with the representation of the Commonwealth at the Imperial Conference in London, and I am sure that if the amount were increased by another .&#163;500 it would not be considered too much to pay for the services &#39;which the Prime Minister performed for Australia during his recent .visit to the Old Country. It is not often that it is possible for men to pay compliments of this character to political opponents, but that is all the more reason why, where they are deserved, they should be paid to men who have satisfactorily performed a public duty. I recognise the value of the services which the </para>

The Bill submitted by the honorable gentleman for expenses was about the lowest submitted by any representative of Australia. I think that should be said, although I do not suppose the honorable gentleman will thank me for putting it on record. The services rendered by the honorable gentleman at the Imperial Conference cannot be estimated in pounds, shillings, and pence. The &#39; important work which he did during his visit was really surprising, and must have left him neither time nor energy to do work of a kind which would have claimed the attention of smaller men. </para>

A political oppo- &#39;nent does not lose his independence by recognising good work done by any public man holding different, political views. The honorable member for Parramatta and T have been very anxious to discuss certain matters, the discussion of which apparently is not in order on these Estimates. I regret very much that I have been unable to discuss the stream of fresh blood that is flowing at the present time from the United Kingdom to other parts of the world, and the desirability of- some effort being made to divert some of the stream to Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I propose to do so; but I should like to say that if we are not permitted to discuss the policy underlying these Additional Estimates it is a waste of time to submit them, and Ministers might just as well take the money and say no more about it. I understand from the Prime Minister that the vote of &#163;555 is the only vote in which his own expenses in connexion with the visit to London are dealt with. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to call the attention of honorable members to the amounts which it is proposed to appropriate in connexion with this Department, under the heading of &#34; Temporary Assistance.&#34; In the Professional Division, I observe that the amount required to cover the cost of temporary assistance is set down at &#163;300. In the Crown Solicitor&#39;s office, a further sum of &#163;100 is required for the same purpose, and under &#34; Contingencies &#34; connected with the High Court, a still further sum of &#163;80, making a total of &#163;480, notwithstanding that upon the Estimates-in-Chief the amount appropriated for temporary assistance amounted to only &#163;90. It will thus be seen that for the current financial year the aggregate expenditure under this heading is  &#163;570.  That I regard as a large item. I suppose that this expenditure will be of a recurring nature? </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member is right in his surmise that the expenditure to which he has directed attention is due to exceptional circumstances. The &#163;300 which the Committee are asked to vote for temporary assistance in the professional division is accounted for by the fact that the secretary to the Department was absent in England for five months, and it was necessary to obtain a professional officer to assist the Department, as there was a large amount of drafting, as well as of administrative work, to be done. </para>

Strictly speaking, that discussion was out of order, but, with the consent of the Committee, it was allowed to proceed, it being understood that honorable members would subsequently be confined to the particular items included in the division under consideration.

If you, sir, will read a note which appears at the bottom of the page to which you have directed attention, I think you will see that the. honorable member for Calare is quite in order. The note in question refers to a ruling given by a  Speaker  of the House of Commons. Exception  seems to have been taken to a ruling of the  Chairman  restricting debate, and, upon reference to Mr/  Speaker  on the following day, the latter, while expressly dissociating himself from the question then under re-, view, went on to say - </para>

                        <para>I think, however, that I ought to state that items of supplementary Estimates may raise in themselves questions of policy, but the interpretation whether they do raise questions of policy, or not, must clearly be left to the  Chairman  of Committees. If I may be allowed to Illustrate what I mean, I would say the. question of the draining of Constantinople would clearly not raise the whole question of foreign embassies. But, on the other hand, . a vote which would largely increase a vote for a&#39; railway to Uganda might raise the whole question of the policy involved in the original vote for Uganda. </para>

                            <para>- The cost seems very great, though, of course, a Senate election is expensive. But, as- the complaint has been made that enormous sums are being asked for on Additional Estimates, which should have been asked for on the Estimates-in-Chief, I ask whether it  was not known when the latter were being prepared that this sum would be required. </para>

                        <para>.- Yesterday I asked the Treasurer whether an increase ,in the allowance of officials located in the interior of Western Australia, similar to the 5 per cent, allowance now being paid to those in the coastal districts) is to be given. The expense of living in the interior is much greater than that of living in Perth or Fremantle. </para>

                            <para>- At the bottom of page 14 there is an item which allows me to mention the subject. It has been shown that the cost of living in Perth and the coastal districts of Western Australia is&#187; sufficiently high to warrant an allowance of 5 per cent, to the public servants living there. The allowance paid to those on the gold-fields, however, was fixed on the assumption  that the cost of living in Perth was the same as it is in Melbourne. I have got the Postmaster-General to acknowledge that .there is justice in the claim that the living allowance of those in the interior should be correspondingly increased, though he has not promised to do anything. </para>

I have risen also to ask for information regarding the proposed expenditure of &#163;1,792 on repairs and maintenance for the Thursday Island Defences. In every part of . the Estimates one finds expenditure in connexion with the Defence Department.- On the last page &#163;&#39;260,000 is provided as New Special Defence expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has aptly described the sanitary arrangements of Parliament House. I trust that this amount is to be used in the direction I have indicated. I also desire to obtain from the Minister some information in regard to items under the heading of &#34; Home Affairs (New South Wales)&#34; providing for a sum of &#163;200 in respect of rent, and &#163;100 for repairs and maintenance. Is the money designed to provide for repairs to buildings temporarily occupied by us? It seems to show a want of ordinary business management, to say nothing of Scottish caution, to propose to effect repairs at a cost of &#163;100 to a building the yearly rental of which amounts to only &#163;200. I understood that the Customs House, Sydney, was to be altered for the purposes of the Home Affairs offices. </para>

Is this money to be expended in repairing the forts at Thursday Island, and is the work to be carried out by white men or Japanese? I wish to know whether the hard earnings of the workers are to be paid out for the encouragement of an alien race and to maintain settlement on Thursday Island, which is absolutely useless for the defence of this country. </para>

                            <para>- So I am told. I understand that the Japanese fleet which visited Australia a few years ago made a survey of these waters, and that the Japanese and the Germans are the only two nations that are absolutely familiar with every inlet and outlet of this country. Such information was obtained by the Germans, not because of any desire on their part to take Australia, but for the safety of their merchant shipping in Australian waters. The Japanese, however, did not make a survey for the same reason. They have no commerce with this country. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Darwin certainly needs to obtain some information regarding the defences of Thursday Island. I have inspected them, and think that there is room for a much larger expenditure upon them. I doubt, however, whether any further expenditure should be incurred on fortifications as we saw them on the last occasion of the parliamentary visit of inspection. I rather think that it would! be wise to obtain from the Minister the fullest information before we pass the item in question. I may inform the honorable member for Darwin that the Japanese did not succeed in inspecting the fortifications on the island, and did not obtain&#39; the information they desired. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member must not take notice of every statement he sees in the press. I am satisfied that the Japanese did not get an opportunity to ascertain the strength of the defences on Thursday Island. Unless they were allowed to visit the forts, they could not make drawings of them. It is absolutely necessary that the Island should be fortified, since it commands a very important waterway. It is necessary that our fortifications there should be strengthened, but some military authorities hold the view that the forts are now wrongly placed. Before we expend &#163;1,792 on their maintenance, we should obtain, from experts, reports dealing with that phase of the question. Let us extend our money on defence&#39;s properly placed. I do not think that we ought to express opinions in this House regarding the defences at different ports of the &#39;Commonwealth, but I certainly think that we have not spent nearly sufficient upon the fortification of our important points of which Thursday Island is one. </para>

                            <para>- No, but I &#39;Have always held that to insure peace, it is necessary to be ready for war. No one is more opposed to militarism than I am&#39;; but I am not so foolish as to believe that by refusing to keep a rifle at hand, and to learn how to use it, we are likely to enjoy immunity from aggression on the part of other nations. I have no desire that the Commonwealth should1 trespass upon the domains of other countries, but I think that we should take care to have adequate defences. I am glad to see that the Minister of Defence has returned to the chamber. If he can convince the Committee that it is wise to expend further sums on the fort at Thursday Island as it stands, I shall be quite prepared to allow the item to pass. But if he shares the idea which seems to be entertained by military experts - that the defence of Torres Strait should be transferred to another point - I think that the sooner we stop spending money on Thursday Island, and set about fortifying the proper place, the better it will be. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Hindmarsh has certainly raised an important point, because it involves the question of what is the proper place for fortifications in Torres Strait. That has been a very debatable question for a considerable time, and when it is determined whether Goode Island or Thursday Island is the proper place, it will mean an expenditure of not &#163;1,700, but very many thousand pounds. With regard to the defence of Australia that is one of the points yet undecided. I do not desire to speak more fully in that regard. Recognising that the question was under consideration and must be decided, I presume in the course of two or three years, and seeing that it was possible that the main fortifications would be at Goode Island, it was regarded as an unwise thing to expend any considerable amount upon the fortifications at Thursday Island, and so things went on for two or three years, until &#39; the fortifications fell into such a state of disrepair that it became absolutely necessary, unless they were to be abandoned at once, to put them into something like order. The Department came to the conclusion that it was not possible to abandon- the .defence of Torres Strait altogether, and that the best course was in the cheapest possible way to put the fortifications into something like fighting efficiency as far as the money would go. </para>

The same question arises continually in connexion with defence. Some modem authorities would rather have some other defence than the mines. They say, &#34; Not exactly what we want ; not quite up-to-date ; but keep what we have- till better can be done, as it is a deterrent for the time being.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- That is prehistoric; action, if any, was taken many years ago. The defence of Torres Strait may- be eventually moved from Thursday Island to Goode Island. In the meantime the best is being done with what we have until something better is obtained. Some representations were made to me in regard to the employment of aliens by officers and others and undue access to our forts, and I directed inquiries to be made. I am informed that in no part of Australia now is an alien employed in connexion with the . Defence Force in any way. </para>

                            <para>- No. One hears a large number of statements made, some of them being correct and others perhaps not quite correct. A considerable time ago I came to the conclusion that the access and publicity in connexion with our forts were deplorable. &#34;Every commandant has now very special instructions that there shall be no such publicity or possibility of obtaining information concerning the forts. It ceased, I understand, some months ago. </para>

                            <para>- No, sir ; but I am grateful for the opportunity of being able to draw attention to the absence of an item for that purpose. I want to know how much longer the Minister of Defence proposes to wait before he brings the defences of Australia - the fortifications on Thursday Island, with the others - up to the standard prescribed by the Imperial Defence Committee? </para>

                        <para>.- Some information ought to-be given to the Committee about the item in regard to the extra allowance to public officers in Western Australia. Up to the present time, officers on the gold-fields have, been given a. special allowance owing to the excessive cost of living there as compared with the coastal districts. Some time ago, the Public Service Commissioner came to the conclusion that the cost of living, even&#39; in Perth, was higher than the cost of living in the eastern States, and consequently he allowed an increase of 5 per cent. to the officers living there. But the officers on the gold-fields have not received a corresponding increase. The disparity which prevailed before the Commissioner made the increase does not now exist. What I want to know is whether the Treasurer can see his way to promise to pay the allowance, so as to put the gold- fields, officers in relatively the same position as the coastal officers? </para>

                        <para>As an outcome of the Commissioner&#39;s visit to Western Australia last year, and his investigations into cost of living in Perth, it was decided to recommend that officers stationed in Perth, and at all localities in Western Australia not already subject to District Allowance, -should be granted a special District Allowance of 5 per cent. on their salaries. The officers on the gold-fields who have drawn their District Allowance since 1904 now urge that if Perth officers are to draw. 5 per cent. allowance, the allowances already paid on the gold-fields should be augmented by an additional 5 per cent., and this demand is supported by the argument that as the gold-fields allowances were originally based on a comparison of cost of living at Perth, and as Perth salaries are being increased by 5 per cent., the gold-fields salaries should be similarly increased. The original District Allowances were not based on a comparison between Perth and the gold-fields - </para>

                            <para>- When the increased allowances were granted they caused a considerable additional expenditure. This is an important question of policy, and I do not feel disposed to take upon myself the responsibility of dealing with it. If it is decided to grant the extra allowances, of course the money can be found, but there is a principle involved which will have to be considered, and the Cabinet, if it decided that they should be paid, would have to override the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s decision. </para>

                        <para>.- There appears under Works and Buildings for Tasmania, in connexion with the Department of the Attorney-General, an item of &#163;270 for rent, and another of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;212</inline> for fittings and furniture. I could understand a Department supplying its own furniture, and even fittings, for its own property ; but not fittings for a rented place. It would be better to show the expenditure on fittings and furniture separately. There is also an item of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;975</inline> for fittings and furniture for the Post and Telegraph Department in Victoria. That seems a large sum. I can find no similar expenditure for the Post and Telegraph Department in any other State. Are those fittings and furniture for the new building, or do they appertain to the officer who was brought from Queensland ? </para>

                        I do not. The honorable member omitted to state this afternoon that 14s. or 15s. a week is the cost of keep. Do the Government propose to grant the increased allowances in places like Townsville and Rockhampton? Is the cost of living in Perth, which is nearer to the Old Country than any other port in Australia, greater than in out-of-the-way places like those I have mentioned? Has the 5 per cent. allowance been given to officers in Perth and its neighbourhood as a concession to the Western Australian representatives in both Houses who have interviewed the Government, or has it been granted upon some broad principle which is to be applied to officers similarly situated in other parts of Australia? It is somewhat invidious to single out the officers in and around a capital city. I have not mentioned Brisbane, which is not much nearer Melbourne than Perth is, but I do not see why officers in and around the south-eastern portions of Queensland, to say nothing of those in remoter parts, should not receive the same treatment. Do the officers in and about Townsville receive the district allowance?

                            <para>- The officers stationed at Perth did not receive a district allowance. What is being asked now on behalf of officers stationed in remote districts of Western Australia is that over and above the district allowance which they have been receiving they should be given the extra living allowance of 5 per cent. granted to officers stationed at Perth. </para>

If the Cabinet decide that these extra allowances should be paid throughout the Commonwealth the money can be found, but it should not be forgotten that the expenditure is creeping up, and we should be very cautious about what we do in this way. </para>

                    <para class="block"> I have searched through the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s original classification scheme, and have been.- unable to find a sentence in it to support that assertion. My opinion is that this excuse is merely an after thought. The basis of comparison actually used must have been the cost of living in Perth. Moreover, there is extrinsic evidence that it was so based, because the district allowances paid to officers on the gold-fields and in the remoter parts of Western Australia prior to Federation were practically the same as those which the Public Service Commissioner recommended. And those allowances were fixed by the State Government of Western Australia upon the basis of the difference between the cost&#34; of living on the gold-fields and in the remoter parts of the State, and&#39; the cost of living in- and around Perth. That is at least corroborative evidence that the district allowances recommended by the Public Service Commissioner were not based upon a comparison between the cost of living on the gold-fields with the cost of living in the eastern States. In any case, as the, honorable member for Brisbane has pointed out, it is but justice that officers employed at remote stations should have their allowances relatively increased. I suggest that the Treasurer obtain another statement from the Public Service Commissioner. He should ask that officer where in his original classification scheme he has said that he based the district allowances upon a comparison between the cost of living on the gold-fields and in the eastern States. </para>

                            <para>- He cannot deny that, when the State Government fixed these district allowances they had regard entirely to the difference in the cost of living, in various parts of Western Australia, and not the cost in the other States. I should like the Public Service  Commissioner also to name the officers in Western Australia who believe that there should be no corresponding increase to gold-fields officers. It is curious that the Public Service Commissioner should make such . a  statement without giving his authority for it. </para>

                            <para>- No;- as to the refusal to make a corresponding increase in the allowance granted to gold-fields officers. I suppose it is useless to expect to produce much effect on the mind of the Treasurer just now. But I may remind him that the matter- to which I have, directed attention has given rise to a sense of injustice amongst- officers stationed in the remoter parts, not only of Western Australia, but of Queensland and New South. Wales. They&#39; naturally feel that, serving the Commonwealth at places where the cost of living is excessive and the conditions of life hard, -some extra payment should be made to them to compensate them for the hardships and deprivations they endure. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to direct the attention of the Treasurer to a matter to which I have already referred, and which I do not intend to raise again on these Estimates. I refer- to the increase in the amounts asked for incidental expenses. I notice that the increase in his own Department is not as large in proportion to the original vote as the increase in connexion with some other Departments. Although the original- Estimates showed a large increase as .compared with last year&#39;s expenditure on these bread-and-butter items, &#39; I find that in some cases the Additional&#34; .Estimates submitted provide  for votes which are&#39; actually in excess of those included in the original Estimates. I do not wish to move any reduction, because I recognise that that is a very unsatisfactory way of testing the opinion of the Committee. I have already shown that, taking all the Departments except the new. Departments, the votes . for incidental expenses on the Estimates-in-Chief exceed by &#163;14,000 the expenditure on this account for last year; and&#39; yet the Additional Estimates provide for a further increase of expenditure amounting to many thousands of pounds. In the circumstances, I feel that I am justified in asking the Treasurer to give special attention to the matter, in order, if possible, to prevent the continual increase of these votes for incidental expenses. </para>

In this connexion, if I remember rightly, the Commission referred to made some recommendation in the direction of enforcing native labour by means of a hut tax. I notice that to-day a statement has been made that ordinances are to. be introduced, to give effect to the. proposal, and so bring about a condition of enforced labour in Papua. I should like the Treasurer to give the Committee some undertaking that before any ordinances of that kind are approved, this House will be given an opportunity to discuss the policy of enforcing labour upon natives of Papua. </para>

                            <para>- Dissatisfaction naturally arises where officers are not treated alike. The officers located in almost every remote portion of Australia naturally think that they &#39; labour under special disabilities. But I know that there is a strong feeling amongst South Australian officers - particularly amongst the linemen employed between Port Augusta and Western Australia - that they are very badly treated in the matter of these district allowances. In some cases they were very much better off when they were under State control. For instance, one of the heavy items of expenditure with them is the cost which they have to incur for the conveyance of rations and other goods. Owing to the extremely high cost of conveying goods to these distant parts, the South Australian Government used periodically to send up goods upon being requisitioned to do so, and to pay the cost of carriage. But under the present system the officers themselves have to pay that cost, and the district allowances do not nearly cover the extra expenditure which they have to incur. I have been informed that no district allowances are paid to the linemen to whom I have referred. They feel that they labour under a special disability as compared with the Western Australian officers at Eucla. Whether this is so or not, I am not in a position to say, but certainly the complaint ought to be investigated.I know that there is a strong belief that the South Australian officers at Eucla are treated worse than are the Western Australian officers at that place. While both technically receive the same district allowances, the fact is that all the Western Australian officers have been placed in the senior positions. No doubt this is due to the fact that prior to Federation the Western Australian officers received higher salaries than did the. South Australian officers. But I desire to impress upon the Public Service Commissioner the necessity of dealing out even-handed justice in this matter. I wish also to emphasize the objection urged by the honorable member for North Sydney in regard to the large amounts involved in these Additional Estimates. He referred particularly to the amounts set down for contingencies. In my opinion, there is a great deal in his complaints. It seems to me that the Estimates-in-Chief should have provided more fully for the probable expenditure of the year, and the large sums appearing in the Additional Estimates are not evidence of foresight on the part of those responsible for their preparation. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like some information in regard to the amount of  &#163;1,776  asked for in connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz&#39;</inline> experiments for the extermination of rabbits by communicating to them a disease. Does the amount cover the total expense incurred by the Government, or will further accounts be presented later on, and has finality been reached in connexion with the experiments ? I should be glad if the Treasurer would make a general statement as to the position of affairs. Some New South Wales pastoralists spent a large sum of money in bringing out <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz,</inline> and when he returned to Europe strong efforts were made, by circularizing pastures protection boards, local government boards, progress committees, pastoralists&#39; unions, and farmers and settlers&#39; associations, to bring pressure on the Government to allow the dissemination of the virus on the mainland. Apparently that effort failed ; but the public should know what view the Government take in regard to the request. At one time it seemed that the difference of opinion as to the advisability of allowing experiments on the mainland would be a <inline font-style="italic">casus belli</inline> between the State and the Commonwealth ; but feeling has since cooled off. No doubt, however, the interests at stake are sufficiently strong to cause further efforts to be made to secure the end aimed at, namely, the free distribution of disease for the extermination of the rabbit pest. </para>

                        <para>. - This matter was intrusted to me at the outset by the Prime Minister. The history of the experiments is well known. The Department of Trade and Customs, of which I was head, took charge of the virus when it was brought to Australia, and it has been in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Tidswell&#39;s</inline> keeping ever since. It was agreed that experiments should be made on Broughton Island, and we contributed towards the cost of erecting premises and obtaining animals for the purposes of the experiments.I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Tidswell</inline> in Sydney last week, and as the assistant left behind by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Danysz</inline> had complained that we intended to keep the virus and use it, taking credit for the destruction of the rabbits, which should be given to him, after consultation with the Prime Minister I wired to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Tidswell</inline> to send it back, which he has done. The experiments are now at an end, and I have authorized the destruction of all the cattle on Broughton Island. </para>

The honorable member for North Sydney has protested strongly against the enormous expenditure for which provision is made under the headings of &#34; Miscellaneous&#34; and &#34; Incidental expenditure and petty cash.&#34; The expenditure amounts to many thousands of pounds, and the Committee is not supplied with any details in regard to it. </para>

                            <para>- The Estimates-in-Chief provided for an expenditure of &#163;10,000 in respect of temporary assistance for the Department of Trade and Customs alone, and yet in these Additional Estimates, with only six weeks of the present financial year to run., we find provision made under the same heading for an expenditure of &#163;4,755 in connexion with the same Department.. That total includes - New South Wales, &#163;1,000 ; Victoria, &#163;500; Queensland, &#163;2,000 ; South Australia, &#163;390; Western Australia, &#163;20; and Tasmania, &#163;125. Thus the total expenditure on temporary assistance in the Department of Trade and Customs for the financial year ending 30th June next will be, in round numbers, &#163;15,000. This seems to indicate either that the Department is mismanaged, as the Post and Telegraph Department is - with the result that under ordinary circumstances v sweating takes place - or that there is unnecessary extravagance allied -with the management Of the Department itself. There must be something radically wrong somewhere when we realize that this is not the result of a sudden and temporary emergency, but that it goes on all the year round, and- year by year assumes greater proportions. If the Department is undermanned and this temporary assistance is. required to cope with the increased and increasing business of a big Department, steps should be taken to appoint a sufficient permanent staff as the urgent heed arises. The practice &#39; of appointing temporary hands is really unjust to those so engaged. Many men apply -for temporary positions in the belief that by securing them they establish a claim to be appointed to the first vacancies that occur on the permanent staff. This- belief is general, notwithstanding that there is a notice that such appointments carry with them no such preference. The; unfortunate feature of the system is that  o  after serving nine months temporary hands must ;necessarily be discharged. Just as they commence to become useful their services . have to be dispensed with, and a fresh  batch of temporary &#34;employes has to be taken on and instructed. The efficiency of the Department is impaired under this arran&#39;gement, because proficient permanent employes have to be taken from their ordinary work from time to time in order to instruct new recruits.  If the Department is undermanned and additional assistance is necessary to tide it over what- is not a mere temporary, congestion of business, But a normal development which must be anticipated unless&#39; we are to become a commercially stagnant community, more permanent hands should be employed. The&#34; sooner the practice of too generally employing temporary assistance is abolished the better. It is giving rise to an evil that is  assuming large proportions, and steps will have to be taken very soon to remedy the trouble. The attention of the Public Service Commissioner should be directed to the enormous expenditure incurred under this heading. &#39; I should move a consider - able reduction in such votes but that I do not wish it to appear that I desire to do an injustice to a large body of men upon whom the blame does not rest. Then, again, I understand that a considerable proportion of this amount has already been spent. It would, therefore, be futile to  move a reduction, and even if I did. I do not think it would be agreed to. I think, it only fair to notify Ministers that when the Estimates for next year are submitted I shall take a very decided stand upon this question. We are not in a position tonight to do more than to enter a protest, and, unfortunately, that will be unavailing in the direction of lessening the immediate, expenditure under these heads. </para>

                        <para>.- Perhaps the item for temporary, assistance-  may be explained by the fact that last year the Tariff had to be prepared ; and also by. the necessity to employ some persons in connexion with the payment&#39; of the sugar bounty. When the Estimates-in-Chief were under consideration, I asked for some particulars as to why a sum of &#163;8,000 was required for the repatriation of kanakas. I should like the Minister of Trade and Customs to state whether these Estimates contain any item for that purpose. According, to what the Prime Minister said some time ago, the Commonwealth was not. to be put to any considerable expense. There was a distinct agreement between the Commonwealth and Queensland that the amount paid- by the planters into the fund&#39; should be repaid by the State to the Commonwealth. I have searched all the papers which have been laid upon the table to find a record of any payment of that sort. </para>

If the Minister has not the information at hand, perhaps he can make a statement later on.

                        <para>. - On these Estimates we are asking for a sum of nearly . &#163;5,000 for the purpose of temporary assistance. When honorable members recollect the. amount of  revenue which we have collected&#39; and, the extra work which we have had to do, and when I mention that the heads of the Department advise that they do not expect the same amount of work to be done next year, no doubt they will recognise at once how unwise it would be for us to make permanent appointments until it. is made clear that there is permanent work to be done. That accounts for the increased amount for temporary assistance. I agree with the honorable member for Lang that it is most undesirable that we should have temporary men doing any work which is of a permanent character. As soon as it is made clear that any work is of a permanent character, I think it is desirable that per- . manent bands should be employed. As a justification for these items,  . I  may mention that last year the revenue amounted to &#163;9,753,000, and that this year it is estimated that it will be &#163;11,931,000 The. cost of collecting the Customs and Excise revenue&#39; last year was &#163;2 13s. 3d. per cent., and the cost this year is estimated at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 7s. 6d. per cent. It will be seen -that the cost is decreasing. Considering the tremendous increase in the work, that messages relating to the Tariff have been passing between the Houses, and that whenever a  Tariff item has been dealt with a telegram has had to be despatched to every Customs House in the Commonwealth, honorable members can easily understand that, not only do we require a lot of temporary assistance, but also that our account for telegrams must be very large. </para>

This item for temporary assistance is not required in connexion with the service of which the honorable member for Coolgardie has spoken. The question &#39; of sending the kanakas back to their islands comes under the Department of the Prime Minister, to whom I shall convey his representations. </para>

I hope that honorable members, recognising that the Department is well administered, will allow the Estimates to pass, especially as it is getting late. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister has talked about the care exercised in keeping down the expenses of his Department I desire to know how much of this &#39; &#39; temporary assistance &#39; &#39; is called in to interpret the regulations which were referred to at question time to-day, and which enable persons to claim drawback on imports which have passed out of the country in another form. I can quite understand the expense to which the Department has been put in connexion with the Tariff, but my information is to the effect that a good deal of this extra assistance has been called in in order to follow up goods, for instance, sugar, which is imported and then exported as an ingredient of jam. </para>

                    <para>- I am not prepared to give a ruling on the question, but on&#39; being asked so to do, I ought to give the House such information as I am possessed of. In the first place, it is impossible to look anywhere for precedents, because I know of no other Constitution which so distributes the financial power between the. respective Houses as does ours. We must therefore be guided wholly by our own Constitution, and by the practice which we have set up. Precisely the same point arose on the consideration of the first Tariff, and it was agreed by the then House that whether or not the message which was sent, as this message has been sent, from another place to us, should be received, was entirely a matter to be determined by the House itself. There were not then, there are not now, any joint Standing Orders dealing with the matter, so that when this question is again called on on the day for which it may be set down, it will be for the House either to proceed with the consideration of the message, or to deal with it as it may think fit, or to refuse to consider it, precisely as the House at that moment pleases. I may remind the House that, on the last occasion, it was decided to take the message into consideration, but the following resolution was adopted- </para>
