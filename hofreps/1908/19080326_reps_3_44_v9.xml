                        <para>- The practice in all cases is to advertise the vacancies two or three times prior to their being filled. The honorable member was good enough to submit to me the particular cases he has in view; and it has been discovered that, although they were omitted from' the issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> immediately prior to the one he showed to me, they were advertised in the previous issue, so that there was ample time for applications to be sent in. For the further information of the honorable member, I may say that the Public Service Commissioner always allows sufficient -time for applicants in other States to send their papers in, 'so that no applications may be missed. </para>

                        <para>-At the beginning of the session I drew the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact 'that the Imperial Government contemplated dealing with one of the London docks; and I asked whether he would make a recommendation to that Government, with a view to having some accommodation in the way of cool storage or otherwise for Australian produce provided for in connexion with any Bill introduced. I understood that subsequently a report was received from Captain Collins, and this morning a newspaper cable mentions that there is a prospect of some recommendation resulting in something being done. I should like to know whether the Prime Minister has had any official in formation on the question from the Imperia Government ? </para>

                        <para>- The information we received is, of course, five or six weeks behind that recently cabled. At that time, there were still conflicting proposals, the more important of which were from persons privately interested in the docks, who desired fresh legislation. The answer received up to that time to our representations was that, as the matter was in private hands, the Board of Trade, although it might make some general representations, had no authority to press them. According to the cables in the press, however, there has been an entire transformation of the situation. " It is now possible, if not probable, that the Imperial Government will undertake the care of the docks, and their reconstruction. In that event, Captain Collins' former instructions to keep himself closely in touch with the whole question are evidently being carried out by him. In addition, as soon as any steps are taken, further representations are intended to be made by the Commonwealth Government, with a view to obtaining the advice of the States, and I am communicating with the States Governments on the subject. </para>

                            <para>- So it is. The charges of repatriation are being borne by the whole people. What is it but an imposition upon the people of the Commonwealth that 75 per cent, of the total sugar revenue finds its way into the pockets of the planters themselves, instead of into the Treasury? I propose to show that this trust fund has been misappropriated by the Queensland Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Neill</inline> Brenan, the Queensland immigration officer, gave the following evidence. </para>

                    <para>The fund has had to pay out large sums at various times for purposes which were not <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> charges upon it. For instance, an agitation was got up against the islanders on account of leprosy, and the examination which was made cost nearly  £1,000  and, I think, they only discovered one or two lepers. All returned passages collected stand as a credit under its own heading, and I take it that the Government of Queensland have accepted the responsibility of running special hospitals for the islanders, which created the heavy loss standing to the debit of that account. It will, when necessary, carry out any liability to the fund which may exist, up to  £5  per head for eac] islander going home. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and, in addition, they subtracted £13,168 17s. 7d., which was expended for " general purposes " - which I presume means the ordinary services of the State. In other words, the Government of that- State spent £34,000 of that money, so that only a little over £10,000 remained to the credit of the fund. The honorable member for Herbert says very truly that some of this money was expended on hospitals. It must not be forgotten, however, that those hospitals were erected for the use of kanakas as far back as 189 1. With all respect to the honorable member, I should like to know how we can be held responsible for that expenditure, seeing that our legislation was passed at least ten years later, and could not possibly have affected it. The Government appear to have been prepared to accept any proposal made by the Royal Commission appointed by the Government of Queensland. That Commission recommended that nearly £55,000 should be expended on the repatriation of kanakas, and that a large proportion of that amount should be devoted to the erection of buildings which, like the sugar bounties, were to be a gift to the State. I do not know why honorable members do not insist upon Queensland carrying out it's bargain with the Federation. The only explanation I can offer is that they are tired of everything relating to the kanakas and the sugar industry, and are willing to agree to  any  vote for which the! Government ask. Even if the Queensland Government had not in hand the money which the planters were required to deposit, the least' it could have done was to return the kanakas to their islands. Queensland introduced the kanakas for her own purpose, and she should have returned them. </para>

                            <para>- They were, and the money so received constitutes the fund which the Queensland Government has misappropriated. I have no desire to labour this matter, but think that an explanation should be given by the Prime Minister. I feel very strongly on this question, because documents in my possession establish a distinct bargain between Queensland and the Federal Government, that the Commonwealth should be paid £5 per head in respect of all kanakas repatriated. </para>

                            <para>- It can be identified, because the item, although it does not show the sources from which the receipts were derived, specifically refers to the repatriation of Pacific islanders. As a matter of fact, they were paid in accordance with the agreement. They were paid into a trust fund out of the consolidated revenue of Queensland. That, however, is immaterial for a sovereign' is the same whatever its source. </para>

                            <para>- The item relates to salaries of our own officers, who supervised the return of the islanders. We thought it necessary in some cases to employ additional, officers, because there was a great rush at the particular time. The item of £8,015 also includes £686 for the maintenance of islanders awaiting deportation at Brisbane and other ports. Up to 30th June, 1907, 1,867 islanders were returned to the Solomons, 1,360 to the New Hebrides, and 351 to Fiji. The deportation, I am happy to say, has been almost completed. It must be a source of great satisfaction to the House that, despite the very threatening prophesies as to the consequences of the return of the islanders in this way, the work has been successfully carried out. I do not insinuate that there was no warrant for those prophesies, because the experiment of returning in such a- short time so large a number of natives to islands Like the Solomons, which are always in a state of unrest - where inter-tribal quarrels are very frequent1 - was necessarily very hazardous. </para>

                            <para>- I should say, from these figures, that the net cost for the year has been about £8,000, but shall obtain further information on the subject. When in Queensland, I visited the depots where the Pacific Islanders lived while awaiting shipment, and found them to be literally children of a larger growth. In reply to questions put by the officer in charge, they seemed undecided as to when they would go, and I was informed that it was not until a vessel was alongside,  and friends or leaders aboard, that many of them determined to leave. To prevent anything but the best of feeling, they were given considerable latitude as to the vessel bv which they would travel, and there was little abuse of this freedom. Some were indifferent about going, others said that they were glad to be getting back to their own country; those who were reluctant to go had become attached to a man or a place. It was gratifying to know that the  work was being done without coercion or ill-feeling. The kanakaslooked upon their repatriation as necessary, and accepted it with philosophical equanimity. Others were highly pleased, most were indifferent and variable. I have spent more anxious hours over this business than over any other matter of administration, and the remarkable success which has attended the repatriation has been so gratifying that I have paid comparatively little regard to the exact cost. </para>

                            <para>- Any one may speak who wishes to do so; but last night the debate had practically petered out. I asked for an adjournment to enable the Prime Minister to make his statement regarding immigration to-day, and he then requested me to assist in bringing the discussion to an early conclusion this afternoon ; but I hope that, under the circumstances, he will not hold me responsible for any discussion that may take place. I wish to say a few words regarding immigration. The debate which "we have had has not been too long, considering the importance of the subject. No other lies more at the root of our national existence, and, therefore, as much light as possible should be thrown on it. In the first place, I take exception to the dilatoriness of the Prime Minister in bringing his immigration proposals to a head. The honorable member for Flinders chided me the other night for speaking rather severely on this subject, and said that we should not quibble about mistakes in the early stages. But, were he an old member of the House, he would know that this matter has been before us during the last four or five years, so that it has now become an annual one. It is time, therefore, that a definite proposal was made. ' If the Prime Minister cannot take a definite step forward, he should let the people of Australia know it, so that the States Governments may be left to their own responsibilities, to take such action as they think best. </para>

                            <para>- I do not suggest that the honorable and learned gentleman would do that; but it might be done in the future. Therefore, I think it would be well for him to move to reduce the vote to such a sum as he thinks will be spent. I have listened to many of the statements made during the debate, and especially to the perfervid utterances of Labour representatives. The honorable member for Hindmarsh, speaking with the earnestness and fervour which always characterize his remarks, complained that there is too often what is euphemistically called the " stinking fish propaganda " carried on by. Australians resident abroad. It is a strange commentary on that speech of the honorable member that, almost immediately afterwards, a member of his party should rise and contend that there is no need to rapidly press on with this matter - that we should take the greatest care as to how we proceed. The honorable member went on to substantiate that statement by saying that there were thousands of people in Australia to-day working for what is far below a living wage. He gave us a harrowing picture, filling in the details, of men who are employed at a pound a week, and of girls who work for 5s. a week or for nothing. I do not pretend to say there is not a basis of fact for the statements made, but I submit that we need not drag these details of our secondary industries into a debate of this character. And it seems to me that there is a very simple; answer to all that was said. If we make our primary industries as prosperous as they ought to be - if we multiply and broad-base those industries - we shall secure the very best foundation for the prosperity of the secondary industries. Immigration, so far from hindering and fettering secondary industries, will make a broader and more certain basis than exists to-day for their prosperity. In other words, if we secure such immigrants as will assist <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the development of our primary industries, that is the surest way </para>

                    <para class="block">I know - and I think I am on sound economic  ground  - of building up those enterprises in the city, which, after all, depend for their life, vitality and prosperity on the people out in the "  farback."  Any well-directed and well -organized scheme of  immigration  so far from taking a farthing from the wages in the city, will tend to very materially increase them. The honorable member for Wannon last night suggested, quietly and calmly, the desirability of altering our Constitution so as to admit of the Commonwealth acquiring all the lands and railways of the States. That is the honorable member's idea of facilitating the flow of immigration. There is only one very serious defect in the suggestion, namely, that to take such a course would be to go far beyond the powers of the Federal Government - far beyond the arrangement which was. honorably made with the States when union was effected. The Federal Government will do no good for itself until it makes up its mind to -work well within its constitutional powers as conferred at present. I am not now speaking for the first time on this question in this Chamber; and I say that a great deal of our Federal ill -repute has been brought about by our tendency 'to work the Federation on the marginal line between the States and the Commonwealth. Instead of working well within our own powers, and developing them - a process which would give us plenty to do - we have all the time been engaged in a tug of war with the States on the question whether we or they have some particular power. To me the question of population is the riddle of the Sphinx for Australia ; and now, when we approach this  supremest  of all problems, we. are quietly told that we ought to uproot the Constitution - no doubt by legitimate means - and acquire the lands and railways of the States. </para>

In my judgment, the land of Australia is, in some cases, locked up in far too large areas;' and something will have to be done to make some of those areas less, and our settlement more concentrated, and, therefore, to make our land production very much more efficient. </para>

Members of the Labour Party say,-. "Hear,- hear;" but may I remind them that the States Parliaments are broad-based on the people's will, just as much as is the Federal Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- The nominee Legislative Councils in Queensland and in New South Wales are, because they are nominee, easily' controllable by the popular Chambers. I remind the honorable member for Yarra, that Victoria is not all Australia - that when we are talking about land, Victoria represents only a very small slice. Where there are large areas of fertile land in Australia, the Parliaments are controlled on a basis of one man one vote, and, in some cases, one adult "one vote. It is not a question of whether large estates shall be broken up - the question is by whom is the breaking: up to be done, in order to bring about closer settlement and more intense cultivation throughout the length and breadth of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I remind the honorable member that the States. Parliament have power to do that kind of thing, whereas we have not. Reference was made last night to New Zealand ; and it is strange that the Dominion should be quoted constantly as a place where large estates are broken up, and the lands are easiest of access, and, consequently, where there is the most intense cultivation. But the figures show that) the average holding in South Australia is 800 acres, and in New South Wales 640 acres, while New Zealand stands third on the list, with 550 acres. This shows that New Zealand has larger average holdings, legislation notwithstanding, than there are in the case of Victoria. It is all very well to look over into your neighbour's field, which always looks green, until you get there. The same table of figures goes on to show that the average holding in France and Germany is 20 acres, in England 56 acres, and in the United States of America, about which we heard so much last night, 128 acres. It would appear, therefore, that a graduated land tax is not the only means of securing closer settlement, seeing that! there is the closest settlement where there is no such tax. </para>

                            <para>- I do not desire to push the argument further than it should legitimately go. I only say that, in my judgment, a graduated land tax is not a proposal calculated to give immediate effect to an immigration policy. I wish to say, further, that in many countries where no graduated land tax is operative, there is concentrated production and close settlement. So long as we continue to deal with airy schemes we shall get no genuine scheme of immigration propounded. It seems to 'me that in discussing this question and that question which do not come within the scope of the powers that we can exercise, we are " in the clouds." It would be far better for us to exercise our own powers to their full extent, and to endeavour to attract people to Australia - : - </para>

                            <para>- That can be propounded only by the Prime Minister. I complain that we have been waiting four or five years for a definite immigration policy. The Prime Minister blames the States for the delay, and the States themselves declare that- they can deal with the question of immigration better than the Commonwealth. Tt is about time that the Prime Minister ceased to dangle this question before the people of Australia, and set about doing something upon his own account by the exercise of the powers vested in the Commonwealth by the Constitution, or tell the people frankly he cannot. </para>

                            <para>- No. They affirm that they can deal with the question of immigration better than can- the Commonwealth. They have told the Prime Minister again and again that they do not wish to be troubled with his proposals, and that they are doing well on their own account. If I were in the Prime Minister's place to-day I should frame an immigration scheme of my own, by the exercise of such powers as we possess, and let the States do the best that they can. Of course, if the States would place areas at our disposal it would be an excellent thing.  But we cannot bludgeon them into doing that. At the same time, their refusal to co-operate with the Commonwealth is not a justification for the Commonwealth continuing to do nothing. </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. The Prime Minister has been waiting on the States for many years. It is time that he formulated a scheme of his own if he will not assist. I venture to think- that we can do a great deal ourselves without reference to the States. It. is time that the Prime Minister ceased making the beautiful speeches to which we have been accustomed to listen during the past four or five years, and commenced to act. I confess that when I have heard Kim discoursing upon this subject I have been tempted to let my fancy roam, and, in my mind's eye, T have seen ships laden with immigrants for Australia, who were assured of a warm welcome upon their arrival. I have had these sights burned into my imagination, by listening to his fervid deliverances upon this question during the past four or five years, and he really must forgive me when I grow a little impatient, and ask what he is doing in regard to the matter upon which he discourses so eloquently ? </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member. But when we touch his speeches with a little sober reason they somehow melt, into thin air. It is unfortunate that they should be buttressed by so small a substratum of practical reason. I heard some time ago of a meeting which the Prime Minister addressed in London upon the question of Australian defence. I am assured that, as he rolled out his fine periods and told his hearers how we com,.menced our military training with the boys at school, and how every boy was trained to be a-soldier; some of the old wise heads exclaimed, " My word, that was a speech worth listening to. We are learning something to-night." An Australian who happened to be present, interjected just here, "Yes. I am. learning something too." No doubt, the speech served its purpose. In saying this I do not wish to detract for one moment from the . great service which the Prime Minister rendered to Australia during his recent visit to Great Britain.

                            <para>- I can assure the honorable member that I am not a competitor with the Prime Minister in the matter of rhetorical embellishment. All I ask for is some tangible result from all the beautiful speeches to which we have been so long accustomed to listen. I stated the other evening that the £20,000 proposed to be expended in advertising our resources in the Mother  Country  was too much to fritter away. If we are going to adopt an effective scheme of immigration, the amount is not nearly sufficient. It is merely a drop in the bucket. The sooner that we have a bolder scheme than any that has yet been forecasted the better. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot endow the honorable member with the wherewithal to appreciate my argument. I have pointed out again and again that there are certain things that we can do irrespective of the States, and I do not think that we ought to wait upon the States if they will not fall into line with us. At the same time, if they would co-operate with us, our proposals would be infinitely more effective. Now, what are we to do in this matter? There can be no doubt as to the gravity of the question. Only the other day, I read an article which seemed to me to put the position in a nutshell. It is all very well for us to concentrate our gaze, on the crowded cities, and upon the poor sweated operatives there whose condition every one of us, I am sure, .desires to better. But that is not all that we have to consider in connexion with the settlement of Australia. There is a view which is even more vital to our national existence, and that view is put very concisely in the article to which I refer. In it the writer says - </para>

                        <para>The present population of the globe may be roughly estimated as 1,700 millions, of which some, goo millions are in Asia. On the basis of an increase of only i per cent, per annum these figures will be doubled in 60 years. The present increase in Australia is about 2 per cent., so that in taking the lower ratio for the world a good margin has been allowed for the decimating influences of plagues, famines, and wars. We must thus face the problem of some 1,700 millions of additional people having to spread themselves over the unoccupied areas of the globe within the next 60 years, or within the lifetime of some who are children to-day. </para>
                        <para class="block">Thus while 1,700,000,000 will be added, to the population of the globe during the next fifty years, at our present rate of increase, Australia's population will then be only comparatively few. The question, therefore, arises whether the world will permit an empty continent like this to continue unsettled while its own population has doubled in the already congested areas outside of Australia. We ought to keep that view in mind when we discuss the ways and means of filling up. Australia with what I hope will be a happy and contented people. </para>

                            <para>- I am not discussing that aspect of the matter. I am in entire agreement with all the disproof of the theory propounded by <inline font-style="italic">Malthus,</inline> and .1 do not believe that the world is  overpopulated  at all, if we are able to make the teachings of science and the growing knowledge of the community available to the' people. Otherwise there is a very serious problem of over-crowding ahead of us- For instance, it is said that bv the adoption of only ordinarily intelligent methods of production, America could sustain a population of 660,000,000 in lieu of 80,000,000. But that statement rests upon the supposition that we have in future a  system  of good government, and that we shall be able to do those things which  to-day  are but remote possibilities. If we could press into the service of mankind all the knowledge that we possess to.dav, what a better world it would be. But somehow or other when we attempt to do that, the human ego will creep in and upset all our schemes. We must, therefore, endeavour from the experience of the past to forecast the future. </para>

                            <para>- But even if it be doubled, in fifty years' time we shall be only a few in Australia, whilst the world .will have added 1,700,000,000 to its already congested areas. That is the point I wish ' to make. In connexion with a scheme of immigration, we must keep our eyes on these cardinal facts. of the situation, because they alone are the guiding stars that we should follow. While congested areas exist outside, what is happening with .regard to immigration to Australia ? A return issued by the Emigration Information Office, in London, shows that last year 85,000- emigrants left the United Kingdom for the United States of America, where there is a population of 80,000,000; whilst only 9,000 left for Australia, where there is a population of 4,000,000. That is a very serious aspect of affairs. </para>

                            <para>- I am. I venture to say that just as there is every conceivable kind of land in America, so there is in Australia. We have our arid and semi-arid  tracts  of country, and America has the' same. The right honorable member, who has given a great deal of attention to this matter must be aware that in the United States of America there are no less than 11,000,000 acres under irrigation. Intense cultivation, rather than large areas of sparsely and  imperfectly  cultivated lands, is to-day the basis of the prosperity of other countries. </para>

                    <para class="block">What can we do to remedy the present state of affairs? The first step is the appointment of a central authority in London for the purpose of looking after the work. I have been very tardy in coming to the decision that we require a High Commissioner for Australia, having in view the fact that all the States have agencies in London. We were told definitely by the Prime Minister and his colleagues in pre-Federation days that one of the advantages of the union was to be the doing away of the States agencies, and the centralizing of our authority in London by the appointment of a High Commissioner for Australia. I believed that that was the way to proceed. But here again the States will not do anything towards the consolidation and economising of their agencies in London, and the time has come for us to have our own High Commissioner, and to set up our own authority and influence in the great metropolis of the world. The very beginning of this question of immigration seems to me to be the appointment of a representative of the Commonwealth in London, clothed with all the authority and appurtenances to enable him. to bring the case for Australia adequately before the people of the old world. After appointing a High Commissioner, what else can we do? Tha answer comes at once in another question : " What are they doing elsewhere? What, for instance, are Canada and other countries doing?" Are honorable members aware that last year  250,000  immigrants went to the Argentine, and that this year it is anticipated that  400,000  more will go into the States of South America which have unsettled government, and where there is nothing like the security for capital and enterprise that exist in Australia? Into those unsettled portions of the globe emigrants are streaming by hundreds of thousands from the overcrowded centres of Europe. How is the Argentine securing them? By going about the work in a business-like way; showing the people the advantages to be derived from going to the Argentine, assisting them if need be to get there, and doing every thing possible to make easy their lot when 'they arrive. They do not stop to find every man a block of land before he emigrates. I believe that only  10  per cent, of the immigrants to Canada go directly on the land, and I venture to say that a very small proportion of 'the immigrants to the Argentine go directly to settle upon the land. They go there as many of us came to Australia - ready to turn 'their hands to anything that will enable them to make a comfortable living, and in the hope of ultimately getting on their feet and prospering. That is what must take place here if we are to have a steady stream of immigration such as will benefit Australia. </para>

                            <para>- It is strange then that only  10  per cent', of the immigrants to Canada find their way to. the land. As the honorable member knows- it is one thing to go on the land, and quite another matter to maintain themselves on it. The best men we can have to settle on the land are those who have some knowledge of the country, and who know something of its methods, customs, and laws. If we are merely going to bring here people who can be conducted to a piece of land immediately on their arrival, we shall not do anything to solve that grave national and racial problem to which the figures I have quoted unmistakably point. We have to consider, not the perfect plan - not what' we should like or what would be best - but what is possible, and make the best use of our possibilities. The other day I saw in the <inline font-style="italic">Manchester Guardian,</inline> an advertisement which struck me as being a rather cute one. . lt related to the advantages of New South Wales, but evidently some cute Canadian had put a heading to it' so that it read : " Canada - New South Wales." Immediately beneath that heading appeared a statement in plain language as to good wages and work being available for healthy, strong young people, and as to assisted passages to New South Wales. The advertisement also indicate3 where reliable information could be obtained. </para>

                            <para>- Very probably ; but it is still more probable that some cute Canadian had had something to do with tHe advertisement. This, at all events, is a specimen of the way in which Australia is being advertised to-day. Could anything better demonstrate the wisdom of at once making our advertising appliances effective and adequate? I do not know exactly what is being done by older  countries, but it occurs to me that, instead of confining our efforts to the great metropolitan centres of Great Britain, we need to get right down to the rural villages of the Old Country to intercept that steady stream of men and women leaving for the metropolitan centres at Home, and get them out here upon our sparsely populated lands. Here they would do very much better than they would by going to sweat and swelter in the metropolitan centres of the old world. I saw the other day a very admirable suggestion by a clergyman who had lately returned from a trip to the Old Country. He urged that we should enlist the services of the clergymen of rural villages, and give them every facility to secure immigrants for Australia. The ministers are the most influential personages in the rural districts of the Old Country, and would make admirable recruiting agents, securing for us the very best class of immigrants. We must first establish our authority in London, and then have our ramifications stretching through the rural districts of the Old Land. We must let the people know that in Australia there is every advantage that can be found elsewhere ; that we can match and overmatch every facility to be found in Canada or the United States of America, and that we have room for hundreds of thousands of healthy, strong, brawny, intelligent people who care to come here and carve out homes for themselves. That is the way to settle the industrial problems of Australia. We must give intending immigrants a favorable bias rather than urge, as is constantly alleged by some honorable members of the' Labour Party, that it is impossible for them to get a living, or even a bare existence in our cities. This is the kind of immigration that would help the cities and advantage all concerned. We shall have to cease constantly decrying our own conditions and resources. I am glad to see the honorable member for Calare in his place, because I want to say that if the speech that he made last night were cabled Home it would cause more fish to stink than any other speech which has been made for a long time either in or outside this Chamber. The picture which he drew last night of the sweated conditions of our cities - I have not a word to say about its accuracy </para>

The better way to proceed is, first, to develop our primary industries, the prosperity of which will enable the sweated population of the cities to demand higher wages and healthier and  pleasanter  conditions. There are other' suggestions which I could make, but I do not wish to occupy too much time. The Prime Minister has indicated that, in his opinion, there is a favorable .field for immigration in the Northern Territory. Whatever may happen in the future, we cannot, at present, dump immigrants there. That is not a proposal which could be discussed in connexion with practical measures for peopling the continent. </para>

Perhaps, at some future time, the Northern Territory will fill up ; it is the wish of my heart that it may. That would help to solve the defence problem. But just now we are discussing ways and means for peopling our. temperate latitudes, where offspring may be reared under conditions making for the  virility  of the race. The populating of the Northern Territory must be left to the future, as our teeming millions expand. I ask the Prime Minister to tell us, frankly, what is in his mind regarding immigration. To keep the continent empty, in view of the congested millions of other countries, is nothing less than an affront to the civilization of the world. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but I should like to know what his position is. He has found fault with every proposal put forward from, this part of the Chamber, and with the Government for having done nothing. Of course, it is not the business of an Opposition leader to propose a definite scheme, though any definite suggestions promising success would be listened to with great interest; but we should know what his general views are. His statement that a High Commissioner should Be appointed to organize the immigration department, and to advertise our resources, did not assist us very much, because we all admit that such an appointment is necessary. I have been in favour of it for years, and shall vote for the Bill when introduced. I think that a High Commissioner has not been appointed because of the difficulty in choosing a suitable person. Such an officer would do a great deal of useful work, not only in regard to immigration, but in advising the Government about finance, in putting the Australian ' view, and in combating the "stinking fish" party's utterances against Australia. The deputy leader of the Opposition took exception to the statement of the Labour Party that, before any scheme of immigration can be adopted, a certain area of land must be made available for immigrants, and that a progressive land tax is necessary . to make land available. He told , us that if we wish to increase our population we must  develop  our primary industries, which will benefit our secondary industries. We all admit that; but it is quite apart from the statement which has been made regarding the need for unlocking our lands. The honorable member admitted that all the more easily accessible and fertile land is now locked up ; that there is not enough land available for applicants in Australia. But he says it is the business of the States to unlock it, and he complains that many troubles come upon us because we exceed our powers.

                            <para>- Of course it is. If the States throw open their lands, Federal legislation for the purpose will be unnecessary ; but those charged with bringing immigrants here must know that there is land for them to go on to. To complain that the Commonwealth Government is doing nothing, while admitting that the land is all locked up, is ridiculous. It is useless to complain of the inaction of the Commonwealth Government while the States do nothing to render immigration possible. The charge against those who are continually emphasizing the need for unlocking the lands a.s a preliminary to an immigration movement, that they are trying to prevent immigration, is absurd. What was the use of the honorable member dwelling on the march of population in other parts of the world, and the immense advantage which would accrue to Australia by having a larger population here ? Those facts are admitted ; but nothing can be done until the land is unlocked by the States, or, as the' result of a progressive land tax imposed by the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. It will be admitted that for some time we have been unable to do that, though there has been an improvement recently in this connexion. I am glad to say that in South Australia there has been a large gain of population, as the result of some good seasons and the opening up of fresh country. Undoubtedly, Australia will ultimately carry a large population, but we must remember that a great deal of the continent is arid land, which cannot be profitably occupied under present conditions. We hear honorable members saving that we should be unable to hold or defend Australia, because our population is only so many to the square mile ; hut when we talk like that, we ought to limit our remarks to that part of Australia which can be profitably occupied. There are large areas in Australia- which at present can  only  be used for grazing or breeding stock, and, indeed, there are many parts where it would be impossible to do even that. As for a progressive tax, that is a .reform 'which at present  appears  to be impossible in the States. One  difficulty  is represented- by the Legislative Councils, which - and it is of no use blinking the fact - are a complete barrier to a progressive land tax.

                            <para>- At any rate, they have the power to elect such a Parliament as I have indicated. In the States, however, the people have no such power. In South Australia, although the people might, by an overwhelming majority, be in favour of a progressive land tax, they could not have that reform because of the opposition of the Legislative Council, which represents only a fraction of the electors. We were told by the honorable member for Parramatta that the people govern the States ; but that is true only in a limited sense, so long as one House, which represents only a fraction, has as much power in the legislation as the popular House. </para>

Four States, therefore, are controlled equally as much by Legislative Councils, representing a fraction of the people, as they are' by Legislative Assemblies, representing the whole of the people. . In South Australia, for instance, the property qualification under the Constitution is high enough to give two-sevenths of the people a representation in the Legislative Council equal to that exercised by the whole people in the popular House. That 'is the reason why this land question has become a Federal matter, though I admit it would be infinitely better if the States could do the work themselves. </para>

                            <para>-I do not say anything of the kind. What I say is that the States can do nothing in the way of a progressive land tax until that reform has the support of the majority of the very small minority which governs the Legislative Councils. This has become a Federal question, not because we desire to infringe on the rights and privileges of the States, but because the Federal Parliament represents the only way out to the people, who are, all round, urging, notwithstanding some States politicians to the contrary, that the Commonwealth should have more and more power. Personally, I feel quite certain that, so far from being limited, the powers of the Federal Parliament will be extended in the future. When a progressive land tax is proposed as essential to a scheme of immigration, we are usually met by the stock argument that such a tax means confiscation. But the compulsory purchase suggested as the alternative is, I contend, equally confiscation- if one is confiscation, so is the other. It has been suggested by, amongst others, I believe, the leader of the Opposition, that the States Governments should undertake a large system of compulsory purchase-; but, if the States Governments were to go into the land market at the present time, when there are more applicants than there is land to supply, the very fact would give rise to fictitious values, the advantage of which ought by no means to go to the present holders. Of course, the producing value of the land would not be altered', but the purchasing value would be so increased if the Government entered upon any large re-purchasing system that the community generally would have what really belonged to them confiscated. Whichever system we may adopt, we cannot avoid either sacrificing the few in the interests of the many, or sacrificing the many in the interests of the few. Personally I do not agree that the term " confiscation " is the correct one to employ in this connexion, but I hold that so far as confiscation does take place, it cuts both ways. If the Government were to enter upon a large re-purchase scheme with a view to securing land upon which immigrants might settle, the effect of their action would be to enormously inflate land values. </para>

                            <para>-I think that the honorable member's statement is altogether a too narrow one. The real value of land is its productive value, which is quite another matter from the value which one may be able to get out of it. Whilst the lands of Australia are locked up, and whilst the States which control them refuse to unlock them, it is idle for honorable members to urge - as did the  deputy  leader of the Opposition - that the Government ought to go in for a large scheme of immigration. So far as the Labour Party are concerned, we believe in immigration, but we do not believe in an immigration scheme which will simply result in the overcrowding of the cities, and in men competing against each other for the small amount of employment that is at present offering. Unless we can enlarge the opportunities for employment in our primary industries, it is idle for us to bring more men hereto compete for the work that is available. Until we can extend our primary industries, and thus develop our secondary industries, it is useless to talk about immigration. Consequently, the position that we have taken up is a logical one. We hold that it is essential that the unlocking of the lands of Australia should accompany any system of immigration. The  deputy  leader of the Opposition stated to-day that only 10 per cent. of the immigrants to Canada settled upon the land, and that, therefore, we did not need to provide land for every immigrant introduced. That statement is perfectly true. But in </para>

                        <para>.- I admire the attitude taken up by the Government upon this matter, and I was rather surprised at the criticism of the  deputy  leader of the Opposition this afternoon. I think that it is our duty to assist the Government - by making suggestions,' for example, some of which may prove of value - to frame a successful scheme for attracting immigrants to this country. We have plenty of land available, but we lack" a proper system of settling immigrants upon it. I am advised that only 5 per cent. of the Crown lands of Queensland have been alienated. Therefore, there is still 95 per cent. of those lands available for settlement. Of my own knowledge I know that on the Darling and Murrumbidgee Rivers, if money were expended in irrigation, a large population could be established upon small areas on which they could grow lucerne and other stock fodders. We also know that if a private individual desires to let land he first of all improves it by the erection of a homestead. Should the Commonwealth assume control of the Northern Territory, my own view is that each block should be properly marked out and houses erected upon a certain number of them, so that the moment an immigrant arrived there he would have a roof over his head. </para>

                            <para>- I may tell the honorable member that when the early immigrants arrived in Victoria we had an Immigrants' Home established for their accommodation. The same provision is made in Canada. At Winnipeg 1,000 immigrants are accommodated in the Home which has been established there. Because there has been one failure in Victoria that does not show that the policy involved is a bad one. As illustrating my contention, I might point to the fact that the Tourists' Bureau in New </para>

                    <para class="block">South Wales is one of the best managed institutions that I have seen in any country. Any person who has visited it in search of information concerning the favorite resorts of that State will freely acknowledge this. If our Labour Bureau in Victoria were only conducted upon similar lines I do not think that we should hear any complaints to the effect that twenty-seven men had been unable to obtain employment. But I look to an immigration scheme chiefly from the stand-point of our defence. Population means safety. Is there any danger, for example, of a foreign nation seizing the United States? Yet 100 years ago those States probably did not possess a greater population than we have to-day. It is all nonsense to argue that there is no room for immigrants in Australia. We all know that every person settled upon the land must employ labour. We must also recognise that in every country there is a percentage of unemployed. If there were only two men in Australia, the probability is that one of them would be occasionally unemployed. I suggest that the States and Commonwealth in times of prosperity, when there is an overflowing Treasury, might set apart a certain portion of the surplus revenue to meet bad seasons, when there would be a considerable number- of unemployed. At such times national works which have been carefully prepared beforehand - such as big irrigation works and the construction of railways - might be proceeded with. If, for instance, we are going to build what is called the " desert " railway, its construction might be undertaken in times of depression. </para>

                            <para>- A big irrigation scheme would pay for itself. I think it was the deputy leader of the Opposition who stated that 11,000,000 acres of arid country in the United States were now being irrigated. We have in Australia at times a magnificent rainfall. I have seen the Murrumbidgee overflow its banks for 7 miles in one night. If at such times the surplus water were conserved, I venture to say that the area which could be irrigated would provide employment for a very large number of persons. </para>

                            <para>- That is all right. But some honorable members have urged that  there is no land upon which we can settle immigrants upon their arrival here. I wish to point out that there are 6,000,000 acres available in Victoria, in addition to large areas in New South Wales and Queensland. There is plenty of room for the people to settle on the lands of Australia if they are only worked on a proper system.

                            <para>- Quite so; but we expect from a Government, not advertisements, but a policy. I understood the  deputy  leader of the Opposition to criticise the Government for having placed on the .Estimates a large sum - a sum which they themselves say cannot possibly be expended during the financial year - in order to make it appear to the world that they are doing their utmost to encourage immigration. My attitude towards the Government in this matter is one of congratulation. I congratulate them upon the entire change of front on the part of the honorable gentleman at their head. One cannot help recalling those national scandals which have so seriously affected the reputation of Australia - scandals popularly known as "the six hatters," "the six potters," and " the groom, the housemaid, and the tourist." We cannot forget that Australia has been made the laughing-stock of the civilized world by some of the absurd legislation passed by. this Parliament during the last seven years. One has only to refer to a Communication lately received by the Government from the Agent-General of New South Wales in order to show that the incidents which I have mentioned have done more injury to Australia than, anything else that has occurred in its history. </para>

The feeling of the Opposition in this matter is correctly represented by the scriptural' line that there is joy in " heaven over one sinner that repenteth. Nothing could be more refreshing than this admission on the part of the Prime Minister that all our legislation which has had the effect of preventing honest, able, healthy men from coming to Australia has been wrong, and that the time has come, not only for removing restrictions on immigration, but for spending thousands of pounds to restore the flow of immigration to Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Most of them came to New South Wales, and the Premier of. that State was engaged in negotiating for many months with the Prime Minister with a view to induce him to remove the restrictions against immigration. _ The present position, therefore, is one for congratulation. It "is a sort of oasis in the desert:' of "restriction to which we have been accustomed in this House. I have  watched Australian politics as keenly as do most "men, and do not hesitate to say that, not "only the legislation pf this Parliament, but the action of the Labour Party, the labour press, the labour unions, and that of the Prime Minister himself in the past, have combined to so seriously stop the flow of immigration to Australia. If it were necessary to produce evidence as to the cause of this stoppage, I could refer honorable members to a very important document which appears amongst our Parliamentary Papers for  1905.  I refer to a memorandum bv the Agents-General on the question of immigration. What I or any other honorable member of the Opposition might say in this regard would be open to the suspicion of being coloured by party feeling. If we were to attribute the dearth of immigration to the legislation of this Parliament, such criticism would be characterized as that of thoroughly partial critics. The Agents-General, however, are in a" totally different position. They are outside our political life; their tendency is to be loyal to the constituted authorities, and to make as light as possible of anything that is considered inimical to the interests of Australia. This memorandum, which is dated November,  1905,  contains certain passages, which I think the public of Australia ought to have put before them, if they have not yet been published in the newspapers. Writing in regard to the causes that have operated to prevent immigration, the Agents-General say - </para>

                        <para>To these must be added the Immigration Restriction Act, especially the language test and contract provisions. As pointed out by us in our report upon " Advertising . the Resources and Development of the Commonwealth," the language test and contract provisions of the Act referred to have proved veritable stumbling  blocks  to us in our work, and have had a most prejudicial influence on the public opinion of every part of this Kingdom. Lest we should be misunderstood, we would like to emphasize the fact that we are strongly in sympathy with the desire of our fellow Australians to preserve Australia' for the white races, and to maintain a high standard of living and of wages; but we should be. very blind indeed -if we were not aware that, of the many causes that have tended to prejudice Australia in the estimation of the public, none has had an influence so widespread and striking as' the cases" which have arisen under the contract provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act. It is true that persons who have ill-will towards Australia have grossly exaggerated the cases to which we refer, but, however arising, the fact that these cases have happened has led the press and business, men to a close examination of the Act, and to the discovery of the sweeping range of the language test, and of the severe nature of the penalties imposed. The press of this country has not been slow to point out that if a mechanic or an agricultural labourer goes to Australia under contract to perform manual labour, he becomes liable to six months' imprisonment ; and that the wording of the contract clause has a tendency so wide as to appear even to include domestic servants of all kinds. We have endeavoured to defend the position of the Commonwealth, on the grounds that the provisions objected to are for emergent use, and that common-sense is the prevailing characteristic of the Australian people ; but our explanations pass unheeded amidst the recurrent clamour which arises whenever the six hatters are mentioned. Nor have we found that it assists matters overmuch to refer to the legislation of other countries. The section of the Act itself is taken as typical of the real attitude of Australia towards the question of immigration. The title and  wording  of the Act, and the reports of the cases that have occurred, exaggerated as they have been by repetition, are deeply impressed upon the minds of the great bulk of the people. Even the more thoughtful elements of the community, who are aware of the genesis of the language test, and accept it as a more or less illogical compromise, made at the instance of the Imperial Government, strongly resent the contract provisions. They cannot understand why_ 4,000,000 of British  people,  living 13,000 miles away from the Motherland, and admittedly suffering from lack of population, should exclude the occasional British artisan or labourer, against whom the section is aimed. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is much more of the same kind, showing that an impartial writer - obviously, by his language, anxious to vindicate the right of Australia to pass this legislation - has yet to admit, and to inform the authorities here, that these very cases have created a prejudice and a misconception with regard to Australia that has caused the flow of immigration to practically stop. The Government cannot say that they were not warned of the probable effects of the legislation in question. A number of honorable members of the Opposition, including myself, over and over again pointed out at the time that we were passing legislation which would lead to the sort of scandal that actually did arise under it. That six honest, reputable, competent workers in the hat trade should have been kept standing on the door step of this country waiting to be admitted - no matter how much the facts may have been exaggerated - must have come as a shock and a surprise to every civilized community. That incident was followed by the case of - six equally reputable and equally competent potters, who had been specially chosen in England for '"their skill, and brought to this country to further one of our own- industries. Then we have the extraordinary cases of the groom who came here to manage the horses of the present Agent-General of Queensland, and of the maid who accompanied that gentleman's wife. Following' them was the case of the tourist, a man of means, in business in England, who was arrested in Tasmania, and, with his daughter, detained until ' papers could be obtained .to show that, although a white man and a Britisher, he was entitled to travel in the Commonwealth. Exaggerated statements may have been made regarding these cases, but there was no denying the underlying facts, and their publication made us the laughing-stock of Europe and America. It is not surprising that, as the Agents-General say, our legislation and its consequences have had the effect of frightening people from coming here. One of the most notorious instances in which immigration has been blocked occurred in connexion with the proposal of General Booth to send out 5,000 families. Many persons may take exception to General Booth's methods; but he is a man whose word is to be relied upon, and, knowing the exception taken by the working classes, of Australia to the importation of workmen likely to unfairly compete against them, he gave the assurance that those whom he sent out would be approved by the authorities here. He proposed to send out, not at our expense, but at the expense of the Salvation Army, with money provided by the English people, 20,000 eligible and desirable immigrants - allowing four to a family. They may not have been desirable from the labour stand-point ; but those who recognise Australia's need for population were anxious that they should come. The labour newspapers, from Western Australia to Queensland, condemned the proposal as inimical to the interests of the Commonwealth, complaining, first, that those to be sent out would be paupers, and, next, that if they came out supplied with money to buy farms, they would be capitalists. The honorable member for South Sydney, who was then leader of the Labour Party, also spoke of them as belonging possibly to an undesirable class,, and every discouragement was shown to the scheme. The honorable member for Angas has quoted correspondence on the subject of immigration between the Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales. I remember being astonished at the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister in regard to the proposals of the Premier of New South Wales. The latter pointed' but that it was absurd to suppose that persons could be induced to come out to take up certain blocks of land before they had studied the conditions of the country. He stated, moreover, that his Government were willing to bring out from 250 to 500 agricultural labourers, if the Prime Minister would allow them to enter the Commonwealth; but the latter would not promise to do so until he had seen the formal- contracts.  His  attitude showed the difference between the theorist and the practical man. Had he had sufficient experience of business life, he would have known it to be impossible to produce contracts showing in every case the wages to be paid. The attempt was for the time abandoned, although the New South Wales Government have since brought to Australia a large number of suitable settlers. </para>

                            <para>- As I read the Act, the honorable gentleman could have waived it or otherwise granted permission, and should have done so, if he was desirous of encouraging immigration. According to the Agents- General, our legislation has scared the working classes of Great Britain, and even if the statements which have been published were absolutely false, it would take a long time to dispel the bad impression Created. No one who has observed what has been going on both inside and outside Australia can be surprised at the cessation of immigration. The honorable member for Boothby referred to the history of America. We all know that when the American States fede rated, their population was only a little larger than ours prior to Federation. They opened their arms, and invited the whole world to come in, irrespective of colour, creed, or nationality., and the result is a magnificent amalgam. </para>

                            <para>-I certainly believe in her immigration policy, which, sooner or later, must be followed in other parts of the world. I do not, of course, include the policy of deliberately bringing the negroes into the country ; I speak of the generous policy towards the races of Europe, which has given the United States a population of  86,000,000,  and a body of commerce which is one of the finest in the world. To improve the state of things here, we must first remove the bad impressions as recorded by the Agents- General. But what is proposed to that end ? Is it suggested that the contract test shall be removed? </para>

                            <para>- If in that respect, the sooner it is made known to the world that there is nothing to prevent Europeans from coming here, the better. The Government tell the people of Great Britain that they are convinced of the errors of their ways, and have removed all barriers to immigration. The honorable member for Parramatta suggests that Ministers are not sincere; but I am willing to believe that they are. I think that many honorable members, including some members of the Labour Tarty, are impressed with the need for a change of policy in this respect. It will lake many years to remove existing impressions abroad regarding Australia, but it can be done in time. The Labour Party asserts that immigrants should not be invited until we have land to put them on, and the honorable member for Balaclava went further, and said that not only should each immigrant have land provided for him, but, in addition, a cottage to live in. I add : Why not furnish the cottage, and stock it with groceries? It is obvious that the question will arise in the minds of democrats, why people from England should have a bit of land and a cottage provided for them, while those already here have to go without. It will be seen at once that the proposal is absolutely impracticable. It is absurd also to expect that every man who comes here will come as a ready-made farmer, prepared at once to go on the land provided. Every sensible man, who immigrates to a great continent like this, has first to look round in order to determine which State, under his personal conditions, is the most suitable. Then he will make observations in the particular State, and determine the district that is most suitable for his purpose, having ascertained by experience what is the value of the labour, his proximity to town, the quality of the land, and the terms on which he can obtain it and the probable market for his products. There is no better way of gaining this knowledge than by, in the first place, engaging as an agricultural labourer, in which capacity he can feel his way and accumulate a little money, while learning something of the country and its conditions. </para>

The honorable member had not that knowledge when he arrived in Australia, but had to gain it before making up his mind where to settle. I do not know how Tong it took the honorable member to make up his mind, but he has a very quick intellect, and probably intuition helped him. I think the honorable member will admit that, as regards the average man, it is absurd to expect him to say at once, " I shall take up that bit of land." </para>

                            <para>- I am delighted to hear such generous sentiments from the honorable member. It is idle to say that we should not bring people here until there are land and houses provided for them. We know that the farmers in every part of Australia are in want of labour, and we shall be doing a good work if we can induce a large body of useful men to come here, and, undertaking this work, enter not hurriedly and hastily, but with thought and caution upon occupation of land on their own account. It is clearly not indispensable that land should be ready for their occupation ; but there ought to be farmers ready  and willing to hire immigrants. The acting leader of the Opposition was perfectly logical and reasonable in asking the Government to state their policy, not with the intention of binding them down to the letter of their announcement, but merely to give some idea of the way in which it is proposed to spend this ,£20,000. Is it proposed to pay some shipping company ^10 a head for indiscriminately bringing people to Australia, or are we to enter into a policy of inducing the States to place land at their disposal ? I have already expressed, the opinion that land prepared for settlement by immigrants is not a <inline font-style="italic">sine qua non.</inline> There is nobody better qualified to ascertain where good land can be found than the man who comes out here with a view of settling; and, therefore, we should be very unwise in the restricting of immigrants to men with capital. We have only to look at the files of the Labour newspapers to see that in many cases men who have money are characterised as robbers, but that, i know, is the view of only a very extreme section of the Labour Party, and one that is not shared by many members of the party in this House. At the same time, the Labour Party should be the last in the world to take exception to a man on the ground that he has no capital. If a man has a sound body and mind, and an honest reputation, we 'should, welcome him here as one likely to become a useful citizen. If it were not for the Opposition support, I am afraid that the Government would have a fair chance of having this vote defeated. If we may judge from the opinions expressed by the Labour Party, they are against the expenditure of such a large sum on the object in view, whereas the Opposition thoroughly approve of the policy of the Government, in taking some steps to assisting immigration. I should not have supported assisted immigration, had it not been that by our legislation in the past- much has been done to discourage it. Had we originally left the doors of Australia open, I should have been content to allow the people to come here who desired to do so. But, according to the Agents -General, our legislation has had the effect of scattering broadcast the idea that it is dangerous for a workman to come to Australia ; and, that being so, we can do no less than spend money.. in  correcting the error. How that error is to be corrected is a matter of administration. I congratulate the Government on the view they take of the situation, and I shall stand by them in any honest attempt to increase the population of Australia by inducing British citizen's to come out on a liberal and rational basis. </para>

                        <para>. - It always affords me a great deal of delight to listen to the honorable member for Parkes, because, whether the subject be science, literature, or the arts, there is no question that he exalts it. But, as to the accuracy of his statements with regard to the Labour Party, they require deep and spiritual investigation. The fact of the matter is that the honorable member seems to be quite happy until he bumps up against the Labour Party. Whether that be due to the fact that the Labour Party has a tendency to wake him up from the lethargy that overtakes most people I do not know ; but there is certainly some cause for the effect I have indicated. But, while the honorable member believes in the rule of gold, he ought to know that the Labour Party believes in the golden rule. The honorable member had a great deal to say about General Booth and his emigration scheme. I regret that I did not know this subject was to be touched upon, or I should have brought here some documents which I received from America, and which show that hundreds of General Booth's emigrants are on the verge of starvation in Canada. </para>

                            <para>- That may be, but I have copies of affidavits from Montreal, Toronto, and Winnipeg, which it would be hard to refute. I have been watching General Booth and his schemes for some time past; and, as I say, I have ample proof that there are hundreds, if not thousands of people, whom he sent to Canada now absolutely starving or sweating in the snow. There are two kinds of perspiration, one of which is caused by fear, and that in Canada is called the " snow sweat." I am glad if the Labour Party did anything to prevent 'General Booth sending immigrants to Australia. The honorable member for Parkes told us that a great sensation had been caused in England by. the exclusion of the six hatters. </para>

                            <para>- Surely the honorable member for Parkes is aware that John Bull is a man who confines his attentions strictly to business. If an attempt is made in England to float a loan or dispose of a property, no inquiries are made about any agitation that may have beer* going on in Australia; all that is asked is, " What is there in it, and. what do I get out of it ? " The honorable member suggested that it would be well if the Prime Minister had a talk with some practical business men, thus indicating that, in his opinion, the Prime Minister is merely theoretical. The honorable member himself appears to be the more theoretical, seeing that he is of opinion that the people of England1 were agitated and frightened by the action taken in regard to the six hatters. </para>

                            <para>- No, but I think they are impracticable - that they have got the " scares." I hope the day will never come when the intellect and thinking power of Australia' shall be manacled by foreign menials of Mammon. The honorable member for Parkes missed the real point of this question when he spoke of the public feeling in England against Australia. The truth is that the people of Great Britain have a " down " upon Australia, not because of anything that the Labour Party has. done, but because some of the greatest names in Australian history have been placed at the heads of prospectuses, and, as a result, widows and orphans have been induced to withdraw their money from British Consols, and to invest it in Australian securities in connexion with which they have been plundered. Instead of sending these great financiers to gaol, we send them to Government House in motor cars. That is why the British people have lost confidence in us. Within the past day or two, New South Wales has floated a loan which has not been underwritten. It has been guaranteed by the underwriters, but it has not been underwritten by the public. Of course, New South Wales had to pay a brokerage fee to obtain that guarantee. If the States will not co-operate with the Commonwealth upon the question of immigration, it is' ridiculous to talk about bringing out to our shores hundreds of immigrants who will only give the country a bad name, when they are starving in our towns, just as some immigrants are doing in America. I scarcely receive an American newspaper in which I do not read that hundreds of starving men are constantly waiting upon the mayors of towns and declaring that they have been attracted to the country by means of false representations. Of course, the introduction of a larger population would be a good thing for the landlords, because it would enable them to raise their rents. The fact is patent to all, that men and women must be housed somewhere, and if there are a thousand persons waiting to occupy one house, its rental value must be increased, and if fifty men are after one  job wages must fall. I do not believe in introducing immigrants . to Australia to allow them to go hungry. I would suggest to the Prime Minister that, after the High Commissioner has been appointed, and a great Commonwealth office has been established in London, in a building, the rental from which will pay the interest upon its capital value, he should seek to amend the Constitution by securing to the Commonwealth power to go upon the money market, if necessary, and to raise loans at a cheap rate of interest, purchase immense areas of land and settle people on them. It seems to me that the States are governed by a bureaucracy. They have adopted antiquated methods, and before any improvement can be effected, we shall require to kill off a lot of the men who have for years been at the head of affairs. In my opinion, we should appoint as a High Commissioner, not a fossil, but a wide-awake Australian who should be compelled to return to the Commonwealth every three years, so that he may drink from the fountain of Australian enthusiasm. I would also suggest the imposition of a heavy absentee tax. </para>

                        <para>.- Reverting to the question of the proposed vote for the repatriation of kanakas, I think that the Prime Minister would do well to favour the Committee with a full and clear statement of the position. At the present moment, it is very much involved. I certainly understood the Prime Minister to say this afternoon that no money had been paid by Queensland at all. </para>

                            <para>- I am referring to a question which I put to the Prime Minister earlier in the afternoon. In the light of the figures which the honorable gentleman has been good enough to show me, it would seem that there is no necessity to vote the £6,500 set down upon these Estimates at all. I do not recollect the exact cost per head which the shipping companies charged for conveying kanakas from Queensland ports to their own islands. But I remember the Prime Minister saying that it would be very little more than £5 per head, and I believe that it was about £5 10s. per head. If that be so, the only cost which the Commonwealth has had to incur is the extra 10s. per head, and the cost of maintaining these Pacific islanders during their detention awaiting deportation. But from the figures which the Prime Minister has been good enough to show me,  1  gather that up to the end of June last the Government had paid £2,165 for passages alone. That is the amount which has been paid for the deportation of 3,202 of these islanders. I utterly fail to see why £2,165 should have to be expended by the Commonwealth in addition to the amount which the Queensland Government provided. Altogether the cost incurred by the Commonwealth in connexion with the repatriation of kanakas has been more than £6,000, the coastal fares and the maintenance of the islanders, up to 30th June last, amounting to nearly £4,000. ' The figures which I have seen must suggest a doubt as to whether it is necessary to vote this additional sum of money. Up to the 1st February last, 4,187 kanakas had been deported, but included in this number were  300 odd who were sent to Fiji, and for whose passages the Commonwealth paid nothing. It is impossible to reconcile the figures as they stand. </para>

                        <para>. - Immigration is a very important subject. We all regret the sparseness of the population of Australia, and every one, I think, would like it to rapidly increase. We are not without blame for the present state of affairs, inasmuch as in our efforts to restrict the introduction of objectionable persons into Australia, we have passed a law which is rightly regarded as having operated adversely to the immigration of persons whom we desire should come to Australia. In the first place, the title to the Act - a title which we inherited from the legislation of the States - is a bad one. The words " Immigration Restriction Act " seem to suggest that we have in Australia too many people, and are desirous of restricting immigration. It is perhaps somewhat late in the day to suggest that the title should be altered, but if the Prime Minister has occasion to deal with the question again I hope that he will consider the desirableness of amending it. We should give our legislation a title that will clearly indicate that our desire is not to restrict immigration generally, but merely to prevent the admission of undesirable persons. The amendment of the principal Act, passed some time ago, was a great improvement, but did not go far enough. Under the original Act even an immigrant .from the United Kingdom could not be brought into Australia unless inquiries disclosed that he was not being introduced to compete with people already here who were willing and competent to undertake the work that he was to do. That provision was repealed by the amending Bill, but we allowed to remain in operation the section which declares that contracts entered into in the Mother Country must be approved bv the.' Minister of External Affairs before persons engaged under them shall be allowed to enter Australia. That is a wholly unnecessary and mischievous provision. So long as a person, anxious to enter Australia does not. come within the provisions of the Act relating "to undesirable "immigrants there should be no objection to his admission. The object of the section in question was really to prevent persons engaged in other parts of the world from being deceived and being induced to enter into contracts to work here for less than the ruling rates of wages. Our desire in that respect could be achieved by other means. We might provide that an agreement by which a person beyond the Commonwealth contracted to work in Australia under conditions that were not in accord with those operating here should not be binding on the person engaged, and in that case could be cancelled by a magistrate. We are agreed that there must be some restriction . on the introduction of persons designed to take the place of men on strike, but the provision that a contract must be approved by the Minister of External Affairs is unnecessary, and, as I have said, mischievous when it does not relate to the admission of a person in connexion with an industrial dispute. A man should be able to renounce a contract, with the approval of a magistrate, entered into abroad if on arriving here he found that the conditions were unfair. I hope that such an amendment of the law will engage the attention of the Government. I have spoken to many men, including members of the Labour Party, and have heard no one say that it would be undesirable to repeal the. provision in the Act that the Minister of External Affairs shall approve of a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> contract with a desirable immigrant before such desirable immigrant can enter Australia. We have heard during, this debate a good, deal regarding what the Commonwealth' should do to encourage immigration. It has been said that the Commonwealth has not yet done anything, and that we should lose no time in establishing in London a central office to advertise Australia. I could readily understand efforts being made abroad to advertise Australia with the object of encouraging immigration if we had plenty of work available for immigrants when they came here, or could settle them on the land. But I fail to recognise the utility of spending money on advertisements designed to attract people without any means except perhaps farm labourers to Australia, if we cannot provide them with either work or land upon their arrival. We could, of course, endeavour to induce people with some means to come to Australia to enter upon the occupation  of the land, but </para>

                    <para class="block">I am one of those who think that the provision in the Constitution giving the Commonwealth co-ordinate power with .the States to legislate in respect to immigration and emigration, was not intended to empower the Commonwealth Parliament to have anything to do with the occupation and settlement of the lands of Australia.  I  believe that the occupation and development of our land is a work that has been reserved under the Constitution to the States, and we must remember that the States are alive to the importance of securing increased population, and are doing all they can in that direction. The States Parliaments are as anxious and active in this matter as we are.  I  cannot find in the Constitution any provision, nor did  I  hear it mentioned at the Conventions, that it was intended that the Commonwealth should have power to invade State avenues in respect of the occupation and development of the lands. Our 00-ordinate power in this respect was designed to enable the Commonwealth to regulate the influx and egress of population, and to take steps to induce persons to come to Australia - to even pay their passages, and to bring them here ; but, having brought them to Australia, the Commonwealth Parliament has no power, in my opinion, to acquire land with a view of settling such immigrants upon it. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the Commonwealth is empowered to purchase land with a view of settling people upon it. Such an idea was foreign to the minds of those who accepted the Constitution. That being so, I fail to see how the Commonwealth would be justified in bringing large numbers of people here, to dump them down at our different ports, and to leave them there to fare as test they can. It ought always to be the desire of the Commonwealth Government to carry out a policy of immigration in cooperation with the States. The Commonwealth Government has gone so far as to undertake to select immigrants, giving the States every opportunity to share in the selection, and to bring them here, free of any expense to the States, if the latter will take charge of them upon their arrival at the principal ports, and either find them employment or settle them upon the land. I should be sorry to see the Commonwealth embark upon the work of bringing thousands of immigrants to Australia and leaving them immediately on their arrival to shift for themselves. It would be not only unjustifiable, but almost cruel to treat in that way people without means. No doubt some would find employment. Stalwart young men, like the honorable member for Maranoa, would be able to look for work, and no doubt would find it. But what would be the position of men with wives and families? They could not leave them on the beach and, shouldering their swags, seek their fortunes inland, as the honorable member for Maranoa, and many of us, when we were younger, would have been ready to do. </para>

                            <para>- There are; but does the honorable member advocate a policy under which thousands would be brought to Australia at the expense of the Commonwealth and left to look after themselves? .There is plenty of room for employment in Australia, but experience teaches me that the present number of employers is not sufficient to find work for a constant large stream of immigrants without means, who must at once have it, unless under the control and supervision of the Governments of the States. We should seek to populate Australia by a well-concerted scheme of action, carried out by the Commonwealth and the States. Efforts in that direction so far have been unsuccessful. There may have been faults on both sides. I am not going to attribute fault to any one, certainly not to my friend the Prime Minister, who has given much anxious consideration to this question. But there is no doubt that since the inception of Federation there has been a sort of armed neutrality between the Commonwealth and the States. The States have been jealous of the Commonwealth, whilst the Commonwealth has been desirous on many occasions of invading States powers. </para>

                            <para>- We must remedy this state of affairs. The cause of the trouble is not far to seek. Most of us came here from the Legislatures of the States. To use an expression which honorable members will readily understand, we were "roads and bridges men." We had been accustomed to interest ourselves in the1 construction of roads, bridges, railways, harbor works, water conservation works, &amp;c, with a view of opening up tha country and extending settlement. Our attention was devoted almost wholly to such matters, and to certain social legislation, which I need not mention at this stage. But when we came here we found that practically everything that had engaged our attention as members of the States Parliaments had passed from our control, and that with the exception of the Post and Telegraph Department, the Defence Department, and the Department of Trade and Customs, we had nothing left to us. That is why the Post and Telegraph Department to-day receives so much attention. It is practically the only Department in which honorable members can interest themselves as they used to do as members of States Legislatures. We have been accustomed to the exercise of fuller powers, and find it difficult to realize our present limitations. </para>

                        <para>.- Before the Prime. Minister addresses the Committee, I wish to supplement the few remarks' on this subject I made the other night. I should be sorry to think the Commonwealth Parliament powerless in regard to immigration without the co-operation of the States. It is not my part to frame a policy, but every honorable member should contribute what ideas he may have on the subject under discussion. The opinion that we can do nothing without State cooperation is based upon the belief that we should invite here only persons who will be able to, at once, take possession of land. That, to my mind, is a wrong belief. What proportion of the thousands who, since the commencement of our history, have voluntarily left the centres of civilization in the Old World to come to Australia did so in the hope of at once becoming possessors of land? An extremely small one. I agree with the right honorable member for Swan that we should endeavour to obtain the cordial co-operation of the States. But should we not also, as the Dominion of Canada has done, endeavour to make it easier for persons who have no immediate hope of obtaining land, but who may, nevertheless, be useful citizens, to come here ? If we had in London a High' Commissioner his officers would be able to test the character, health, and general qualities of persons wishing to emigrate, and to say to them, " Having satisfied us that you have the energy, will, and physical and mental abilities necessary to make VOL useful citizens, whether you can or can not immediately take possession of land, we are ready to pay part of the cost of sending you out " ? We can do much in that direction without the co-operation of the States. I do not suggest that persons should be dumped here; but we do not want immigrants who will need taking in hand and nursing. </para>

                            <para>- The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has done a great deal. But because our circumstances are different, we are not therefore powerless, and I put forward this skeleton idea for the consideration of the Prime Minister. Much can be done without the co-operation of the States, because I am" sure that Parliament will vote a far larger sum than is asked for to make our resources known to the people of the older countries of the world, and to assist desirable immigrants who wish to make this country their future home, by defraying part of the expenses of the long and costly voyage. I read in the press to-day comments about going back to a- system of assisted immigration, Australia has, in the past, derived enormous benefits from that system, notwithstanding occasional abuses. </para>

                            <para>- That is the best kind of invitation that can be extended to intending immigrants. But what we have to do is to direct the stream of immigration towards Australia, and the mere issuing of newspaper advertisements and pamphlets, telling of the resources of the country, is not sufficient. We should be prepared to tell suitable emigrants, " If you are willing to rely on your own resources, and to make your own way, we will pay a considerable part of the cost of the voyage which you at present are incapable of paying yourselves." There is no want of definiteness in my suggestion. The question is, shall we, ' or shall we not, adopt that simple means of encouraging immigration independently of State co-operation? </para>

                            <para>- It should be understood that those who come out assisted by the Commonwealth, are willing to do as settlers in other countries have done, and as our own early immigrants did. We should not invite them here to be nursed, or to be put on farms. What we wish to do is to draw Australia 10,000 or 15,000 miles nearer to the Old Country, so far as suitable persons, desirous of emigrating, but not possessing the means to pay for the long voyage to this country, are concerned. I should not have spoken, had I not desired it to be understood that, in mv opinion, it would be an .abdication of one of the most important of our functions if we were to confess ourselves helpless to move in this matter without the aid of the States. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Flinders has undoubtedly made his intention very clear.  His  purpose, as well as his language, is explicit. He palpably intends to introduce, if he can, a horde of penniless workers into this country, and he would do this, despite the fact that there is' a large contingent of unemployed people in every State in the Union. I distinguish between unemployed and unemployable. We know there is a large number of unemployable in every State, but there is also a considerable body of men who are desirous and capable of honest labour, yet who are unable to find it. I should like to know how the honorable member would view a proposal to bring out here a contingent of lawyers to compete with him in his occupation. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member might welcome them, now that he has got to the 'top of the tree in his profession; but would he welcome eminent meru, of the English Bar if he were a junior starting the battle of life afresh? And yet that is the position in which he would place a great many of the workers in Australia. What the honorable member desires is to bring out additional competitors - men who would have absolutely nothing when they arrived, and who would -foe compelled, by sheer necessity, to accept the first offer. That is not a proposal which the Government should consider for one moment. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite satisfied with Australia, if the honorable member is not. But I am not entering into a dialogue with him. At present I am dealing wilh the serious argument of the honorable member for Flinders. The right honorable member for Swan has, I think, put the matter very fairly. It is very proper to encourage the immigration of people who have a little capital, and are able to take up land; but it would be very unwise to bring men here to compete with  those who already find the battle of life sufficiently keen in city industries. As the Government will probably find out, the class of men able to make a success of bush life are getting very scarce in the United Kingdom, as well as in America and Canada. I suggest, however, that the Government are more likely to get men . of that desirable class from the two latter countries, than from anywhere in the old world- There can be found men with some experience of new countries, and, considering the greater attraction which Australia presents, we should have a chance of  securing in those directions, a considerable number of excellent colonists. But the tendency everywhere is for people to congregate in the towns. A great deal is often made of the fact as it affects Australia, but the same tendency can be observed in England, and other countries. Farmers' sons do not take to their fathers' business, but prefer to find employment in the towns as policemen, tram conductors, clerks, and so forth. Twenty-five years ago, when I was in the old country, that tendency was operative, and I suppose it has been accentuated since. </para>

                            <para>- I am very glad the honorable member has made that interjection, because it enables me to say that, in my opinion, a land tax would, in this country at any rale, have the contrary effect of inducing people to go upon the land. The great trouble in  Australia  is that settlers have to go so far back, and a land tax which had the effect of. bursting up the big estates in the coastal areas, where there is a good climate and a reliable rainfall, would result in the closer settlement of prosperous inhabitant, while as time went on the population would radiate to the remote localities. We must recognise that life in the Australian bush is not too attractive; and side by side with any reasonable effort to promote immigration, something should be done to remedy that state of affairs. A few years ago I suggested, as an ideal to which our administrators should  work,  that every settler's house in Australia ought to be connected with the telephone service ; and I am sure ' that some outlay in this direction would be much more remunerative in the long run than the expenditure of the  ,£120,000  a year, which is wasted on an ocean mail service. It is the isolation of the bush that makes it difficult for the people to be contented there ; and the suggestion I have made,  if  carried out, would, so to speak, annihilate distance, and bring the people there into closer contact with one another. There can be no doubt that the usefulness and convenience of a service of this sort is immeasurable. I should not have risen but for the remarks of the honorable member for Flinders ; and I merely wish to enter my protest against the suggestion he makes that people should be dumped down here at the ports in order to enter into competition with the workers already here. As I said before, I think the right honorable member for Swan has put the matter very fairly. I should not be particular whether immigrants were British, German, Italian, or from any other European country, so long as they were prepared to go on the  land, and presented material of which good colonists could be made. But we do not desire immigrants whose natural habitat is the city and the town. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. Every fresh competitor would undoubtedly present an encouragement and temptation to employers to indulge in sweating. I trust the Government will proceed with a spirited immigration policy on sound lines, of which the country can approve, because, undoubtedly, more population is necessary in order that the country may be adequately defended. </para>

                            <para>- That does not accord with statements made at the time. At any rate, those Premiers' Conferences have not treated the Federal Government with courtesy. I remember how, at one of the Conferences, the Premiers actually deliberated for some time whether they should admit the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to their presence. I regret that I have not my marked copies of the reports of those Conferences, so that I might read the passages to honorable members; however, I shall take a future opportunity of doing so; in order to show the studied insolence of those Jacks-in-office to Ministers of the national Parliament. I do not think that the right honorable member for Swan should airily dismiss this matter. He ought to uphold the dignity of the national Parliament and its Ministers. </para>

                            <para>- That is what I want to know. When the  Tight  honorable member for Swan enlarges upon our offences against the States, he ought to keep alongside him a little catalogue of the offences by the States against the Commonwealth. When the future historian comes to sum up the position, I think he will say that the Prime Minister must have been a remarkably amiable man to have quietly submitted to all the studied affronts by the States Premiers. He will also recognise that the honorable gentleman was doing his best to reduce the friction that is inevitable in the early stages of the Federation. At the same time, I am inclined to think that he has gone too far in attempting to placate the States' Premiers. I would ask any self-respecting man to read the correspondence which has taken place in connexion with the selection of the Federal Capital, and to say whether he would submit to be bullied and reviled as the Prime Minister has been. I would not have touched upon this matter had it not been for the remarks of the right honorable member for Swan. Upon the next occasion that he rises to enlarge upon the sins of this Parliament he ought to recollect that there is something to be said upon the other side. </para>

                        <para>.- It was unfortunate that in the remarks which he made this afternoon the honorable member for Parkes should have relied for his data upon his memory. The passage which he quoted from the report of the Agents-General in reference to the misconception caused in England by certain provisions in our Immigration Restriction Act relates to provisions which were amended three years ago, since which period the allusions in question have become more and more rare. The words of the Act which were misconstrued have been altered to such an extent that during my recent visit to England " I do not recollect seeing a single allusion to the alleged exclusiveness of this country. Whilst he was speaking, I handed the honorable member for Parkes a copy of the Act, showing that certain sections  had  been removed, but unfortunately he did not refer to it. He was also wrong in his facts. He next mentioned the correspondence which took place between the late Premier of New South Wales and myself in regard to the introduction of certain contract labourers, but  unfortunately forgot that that correspondence closed with a letter from myself, in which I pointed out a means by which the labourers whom the New South Wales Premier desired to introduce could be brought into the Commonwealth". I believe that these labourers were subsequently introduced, though the honorable member for Parkes seemed to labour under the impression that some action upon our part had closed the door against them. In reference to a comment by the honorable member for Darwin, I may say that one of our ablest journalists,  Colonel Reay,  made it his business to visit the Tilbury Docks for the purpose of seeing a detachment of immigrants whom the Salvation Army were sending to Canada. He informed me that a better set-up and more promising class he had never seen. He moved amongst them, and ascertained that they had been well treated, that they were well-informed, that they knew the conditions which they had to face in the new country to which they were going, that they were full of hope, and that many of them had money in their possession.  His  testimony was that of a perfectly impartial pressman, who was only anxious to become acquainted with the facts, and he assured me that the selection of the immigrants had evidently been made with great judgment, and that they were leaving the Old Country under the best possible conditions. This Government never at any time discouraged any scheme of General' Booth for settling immigrants in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- In discussing the vote for advertising the resources of Australia, we must recollect that, although the encouragement of immigration is a very prominent purpose to be served in this way, yet the use of the word ina restricted sense is apt to lead to some mis.understanding. Under the circumstances of Australia in particular, and of new countries in general, a certain amount of what may be termed " advertising " is necessary, whether in connexion with immigration or not. Quite naturally, the discussion in this Chamber has turned upon the very important question of how best to attract settlers. . But it would be a mistake to overlook the fact that a good deal more than that is aimed at by this vote. For instance, the commonest complaint made on behalf of our industrial and rural investments is that they suffer owing to the </para>

                    <para class="block">Sack of knowledge of critics in the Mother Country of our climate and conditions. In the centres of financial strength and political influence we are also liable to lose for want of accurate information of our aims and opportunities. For this reason, it is necessary for us - as a mere matter of general business, and quite apart from any particular end that we may have in view - to take steps . to make ourselves and our. resources better known, especially in the Mother Country. If for no other reasons than those of private finance, action would be called for. But when we recollect the great importance of public finance - especially to Australia- and realize that some misconceptions which are current may have an injurious effect upon our credit and unduly increase our burdens as borrowers, it becomes very patent that, under any circumstances, we require to take steps to make accurate knowledge of our circumstances available. We have to protect ourselves both against the calumnies of interested parties and the mere mistakes which arise from want of information. Under- these circumstances, I venture to say that, even apart from the encouragement of immigration, a vote of this kind judiciously expended is necessary. I cordially concur in the opinion which has been expressed by several honorable members, that the appointment of a High Commissioner is - if not a condition precedent to the inauguration of any scheme of immigration - at all events one of the most powerful factors to be employed in connexion with it. But a High Commissioner - quite apart from his relation to immigration - has also a distinct value to us, because of what may be termed - without derogating from the importance of his high office - his advertising value. One of his chief duties will be to correct the misconceptions to which I have referred, and to place the country which he represents in its true position before those who criticise it either in Parliament or in the press. Whenever he so acts he is advertising the Commonwealth. Many activities .of his which might be summed  up  under the same heading remind us of the necessity for making some provision of the sort. </para>

                            <para>- It does not apply at all. I am merely pointing out an objection to this vote being regarded merely: as one to encourage immigration, because by advertising our resources it will serve a number of other purposes which are also served either by a High Commissioner or by means of other agencies that we can employ. Those who complain that we are suffering because we have no central office in London where inquiries may - be made and action may be taken, do not overlook the fact that the establishment of such an office will in itself be a valuable advertisement. When we are reckoning up its usefulness to us, we must make allowance for that aspect. In connexion with the appointment of a High Commissioner, we have to face the existing separate representation of the <inline font-style="italic">States,</inline> which, though it may not directly impair the usefulness of our official, will necessarily involve a considerable duplication of the work in London that' will be done on behalf of Australia. A great many of the duties at present cast upon the representatives of the States could, undoubtedly, be more effectively performed by a High Commissioner. </para>

                            <para>- Among the values of a High Commissioner, we must not. forget that he will be an advertisement to Australia. He will be there to correct misconceptions, and to circulate unchallengeable information, and these may be properly designated a kind of advertisement. Of course, that will be only one phase of his work, but still it will be a useful phase. It is quite certain that the present Agents-General - able' and zealous as they are - can not make anything like the impression upon behalf of Australia even .collectively that a. High Commissioner will be expected to make, if we obtain a man strong enough to fill that post. We must recollect that when we affect opinion in Great Britain, we affect the financial standing of Australia. We shall enhance it, and that in itself is a form of advertisement. We can affect our political weight in the counsels of the Empire. . In point of fact, reputation is a great asset. It is a particularly great asset to a country as remote as is Australia, and it is a particularly necessary asset to a country which has often been so unfairly abused. We cannot expect to receive that consideration in political circles, in the press, or internationally to which we are entitled, unless we are better known and understood. All efforts that enable us to achieve that end are good, because they give us a better advertisement. Portion of this vote has been expended upon hand-books which we have circulated, setting out in an abbreviated form the statistics relating to Australia as a whole. Out of it I propose to purchase a number of copies of the valuable and exhaustive work which our Statistician, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> has very nearly completed, in order that we may place in the chief libraries of the Mother Country a work of reference containing figures relating to every detail of life, production, progress, and settlement in Australia. I have dwelt upon this topic thus far, because it would be a mistake if honorable members merely looked at the proposed vote, and asked what bearing it had upon immigration. If they regarded the matter merely from that stand-point, they would misunderstand its value and its varied influences. Coming to the question of immigration which has engaged the attention of honorable  members to the exclusion of all other matters, may I point out that our investigations show that advertising takes protean shapes. In point of fact, our Canadian cousins have run the whole gamut of possible advertising. They have found it necessary again and again to alter their modes of appealing to the people in order to keep alive the interest in their great country. When we come to consider the particular methods to be employed, 1 think we shall do well to attach first of all very considerable responsibility to the High Commissioner himself, and, subject to him, to the advice of experts, as to the particular means to be adopted in order to make known in Great Britain any demand for a particular kind of labour or for persons possessing special qualifications. It is not for us to endeavour to determine too closely the course to be followed. It is not for us to say whether an appeal shall be made by means of advertisements in the newspapers, contributed articles, illustrations, the placarding of hoardings, scrolls upon buildings, bioscopes, or any of the other methods that have been submitted to our consideration. One becomes lost in an ocean of possibilities when one endeavours to determine from this distance which of these methods ought to be applied, and how and when. We must be content to give our agents on the spot general instructions and leave them a free hand. We must limit the expenditure, but empower them to employ what at the moment appears to be the best means of catching the attention of the class whom we desire to attract. </para>

                            <para>- In the first place they resorted to platform work, and the attractions of illustrated lectures having almost' died out, they resorted to practical illustrations of the many details of agriculture and cattle rearing in the Dominion. Those methods, too, have been rather exhausted. Then resort has been had to the travelling caravan, which in its turn seems to have lost its vogue. Whether or not they have reduced their efforts I do not know, but they appear to think it necessary from time to time to vary their appeals. They, have scattered throughout Great Britain a dozen offices as well as the one in London, and these keep to no single device. In connexion with this question of advertising we are face to face with the probability of unnecessary duplication if the six States, according to their impulses, are to be more or less in evidence as advertisers of the sectional attractions of their own particular portions of Australia. A noticeable feature of the confusion that exists <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the rural mind in regard to Australia is that they apply to the whole Commonwealth statements in regard to any one State. In that way they acquire mistaken views as to the nature of the choice that is open to them, when, as a matter of fact, the whole of Australia lies before them. Then there is the unnecessary expense involved, by advertising in sections, information which becomes more impressive and effective if it is advertised as a. whole. </para>

                            <para>- They have provincial representations supplementing that of the Dominion. One never sees the provincial totals so advertised as to obscure the general. The figures in regard to Canada; as a whole are invariably impressed upon the public mind, and that work is supported with details by the various provincial agents, who put themselves in communication with the people, and enlarge upon the special attractions of their own provinces. But the duplication and the competition of advertisement against advertisement does not seem to be pushed to anything approaching the extreme that is likely to occur in respect to this country. The chief advertisers of Canada are the Canadian Dominion, with its great interests in its new north-western territory, and above and beyond all, the Canadian-Pacific Railway Company and the enormous financial influence that it brings to bear. Not only steamship, but railroad agents, throughout the United Kingdom, axe kept in touch by that very great, prosperous, and enterprising company. Wherever the Canadian Government goes, the Canadian-Pacific Railway Company is beside it, and sometimes in front of it. It has great blocks of land to sell - areas which were part of the price paid for the construction of its  railway.  . </para>

                            <para>- I understand that is so- There is, therefore, in the first place, no overlapping in respect of the advertisements published on behalf of Canada. Then, again, the work of the Government is supplemented by the enormous private influence of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, the power of which is felt not  only  in the advertising world, but throughout all social and political circles. It is a most potent influence in keeping  Canada to the front in the English press without any direct expense to the ' Dominion. " We have no such organization behind us. Our task both as regards overlapping and competition, is more difficult. Although I believe that the Agents-General discourage it as much as possible, they cannot prevent' their respective agencies throughout the Mother Country, when some one appeals to them for information, from unduly exalting the prospects of their own State at the expense of a neighbouring State. </para>

                            <para>- We have just had what I think is a very admirable demonstration of State feeling in a Federal House. Such a feeling will always be, and ought always to be, subject to the qualification which the honorable member for Maranoa has mentioned, that he would glory in pointing out the advantages of his own State without detracting from those of other States. Unfortunately, this exalting of a particular State at the expense of its neighbours is done not only by word of mouth, which cannot be traced, but even by means of publications issued by some of the States in which they reflect upon their neighbours in order to boom their own part of the union. We cannot entirely get rid of overlapping, unnecessary expense, and this suicidal competition of State against State unless the task of advertising Australia as a whole in the Mother Country is placed in the hands of one authority. That authority, as 1 have more than once submitted to the Premiers, would give a guarantee of its good faith by publishing in regard to each State only those particulars officially furnished by the Government of that State, for which the State Government would accept responsibility. In no sense would it so interfere that one' State would be prejudiced to the advantage of another. Such a national work can be done only by the Commonwealth. I have ventured to impress upon the States Governments that they have nothing to lose and everything to gain by the Commonwealth undertaking this task for them. We are being criticised - and no one objects to criticism - because, we are supposed to be depriving the States of some income which they have received or which they believe they ought to receive. Here is an opportunity which we have offered and continue to offer to them of relieving themselves of certain expenditure. We offer to undertake this work on behalf of the States ; to relieve them of the expenditure which it! involves solely for their advantage', and not for the benefit of the Commonwealth as distinguished from the States. We, of course, gain by every citizen who enters Australia no matter into which State he goes. If he is a valuable asset to one State he is equally valuable to Australia as a whole. We have no need to discriminate and do not wish to do so. It may be suggested that since we control Papua and the Northern Territory may become another territory of the Commonwealth, some bias might be shown in that connexion by our representatives. The States, however, will always be able to rely, as my honorable friend has said, upon the advantages in the matter of climate which they possess. Surely we may take it that it has been proved incontestably that, looking at the interests of Australia as a whole, this work should be undertaken by the Commonwealth. . Australia is a whole. It is divided into Stares for local purposes and endowed with a Commonwealth of restricted powers in order that its proper development may be secured by both political organizations. Both the States and the Commonwealth are instruments to be used by the people as a whole for the benefit of Australia as a whole. They are to be employed for the industrial and .rural development of the country as a unit. In its defence there is no distinction possible between the States. In that respect no boundary line can be drawn. Consequently this question of immigration, regarded even as a mere matter of advertising, requires to be dealt with nationally in order that justice may be clone to all "the States without impairing any influence which the Commonwealth ought to exercise. Then to come - so far as I can in connexion with a vote which deals only with advertising the resources of Australia - to the vital question of immigration, may I emphasize the remarks that have been made to-day. by the right honorable member for Swan and the honorable member for Coolgardie, as well as by others, upon the great value of the cooperation of the States. It seems to me that there is an irresistible case for intrusting to the Commonwealth the work of advertising Australia as a whole abroad, each State furnishing the facts it wishes to have advertised. Under such a system we could not pick and choose, we should not select the data in any way. We should take what the States themselves gave us ; bear the expense of advertising it, and choose the methods which seemed to us, after full inquiry, best suited at the moment, to the Mother Country or to any of the other countries to which allusion has been made. But when dealing with immigration into this country we cannot help being impressed by the many difficulties that will be removed if we can enlist the cordial co-operation of the States. In the first place it is not only essential to reach the desirable people - avoiding the unemployable - of the Mother Country, and in every other country  but to recognise that we have not accomplished our task by merely bringing them here. We must provide for their reception, as the United States and Canada, in particular, have done. </para>

                            <para>- Companies having interests similar to 'those of the 'CanadianPacific Railway Company have looked after immigrants on arrival in the United States. Because of the difference between the methods and conditions of farming here and in the Mother Country, and the strangeness of bush life to those who are unused to our sparse settlement,  immi-grants  should be provided on arrival with proper accommodation, information, and all knowledge necessary to fairly launch them on their new careers. Yesterday I ventured to interject the truism that the best advertisement a country can have is the letter written home by the successful immigrant. Such an advertisement cannot .be surpassed, nor can the  injury  done by. the letters of discontented or dissatisfied immigrants be repaired. If immigration is to be a success, the immigrant must be given all the assistance -he may require to make -a fair start. It may be asked why should more consideration be shown to the newcomer than to the citizen of the Commonwealth? I see no reason why a distinction should  exist. The provision now made from winter to winter, in' time of stress, and in haste, to disseminate knowledge as to where employment is to be found, and where labourers are wanting work, is extremely defective. Much of the difficulty in dealing with the unemployed is due to the fact that applicants for work are neither properly classified nor informed of their opportunities. </para>

                            <para>- Every winter such' an organization is improvised ; and in New South Wales there is a permanent Department which makes inquiries and disseminates information regarding the state of the labour market. However, I do not wish to discuss what is at present a State matter, beyond paying that it is hardly a fair answer to those who advocate proper organization for the assistance of immigrants that there is not such an organization for those already in the country. Both classes should be assisted. We should have effective machinery for making known where employment is obtainable, and under what conditions, for the information of the seeker after work, be he immigrant or citizen. </para>

                            <para>- I have yet to hear of a country where that problem has been solved, though excellent work has been done in the attempt. Bull I fall to see that the fact that unemployment exists is a reason why we should cease from applying to the development of the Commonwealth all the labour we can devote to its undoubtedly enormous unused opportunities. The States being the large landholders, and in possession of Larger local public services than are at the disposal of the Commonwealth; have much better means for collecting and transmitting information from one place to another than the Commonwealth could obtain without large expenditure. If we can secure their co-operation, we shall be able to give a much better guarantee to those whom we wish to attract to our shores that, without delay or needless cost, they will find employment or land available for those who seek it. </para>

                            <para>- That remains to be seen. While pointing out the great value of State co-operation, I shall, so as not to detain the Committee, make no reference to the many directions in which it is most desirable that the States should pursue the task of welcoming and furnishing immigrants with information. When I come to the possibility that the States may not cooperate with the Commonwealth, I feel myself under an even greater disability, because we are likely shortly to meet the Premiers of the States to discuss this question, and I desire neither to reflect on what they have done nor to use language which could be fairly construed to imply anything in the nature of a threat. If we must look forward to the possibility of our proposals for co-operation being rejected, I agree with the honorable and learned member for Flinders that even that will not bring us to a full stop. We shall have to adopt other means, which I hesitate to describe, because I do not wish to assume an aggressive attitude. The honorable member for Angas detailed up to a .certain point the negotiations which have taken place in this regard between the Governments of the States and that of the Commonwealth. While there is a distinction between the Government and Parliament of the Commonwealth and those whom we represent, there is, I believe, an even greater distinction, where national questions are concerned, between the Governments and Parliaments of the States and their constituents. We have not yet had an opportunity - we may not soon have, and do not desire it - to ascertain the judgment of the people in regard to these vexed questions; but if the Commonwealth takes the true national path, avoiding any extinction or invasion of State rights, but seeking to serve national ends by national means, the people, who are the electors both for the States and the Commonwealth, will support us. Whenever we propose to carry out national work with national machinery, we shall have their support, and the Governments of the States, if they venture to appeal to them to resist it will not be supported by those who are their masters as well as ours. It is to the constituencies that we shall then appeal, and .in their hands judgment will lie. But it will be an unfortunate thing if we are obliged to appeal to them in such emergencies. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with the misconception that a refusal of the State Governments to co-operate must mean an abandonment of our proposals. I have gone further by saying that, after such a refusal, should there be a marked difference of opinion in regard to the handling of this national question, the Commonwealth Parliament will more truly interpret the national feeling and sentiment than the Parliaments of the States. </para>

                            <para>- I am pointing our that the proper course to follow, if we do rot secure the co-operation of the States will be to submit the matter to the people. We cannot then be charged with invading States' rights, since we shall be appealing" to the possessors of all the powers distributed between' the States and the Commonwealth. But I deprecate the idea that I am even hinting at the possibility of a conflict between the Commonwealth Government and Parliament and the States' Governments and Parliaments as if they were antagonistic in origin or opposite in their true interests. The real solution will be to submit the question at issue directly to the electors, of whose interests we are both of us the custodians. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. But we have already had warning from- one, if not more, of the State Premiers that, if we attempt to introduce immigrants without the consent or against the will of State authorities, there may be serious trouble. That was a direct intimation that, under certain extreme circumstances, we might not only have to proceed without State assistance, but in defiance of State antagonism. I have never suggested such a possibility, but it was suggested at one of the Conferences. Consequently I reply that if that misguided view prevails it will become necessary for us to appeal to the people. </para>

                            <para>- It is possible I may have given that hint, but do not remember it. In connexion with immigration what: we have to fear is, as I say, if, from any circumstances, we bring people here who find that the representations made are unjustified, and they cannot obtain an opportunity to take part in the development of the country, that would be fatal to any expenditure we might be undertaking oversea. If, therefore, we have to face the possibility of State inaction and want of sympathy, it will make our task very much more critical, and we shall have to proceed with so much greater caution. It will be a difficult matter to introduce more than a very limited number. The value of State co-operation is that with it we can venture,, with the greatest confidence, to introduce immigrants in large numbers, whereas, without the cordial co-operation of the States, we shall require to introduce them with great circumspection, in order that they may not find themselves deceived, and may not, therefore, react on our advertising agencies abroad by demonstrating that the promises held out are not, or cannot, be fulfilled. Here we see the value of a High Commissioner in London, with his finger on the pulse of the emigration movement on that side, assisting the Commonwealth on this side, in close touch with the whole of the continent and familiar with all the circumstances of our land and land settlement. We can then govern the influx of immigrants so as to meet the varying conditions of seasons or circumstances. When we speak of land settlement, I hope we remember - although it is a point which has been overlooked or ignored by several speakers - that there is an immense amount of labour employed on land which is not necessarily the labour of the owners. In this country large numbers of men are occupied in making homes for themselves and families, who are short cf assistance required all the year round.. When speaking of land settlement I have in  contemplation those who come here sufficiently qualified by the possession of knowledge and capital to take up land, and also those who come out, in the first instance, as agricultural labourers with a view, no doubt, of taking up land for themselves when they shall have become qualified by knowledge of the country to decide where to make their selections. The number of settlers who will arrive with money will, I think, be much larger than anticipated, if those eligible are made aware of the circumstances and conditions of Australia. I do not mean particularly in Victoria, where the price of land to-day is quite high compared with prices ruling elsewhere, but other parts of New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia, where land can be purchased at much lower prices. These men will want skilled labour, and they will not bring with them immigrant labourers as innocent as themselves, but will require men who have served their apprenticeship here. However, that is digression. What the States Governments will be entitled to know, when we are debating the question with them, is that if they co-operate with us, we can at once commence what I have termed the large immigration. But if we have to watch the course of employment, study the various land systems, and consider the overplus of applicants for all land that is being thrown open, at all events. in the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, we shall have to proceed with extreme caution. There are moreland seekers than Crown land left open for selection in the populous "States. For my own part. so far as I am able to judge. through minds better informed than mine on this subject, I believe that, even if we commence with a small stream, it can be steadily increased without risk or danger. Those in the first and small stream will be a source of employment for the second and larger stream. </para>

                            <para>- Not yet; but I notice they have been exchanging newspaper paragraphs which seem to point in that direction. When the vote is proposed next year, I shall be prepared, of course, to lay a scheme before the House, and discuss it in detail with the qualification I have already indicated. We shall then give particulars of the scale on which the immigration will be instituted, and the rate at which it can be continued without apprehension, even if we cannot count on the co-operation for which we hope. I believe that in the last resort, we shall find it possible to proceed with the introduction of immigrants under proper conditions, without delay. I most earnestly hope and trust, however, that the experience which the States have had with this Government during the last three years will satisfy them that we have been as patient as men can be in waiting for some realization of the plans submitted as long ago as 1906. I do not desire to weary honorable members with quotations, but it will be remembered that the Premier of Western Australia was not able to attend the Sydney Conference in 1906, and that in March of that year I wrote to him as follows - </para>

                        <para>If the States, in their own way, at their own terms, and according to their own judgment will make sufficient land obtainable without difficulty to supply the needs of a steady inflow into Australia of suitable immigrants such as con naturally be absorbed by them, the Commonwealth Government will supply those immigrants. Next session we will make adequate recommendations to the Federal Parliament, first for advertising Australia in the Mother Country, on at least the scale proposed by the AgentsCeneral ; next for subsidizing the passages of suitable immigrants by lines of steamers at cheap fares; and, in addition, for taking any other action that may be considered expedient for fostering rural pursuits by means of bounties. These things can be done much more economically and effectively by the Commonwealth acting for Australia than by the States separately. Bounties can only be granted by the Commonwealth. The several States would, of course, supplement these activities to any extent they thought desirable, according to whatever arrangements here, or as to their joint labours at Home, they may decide to adopt. The proposal now made needs no elaboration. It is a business offer. The Commonwealth would undertake the responsibility of carrying it out effectively. If it is accepted we shall at once become united in a truly Federal spirit for a truly national object. I have no doubt of the response of the Parliament to any measure submitted in this regard. </para>

                    <para class="block">That offer went before the Conference in  1906,  and was politely declined on the ground, amongst others, that certain States would benefit more than other States by the immigration, and, therefore, should pay a proportionate share of the expense. As I said, that argument had no weight from our point of view- - that it was a matter we were quite willing to leave them to settle amongst themselves. Wherever immigrants may land, they at once become citizens of the Commonwealth. The proposals in the letter have been pressed on the Premiers in different! forms at successive Conferences so far without result. If  I  may say so, I join with" the  deputy  leader of the Opposition and with the honorable member for Flinders and others, who have said that under these circumstances, after this next Conference, we shall have fairly discharged our obligation to the States Governments. The people of Australia will understand that we have not entered on this great and important field without having given the States Administrations every possible chance to co-operate with us, inviting them, if they so preferred, to name their own terms and methods. So far, we have been unfortunate in that we have not obtained any encouraging response. The Sibylline books are lessening, and at the next Conference we shall burn the last of the series. </para>

                            <para>- May I venture to differ from the acting leader of the Opposition in the rather pessimistic view he appears to take of the prospects of the Northern Territory. I am well aware that one of the Premiers said at a Conference that any settlers we might send there would in a few months be found in some of the other States. Having been forewarned we should be forearmed against such a contingency ; but those who have recently visited the Northern Territory, amongst them the honorable member for Illawarra, hold, I believe, a strong opinion that there are large areas of extremely fertile country offering admirable opportunity to young and enterprising settlers for mixed farming. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the settlers we shall draw to the Northern Territory will be mainly Australians. If we offer encouragement by providing railway communication, and, perhaps, freezing works for meat and butter particularly, there are large tracts of land adjoining the Victoria and other rivers, which can be occupied at comparatively small expense, on which cattle are now thriving, and from which a considerable business could be done direct with the East. </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree that advertising in itself is not sufficient to encourage immigration. In my opening remarks, I pointed out the many other uses that advertising serves, but I freely admit that if immigration is to be successfully encouraged, it will involve some expenditure here - even in the settled States - that it will require a considerable expenditure - though nothing like the amount mentioned by the honorable member for Wimmera - to make settlement possible in the Northern Territory ; and that it will further involve a steady judicious outlay in the Mother Country, Scandinavia, and elsewhere. The expenditure in those countries need not be large. This will give us a reinforcement of people who are competent to face the difficulties which surround our pioneers to-day, and which will continue to surround them for many years. But, just as our own fathers undauntedly conquered their surroundings, the same task will, and must, proceed around the whole coast of the Commonwealth. The enterprise is a very great and ambitious one, and may prove costly. But I thoroughly agree with the  deputy  leader of the Opposition that we have either to undertake it as a nation, or consent to cease to be. Because of the gravity of this problem, and because of the responsibilities involved in carrying it out, I look to the future with considerable anxiety. Failure would be better than not to attempt the task. Fail we cannot if we pursue our end with circumspection and judgment, steadily pushing forward the boundaries of civilization into the almost unknown parts of our territory. There are many encouraging omens. I have  been jested at not ungenerously because of the speeches which I have made upon this subject during the past year or two. When outside the House, I intend to continue making such speeches until the people realize the necessity for taking definite action. I shall be only too glad if those who have been jesting at my efforts will join me in undertaking this necessary missionary work, because we shall presently require to ask for a great deal more money than we have hitherto been granted. Further, we may be quite certain that we shall not get that money from the people of this country until we have satisfied them that this is an absolutely necessary work, and that it is being done in the right way.  </para>

                            <para>- I hope and believe so. I am greatly encouraged by the fact that in Victoria, no later than yesterday, this question was dealt with, at Maryborough, by a representative gathering of the Australian Natives' Association. That Conference discussed the subject of immigration, both from the State and from the national point of view, and carried a resolution, from the national point of view, indorsing this movement. This means much. What young Australia thinks today, all Australia will think to-morrow. If we can succeed in impressing the young Australians throughout the States, we shall not have to wait long for the support which we ask in Parliament to enable us to perform our duty in this regard. There are two or three outstanding duties very patent in the Commonwealth. In the first place, we must occupy this country, because, without occupation, it cannot be retained. Next, we must utilize it thoroughly to  maintain  our several standards ; and, lastly, having occupied and utilized it, we must take care that it does not pass from our race and from our flag. Without these three essentials our future would be absolutely hopeless. It is only with them that we can accomplish any of the great social tasks to which we have set our hands. Everything depends upon these three achievements - our occupation of the  country,  our use of it, and our retention of it. Therefore, the proposals which I hope to submit upon the next Estimates -will contain a provision for commencing the great work of adding to the population of this country much faster than it is being added to by our natural increase. We are getting a certain stream of immigration without State encouragement, and . some little trickles of immigration with State encouragement, but we need something much more than both combined if the Australia of 1920 is to be adequate to the trials which will lie before her. </para>

                        <para>. - I am very unwilling to make any further remarks upon this subject. But I wish to make a brief reference to the question of the unemployed in Australia. Before doing so, I should like to say with what pleasure I have listened to the speech just delivered by the Prime Minister, as I have listened to him upon many other occasions. -When he was reading the letter which he wrote two years ago bearing on this question of immigration, the honorable member for Dalley interjected that it was a beautiful letter. So it was. All the speeches delivered by the Prime Minister are beautiful. But I venture to say that at last the honorable gentleman is getting down to bed-rock. I congratulate him upon that fact, and I hope that later in the year we shall have submitted to us as well-matured and complete an immigration scheme as his ingenuity can devise. I understand him to say that whilst nothing can be done during the present financial year, something of a definite character will be undertaken during the next financial year. The Prime Minister will then submit a definite scheme for an early procedure with this important undertaking. </para>

                            <para>- The remarks that I specially desire to make at this stage refer to the methods in vogue in Australia for utilizing our surplus labour. I have often thought that there need not be a jingle man unemployed in the Commonwealth if we only possessed a thorough system of organization. With our wide diversity of climate and our great natural resources, all that is needed to insure employment for every man in Australia is a complete organization of our unemployed forces. I am looking forward with some hope to the establishment of a Department of Internal Affairs in connexion with the suggestion that has been made for the creation of a Board of Trade in Australia. It seems to me that a very useful function might be performed by such a body in connexion with the registration of labour in various parts of Australia, by directing the unemployed in one part to other! parts where employment could be obtained. I think that this work might be done in each of the States through their systems of local Government. I see that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Burns is organizing a similar scheme in connexion with the United Kingdom. I venture to say that with his practical mind, if he seriously addresses himself to the task, he will succeed. Everybody is aware that at all seasons of the year, when there is a dearth of employment in one portion of a State, there is an abundance of employment in other portions of that State or in other States. There is scarcely a time when one State is not more prosperous than another - when one State of the Commonwealth is not suffering from drought, whilst another is receiving copious rains. In travelling bv rail between Albury and Melbourne, the outlook at present is of the blackest description. Scarcely a blade of grass is to be seen. </para>

                            <para>- It is very unusual, and along that line things are looking worse than I have previously seen them. But on the other side of the border, the country is clothed in verdure and beauty in consequence of the copious rains that have fallen. In some portions of Australia there is always a condition of drought, whilst in other parts there is a condition of plenty and a profitable field for labour. Clearly, therefore, instead of saying - as we are constantly doing - that there are plenty of unemployed in Australia we should say that there is an abundance of opportunity for labour in Australia, and we should set about completing the requisite organization to transfer the man who wants employment to the place where that employment can be found. There is a great field open to some person in authority who has the means at his command for perfecting this organization. If that were done we should hear no more about the unemployed question as a bar sinister to bringing people here from outside. </para>

                            <para>- The functions of many of the Departments are increasing. The Department of Trade and Customs, for instance, has now to administer the Commerce Act, whilst the work of the Department of Home Affairs has been extended. The preparation of regulations under new Acts has to be undertaken by the Department of the Attorney-General, and advice has to be given from time to time by it. In that way, the work of the Central office has been greatly increased. A junior clerk at a salary of £50 per annum has also been added to the staff. </para>

                        <para>.- There appears in this division the item, " Secretary to the representative of the Government in the Senate,  £360."  The Secretary to the Prime Minister, however, receives only £335per annum. I believe in every man being well paid, and I should like to know whether the duties of the Secretary to the representative of the Government in be Senate are more arduous than are those of the Secretary to the Prime Minister? I do not insinuate that the first-named officer is being too highly paid ; in the absence of information, it seems to me that the Secretary to the Prime Minister is being underpaid. </para>

Whilst I admire any man who, by close study, has succeeded in passing certain examinations, and so increased his learning, I trust that the fact, that a man has passed such examinations, will not be used as a reason for putting him before men who have not done so, but can render equally good service: </para>

Accordingly, the Chief Clerk was transferred from the Melbourne office and put in charge, and the next in seniority to him made Chief Clerk in Melbourne, two junior clerks also being appointed in Melbourne at a salary of , £50 each. </para>

                        <para>.- Pro vision is made in this division for two additional associates. I do not object to each Justice of the High Court having his associate ; but it seems to me that when these dignitaries travel, it should not be necessary for them to take their associates with them. If reasonable economy were aimed at, they might very well utilize the services of the associates of the Judges of the Supreme Courts of the other States. </para>

If he had a wider knowledge of the practical working of the High Court, he would know that the Registrars are State officials, and that half its work is done by State officials. If he were to study economy in this and other matters, he could afford to be more liberal in granting postal facilities. </para>

                            <para>- The Judges of the States Courts do not travel, and therefore their associates do not cost so much as the associates to the Justices of the High Court, whose- travelling expenses come to , £3,000 per annum, or £600 a year for each Justice. No doubt the Justices carry with them their tipstaffs as well as their associates. Apparently economy is to be practised only in connexion with parliamentary services.  1  shall not move a reduction; but I hope that the Attorney -General will see whether a saving cannot be made. The Justices probably require associates ; but I think that when away from Melbourne', they might utilize the services of persons on the spot. </para>

Last year fifty appeal cases were listed in Melbourne, fifty in Sydney ; eleven in Brisbane, and six in Perth, or 117 in all; and it took the Court, sitting continuously, all the time it had at its disposal to get through the work. The associates have to be in continuous attendance on the Justices, so that it would be impossible to carry out the honorable member's suggestion. </para>

For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, who has been doing Arbitration work, found it necessary to go to Adelaide and Sydney from time to time, and also to Perth and Hobart, to hear actions against the Government for compensation. It is absolutely essential that each Judge should have his associate with him when travelling ; and I can assure the honorable member that the expense is kept down to the minimum. </para>

It would be unnecessary and undesirable to appoint Commonwealth officers to perform duties necessary only when the High Court happens to be sitting in a State; and therefore it was arranged that the States officers should act The Commonwealth Government took the view that the officers individually should receive this money, but the Premier of Victoria replied that such action would be contrary to the policy of his Government. Similar replies were received from all the other States ; and the result is that the money is paid by the Commonwealth to the States- and not to the officers direct. The general question was discussed at Premiers Conferences;and it was decided that the States Governments should receive the money and then decide how the officers should be remunerated. The work performed in the case of the registrars and others is of a "skilled nature, and the whole scheme of the Judicature Act contemplates the utilization of the services of States officers wherever possible. </para>

We have pressed on the States the view that the officers ought to receive the extra payment for increased work; and I may instance the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Halloran,</inline> in- Victoria, who has done such excellent work for the Commonwealth ; indeed, there was so much work, that he had to do it in his own time, and it was found necessary to appoint an officer to assist him. My opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Halloran's</inline> work was so high, that in June, 1907, I addressed a special letter to the Premier, pressing the view that he should receive the extra payment, and the result was the communication from that Minister to which I have referred. Of course the States Governments have full control of their own servants, and may recompense them as they choose. </para>

The policy of utilizing  the services of Commonwealth officers for the States and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa,</inline> has always been followed, with a view to avoiding duplication of officers, with the resultant increase of expenditure, and it is applied, for example, in the administration of the Commerce Act and the Electoral Act, and the Post and Telegraph Department, and the Treasurer's Department. </para>

                        <para>. - I know of a case similar to that cited by the Attorney-General, in which the Commonwealth pays £5 to a State for services rendered to it by a State officer, and that officer receives only£1 of it. The State pockets the balance. It appears, from the remarks of the Attorney-General, that New South Wales is the only State which pays anything to its officers for services, which they render to the Commonwealth. I should like to know whether the Commonwealth Government pockets the money which is voted to our officers for the services which they render to the States? </para>

                        <para>.- The explanation of the position given by the Attorney-General was absolutely accurate. The officers who perform work for the Commonwealth are State officials who are amenable to the States Governments. They work under the Public Service Acts of their own States, and it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to deal directly with them. They would not be allowed, without punishment, to receive direct from the Commonwealth compensation for services which they had rendered. But it seems to me - especially in the case of the prothonotary who initiated all the machinery of the High Court in the early stages of its existence, and who also presided at several disputed elections in this State - that an injustice has been done. This particular officer has performed a good deal of Commonwealth work in his own time. </para>

                            <para>- That officer has performed a lot of Commonwealth work in his own time, but owing to the bias of his official superior, he has not been permitted to receive any remuneration for it. It seems to me that the Attorney-General might put a little more vim into the diplomatic letters upon this subject which he forwards to the State Government. Of course, he may incur the risk of being told to mind his own business, but where he knows that a manifest injustice is being done, he ought to present the matter to the State Government in a form in which it is not accustomed to receive official communications.  . I  suppose that we can do nothing but agree to the vote. At the same time, I would suggest that a deal of  confusion might be avoided if, in the future, the amount set apart for this particular purpose were subdivided, so as to show the sum allocated to each State, and the officers who were entitled to receive it. </para>

                            <para>- But the State would very naturally say, " These are the salaries which we pay to our officials for performing State work, and we consider them sufficient." Thus we should have no <inline font-style="italic">locus standi.</inline> I see no way out of the difficulty, but I think that the Attorney -General might impart a little more fire to his future communications upon the subject, although nothing can be said upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Halloran's</inline> behalf, stronger than what was said by a previous Attorney-General. Nevertheless, owing to the prejudice of a certain official who is his superior, that officer's services have not been recognised.. Seeing that the amount involved in his case was a small one, and that its payment -would not have established a precedent - because we shall never have to organize the High Court again - it was a contemptible . act on the part of the Victorian Government to refuse to allow him to accept it. </para>

The honorable gentleman has also stated that we cannot avail ourselves of the services of State officers to perform Federal work without the consent of the State concerned. I am very sorry that he should have taken up a position in direct opposition to a recent decision of the High Court. A similar position was taken up by a State Chief Justice. But what was the answer of the High Court? It was that, although the Chief Justice of the State in question was not a servant of the High Court, he was an officer of the law and had to obey the law. If the Commonwealth employs this officer to do certain work, and the Judiciary Act empowers it to do so, it is absurd to say that the Commonwealth cannot pay him for his services. </para>

                            <para>- No ; but they work for us, and our moral liability is to them. If the honorable member employs a railway porter to carry his luggage he compensates him for his trouble, although he is not his servant, but is employed by the Railways Commissioners. In this instance we are getting special work done for us - it is not here a question of tipping- and only one of the States hands over to the officers concerned money paid to it by the Commonwealth for services so rendered. If the Attorney-General will not give us satisfaction I hope that, if we are driven to take the only step "we can take when we see an injustice done, he will regret his action. </para>

The Commonwealth ought to have given him a bonus. ' As the honorable member for Coolgardie has said, because this man's superior officer has a bias against him no . recommendation has been made that he shall receive payment in respect of the services rendered by him to the Commonwealth. We ought to. bring the State Government up with a round turn by refusing to make any payment to it. </para>

The work of managing a railway station, and looking after a post-office attached to it is assessed at a certain value.

Even if the individuals concerned are not permitted to receive this money, we must pay it over to the States.

                        <para>. - Under the Judiciary Act, certain duties have to be performed by district registrars, and the States were asked to allow us to utilize the services of their officers, to avoid the appointment of Commonwealth officers, whose time would not be fully occupied. It was shown that one of the officers asked by the State to do Commonwealth work was overworked, and strong representations were made on his behalf to the State Government by several Attorneys-General. Since I have been in office, he has been relieved to some extent by the appointment of a Commonwealth officer to assist him. When it was represented to the State that those of their officers who were doing Commonwealth work should receive payment from the Commonwealth, the New South Wales Government replied that, where officers were doing work for the Commonwealth which took up additional time, they were compensated for it. The reply we got from Queensland was that the duties of district registrar and deputy marshall were performed by the State officer in his ordinary office hours, and, as the State paid him for the period during which he was employed, it was considered that he was not personally entitled to the remuneration paid by the Commonwealth, and that it was due to the State. The Government of Western Australia pointed out that, in consequence of the attendance of its officer in Court on Commonwealth business, it had to pay other officers to do his work, and, therefore, considered that he was not entitled to the Commonwealth remuneration. We cannot compel the States to pay these men the amounts we pay, but we must compensate the States for work that is done for us'. </para>

                                has since been relieved of some of his work. I shall not hesitate to make strong representations in every case in which it is thought that officers are suffering injustice. The States and Commonwealth are working together to save expense, and it is the duty of the Public Service Commissioner, where Commonwealth officers are performing State services, to assess the value of the whole of the work done, while the same filing should be done in regard to the States officials who are performing Commonwealth services. In many of the States railway officials do a great deal of work.

I have risen mainly to suggest that when the next Estimates are prepared the Minister should formulate a comprehensive scheme for dealing with this matter, so that those who do work for the Commonwealth may be actually paid for their work. As payments have been made for ten months of the current financial year, this discussion is not of much value, except as an indication of our wishes in the matter. </para>

The Commonwealth utilizes the services of State officers, for which it naturally has to pay. If the work is done during the time for which the States pay those officers, they have no claim upon the sum paid by the Commonwealth ; but if it is done in overtime they should be reimbursed. The proposal of the honorable member for Maranoa, if carried, may do some good. It might be advisable to send to the Premier of Victoria . copies of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> containing the report of this discussion, when, perhaps, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent,</inline> who with all his ruggedness has his good points, might see that an injustice is being done. I shall take every opportunity of bringing under the notice of honorable members cases of officers who work overtime and are not being paid, because the Commonwealth is rich enough to pay its officers for all the work that is done by them. I am glad that the Attorney-General confirms the high opinion held of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Halloran</inline> by all who know that gentle- man ; and the strongest recommendations ought to be made to the State Government to hold the scales of justice evenly. </para>

                        <para>.I recognise the difficulty of the Attorney-General, and also the difficulty of the Committee. This work has been performed, and must be paid for under the agreement between the Commonwealth and the. States Governments. The States Governments hold that, as the services of their officers are rendered during office hours', the individuals are not entitled to the money paid by the Commonwealth. This Parliament has <inline font-style="italic">declared</inline> emphatically against sweating ; and yet we find the Commonwealth using the States Governments as a mean's to sweat States officers. I had personal experience of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Halloran,</inline> who is a first class officer, during the proceedings in my election petition. Had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Halloran</inline> been occupied only during office hours in that work, I should have nothing further to say ; but, as a matter of fact, for fourteen nights he was engaged up to 11 o'clock, and on one occasion until after midnight ; and he performed his duties so admirably that this Parliament' voted a sum of money as compensation to him. However, as has been pointed out, the State Government decline to allow him one farthing. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not know whether the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs has been drawn to some figures published in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of this evening and in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of yesterday, relating to the white man's burden. These figures show that wheat bags have been weighted up to 475 lbs., and that others range down to 350 lbs. I know I am voicing the opinion of every honorable member when I urge that the Minister should take steps to prevent this sort of thing being continued. </para>
