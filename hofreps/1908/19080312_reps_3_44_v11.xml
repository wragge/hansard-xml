                        <para>- The question cannot be answered by a plain &#34;Yes&#34; or &#34;No.&#34; There are some dozens of unions, and if they all had an unofficial secretary the work of the Department would practically be rendered impossible. I have expressed the opinion that if these unions were united - one for each section of the service - the work would be so great that an ordinary official could not attend to it, and that some one who would do the work thoroughly would have to be recognised by the Commissioner. </para>

As most business places in the city are closed on Saturday afternoon, can the Minister see his way clear to give these officers a half -holiday ? </para>

                            <para>- It has been my policy to close as many offices as possible at 6 p.m., and to extend the half -holiday principle, but I find that the public are exceedingly unreasonable. We have just received a petition to extend, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., the closing hour of a telegraph office at which, in those hours, during the last six months, only two telegrams have been lodged. I shall certainly extend the half-holiday principle as far as possible to all the employ&#233;s of the Department. </para>

The officers who deal with this branch of the service have informed, me. that they have no information with regard to the case. &#39; I should be. glad if the honorable member would supply me with the source of his information that the Department object to the registration of rifle clubs. He will remember that the Prime Minister, in outlining the defence scheme to the House, said that not only did we intend to continue the rifle club movement, but that the Estimates to be submitted would provide for a sum of ^10,000 in excess of the amount now voted for that purpose. </para>

                        <para>- The invention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brennan</inline> is now world famous, and many articles, illustrated and otherwise, have appeared in connexion with it. It attracted  so much attention that, whilst we were in London, my honorable colleague the Treasurer endeavoured to find time to inspect a working model of it. But, unfortunately, this proved impossible owing to his early departure. Whilst in England, I was informed, on practically official authority, that the Government of India thought so highly of the invention that they were prepared to expend a considerable sum upon the construction of a trial line. Having regard to the cost of. the working of the mono-rail system, it would be a matter of the utmost importance to us to adopt it if it should prove successful. But, as far as I am aware, a trial upon an actual working scale has not yet been made. </para>

For instance, upon the Murray, the shade registrations throughout the present year have been 10 degrees and 12 degrees lower than registrations in places from 120 to 200 miles south. These inconsistencies, which are very misleading to the public, and are calculated to do certain areas great injury, are due to the fact that no proper stations for the registration of shade temperatures have been established. 1 therefore wish to know whether it is intended to establish proper stations for the registration of shade temperatures in the northern districts of Victoria ? </para>

                        <para>A curious list drifts round Federal Parliament House. It purports to show the names of two members, both Tories, who got &#163;2,000 apiece for changing their views about the necessity for taxing the Standard Oil Trust&#39;s kerosene ; of a third Tory who was bought by being put into a nice corpulent spec, and of a fourth Tory who took the price of the betrayal of his country in a different form, but took it all the same. Certainly, a person who has openly alleged to be the emissary of Standard Oil was lobbying most industriously, and there was a sudden and amazing falling away among those who wanted to reserve the Australian market for the British Company&#39;s oil, and the Four, regarding whom suspicion now stinks to Heaven, are said to have not only changed their own views, but to have toiled enthusiastically to make converts to the doctrine of free-trade for the Monopoly&#39;s oil. </para>

                        <para>- The paragraph to which the honorable member has directed attention was brought under my notice by letter from Sydney during the latter portion of last month. I replied at once, inquiring why our notice had not been directed to it previously, whether there was any further information making the charge more definite, and why it had been left until this time to be brought under notice. To that, speaking from memory, we have received no answer. Parliament, of course, has not been sitting since it was published. The charge contained in the paragraph is a most serious one, but of the most general character. It uses a party name with which we are not familiar - the Tory Party - and it is a matter of individual opinion as to what part of this House that term, applies. There is no indication of any kind to what individual members this statement relates. Under these circumstances, it rests with the </para>

                    <para class="block">House, if sufficiently aggrieved, to call the editor of that publication to answer for this general indictment. Whether the dignity of Parliament is served by taking notice of such wild imaginations is always a matter for grave consideration. We have known in this State, and elsewhere, editors and publishers brought to the Bar, but we have rarely, if ever, seen any good results follow from the proceedings. In this case, as in any other, if some convenient means could be devised by which, without the antiquated procedure that at present obtains, this House could provide for its protection in the future against particular or wholesale slanders - of which this is by no means the only or the most damaging that could be cited from the press - we should have some prospect of making those responsible suffer for it in a legal and just way so as to forbid them for the future. But every one who has had any experience in connexion with legislative bodies, and of charges of this character, shrinks from taking the only steps now available, seeing that the almost invariable result is nothing but a great public advertisement of the scandal complained of and some admonition to the offender without any appreciable effect. Therefore at this date, after the publication and with such a general charge, I think it may be reasonably questioned whether we have anything to gain by proceeding further. </para>

                            <para>- No attention was officially called to the matter until, as I have said, past the middle of last month, when four to six weeks had elapsed. So far as my memory serves, no further particulars or repetition of the charges was forthcoming. I do feel, however, that the time has arrived when this House is called upon to consider the constant imputations which are recklessly and vaguely levelled against honorable members, and sometimes against public officials. We should see whether some adequate mechanism cannot be devised for dealing with the offenders without distinction and with the necessary penalties. I shall take an opportunity of consulting my colleagues, and am prepared to advise them to appoint a small Committee to consider a method of procedure by which, without adding to the notoriety dear to some slanderers, we may bring them before a proper tribunal, and deal with them in an efficient manner. </para>

                    <para>- The course of public business is determined by one factor, which, at the present time, unfortunately, remains of an indeterminate character, namely, the return of the Tariff, with suggestions from the other Chamber. We are at present unable to say whether the Tariff will be returned to us in three, four, five, or six weeks, and, consequently, any forecast as to public business must be subject to that possible variation. The business proposed, to be dealt with roughly follows the order of the first items on the notice-paper. The Quarantine Bill has already passed both Houses, and, as only the amendments made by the Senate remain to be dealt with, that measure ought to be rapidly disposed of. Then we have Supply, which, of course, includes the whole of the Estimates. Ten months of the year have expired, and they must be disposed of before the end of June.&#39; The Australian Industries Preservation Bill - the third order of the day - comes to us from the Senate, and is a very short measure. Then follows the Papua Bill, a slight, formal measure, whose consideration can be postponed until any convenient opportunity. The fifth order of the day is the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, which we expect to be able to further consider in Committee very shortly-when the Senate has dealt with the section of the Tariff relating to it. The Commerce Trade Description Bill, the Marine Insurance Bill, and the resumption of the Committee of Ways and Means, can be handled at convenience. Then comes the Seat of Government Bill, the measure which I understand the honorable and learned gentleman to have chiefly in mind. The only legislation to be introduced in addition to the list on the notice-paper, so far as I am now aware, is a Bill for dealing with the surplus funds returnable to the States. It would have been laid on the table to-day were it not for the fact that the Attorney- General has been too engrossed in the cases in the High Court, to which the Commonwealth is a party, to be able to complete its final revision ; but the Treasurer will give notice of it to-day. It is a short but important measure, which must be dealt with before the Tariff is returned to us, and passed into law before June. The consideration of the Estimates and the Additional Estimates, also urgent, can be arranged to meet the wishes of the House. Now, as to time. The first two measures on the business-paper need not detain us very long. The discussion of the Australian Industries Preservation Bill should occupy, at most, two or three evenings. </para>

                        <para>- I hope not much, if any, longer. Supply ought not to call for much debate at this stage. Therefore, we shall probably be able to discuss the Seat of Government Bill at the end of a. fortnight, or possibly after three weeks. The Bill relating to the surplus funds returnable to the States, though short, is important, and may occupy more time than I have allowed for; but, even if we leave a month for these measures, unless there is much more expedition in another place in dealing with the Tariff, it is probable that we shall be able to dispose of the Seat of Government Bill as well before that measure is returned to us. If we saw that it could not be disposed of before the consideration of the Senate&#39;s requests in connexion with the Customs Tariff Bill had to be undertaken, it would be wise to postpone it, because it is not desirable to have a break in its consideration. </para>

                        <para>- The second reading has not been moved, but I have every reason to hope that, with the enthusiastic support of the honorable member, we shall easily carry it. If the Capital Site question is not dealt with before the Customs Tariff Bill is returned by the Senate, I shall ask the House to deal with it after the Senate&#39;s requests have been disposed of, that is, assuming it to be possible to cope- with it this session. It will be of great advantage to us, if we are going to close, to dispose of it before separating, so that we may meet next session with a clear run for our financial and defence proposals. </para>

                        <para>- On the last occasion its consideration occupied more than a fortnight. There are many delays which may arise, because of the peculiar complications which it presents. Members have first, second, and third preferences, divisions of opinion exist among all parties in regard to every site, and the tactics by which they hope to defeat other sites. Then there are proposals already on the notice-paper - though I do not expect them to be brought forward - for an alteration of the Constitution in this regard. Anything may happen in this way to introduce unforeseen embarrassments. If we deal with the Quarantine Bill and other measures as rapidly as we dealt with certain measures in the early part of the session, I see no reason why we should &#39;not pass the Seat of Government Bill this session. In some correspondence which took place . a little while ago, my hopes were not so sanguine, because I thought that the matter would probably have to go over until next session. If we are fortunate in getting a good run of business, there is no reason why it should not. be tackled this session. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member asked a question in the time allotted for the asking of questions without notice, and he has received a reply in the ordinary way. Had I understood the Prime Minister to be making a Ministerial statement, I should have asked him to conclude with a motion, to enable debate to take place upon it. As he was merely replying to a. question, I must now call upon the honorable member for Echuca, who rose before the honorable member for East Sydney, or, if the Prime Minister pleases, I will regard him as not having resumed his seat, and give him the opportunity,&#39; by- laying a paper on the table, to conclude with a motion. </para>

                        <para>- My request was that the Prime Minister should make a statement, not to me, but to the House, as to the probable course of business during the remainder of the session. It is of great help to honorable members to have, from the only authority which can give us a reliable &#39; forecast, a statement of the intentions of the Government in regard to public business ; and I am glad that the Prime Minister recognised this by promptly acceding to my request. My remarks will not be controversial, because I think that such a speech would be foreign to the occasion ; I wish merely to make a few observations, entirely free from party spirit, on the progress of public business. The Prime Minister - perhaps because the situation of affairs prevented him - has unfortunately not dealt with one very important question. He has not told us whether he intends a short time hence merely to follow the practice adopted just prior to Christmas, and adjourn for a month or two- </para>

                        <para>- That removes one difficulty. We shall have a very considerable volume of business relating to the Tariff and that very important matter to dispose of. May I suggest to the earnest consideration of the Government that they should avoid as far as possible departing from understandings arrived at between the Government and this House in connexion with the rates of duties? It will he most inconvenient if we discover, when by-and-by the Tariff is returned to us, that the Minister in charge of it in another place has departed from the understandings which the Treasurer arrived at with this House in regard to certain duties. In dealing with this Tariff by-and-by we shall have troubles enough without having what I might call a high temperature engendered as the result of an arrangement arrived at between the Committee of this House and the Government being overridden by a member of the Government in. another place. &#39; Unless the Cabinet speaks with one voice in dealing with the Tariff the normal -difficulties of the situation will be immensely increased, and honorable members who are opposed to the Government in. this House will have scope to put one member of the Ministry against another in connexion with these important matters. That would be very undesirable. I hope that when the Tariff comes back to us the arrangements which have been made between the Government and members of the Committee of this House will be honorably observed. If the new protection scheme fails and cannot be proceeded with, I presume that honorable members who have been dealing with the Tariff on the basis of that important system will not treat it as being precisely the same without the new7 protection. I presume that the establishment of the new protection has entered seriously &#39; into the consideration of honorable members in connexion with the imposition of duties. I feel sure that they will review the situation if the new protection scheme cannot be proceeded with. The Prime Minister very properly promised us that the Committee would have an opportunity to review the position if such a situation arose. I come now to the question of the Seat of Government. The constant iteration of the demand for settlement of the question may .occasionally present to some honorable members a more or Jess humorous aspect. But putting aside those passing humours, I feel that since; the Government and the House have determined to deal with the matter one way or another, the sooner it is out of the way the better. It has been a disturbing influence in the course of our legislation for the last eight years, and since the Government have practically pledged themselves to deal with it within the next two or three weeks, or very soon afterwards, I would strongly urge them to ask the House to dispose of it before the Tariff is returned to us. I take the Government to be sincere in their statement that they propose to get it out of the way this session. There will be ample time to do so before the Tariff is returned from another place, and I hope I am representing the general feeling of the House when I say that it should be dealt with within the next three weeks. That would give every honorable member who wishes to revisit the suggested sites, or to visit them for the first time, a reasonable opportunity to do so during the next two week-ends. </para>

                        <para>- It is much better that the procedure to be adopted in settling the question should be decided by the Prime Minister and his colleagues. I made one suggestion yesterday, but think it would he unfair to advance any other suggestion before the Government ha\e stated their intention. I look to them to determine upon a method of procedure which will leave every honorable member perfectly free to vote as he pleases. </para>

                        <para>- There is yet a great deal of work to be done in connexion with the Tariff. I cordially agree with the view of the Prime Minister that the Quarantine Bill should be got out of the way. It is practically finished, and should have been disposed of years ago. The Government will find very little difficulty in passing it through its remaining stages. The Additional Estimates are very important. I do not know their nature, but do not suppose that they raise any large question of public policy. That being so, their consideration should not take long. The Prime Minister did not say. anything about the Defence scheme, but I suppose that was a mere omission. </para>

                        <para>- The defence scheme for the present seems to be put aside. Although I differ from the Prime Minister, 1 thoroughly recognise the service which he has rendered in bringing this question to the forefront of practical politics. However much we may differ from his views on the question, we must nil do that. Whilst the future scheme remains in abeyance, I hope that the Prime Minister will not suspend or impair the existing system, but that the fullest encouragement will be given to the rifle clubs, the militia and the volunteer forces, and that recruiting will be encouraged in every possible way. Those are lines upon which we all agree. We am agreed as to the .importance of defence; we differ only as to the precise methods to he adopted. Pending the settlement of the question, let the methods prevailing for years in the Commonwealth be  fully  supported. In the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, at the opening of this Parliament, great prominence was given to the financial relations of the States, coupled with the federalization of old-age pensions. Long ago I took up a very strong attitude in respect to that matter. A Conference of Premiers is about to be held, and I hope thai the Government will use their influence with the Premiers of the States to secure an arrangement that will enable old-age pensions to be federalized with a minimum of inconvenience, and without any delay. </para>

                        <para>- That is a very fair suggestion. I can see no trouble if the other States will only consent to give the Federal Government the authority to federalize old-age pensions, and to take the amount required from the sum returnable to them under the Constitution!. The difficulty of the Braddon section would thus be surmounted, and an old-age pension system could be federalized without delay/ No amendment of the Constitution would be necessary. I hope that the Government will use their influence with the Premiers of the States. </para>

                        <para>- I come now to the Postal Rates Bill. Surely the Prime Minister is not going to devote valuable public time to the discussion of that Bill, which would deprive us of a revenue of over&#163;100,000 per annum, at a time when the officers of the Post and Telegraph Department are notoriously underpaid. . If we had the necessary money, and everything in the Department were being conducted in a proper way, no anxiety would be experienced by anybody. The idea underlying the proposal is a good one. The more postage is cheapened the better. Every intelligent man will admit that. But we must have some regard to the financial position of the Commonwealth, and if we have &#163;100,000 to spare, I would rather see it paid away to the men who carry our letters or devoted to placing reasonable postal and telephonic facilities within the reach of the whole community, than I would see it expended upon penny postage. </para>

We must endeavour, as far as possible, to get on with the transaction of public business, and if, by adjourning, instead of proroguing, two or three months hence, we can secure more expedition and satisfaction, I am sure that honorable members will not shrink from adopting that course. So far as I am concerned - and I think I may speak for honorable members upon this side of the House - so long as the measures submitted by the Government are measures to which we can give our support, we will not allow any party feeling to interfere with the dis charge of our duty to the country. When Government measures call for criticism, it will not be found wanting. If, however, the Ministry will redeem the promise which has now been distinctly made, to deal with one of the thorny subjects that has been before the House for many years - the question of the selection of the permanent Seat of Government - there will have been one achievement this session upon which they will be able to congratulate themselves. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with some of the. observations which have been made by the leader of the Opposition, and I disagree with others. It is, therefore, only fair that I should be permitted to state the position which I take up. I am exceedingly pleased to learn of the anxiety of the right honorable member for East Sydney to have certain matters submitted to the State Premiers. I can assure him that the whole of the members of the Labour Party are just as anxious as he is in that connexion. But the fact cannot be ignored that our patience in these matters has been almost exhausted, and the time has arrived when this Parliament must perform the duty which has been cast upon it. Upon the question of penny postage, I have already expressed my opinion very strongly. Every honorable member is&#39; in favour of penny postage if it were merely a question of penny postage <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> twopenny postage. But the real point is whether we shall devote money which is being collected in certain of the States in which the residents do not enjoy reasonable postal and telephonic facilities to the introduction of the system of penny postage. Shall we provide these persons with reasonable postal and telephonic facilities, or shall we allow a particular Minister to gain some little political kudos for having brought about the adoption of penny postage during his tenure of office? I say that until we have provided the residents of the various States with an efficient postal service we should hesitate to adopt penny postage. The one matter which I consider most urgent at the present time is the carrying out of the pledges which we have repeatedly made to the old people of Australia that we would pay them old-age pensions. </para>

                    <para>The necessity for the regulation arose through numerous cases arising in the remote parts of the Commonwealth where offences had been committed at distant places - say, for example, such places as the Gulf country of Queensland or Broome, or Wyndham, in Western Australia. To get to many of these places would necessitate the Board&#39;s spending days travelling by steamers and coaches both ways at considerable expense, and it was considered that in these exceptional cases some more reasonable and businesslike means should be devised than that of either bringing the accused and all necessary witnesses to the head centre or of taking three highly-paid officials away from their work for perhaps weeks, with all the attendant expenses. In cases of this kind the evidence is taken locally by a responsible and competent person. The accused has full opportunity of being represented by counsel and&#39; cross-examining any witnesses brought against him, and also of adducing whatever evidence he is able to in his favour. It is dealt with in exactly the same way as if the inquiry were held at the head centre. When the evidence is completed, it is remitted verbatim to the Board, who consider it and arrive at their finding. </para>

                <para class="block">I desire to add that the power of delegating the taking of evidence has been exercised by the Commissioner on the advice of the Attorney-General as to its legality. When the Public Service Bill was under consideration in the House, this very point was raised, and I remember that the Gulf of Carpentaria was specially mentioned in connexion with it. Provision was inserted in that Bill for the taking of evidence in this manner for the purpose of enabling cases to be dealt with, which it was practically impossible to deal with in any other way.

                        <para>- I admit that it might, and, therefore, we have to proceed with a view to giving the man in a distant district the same facilities, as far as possible, as those enjoyed by the man in the centre of population. The honorable member will admit that it is most difficult to deal with cases in distant parts of this immense continent. Last night the honorable member for Maranoa stated that the plan complained of was adopted only in Queensland, but I may inform him that exactly similar procedure has been followed in New South Wales. In Victoria. &#39; the territory is not so large, and, therefore, this procedure is not necessary, and in Western Australia there has never been a case requiring it. </para>

                    <para>.-I have not been able to look closely at the  Amendments,  which do not explain themselves, &#39;but they seem to be generally harmless. There is one amendment, however, which stands out in the shape of  an  addition to  a  clause, and I think attention should be directed to it, because it makes an important, novel, and, perhaps, dangerous departure, under which all sorts of favoritism might be shown. For instance, if a ship arrives in Hobson&#39;s Bay with some quarantinable disease on board, all passengers and others, although they may not have the disease, have to go into quarantine. The effect of the amendment, however, is that if a ship were to arrive with, say, 200 passengers, and a case of small-pox, the quarantine officer would be able to pick out any person - who would generally be some one of influence with important business in shore - and allow him out of bounds. The amendment, which is in the form of an addition to clause 45, provides that where a person ordered into quarantine is not, in the opinion of the quarantine officer, actually suffering from a quarantinable disease, he may, subject to the regulations, be permitted to leave the ship or station under quarantine surveillance. The opinion of a quarantine officer is a variable opinion. </para>

                        <para>- When such an extraordinary case arises, it will be dealt with in some way or other. What I am saying is that, in the actual administration of the quarantine law, if it be permissible to allow persons out of bounds, we know, as a rule, the class of persons who will be thus treated. </para>

                        <para>- Under such circumstances as the honorable member has suggested, the law could only be overridden once in about four years. We must remember the tremendous risks to which the community might be exposed if this amendment were made part of the law. Doctors, like other men, may make mistakes,  and even in cases where a man is not, when examined, apparently suffering from disease, he may, if allowed out of quarantine, develop it within a day or two, to the great danger of the community. What is the use of providing for the surveillance of men allowed out of quarantine bounds ? Who is going to look after the liberated contact? </para>

                        <para>- What intense dissatisfaction would be created amongst the passengers of a quarantined ship if some favoured person, having perhaps large interests on shore, were allowed his liberty, while the remainder were detained ! The law must be administered humanely, but with the most absolute impartiality. By allowing only one person out of quarantine, the community would be exposed to the dangers for the prevention of which perhaps  199  other persons were being detained. It is unfortunate that quarantine detention should be necessary; but it is useless unless made absolute. What surveillance can there be of persons allowed out of quarantine? Are we going to provide that certain passengers of a detained vessel may go to a first-class lodging house in Queenscliff, while the remainder are kept quarantined at the quarantine station ? Such difference of treatment would create the most intense dissatisfaction. In my opinion, it is objectionable to give any quarantine officer such tremendous power. </para>

The quarantine officer may make a mistake, or he may be right, and the man may not be suffering from the disease, but, having been a contact, or having become infected, although showing no signs of sickness, he may become ill within two or three days after his liberation.

                        <para>- When vessels are quarantined, there are ordinarily only one or two persons, out of perhaps  100  on board, suffering from disease, but as the disease may have been communicated to those who have been in close contact with them, it has been considered unsafe to release any one until a sufficiently long period has elapsed to show that no further case will develop. Quarantine would be intolerable if it did not apply to all concerned. When Treasurer of New South Wales, I administered the Quarantine Department, and know that occasionally the most impassioned appeals for release, on account of urgent business, or for other reasons, were made to the authorities. There would be seething discontent if one man were released while another in exactly the same position, so far as the quarantinable disease was concerned, was detained. The proposed distinction is likely to upset the whole quarantine system. If it were provided that every person not suffering from a quarantinable disease should be allowed to go free, the proposal would be regarded as farcical, and the suggestion that certain persons, not apparently suffering, should be allowed to go free, strikes at the utility of quarantine. </para>

                        <para>- That, in some cases, might be no great injury to the nation, though unfortunate for the Ministers. It might happen, too, that among a number of quarantined persons was one who had come from the other side of the world to see a dying relative. Would such a person be detained if, in the opinion of the medical officer in charge, he could with perfect safety to the community be allowed to visit his relative, and return to the quarantine station? I am putting undoubtedly hard cases. I know that in the past Governments have broken the law, by allowing distinguished persons to leave quarantine, and undoubtedly the law will be broken again. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. What weighs most with me in this matter is the opinion that, if every detained person is required to remain in quarantine, the Government will find it incumbent to provide inhabitable quarantine stations, whereas, if leading and influential persons were exempted, very unsuitable provision might be made for those who remained. I was surprised to learn when a conference of the medical officers of Australia assembled not long ago, that they were unanimously in favour of doing away with quarantine, and having open ports. They seem prepared to deal with infectious diseases after they come here. </para>

                        <para>- Its commerce is such that, perhaps, , it could not have an efficient quarantine in regard to all the infectious diseases brought to its shores. But If we are to have effective quarantine, it is necessary that all whom the medical authorities regard as contacts should, without distinction, be detained in the quarantine ground. There may be occasions when, in the interests of the country, certain persons may have to be allowed out under surveillance. These should be very rare exceptions, and made, not on account of social position, but solely in the public interest, and, being necessary, I think should be provided for by law . </para>

                        <para>- There is a system of surveillance. The honorable member for East Sydney spoke of 200 persons being placed in Quarantine, and one of their number being allowed to go free. A passenger on an infected ship would not be allowed to go free, except for some very special reason. Let me put the converse position. Supposing it were desirable to release 199 out of 200 persons ordered into quarantine, would it not be unfortunate if the power to grant that release did not exist? </para>

                        <para>- It is just as easy to imagine a case where it would be necessary to release 199 out of 200 persons as a case in which it would be necessary to release one, and keep in quarantine the remaining 199. This is a power that ought to be expressly stated. The Administration would be responsible to Parliament if any unreasonable preference were shown to any individual. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sur prised that the Minister should hesitate to ask the Committee to reject the amendment of clause 45, in view of the speech made by the leader of the Opposition. Only a few months ago the federalization of the quarantine system of the States was warmly approved. It was felt that the States&#39; system had been somewhat lax, and the Minister and the honorable member for Hunter, who apparently supports this amendment, were then most strongly in favour of rigid quarantine laws. </para>

                        <para>- Australia to-day is remarkably free from small-pox, and I think that the leader of the Opposition is to be commended for the stand he has taken with respect to this amendment. Why should we differentiate between passengers on an infected ship? If the Governor-General were a passenger on a ship infected with small-pox, and were allowed to go free on reaching port, he would be just as liable to spread disease as would be the humblest steerage passenger*. The reference made by an honorable member to the position of a naval officer on board such a vessel was rather beside the mark. There are strong sentimental considerations running through all our legislation. Cases of hardship must arise under every law. It has been said that it might be desired to allow a man in quarantine to visit a dying relative, but no one ever thinks of  asking that a prisoner be released in order that he may see some relative who is dying. </para>

                        <para>- Why should we give the quarantine officer such a power as this? We may depend upon it that it would not be exercised in favour of an unknown steerage passenger. It would be the man in the saloon, who could bring influence to bear, who would have it extended to him. Let us have quarantine or no quarantine. I certainly believe in an effective system. The honorable member for Wide Bay said he had known a Government to release from quarantine men who should have bean detained; and I think that we should guard against any leakage under the Federal Jaw. I am glad that the leader of the Opposition has drawn special attention to this amendment, and hope that it will be resisted. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree entirely with everything that has been said by the leader of the Opposition. There is no comparison between the quarantine laws of Great Britain and these of Australia. For many years quarantine in the Old Land has been practically nonexistent. There is a certain measure of surveillance, but nothing more. In Australia the position is wholly different. This is a young country, with a comparatively small population, and we want to shut out all highly contagious diseases. The amendment of clause 45 is not at all comparable with clause 14. Under that clause the Governor-General, acting on the advice of his responsible Ministers, may exempt a person from quarantine, and the Ministry would have to take full responsibility for such action. We may depend upon it that they would take care to obtain the opinion of more than one expert before advising the Governor-General to release any individual from quarantine. Under this amendment, however, a suspect might be allowed to leave a ship and spread disease. In this country it is almost impossible to keep a man so released under surveillance. A person who had. been suffering from scarlet fever might be released when the state of desquamation was so fine as to be unnoticeable. If the patient had taken a bath before being examined, the desquamation might have disappeared, only to re-appear a day or two later, after he had been released, and had gone to the back blocks. He might there be placed under the surveillance of the local policeman, but  within three weeks the whole district would probably be infected with scarlet fever. Since we have adopted the principle of quarantine, we should make our quarantine laws effective. If a quarantine officer made a mistake under this provision he could be dismissed, but that would be poor satisfaction to those who suffered - and we have to remember that the poorer classes more particularly would suffer - from such a mistake. Having affirmed the principle, we ought to say that it shall apply to all sections of the community, irrespective of class or station. </para>

                    <para>.- I am glad that the leader of the Opposition has directed special attention to the amendment of clause 45. I can well understand that the Minister is very anxious to get the Bill through, and does not wish it to be returned from the Senate. That <inline font-style="italic">can</inline> be his only reason for proposing that the amendment be agreed to. It seems very largely to set aside the whole object of the Bill. As the honorable member for Corangamite has pointed out, this provision differs materially from clause 14. </para>

                        <para>- I know that. Under the amendment of the Senate any quarantine officer, acting upon his own initiative, would have power to release from quarantine any person whom he might think was not suffering from a quarantinable disease. He would have power to release him under surveillance, the nature of the surveillance being prescribed by regulation. Surely that is a very different matter from the Governor-General being moved, in order to obtain the release of an individual from quarantine. Where the Governor-General has to be moved, the case would have to be a very exceptional one. But, under the amendment of the Senate, all that a quarantined person would require to do would be to curry favour with the quarantine officer. This proposal opens up a painful vista to the quarantine officer, who would be importuned night and day for the release of particular individuals. Under such circumstances, what persons would be likely to secure their release?Naturally, those who were able to bring the most influence to bear - persons who, because they possessed a large number of friends, would be able to get their cases favorably dealt with by the quarantine officer. Surely the possibility of favoritism should not exist in a matter of this kind. If a quarantine officer is to have power to release, under surveillance, a person who is not suffering from any quarantinable disease, the Bill becomes ridiculous. We do not want to isolate persons who are not suffering from a quarantinable disease. </para>

                        <para>- Then this Bill is not required. If a medical officer, upon examination, found that nearly the whole of the passengers of a ship were free from any quarantinable disease, why not give him the power to let them go? But that is not the proposal for which the Government are fighting, and I am surprised at the Minister of Trade and Customs supporting the amendment of the Senate. As a matter of fact, it did not emanate from the Government . </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Now a steamer would reach Fremantle from Colombo in ten days, and therefore a ship might&#39; have on board hundreds of passengers who, to all appearances, were perfectly healthy, but who actually had the disease of small-pox latent in their systems. My next point is, &#34; What is the nature of the surveillance provided for by regulation?&#34; I inquired into this matter yesterday, and I was informed that upon being released under surveillance each person would have to undertake to report himself at the nearest police station every day until the period of incubation had been completed. That is to say, if he had left an infected port ten days before the vessel arrived here, the surveillance regulations provide that for a further period of eleven days he must report himself daily at the nearest police station. In my judgment that kind of surveillance would be quite as bad as quarantine. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps not. I admit that I have not been upon a quarantine station. Of course, the idea underlying this regulation is that the authorities may be enabled, should disease break out, to trace it promptly, and to suppress it. </para>

                        <para>- We have, I think, to consider mainly one disease, namely, small-pox. That is the disease which occurs to everybody in dealing with this question of quarantine. I understand that in England, where they have a system of quarantine which has been in vogue from time immemorial, a somewhat similar provision obtains. </para>

                        <para>- If we err at all, I think that we ought to err upon the safe side. At the same time, I do not dismiss the amendment of the Senate as a ridiculous one. On the contrary, there is much to be said for it, although the system of surveillance for which it provides would be&#39; almost as irksome as would quarantine itself. If there is a possibility of an outbreak of small-pox, for instance, from a shipload of people, who, though not suffering from the disease, are let loose on the land with it latent in their bodies, it is worth our while taking every precaution. In a climate like that of Australia, where diseases seem to thrive and spread with amazing rapidity, we ought to be all the more careful in our endeavours to prevent the introduction of what have proved such terrible scourges elsewhere. I ask the Minister whether he thinks it worth while putting this matter to the vote. If he does think so, I shall feel obliged to vote on what I regard as the side of greater safety. </para>

                    <para>.- I shall vote for the amendment suggested by the Senate. I do not think any one is more favorable to stringent regulations affecting the spreading of diseases than I am. When I was at Hong Kong I made many inquiries, the results of which induced me to regard that place as the storm-centre of disease so far as Australia and other places are concerned. I am alluding now to the three dangerous diseases of small-pox, cholera, and plague; and in no country in the world do the conditions prevail which can be observed at Hong Kong. No less than 1,100 dead bodies are thrown into the streets of that city every year, and those who know the veneration which the Chinese have for their dead will understand that there must be something wrong when such conditions prevail in an English port which is greater than either London or Liverpool. The <inline font-style="italic">South China Weekly Post,</inline> in 1905, published figures showing that in the previous year the total number of bodies examined at Hong Kong was 2,225. Of these, non-plague cases numbered 1,700, or nearly 80 per cent., while the plague cases numbered 430, or 19.3 per cent.; 1,171 bodies were, in the same year, found in the streets, of which the non-plague cases numbered 1,028 or 87.4 per cent., while the plague cases numbered 148, or 12.6 per cent. Those figures deal particularly with plague ; but there were also small-pox and cholera cases. I have full confidence in the conduct of any Government officer who has control in a place of trust. It was interjected by one honorable member that the officer might be bribed ; but bribery is possible anywhere, and an officer who is subject to such influence would be in danger not only of losing his position, but,I believe, of severe punishment under the Act. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that the man with the most medical diplomas would make the best quarantine officer, though he might prove the most efficient in the work of organizing and general control. I can say that one of the persons who was under surveillance in West Melbourne afterwards expressed the opinion that he would prefer six weeks in a quarantine station. I read the speech of the honorable senator who introduced this amendment, and his views accord with my experience. I have  been four times a doctor on hoard ship, and have brought emigrants to Australia, so that I have some knowledge of this matter. I do not think we sufficiently appreciate what we owe to the United States in connexion with the preservation of the public health. It is not the laws&#39; as they leave the American Congress, but the regulations and the ability of the heads of the Department, which make America the sentinel, as it were, to guard us from the diseases of the East. All bills of health on ships in the Japan trade, and the Eastern trade generally, have to be vised by the American Consul. This holds good in all the ports on the way to Hong Kong; and at Manila the American authorities insist on the Chinese on board taking antiseptic baths. We must all pay a meed of praise to the great American nation for so guarding us from the dangers incidental to the diseases of the East. There is no doubt that we might reciprocate somewhat - that the present Government might act in friendly co-operation with the American authorities in order to make our safeguards better than they are now. The sooner this Bill becomes law, the better it will be for us; and if experience proves, in the course of a year or two, that amendments are necessary, they can easily be made. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Melbourne has not made out a good case for the amendment. He spoke of what the Americans do at Manila to prevent the spreading of disease. But, nevertheless, vessels trading from the East to. Port Darwin may bring plague, small-pox, and other diseases with them. On the arrival of such a vessel at Port Darwin, the medical officer might be absent, and the quarantine officer, who need not be a medical man, would, under the amendment, have power to allow certain of the passengers to go ashore. We have it on the authority of the honorable member for Hunter that some diseases take three weeks to develop. As for the surveillance spoken of, it has been explained that that means that the persons concerned must attend regularly to have their pulse, their temperature, and their respiration taken. Is the local policeman to determine whether such a person is suffering from disease, and, if so, what the nature of the disease is? Even in regard to measles, several examinations have often to be made before the disease can be definitely distinguished from diseases whose initial symptoms are similar. . Besides, the local &#34; bobby &#34; will be as likely as any one else to take an infectious disease. Under this provision, any one might be allowed to land at Port Darwin from a vessel from the East, so long as he showed no signs of disease. Only the other day, persons on board the <inline font-style="italic">Empire,</inline> coming from Japan, did not develop disease until the vessel had passed Port Darwin, and was groping her way along our northern coasts. It appears to me that the only persons who should be allowed out of quarantine are those whose services are absolutely and urgently needed by the public, and provision is made in clause 14 for the release of such persons by the Governor- General. The provision under discussion merely makes the measure a nullity. The honorable member for Melbourne spoke of the horrible disfigurement which results from some of the diseases which are prevalent in the East, and which it is therefore desirable to keep out, merely because, if they were established in our midst, they would do much to destroy the beauty of our race. He spoke of  1,100  corpses of persons who had died from various diseases being turned into the streets of Hong Kong, and altogether showed our danger of infection from the East to be very great. </para>

                    <para>.- The object of quarantine laws is to protect the community from the dissemination of disease, it being recognised that the interest of the many must be paramount to the comfort of the few. It is said that a coach and four can be driven through any Act of Parliament. But this provision gives even more room than usual for that operation. . The quarantine officer may, or may not, be a medical man, and even the cleverest medical men make mistakes, because it is not easy to determine whether persons are suffering from certain ailments. The community must be protected from the possibility of mistakes. Surveillance may mean anything, or nothing. </para>

                        <para>- Quarantine is objectionable to travellers, because of the delays and possible discomfort caused by the detention. But all travellers know that it is one of the risks which they take. The convenience of the travelling public cannot be weighed against the health of the community. Diseases may be latent, and not noticeable on examination. That is recognised in the amendment by the provision made for surveillance. If it were certain that a person could be released without danger to the community, what occasion would there be for keeping him under surveillance? I am sure that the public will not put up with anything in the nature of favoritism in regard to quarantine. If a ship is detained because of the sickness of one or two of her passengers, the medical officer must either keep all on board in quarantine, or let all who are not sick go. If the latter course is to be taken, the Bill is unnecessary. All we should do is to provide that persons actually suffering from infectious diseases shall be detained. In a district like that which I represent, it would be impossible for a person to present himself daily at a police station, because police stations are often more than a day&#39;s journey apart. Probably most persons would prefer to stay in quarantine, where, as at Sydney, they would be fairly comfortable, rather than be compelled to present themselves to the police from day to day. At any rate, it is unwise to leave a loophole for abuse. Honorable members must know what a great scare there was in Sydney when plague was first discovered there, and we may have a similar small-pox scare if, by allowing persons out of quarantine, the disease is spread through the community. </para>

                        <para>- No medical officer would think of releasing passengers without a thorough examination, which would take a long time if there were  200  or more. I have not heard many complaints in regard to our quarantine regulations. The public recognise that it is wise to take precautions against the introduction of diseases. The honorable member for Melbourne only made the wisdom of such a course more apparent, by showing the great clanger of infection from the East. Yet he would give the quarantine officers power to turn loose a ship load of passengers who had been in contact with a diseased person. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman gave the Americans great credit for the safeguards they take, which, he said, were of advantage to us. But his remarks only emphasized the need for great care on our part. It may be that this system would for a time work very well ; that the quarantine officers would recognise the responsibility cast upon them, and would not be prepared to release any man until they  had satisfied themselves, after consultation with other experts, that he should be allowed to go free. After a time, however, a more lax state of affairs might prevail. Let us consider the preservation of the health of the people generally, and err, if at all, on the side of hardship, rather than run the risk of allowing disease to be spread broadcast. </para>

                        <para>- The Government medical officer of New South Wales says that there is no need for the exacting conditions that have hitherto prevailed. The system of quarantine, to my mind, has never been absolute. The conditions supposed to be in operation are so irksome that I believe they have been largely ignored, or that it has been tacitly conceded that they cannot be observed in their entirety. From some of the arguments that have been advanced, it would seem that the quarantine laws of the States have been more honoured in the breach than in the observance. The point is that the quarantine officers would recognise that, provided those affected by the disease were detained, nothing was to be gained by quarantining the remaining passengers on a ship upon which an outbreak of small-pox had occurred. Reasons of self-interest would cause those allowed to go free to keep a careful watch upon themselves and ascertain whether or not they were infected. </para>

                        <para>- It does not follow that the disease would be disseminated in that way. I gather that the opinion of medical men is that infection does not take place so readily as many laymen imagine. It is not when the disease is incubating, but when it has developed, that danger of infection arises. The diseases to which this provision relates already exist amongst us. If we placed in quarantine persons who were suffering from any of these diseases, or were noticeably developing any of them, we should keep them well under control. The fear of the public - which would materialize into public opinion - of the possibility of the spread of disease, would have considerable political weight. It certainly seems to me that we are justified in accepting the opinions of experts in this matter. In the United States of America only those who are affected are quarantined. </para>

                        <para>- It is admitted that England has abandoned the system because there are so many people entering and leaving that country that it is impossible to secure effective quarantine. . After all, the health of the people depends more upon an effective local system and the setting of our own house in order than upon watching assiduously those who come from abroad. Let us by all means quarantine those who are infected with disease, but we are merely bowing to the inevitable when we say it is impossible to quarantine every one who comes from an infected port or lands from an infected ship. We must content ourselves with quarantining the passengers who are suffering from any contagious disease, trusting to the law and good sense of the remainder who are allowed to land to report themselves. I do not propose, as was suggested, that they should report to a policeman. Such a proposition is ridiculous. None but qualified medical officers would be deputed to carry out that duty. </para>

                    <para>.- It would be&#39; a mistake to agree to the amendment made in clause  45  by the Senate. Under clause  14,  the Governor-General has power to exempt any person or ship from the quarantine regulations, or to allow them to leave the quarantine station. There we have Ministerial responsibility. If the Minister rnakes a mistake, he is responsible to Parliament and the country ; but if under this amendment the quarantine officer made a mistake, the Government would not be responsible. The Ministerial head of the Department could say, &#34; I know nothing about the matter. The mistake was made by one of my officers.&#34; We have given the Minister quite enough power to deal with this matter under clause  14.  This is not a party&#39; question ; we are simply seeking to do what is best in the interests of the public. It is a mistake to allow our quarantine regulations to become too. lax. If my memory serves me. rightly, we last had an outbreak of small-pox in Victoria some twelve or fourteen years ago. Two days after the arrival of a certain vessel in our port, one of the passengers was found to be suffering from small-pox. Meantime, all the other passengers had scattered over Australia. I think that at least a dozen cases of small-pox occurred, and that .one of the passengers carried the disease as far as Sydney. That shows the danger of allowing any passenger out of quarantine before the clanger -period has expired. In the case in question, the authorities collected as many of the passengers as possible, and erected tents for their accommodation on Coode Island. Half-a-dozen houses were also placer! under police surveillance, but, notwithstanding those precautions, a number of cases of small-pox occurred, and the disease spread to Sydney. &#34;That is an illustration of the danger of lax administration. We Have gone quite far enough by passing clause  14- </para>

                    (Wilmot) &#91;Sail.The only amendment to which exception can be taken is that made by the Senate in respect of clause  45.  As a layman, it seems to me that a proper regard for the preservation of the public health should induce us to reject it. By accepting it we_ should undo all that we have done in the direction of passing an effective quarantine law. Such a provision might open our doors to a serious scourge.- The words &#34;actuallysuffering,&#34; which appear in the amendment, would give the quarantine officers a very wide discretion. It is possible that where a large number of passengers on board an infected ship had to be inspected some one . who ought to be kept in quarantine might escape and spread dis ease far and wide. Clause  14  will give the officers administering the law quite enough latitude, and under it there should be no possibility of any case of real hardship. Quarantine regulations are not only irksome, but in some cases may interfere seriously with trade. Our first consideration in passing this Bill, however, is the preservation of the public health. That is all-important. Why should we jeopardize the health of the people for the convenience of a few ?

                        <para>- It seems to me that the amendment ought to be rejected. It seems to me that in order to insure absolute security to our people, we should require to obtain the services of up-to-date medical officers. We all recognise that we have hitherto, been blessed with excellent medical officers, but at the same time we cannot claim that they are by any means perfect. Under trie amendment of the&#34; Senate a medical officer would probably release from quarantine two or three persons who ought to be detained there, . and the result would be disastrous to the community. Unfortunately, Australia seems to offer exceptional facilities for the fostering of all sorts of disease, and if there is one thing to which we ought to direct our attention it is the means of securing to our people immunity from the introduction of disease from abroad. If we agree with the amendment of the Senate we shall open the door to the introduction of small -pox and other diseases from over- sea.  I shall therefore support the right honorable member for East Sydney in his opposition to the proposal. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to preface my remarks with the statement that the incubation period of small-pox is thirteen days, not three weeks, as I hurriedly interjected this afternoon, in reply to an observation by the honorable member for Parramatta. It seems to me that in connexion with a Bill of this description we cannot exercise too much caution. Various opinions have been expressed by honorable members regarding different forms of quarantine, the reasons underlying quarantine, and the results attending it. Whilst the leader of the Labour Party was speaking, I made an interjection which was intended to direct attention to the fact that different countries required to adopt different systems of quarantine. Unfortunately, my interjection was misunderstood by the honorable member for Dalley, who subsequently attempted to turn it inside out. I am at a loss to know why my interjections possess such a peculiar fascination for that honorable member, who rarely allows an opportunity to pass without taking exception to them. I. repeat that different countries require to adopt different systems of quarantine. The system which obtains in Great Britain differs from that which prevails in America. Nor can the Commonwealth expect to fashion its quarantine laws upon the lines which have been adopted by the countries of the old world, because our conditions are entirely dissimilar. For instance, we have a very sparse population, and practically a virgin country. Australia has never suffered from cholera or hydrophobia, and in that respect it differs from Continental countries. Further, we are, to a large extent, protected from the introduction of disease by our extensive seaboard, by the fact that Australia is an island, and by our remoteness from infected ports. We are so far removed from some of these ports that passengers who have contracted disease on the voyage would have recovered from the attack ere they arrived here. In Great Britain the people chiefly fear cholera, and in America small-pox. In Australia we chiefly fear small-pox, which may be introduced from eastern countries. To-day the means of transit have become so rapid that the danger of its introduction has been considerably increased. Of course, if we had perfect sanitation and perfect sanitary laws we might have very little to fear, and it might be possible to adopt the limited form of quarantine adopted in America, under which suspects are allowed to travel throughout the country, and only those persons who are . actually suffering from disease are placed in quarantine. But that system ought not to be adopted here, because for a considerable time we may reasonably hope to keep out diseases from abroad. Honorable members must recognise that if we possessed the maritime trade &#39; that is possessed by older countries it would be almost impossible to do this. If we had ships arriving daily -with numbers of immigrants on board it would be almost impossible to quarantine the whole of the passengers carried by them. But situated as we are, we should endeavour to make the provisions of our Quarantine Act as rigid as possible. The more stringent our health laws are the better for all concerned. I shall oppose the amendment of the Senate, because it would open the door to the introduction of disease. I quite agree . with the leader of the Opposition that it would be unwise on our part to allow this Bill to be altered in the way suggested by the Senate. I shall vote against the proposal, because, also, it is not right to vest such large powers .in the hands of a quarantine officer. I know that officers are supposed to be above suspicion, but we must recollect that we are all human. It appears to me that at the present time a tremendous quantity of opium is being smuggled into the Commonwealth, and that a few coloured aliens are also gaining admission.  .1  am, therefore, led to fear that the regulations in respect of these matters are not being administered as they should be. In exactly the same way I apprehend that the adoption of the amendment made by the Senate might permit of the introduction of diseases that we do not wish to see here. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that this is a very important matter in connexion with our quarantine laws. We should be very careful about how we set up a code of laws and afterwards give the officers administering them power to give effect to a different system. This Bill prescribes a system of dealing with all persons on board ships upon which there is infectious disease. It provides that every individual upon such a ship, no matter what may be his rank or station, shall be quarantined until a certain period has elapsed, when it will be safe to allow him to mix with the general public. How the honorable member for Macquarie can entertain the flippant view that he does of the danger of disease spreading amongst our people passes my comprehension. Talk about Tories! Was ever a more recklessly Conservative speech delivered than that made by the honorable member? What is the object of imprisoning all these persons because there is one case of disease on board ? It is not that we want to punish them. This is not done because we desire to expose people to inconvenience and suffering, but because the great mass of the people must be saved from the possibility of pestilences, which if introduced might destroy thousands. We desire to keep Australia free from those horrible scourges which afflict more populous communities; and, however harsh it may seem, we, in the interests of public health, are passing a law which compels every one on a ship under such circumstances to be practically imprisoned until the period of possible danger has expired. </para>

Why should it be in the power of a. medical officer to set one man free and keep forty-nine others imprisoned behind the bars of the quarantine station ? Surely we must have some regard for principle. If the safety of the public requires the forty-nine men to be imprisoned it requires that the one man also shall be imprisoned. </para>

                        <para>- Either proceeding is ridiculous. Either let every one go who is free from disease, or detain all. The present system is that not only those who have travelled on the ship, but even any from the shore who may have come aboard to greet a relative, or by any chance may have got into the quarantine area, are detained. This, as I say, is done not because we desire to interfere with the liberty of individuals, but because the public interests require the act of force and detention. The very fact that any person released under this amendment is to be under observation shows that the authorities are not sure that he will not develop disease. </para>

                        <para>- I think the amendment goes much further. I have been at the head of a Department which had the administration of quarantine; and I know the pressure that is brought to bear in efforts to secure the release of certain persons who. it may be, are connected with large business affairs, and whose presence on shore is very important. But the moment the rule is broken dissatisfaction must arise. Let us imagine for a moment the dissatisfaction caused amongst 199 passengers behind the quarantine bars if one were allowed to go. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly; I consider that if we allow even the most important person to go free while 100 others are detained, we are damaging the whole system of quarantine. Just as in a prison, no one should be allowed to go out under surveillance while others are detained. If it is necessary for the public safety to detain the man in the steerage, it is necessary to detain even the Governor-General if he be a passenger. I think that that is a sound democratic principle that ought not to turn the stomachs of my honorable friends opposite. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I confess that if I were in favour of a special clause allowing certain distinguished&#39; persons, say the Governor-General, to walk through the quarantine gate, I could not very well object to the other proposal. But the law of quarantine should absolutely refuse to distinguish between one human being and another, whatever their position. I gathered from the interjections of the honorable member for Melbourne, that he really does not disagree with the principle of treating every one alike. </para>

                <para class="block">That is the principle of the measure; and under that principle the moment a vessel reaches port, with disease on board, every person thereon is detained. If it is desired to do away with that principle, and to permit to go free all who are not actually sick, or showing symptoms of sickness, then it is a question of policy for. the House to decide. But if that be regarded as a safe course, it is a reversal of the rules of all the quarantine systems of Australia up to this day ; and instead of making quarantine more efficient it will break it down. I have before me the Consolidated Quarantine Act of New South Wales of 1897,and there is not a line under which even the greatest man that ever lived could be exempt from quarantine if he happened to be a passenger on a vessel subject to detention. I do not believe in clause 14. If it is right to keep thousands of people in quarantine, although they are well, there is no rhyme or. reason in allowing any one to leave. It is a practical breaking of the law in favour of some individual. At any rate, those who believe in some power to distinguish between one man and another ought to be satisfied with clause 14, which is as follows - </para>

                        <para>- I am indebted to the honorable member for the interjection. If, in the public interest, certain persons exposed to infection are quarantined,  why  should exceptions be made? In Holland, there are many miles of dykes, but one little leak might be sufficient to make them all useless. So the release from quarantine of one apparently healthy person might nullify the precautions of years, by sowing the seeds of an ineradicable pestilence. The word &#39; &#39; surveillance &#34; is a new one in English legislation). The person under surveillance is at liberty, and yet not at liberty. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; who has only to present himself to the authorities once a day. The fact that a penalty of  &#163;100  is provided for breach of the law shows that the provision is for application to the richer members of the community. My experience tells me that exceptions would not be made except in regard to persons of influence and standing; that unknown persons, would not be released. If, in&#62; the interests of the public health, certain persons should be kept behind prison bars for a time, those bars should not be. let down for any one. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not wish to say anything in regard to the general objections to the amendment, because they have been&#39; pretty exhaustively stated. I do not believe in it, because it seems to me dangerous. Furthermore, I do not think it \yorkable. Clauses 17 and 19 provide that when a man is allowed to land from a ship, he is released from quarantine, and no after surveillance is possible.&#34; . If there is to be no surveillance, the public will not be protected. Clause 34 provides that, when a vessel arrives at a port from a proclaimed place, or is subject to quarantine, and the quarantine officer is satisfied that there is no person on board actually suffering from disease, he may allow her to continue her voyage, and may allow persons to land. But it is expressly provided that those so allowed to land remain subject to quarantine, and must obey the regulations regarding surveillance. Under the amendment, there is no such reservation. It is not- stated that the person landing is still subject to quarantine. Therefore, unless kept subject to quarantine, he is clear of the penal provisions relating to a quarantined person. It is provided that he&#39; shall be under quarantine surveillance, and shall comply with the. regulations relating thereto; but the Bill gives no power for the making of such regulations. Clause 87 contains -a general power for making, regulations, but it implies a limitation to the matters therein set down. The Minister would find that before the  &#163;100  penalty &#34;could be levied, it must be clearly shown that the person proceeded against had broken a regulation which the Act gave the Government power to make. Otherwise, I do not think the fine could be levied. This is a weakness in the provision which; apart from questions of policy, justifies its rejection. </para>

                    <para>.- Whilst in sympathy with any relaxation of quarantine, not incompatible with the preservation of the public - health, I regard the amendment as a dangerous innovation. The honorable member for Angas has shown that the Act is not so framed as to make the provisions relating to quarantine enforceable on those released under the amendment. But, apart from that objection, which should be sufficient to prevent its acceptance, I am of opinion that it is too early for us to follow in the footsteps of other countries, where more stringent measures have been taken internally for the eradication of diseases, by making; our quarantine law less stringent. In countries, where vaccination is compulsory, the spread of small-pox from a centre of infection cannot be nearly so rapid as it might be here, where only a small percentage of the people have been vaccinated, and where the climatic conditions and the difficulties of proper medical surveillance are favorable to its rapid extension. Fortunately, however, we have hitherto&#39; been able to keep it out, and. Australia is, I believe, the only country in the world where small-pox is not endemic. Our circumstances are such-,, however, that it would be extremely dangerous to allow it, or any similar disease,, to gain a footing, and, therefore, I shall!  strongly oppose the adoption of the amendment. The Government, instead of being driven, should show its readiness to do all that is possible for the preservation of the public health. I hope that the Minister will not treat the matter lightly, for it is one which honorable members have deeply at heart, and needs most earnest consideration. If we err at all, we should err on the side of over-precaution. </para>

                    <para>. - The objections raised to the amendment apply equally to clause 14, which empowers the Governor-General to authorize the release of any person from quarantine. The Governor-General would act upon the advice of the very officer whose opinion would be asked if it were proposed to give effect to the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- A quarantined person, feeling that he had not got rid of the disease, might prefer to remain in quarantine a little longer ; but all who can be safely liberated should be set at liberty. In conversation, medical authorities of good standing have told me that the inspection which now takes place before a clean bill of health is given to a ship has greatly diminished the&#39; risk of the introduction of diseases. At all events I am satisfied that no greater danger is to be feared from the acceptance of this amendment than is likely to arise under clause 14. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Hindmarsh has pointed to a feature of the Bill that is worth considering. I do not anticipate that any improper discrimination will be made by the quarantine officers in regard to releasing persons under surveillance, Our experience in Australia is that these officers are men of some responsibility. A quarantine officer, being a medical man, knows that he incurs a very serious responsibility in releasing persons where there is a real danger of their carrying disease into the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- After all, practically all the power that we assume under. this Bill is vested in&#39; the quarantine officers. The person on whose decision rests the question of whether or not a vessel is to be quarantined is the quarantine officer. He might decide that what were regarded by the ship&#39;s officer or bv some of the general public as suspicious symptoms were not of sufficient gravity to justify the ship being ordered into quarantine, and might allow the ship to go free. If he made an error of judgment, or were not properly seized of the gravity of the situation, serious consequences might follow. The success or failure of the Quarantine Act must rest upon the shoulders of the officers. Having granted absolute power to the quarantine officers to detain a vessel or to allow her to proceed on her journey, it seems to me rather strange that we should object to give them the power of surveillance. </para>

                        <para>- The point is whether we are going to compel an officer to say that either a whole ship.&#39;s company shall go into quarantine, or that nothing shall be done. If that is the only discretion to .be vested in the quarantine officer, it may so operate as to defeat the objects of the Bill. If a quarantine officer were in doubt as to the presence of a contagious disease on board ship - and we know that a number of communicable diseases in their initial stages are very difficult to diagnose - he might allow the vessel to proceed on her way if he had not the power to place under surveillance some of those on board. Unless some power of this description is given to the officers, the object of the Bill may be largely defeated. </para>

                        <para>- And I do not say that it is not justified. Our ideas in respect of quarantine in plague cases have- expanded very much since the first outbreak in New South Wales. At first a very rigid system was enforced, but it has since been relaxed1 as being in a very large degree unnecessary. </para>

                        <para>- That depends on the nature of the disease. A certain measure of isolation may be necessary in one case, and much more may be necessary in others. It appears to me that in this instance we must trust the officers. I see no escape from that position. The whole value of the Act seems to depend upon the efficiency of the officers charged with its administration. That being so, I do not see why we should not give them this power, rather than compel them to take extreme measures, whether it might be necessary to do so or not.&#39; </para>

                        <para>- Surely I am at liberty to believe that the right honorable member would do what I should do. It must be admitted that he has built up his objection to the amendment of clause 45 on the possibility . of favoritism. He said that the provision would be much better if the recommendation for the release of a person on board a suspected ship had to pass through the hands of the Chief Medical Officer and the Department of Public Health before being submitted to the Governor-General. As an old politician, the right honorable member must know that such recommendations pass through the hands of responsible officers. If we cannot trust our officers, our quarantine law must fail. The amendment is really a restriction, rather than an extension, of the power conferred by clause 14, under which a man under suspicion may be allowed absolute freedom. </para>

                        <para>- Under the amendment proposed, he would have to report himself. He would be kept under close surveillance. The right honorable member spoke of 200 passengers being on board a vessel only one of whom might be released under a provision of this kind. Let me put a reasonable case to him - such a one as might occur. Let us suppose that upon a large ship there is one saloon passenger who has a portmanteau containing some rags which might be expected to harbour a quarantinable disease. &#39; If the quarantine officer satisfied himself that there was no ground for entertaining such a belief ought he to quarantine the whole of the steerage passengers on that ship ? The right honorable member has attempted to build up his case by urging that under the amendment made by the Senate favoritism might be exercised. It is idle to suggest that a Minister would not accept responsibility for the acts of his officers. As a matter of fact, he has to accept that responsibility in every instance. </para>

                        <para>- Does the right honorable member think that any officer would attempt to discriminate in the way that has been suggested? I say .that we &#39;should not rush to extremes in legislation of this kind ; the adoption of a middle course should always be open to us. Why should we not vest some discretion in our quarantine officers instead of laying down a hard-and-fast rule? If the man of importance can get past these officers he can also get past the Governor-General, because the latter acts upon the advice of his Ministers. </para>

If we do not accept the amendment of the Senate we shall probably delay the passing of this measure for two or three months. In view of the declaration of the honorable member for Melbourne who, upon this subject, is a specialist, I think that we might very safely agree to the amendment of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- Unfortunately, I possess some knowledge of infectious diseases and quarantine regulations, and in the light of that knowledge I say that the amendment of the Senate is a very wise one, because it refers the matter of exemption from quarantine to quarantine officers. Surely that is better than allowing it to remain under the control of the Government. We must all recognise that no matter what action a Ministry might take in connexion with quarantine arrangements, under our party system of government it would be sure to be questioned by political opponents. I think that altogether too much has been made of the suggestion that under the amendment, of the Senate one passenger by a vessel might be liberated from quarantine, whilst 199 others might be detained. We know very well that nowadays the various classes of passengers on board-ship are just as much separated from each other as are the dwellers in adjacent houses in our cities. If. a case of smallpox occurs amongst the first-class passengers on a vessel, why should those in the steerage be quarantined? </para>

                        <para>- In city life, if an outbreak of infectious disease occurs in one house of a terrace that house alone is isolated, notwithstanding that its inmates come into much closer contact with their neighbours than do the various classes of passengers on board ship. In the case of small-pox, I contend that the greatest&#39; danger lies, not in contact with the sufferer, but in the liability of one&#39;s clothing to infection. In Tasmania the first outbreak of this disease was traced to certain clothing which&#34; &#39;had been locked up in a box for some considerable time. If the passengers by any vessel upon which an outbreak of small- pox occurred had their clothing thoroughly fumigated there would be comparatively little danger of their spreading infection. I hope that the Committee will agree to the amendment of the Senate, and that the Bill will speedily become law. Only yesterday, in coming from Launceston, I heard complaints made of the existing quarantine regulations as between State and State, and of the necessity for their early alteration. I hope that we shall leave this matter of quarantine in the hands of our quarantine officers, and not in those of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- No, but it is not well to provide in a Bill of this character for the exercise of political influence in any shape or form. I recollect one occasion upon which the Mayor of Launceston was unable to visit Melbourne, because he had not been vaccinated, notwithstanding that he had suffered from small-pox, which I understand affords the sufferer greater immunity from further attack than would vaccination. According to the regulations made by the Victorian authorities, no per-, son could be admitted to the Colony unless he had been vaccinated ; and this incident, in my opinion, shows that a certain amount of discretion should be left with the responsible officer. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with those who declare,- in no uncertain language, that all classes of people should&#39; be treated alike in the administration of the quarantine law.; and I believe that the provisions of this Bill as proposed to be. amended will have that result. It is highly important, however, that some discretionary power should be given to those who will be responsible for the administration ; and, as a matter of fact, under State law, there is a discretionary power now in the hands of the quarantine -officer, who is generally a medical man. It appears to me harsh that, because of certain suspicious symptoms, all the people on a ship should be detained, when the safety of the public might be completely guaranteed by keeping the actual case and contacts under observation. That, I think, is the principle on which&#39; the various States Acts have been administered up to the present time. The right .honorable member for East Sydney this afternoon told us that under his administration of the quarantine laws of New .South Wales no exemptions were permitted ; and I unhesitatingly accept his statement that he was not aware of any exemptions. The fact remains, however, that under the New South Wales Act the Governor in. Council - which, of course, means the&#39; Government - may grant exemptions in regard to persons or goods on any ship. It may be absolutely necessary, on account of suspicious symptoms, that certain people should be detained, but it is a great hardship that others, who show no symptoms whatever, should be confined; in other words, I can conceive of circumstances where it may be desirable or necessary to detain individuals, but not to detain the whole of the passengers. </para>

When I was in Sydney in  1906  a ship arrived with a suspicious case on board. Passengers, officers, and crew were taken to the quarantine station, while the ship and cargo were fumigated, and the latter discharged at the wharf. The vessel was booked to leave in three weeks&#39; time; and the work of discharging was completed on the very day of the expiration of the quarantine period. </para>

In my opinion, a proper system of surveillance could be arranged, with due regard to the safety of the public. In the last resort, Ministers must rely on the reports of the medical officers, who have the supervision of quarantine. </para>

                    <para>.- The leader of the Opposition pointed out that there are two basic principles underlying this Bill - one the health of the people, and the other the equal treatment of the people. The question is whether the quarantine law has to be administered by an officer, who is a medical man - or ought to be a medical man- </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, I think the officer is always a medical man. The question is whether the health of the people will be better conserved by the employment of medical men, or by appeals, no doubt from the advice of medical men, to the Governor-General in Council. If a vessel be detained under quarantine, the cost is from &#163;1,500 for every twelve hours&#39;; and, as the Executive Council could not very well be called together under twenty-four hours, we readily see how soon the owners of a vessel may be called upon to meet an expenditure of some &#163;3,000. There is no reason for making trade barriers of that kind. An order by the Governor- General in Council would be based on the opinion of the Health Officer, who is sure to be a medical man. </para>

                        <para>- No Ministry would be so foolish as to appoint other than a medical man to do a medical man&#39;s work. When in Ceylon recently, I found that all arrivals from India, whether by a suspected ship or not, must report themselves regularly to the local medical officers for a certain period. This is done because plague is rampant in India, and the authorities wish to keep it out of the adjacent dependency. If Ceylon, which is much more exposed to infection than we are, finds that system efficient, I do not think that we run much risk, seeing that our ports are ten days&#39; steaming from India. As to the possibility that quarantine might be relaxed in favour of the Governor-General, or some high official, I think that nowadays the press and our friends in the Labour corner are so vigilant that a responsible official would rather release a steerage passenger. Our friends, quite rightly, are determined that no distinction of rank shall be observed in matters of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly ; and I admire honorable members for it. The objection raised is a mere bogy. A measure of this kind is badly wanted, because now at every port a different set of State regulations has to be observed. The other day, although we arrived about 8 o&#39;clock in the morning, we could not leave the steamer until mid-day, not because there was disease on board, but because of delay in clearing another steamer. Such a delay means considerable expense to a ship&#39;s owners. </para>

It likewise sought to repress monopolies by making it an offence for any person to monopolize or attempt to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce with other countries or among the States with intent to control, to the detriment of the public, the supply or price of any service, merchandise, or commodity. Further, it made it an offence for any corporation or trading or financial corporation formed within the Commonwealth to monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine in any of the ways to which I have already referred. The intention of the Parliament was that trusts which were injurious should be repressed. It was recognised that trusts and combines were beginning to grow in Australia. It was realized, also, that in other countries, notably the United States, there had been formed large trusts and combines that were operating to the detriment of the public, and that the Legislature of those countries had attempted to pass laws to deal with them. Guided by a similar feeling in Australia, we passed this legislation. Honorable members will recollect that the Bill was attacked at the time as being rather drastic ; but, when compared with the United States law, it is found to be in essence much milder. </para>

                            <para>- In our case, the &#34; intent &#39; &#39; is the essence of the offence ; whereas in the United States of America any combination in restraint of Inter-State trade is an offence. We required something more, and determined that intent should be proved. The Act has-been in operation since 1906, and it has since been our duty to administer it and to apply it to Australian conditions. During the last twelve months more particularly, the existence of a series of combines has been brought under the notice of the Department of the Attorney-General, and, after careful investigation, we have arrived at the conclusion that an amendment of the Act is necessary if we are to cope effectively with those evils. The operations of a &#34;series of combines have been most carefully investigated. The officers of the Department have made full inquiries, and have obtained as much evidence as it is possible to secure in connexion with a number of combines that are alleged to exist in Australia. But when one enters a Court of law in a matter of this kind one has to prove that a combine in restraint of trade is in existence. A combine may consist of a limited number of persons who join together for the purpose of accomplishing a certain object. The agreement to combine is absolutely within their own knowledge, but the effect of what they do may come home to every individual in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- The Crown Solicitor, after investigating concrete cases put before him, made the report from which I was reading. Upon investigation, we felt it was essential for the Administration to be equipped with wider powers than we possess under the existing Act. If honorable members look at the nature of the offences in respect of which prosecutions can be instituted, they will realize that wider powers are necessary. A . secret agreement may be made by six or seven wealthy individuals, who keep the memorandum of agreement within their own possession and control. Naturally, if we ask them for information in regard to it, they decline to give it, saying, &#34;It is our own private concern.&#34; That may be so, but their operations may affect the whole Commonwealth. They are exercising their powers to the detriment of the public, and it is because they are doing so that it is necessary for us to take action and to ask for these powers. The powers for which this Bill provides are not unknown to other countries, or even to our own law. The United States has had to deal with InterState corporations. Its Inter-state Commerce Act of 1887, which applies to all common carriers engaged in Inter-State commerce, provides that all charges for transportation must be reasonable, and prohibits pools or combinations in Inter-State traffic. Under section 20, the Inter-State Commission, appointed to secure the enforcement of the Act, is vested with very wide powers. For instance, that section enables the Commission to require all corporations who are common carriers, subject to the Act&#39;, to furnish annual reports. These show -(1) The amount of capital stock issued, the amounts paid therefor, and the manner of payment: (2) dividends paid, surplus fund, and number of shareholders ; (3) funded and floating debts, and interest paid thereon; (4) cost and value of the carriers&#39; property ; (5) number of employes, and salaries paid ; (6) amount expended on improvements during the year, and nature of improvements ; (7) earnings and receipts from each branch of business and from all sources; (8) operating and other expenses, balance of profit and loss, and a complete exhibit of the financial operations of the carrier each year. Moreover these reports must contain such information in relation to rates or regulations concerning fares or freights, or agreements, arrangements, or contracts with other common carriers, as the Commission may require. The Inter-State Commission can also require all common carriers to have a uniform system of accounts, and it is absolutely essential that these powers should be given in respect of corporations having control over the highways of trade and commerce, which are practically the lifeblood of the nation. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that the right honorable member is misapplying the remark. It is necessary that those who control the highways of trade and commerce to the detriment of the public should be dealt with, and that the Commission should have power to obtain from them the nature of their transactions, in order that the law may be enforced. If an honest agreement is made, nothing is to be feared, but if a body of men have entered into an agreement to the detriment of the public the people are entitled to know &#39; it. That is the position that the authorities of the United States of America took up. In 1.906, in the United States, an amending law was passed, giving even more extensive powers of investigation. Under the law of 1906. these reports have to be made on oath, and any failure to file them within the prescribed time, or to make specific answer to any question authorized by the section - that is any question upon which the Commission may need information - is punishable by a fine of $100 per day. </para>

                            <para>- The Inter-State Commerce Act of 1887, and the Amending Act of 1906. Under the latter Act, the Commission has access at all times to all accounts, records and memoranda to be kept by Inter-State carriers, and it is unlawful for a carrier to keep any other accounts, records or memoranda, than those prescribed or approved by the Commission. The Commission may, furthermore, employ special agents or examiners, who have authority under the order of the Commission to inspect and examine any and all accounts, records, &#38;c, kept by any carrier The penalty for refusing or failing to keep such accounts, memoranda, &#38;c, as are prescribed by the Commission, or to submit such accounts, to the inspection of the Commission, or any of its authorized agents or examiners, is $500 for each offence, and for every day of the continuance of the offence. Penalties are imposed for false entries. The Inter-State Commission Act deals only with one class of corporation - the class which is engaged in Inter-State commerce - railways and carriers. But in February, 1903, the United States. Congress passed ah Act to establish a Department of Commerce and Labour. Section 6 of this Act enacted that there should be, in this Department, a bureau to be called &#39;a Bureau pf Corporations, with an officer known as the Commissioner of Corporations at its head.  The Commissioner has power to make investigations- into the organization, conduct, and management of the business of any joint stock company, corporation, or corporate combination, engaged in InterState commerce, except common carriers, who are dealt with in the Inter-State Commerce Act. In order to accomplish these purposes, the Commissioner has, with respect to all corporations or combinations engaged in Inter-State commerce, all the powers which are conferred by the Act already alluded to upon the Inter- State Commission. So that in the United States exceedingly large powers have been conferred in regard to this particular matter. Further, the United States Government are rigorously enforcing these laws, and with success. What is the nature of the law that we propose to enact ? . The Bill is a short one, and is confined solely to the question of procedure. It does not purport to amend in any way the principle of the original Act. All that it does is to provide machinery with which it is considered necessary to arm the Executive in order that the law as expressed in the Australian Industries Preservation Act of 1906 may be successfully administered. In  the first place, it deals with the onus of proof. In this matter, we simply follow the principle which &#39; has been adopted in our Customs Act. Section 255 of that &#39; Act sets out that when an information has been laid against an individual, the onus of proof is thrown upon him with certain exceptions. We have adopted those exceptions in this Bill, and we ask the House to enact that - </para>

                            <para>- I would further point out that this power can be exercised only where a complaint has been made on oath in writing to the Comptroller-General that a person has been guilty of an offence against the Act. The Comptroller-General has also to be satisfied that the complaint is well founded. When he is so satisfied, he may go to the individual in question and say - &#34; I demand the production of your agreement,&#34; and the individual is bound to produce it, subject to penalties. Under clause  15d  of the Bill, the Comptroller-General can obtain possession of these documents and impound them. But to prevent the information thus gained from being disclosed, provision is made that the only persons to whom it may be revealed are the Attorney-General or persons authorized by him, or the Comptroller-General, or the tribunal before whom the case is being tried. I submit that these provisions are absolutely necessary for. the due enforcement of the law. They are not harsh provisions. The innocent man who is carrying on his business in accordance with the law of the land has nothing to fear from this Bill. Underlying the whole measure is a recognition of the fact that Parliament has declared that these combines shall not carry on their operations to the detriment of the public. The machinery which it provides is required to protect the interests alike of the producers and consumers. It is necessary that the Executive should be equipped with these powers in order that the law as declared in the principal Act may be successfully enforced. </para>

I think, therefore, it would be in the interests of the measure itself if the debate were adjourned so that honorable members might be afforded an opportunity of studying its provisions in the light of the provisions of the principal Act. It is impossible to deal with it in a satisfactory manner at a few moments&#39; notice, and if no other honorable member desires to speak at the present stage upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill,  I  should like to move the adjournment of the debate. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to know what has happened to prevent the carrying out of the intention clearly expressed before we adjourned in regard to the ventilating and sewering of Parliament House. We return to work to find an atmosphere just as oppressive and smellful as before, and the sewering still incomplete. Many of us object most strongly to the atmosphere of the House, and to the sanitary arrangements in particular. It has seemed to us for some time simply disgraceful that the Parliament of the Commonwealth, above all other institutions, should not have all up-to-date sanitary arrangements, as well as modern methods of&#39; ventilation. </para>

                        <para>. - The position in regard to ventilation is that the scheme is now actually being carried out, and, it is expected, will be completed in two weeks at furthest. But, of course, as a system of ventilation, it can have no effect until it is completed. As the honorable member has said, the conditions are just as we left them when we adjourned, but progress has been made during the adjournment, and the work advanced to the eve of completion. As to the sewerage, the honorable member has probably derived his information by a statement made in the press on behalf of the State Government, that they propose to alter the whole of the arrangements in the building. I believe the plans are prepared and ready, but this is a work which cannot be carried on while either House is sitting, and. as the Senate has been at work, it has not been possible to take advantage of the recent adjournment. It may take weeks, or, perhaps, months, to complete the sewerage, seeing that the work involves the penetration of these massive walls. It is, however, the intention of the State Government to carry out the sewerage work on the first occasion on which both Houses are long enough in recess. </para>

                    <para>Mr.JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta)  &#91;9.2&#93;.  - If a day should ever come, I suppose, when both Houses are not sitting ! The statement of the Prime Minister is satisfactory as far as it goes, but it seems as if we may give up all hope of ever breathing a pure atmosphere here, or having the ordinary, cleanly, sanitary arrangements common to almost every household. If we have to wait until both Houses are absolutely in recess, our prospects seem hopeless, for, apparently, we have turned on. perpetual motion, though whether that is good for the Commonwealth or not I do not stay to inquire. I advise the Prime Minister to consider very seriously whether something cannot be done, even though Parliament is sitting continuously, to make this House what it ought to be - a reasonably healthy place in which to transact the country&#39;s business. </para>

                            <para>- Anyhow, there seems to me to be an invidious distinction made in the wages. No doubt this person is quite as capable as others who receive more money for lighter work, but owing to circumstances over which he has no control he is compelled to take the lower-paid position. There seems to me to be too great a disparity in the wages paid, and I ask whether something cannot be done to remove what appears to me an invidious distinction. </para>

                        <para>. - This seems an appropriate time, in considering the item of contingencies in connexion with Parliament House, to raise a question which I think should have been raised long ago. I should like to know, first of all, whether any provision has been made on the Estimates for meeting the expenses of the Echuca re-election? </para>

                        <para>. - The matter to which the honorable, member for Parramatta refers is one that was not ripe for settlement when these Estimates were prepared a considerable time ago. It was only to-day that I received the full information, not only in reference to the Echuca election, but also the South Australian Senate election-; and a point has arisen, which I shall have to consider with the Prime Minister and my colleagues, as to how far the Government should accept responsibility for legal expenses. This is rather a difficult matter, as to pay the legal expenses might set a dangerous precedent. However, the question will be placed before  the. Cabinet at the earliest possible date. </para>

                        <para>.- It is usual for honorable members to move reductions in the votes, but in this case I suggest there should be an increase. These gardens, as &#171; the Prime Minister, who is a lover of the beautiful, will acknowledge, are an adornment to Parliament House, but I wish to point out that there is not a sufficiently large staff to keep them in proper order. We have only one foreman gardener and two assistants, and any one who has any knowledge. of gardens will recognise thai such extensive grounds as we have here cannot be properly looked after by so few men. The foreman gardener and his assistants are very hard-worked, and certainly some consideration should be given to the? matter. The service is not one which can command political influence. We ought not only to see that these buildings are kept in good repair, but also that the surroundings are kept in good order. The gardens are so beautiful that I am sorry that the public has not an opportunity to take pleasure in them. If the surrounding railings were removed, they would be one of the beauty spots of Melbourne. But, at present, probably few persons know how beautiful they are. In the past, they have occasionally been used by certain honorable members for private functions, and, therefore, there should be no objection to the citizens of the Commonwealth using them. My experience is that the general public values these opportunities for enjoyment; and that no vandalism is to be feared. I do not believe in keeping the precincts of Parliament as private as the surroundings of an oriental palace. At any rate, the gardening staff is undermanned, and I hope that the Treasurer will see that further assistance is provided. </para>

But I would remind him that they are State officers, and, moreover, that we, as mere tenants-at-will of the State Government, have not the right to remove the surrounding fences. </para>

                            <para>- I think the suggestion that the State authorities should be approached by the House Committee a good one. I have seen, in Canada, parliamentary gardens, much larger &#34;than ours, to which the public had free access, and honorable members were not spied on, nor did any outrageous conduct take place there. This reform was advocated by the honorable member for Melbourne twenty years ago. The honorable member for Dalley will be pleased to know that the fences surrounding a number of the Melbourne parks and gardens have been removed. </para>

                        <para>.- I am glad to find honorable members from other States appreciative of the advantages of removing the enclosures of public gardens. Ballarat is entitled to great credit for being the pioneer city in this movement. Melbourne has followed its example, and Sydney, though more conservative, her. City Council showing great timidity when the proposal was first made, is now proceeding to do likewise. I heartily concur in the views expressed by the honorable member for Wide Bay as to the question of removing the fences surrounding the Parliament gardens. </para>

If we determine to try to attract emigrants to Australia, we shall have to outvie Canada. If we wish to turn the flood of emigration this way, we must not be content to spend a few thousands per annum. </para>

Dalley, men of great talent and prominence, and most capable platform speakers, to draw the attention of the people of Great Britain to the possibilities of this country, with the result that for years afterwards there was a steady flow of most desirable immigrants. The Prime Minister says that he believes in this policy. The non-appointment of a High Commissioner, and the lack of information in Great Britain, have retarded immigration. </para>

By rebutting false statements, and disseminating information, he is doing good work for the State and for the Commonwealth. But we need a Commonwealth representative. When, during the discussion of the Budget, ari expenditure of  &#163;20,000  was suggested, I said that  &#163;200,000  should be spent, and I understood the Prime Minister to agree to that. It is better to spend a large sum and to get a return, than to allow small sums to trickle away without giving a return. The Prime Minister might well avail himself of this opportunity to give the Committee some further indication of his intentions in this regard. </para>

                        <para>.- This question of immigration is probably of greater importance to the Commonwealth than is even the passing of the Defence Bill or the consideration of other matters with respect to which the public mind is now exercised. It is, in short, the defence problem of Australia, and must be gone into with considerable care. I found when I was in London that the inferred promise of the Government to spend large sums on &#39; immigration in what, perhaps, might have appeared to be a careless way, had not done the Commonwealth the good that the Prime Minister thought his utterances would effect. In a number of quarters it has, I believe, excited an ambition to share in some degree in a little of the money to be provided rather than to provide us with the immigrants which we all desire. &#39; At the  present time there is in &#39;existence in England a practice of asking from shipping companies and from Government&#39;s a commission on immigrants&#39; sent out. I admit that the practice is not general ; but I do not think the Commonwealth requires &#39; immigrants on those terms. We are glad, of course, to get immigrants however we may obtain them, but the people we are anxious to see coming here are those who will arrive with a full knowledge of what they are coming to and who will consequently be best fitted to make themselves useful citizens of our young Commonwealth. We can secure them iti the first place only by endeavouring to get over the geographical disadvantage to which the honorable member for Wide Bay referred when he alluded to the advantage which Canada enjoys over Australia by reason of her proximity to Europe. I cordially agree that &#39;were Australia as happily situated, geographically, as Canada is we should by th:s time, owing to our greater natural resources, have received a greater proportion of European emigrants than has that country. </para>

                            <para>- I thought that my honorable friend would realize that I was referring to our distance from Europe. What I wish to urge upon the Prime Minister is that if he desires to overcome that difficulty by equalizing the passage money of immigrants to Canada and to Australia, he must also arrange to allow immigrants to return at the same rate. In the absence of &#39;such an arrangement the dissatisfied immigrant comes here with the suspicion that he has been trapped. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that they do it to some extent. We . want immigrants . to feel that by coming here they profit as much as does the country. If we can create such a feeling I believe that we shall get a free flow of immigrants. That, I think, is the larger side of the question of assisted immigration, and only by dealing with it in that broad way shall we find our action satisfactory. Another question in connexion &#39; with immigration is  the urgent&#39; necessity for. the appointment of some one to speak in London on behalf of the Australian people. A High Commissioner should be appointed without delay. Every time an Australian goes to London he finds more clearly defined the disadvantages under which Australia is suffering in having there no official representative. The people of Canada have there a&#39; representative who is always putting forward the best phase of Canadian enterprise and political movement. On the other hand,, the various States of Australia which very often are not altogether in complete accord :with the &#39;Commonwealth, have in London representatives who are not as anxious, perhaps, to work harmoniously in the interests of &#39;the Commonwealth as they are desirous of forwarding the interests of the particular States which they represent. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish any&#39; remarks I am making at present to be turned into an attack upon this or that officer. The point is that we need a. High Commissioner as opposed to an official. I hope that the Prime Minister will do all that he can to urge once more the establishment of this office. . The question of who shall fill it is not so important as is the creation of the office itself. It may, of course, be surrounded with great difficulties &#39; to the Prime Minister. I recognise that it is necessary to obtain, the services of the best man available, and,, whoever we appoint, we require a permanent head of the Government  Department in London - a man who, in the administration of that Department, will be able to carry out a consistent policy from year to year, irrespective of who may be the&#39; political mouthpiece in Australia. It is the appointment itself that is now most necessary to Australia. After all, it is not so much the word that&#34; is uttered as the elevation from which it is uttered that affects the public mind. Whoever occupies the position of High Commissioner of Australia .will speak from a very considerable -eminence, and one which cannot fail to attract the attention which that eminence deserves of public opinion in Great Britain. I hope that the Prime Minister will take this step to create in England a better feeling towards, and a greater confidence in, Australia, and so help to bring about a near solution, or, at all events, the beginning of a near solution of the greatest problem that confronts Australia - the populating of this empty continent. </para>

                        <para>.- Whilst one cannot but indorse the sentiment expressed in regard to the need of population, I, for one, am tired of listening to mere generalities, and of waiting for a practical proposition. Considering that Australia is a much better country than Canada, we should have no difficulty in attracting immigrants. We have not the snow that Canada has to contend with, and large areas in Australia are more easilyheld&#39;, than in Canada. That is really the reason why we have not a larger population. Our temperate climate makes it easy to hold enormous areas of  fertile land. Men have acquired large areas owing to what was at the outset a very necessary policy, and consequently our fertile lands have been alienated. If the best of Australian soil were made readily available, we should not have much need to advertise our resources in the -Old Land. When gold was discovered in Australia, and it was known that any one could obtain a miner&#39;s right to search for it, we did not have, to advertise that fact abroad. As soon as the people in the Old World learned that gold was to be found in Australia and was accessible, they came in thousands to our shores. Let the same principle be applied to our natural resources generally. Let if be known that any one who comes here and is willing to go on the soil will be encouraged by the Government to do so. Let it be known that he will be&#39; met by Government agents and assisted to secure an area of fertile land, and the people will flock to Australia. Distance will be no bar to their coming. The distance between Australia and Europe today is being reduced. The position is not what it was when America was being settled. It then took as long to cross the Atlantic as it does now to travel from England to Australia. </para>

                            <para>- And it would be no bar to the people coming here if it were known that what is better than gold - the permanent wealth of the country, of which the people can never be dispossessed as long as the land is properly cultivated - is available. No proposition for encouraging immigration will have my support unless it is accompanied by some practical proposal to settle the people on the land. We do not desire to turn them out on the land as we turn out a horse in one of our lanes in times of drought. We want it to be understood that men having proper credentials will receive financial assistance in settling on the land. What purpose will be served by establishing in London an institution to send men to Australia if, when they come here, they will have to indulge in what is little better than a gamble for a block of land ? It is idle to talk about the necessity of encouraging immigration as long as we fail to make room on the land for men when they come here, and room in the secondary industries that will then spring up. </para>

                        <para>. - I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister will take steps to provide for the establishment of a properly organized Immigration Department working throughout Great Britain. If lecturers travelled the United Kingdom, and the necessary funds were provided, we should have no difficulty in obtaining suitable immigrants. We should be able to obtain men like those who have built up Australia and made her what she is. Men of the eminence of the late William Bede Dalley and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes felt it an honour to lecture in the United Kingdom and make known the openings for enterprising immigrants to Australia. If we provide funds by which worthy men, ready to do what the people of England have always done in connexion with our colonization schemes, may leave Great Britain for Australia, we shall have no difficulty in obtaining them. The few men selected by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan</inline> and sent out to New South Wales find employment as soon as they reach their destination. Nevertheless, unemployed are still to be found in Sydney. There is a backwash in every community, and improvident men are even to be found amongst our immigrants. If we are going to nurse our immigrants and bottle-feed them, we shall not have a hardy population as worthy successors to the men who made Australia what she is. There are to be found in the Old Country tens of thousands of men of the stamp of our fathers, who do not require to be brought up on the State feeding-bottle. To talk about bringing men here only upon condition that we can supply them with land, and with money to stock it, is perfectly ridiculous. By acting in that fashion we should be merely courting failure. If a father started a youth out in the world with a large banking account, the probability is that the youth would return to his home, having wasted his substance in riotous living. So it would  be  with the immigrant. If we wish to attract immigrants, let us give them a reasonable opportunity of acquiring land upon their arrival. In New South Wales and Victoria schemes are being elaborated at the present time under which they will be able to obtain land. But those States do not intend to give immigrants the land. There are enough men here who are tumbling over each other in their efforts to obtain more land than they already possess. Those who croak about the lack of opportunity which presents itself in this connexion are the real land-grabbers of Australia. Labour bureaux should be established in our midst, &#39; through whose agency immigrants would be able to obtain employment. </para>

Those who seek to lock up our lands in the interests of the labourer who is already here are merely pandering to his acquisitiveness. The honorable member for Barrier thinks only of those who are already here, not of those who are willing to come here and contribute to our national wealth. </para>

But individuals like the honorable member for Barrier have come to Australia to damn the country which has taken them in. They came here to live upon the game. They are really leeches upon the country. They create nothing. They are merely absorbers, and they pander to the lower instincts of those who are susceptible to their influence. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has been under my observation for a number of years. The immigrants who settled South Australia were specially selected by the agents of persons who were anxious to assist in the movement for colonization. To-day that small State, in proportion to its population, is one of the richest of the group. It is marvellous to reflect how those men have succeeded, considering the conditions under which some of them labour who are settled outside Goyder&#39;s line of rainfall. </para>

If we wish to make Australia great, let us afford the men of England, who are as good in every respect as we are, and who would prove worthy successors of the pioneers who built up this country, an opportunity to settle here. If the Prime Minister will set aside a large sum of money for that purpose I shall be glad to afford him my support. A High Commissioner for the Commonwealth would prove an excellent officer in London, but the head of an Immigration Department there is also necessary, and lecturers are required to travel through Great Britain and advertise our resources. Let those who profess to have so much interest in our welfare take up the <inline font-style="italic">r&#244;le</inline> of lecturers in the Old Country for the purpose of illustrating our resources. </para>

Personally, I endeavour to make two. blades of grass grow where formerly only one grew. That is more than the honorable member can say. If the Prime Minister would only cease making long speeches upon the subject of immigration, and resolve to act, he would make a reputation worthy of himself. I am pleased to know that he declared himself upon this question when his attitude was not a popular one, and it takes a courageous man to do that. Upon this subject, honorable members upon the other side of the chamber dare not desert him. He can propose what he unquestionably believes in, and they are bound to support him. They are at liberty to leave him if they choose, and in that case members of the Opposition will be found supporting an immigration scheme. A broad-minded statesman, who has a policy which is worthy of the people whom he represents, is bound to succeed, because he demonstrates that he is a man who is fitted for the position that he fills. </para>

Without posing as an alarmist, I think that we have reached a very important stage in our history - a stage almost of stagnation so far as an increase of our population is concerned. </para>

But if we are going to increase our population at our present snail&#39;s pace, this country, instead of remaining a portion of the British Empire, will, in a few years, be handed over to the teeming millions of Asia. We have now reached a stage when it is incumbent upon us to consider our position, and to reflect whether we ought not to submit to personal sacrifices, rather than allow ourselves to drift into a state of ineptitude which will permit of Eastern nations robbing us of our heritage. I recognise that a policy of inviting here large numbers of immigrants, without being able to at once afford them employment, is one that may be open to the charge of inhumanity. The question, however, is whether there is any greater duty on the Commonwealth or States Governments to find employment for every immigrant than there is to find employment for everybody now within the Commonwealth. If we have to wait until we can provide work for every immigrant we shall not make much advance in population. I believe that the insular policy adopted by the Labour Party, no doubt conscientiously, of discouraging immigration </para>

                            <para>- I admit that that is perfectly consistent with the policy of Socialism enunciated as the main plank of the Labour Party - the policy that it is the duty of the State to find employment for every individual. Consistently with that policy, the Labour Party hold that employment must be found for all here before we invite more people to come to this country. The Prime Minister has a difficult task to fulfil in enunciating a vigorous policy of immigration without the opening up of avenues of employment. I believe, however, that if the Commonwealth Parliament shows that it really desires to carry out a broad policy of immigration, encouragement will be given to the States Governments to initiate large public works. </para>

                            <para>- I mean to say that the imposition of a land tax will merely mean the purchase of the large estates, when cut up, by the present small holders of land, and not by those of more limited means. With proper negotiation between the Federal and the States authorities, I think it might be possible to initiate an important scheme of locking the Murray, the Murrumbidgee, and the Darling. The water which now runs to waste would thus be conserved, and the dry, arid, but rich country on the banks of those rivers would give room for hundreds of thousands of people. I believe that under present circumstances the States Governments are not sure that the labour would be available if they decided to enter&#39; upon any such large public works. As a matter of fact, along the rivers I have mentioned there is land sufficient to satisfy the aspirations of a stream of immigration equal to that which has been flowing into Canada. </para>

                            <para>- The locking of the rivers would be subject to the reasonable use of the water by the States for irrigation purposes; and the locking, while facilitating navigation, would also conserve the water for irrigation. According to the estimates of the various States&#39; engineers, there ate 50,000,000 acres along the watercourses I have named that could be irrigated, and thus made quite capable, I believe, of supporting a population of 25,000,000 of people on the basis of the Egyptian Nile and Mildura settlements. </para>

                    <para>That may appear a rosy picture, but we must remember that France, a comparatively small country, supports from 18,000,000 to 20,000,000 of people on the soil. If the Federal Parliament should undertake the locking of these rivers, we shall find a solution of the land question in its 1 elation to immigration. Considering that we have reached the stage when the States Governments have not fallen in with the proposal or invitation of the Prime Minister to throw their- land open for immigration settlement, it is our duty to use other means ; and I should be very glad to support the .Government in any proposal to lock the streams. </para>

The land settlement policy can be solved in only one way, and that is by the re-purchase of the land by the States. If there be a land tax there must be an exemption, just on the same principle that the Labour Party believes in a minimum wage. We may be absolutely certain that the&#39; Labour organizations in formulating their policy would insist- </para>

                            <para>- I was going to point out that, just as there is a minimum wage, there must be an exemption in the case of a land tax. The result would be that small men would not buy up and settle on the large estates, but that they would fall into the hands of existing holders in a substantial form. I again emphasize the need for the appointment of a High Commissioner, and for a vigorous scheme of immigration. </para>

                        <para>. - If the speeches of. those&#39; who have preceded me were not comical, they would be tragical. It has been extraordinary to hear the representatives of wealth and property express the desire that our population may increase at an enormous rate of speed. They know that the larger the population the more there will be for the various places to be filled, and that when there are fifty men waiting for one-&#39;  job, down will come McGinty&#39;s wages. When men who will not vote for a land tax and the bursting up of large estates talk about the need for immigration, their desire is to have working men fighting for jobs like dogs for a bone. But, in the midst of our Christian civilization, . people are starving, and the farms one hears most of in Australia are baby farms. I am surprised to hear the honorable member for Robertson speaking about Socialism. If individualism makes people starve, Socialism will at least bury them decently. </para>

Notwithstanding all that we have heard about that and other &#34;isms,&#34; I see no difference between honorable members opposite and ourselves. We should not bring immigrants to this country until we are able to take them by the hand, as they do in Montreal and Quebec, and say, &#34; We have farms ready for you.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Then they are brought out under false pretences. Last year 1,050,000 persons emigrated to the United States of America. I remember when agents used to meet immigrants at Castle Gardens, Philadelphia, and Boston, and convey them by immigrant trains to the west, where they were placed upon 160-acre holdings, with homestead, preemption., or timber right land tenures. Let us do something like that in Australia. If the States will not impose taxation to make land available, and the electors of the Commonwealth do not show themselves sufficiently intelligent to give the Labour Party the necessary numbers, the only thing to do is to alter the Constitution, so that the Commonwealth can buy land, and resell it to immigrants. </para>

                            <para>- If the attempt is made to go out of the beaten track, the person making it is looked upon as a menace to the well-being of the country. I suggest that we should devise some system for rearing the children which now perish miserably in our midst for want of proper care. Thousands of infants are done to death because we have not the courage to build foundling asylums, as Canada has done, to preserve infant life for the benefit of the State. It is time that we got rid of false shame, and hit straight out from the shoulder. Instead of letting infants perish in baby farms, we should preserve their lives, and bring them up decently. We ought to try to change our economic conditions. I would vote  to-morrow  for expenditure upon the erection of three or four foundling asylums. Did honorable members read the reports about the Perth baby farming case the other day? They were disgraceful. </para>

                        <para>. - We have heard enough of the statement so often repeated in this House that there is no land available for settlement in Australia. I am one of those who think that there is a great deal of nonsense, and sometimes a good deal of insincerity, associated with the talk that we hear on the question of immigration. Up to the present, I have been unable to see how the Commonwealth could possibly establish any system of immigration unless, as some honorable member has said, it simply landed the people on the wharfs and left them there to shift for themselves. That would be undesirable, and it seems to me that in speaking of immigration we are talking about something that we are not prepared at present to undertake. I am not now discussing the advisableness of immigration to Australia, because I believe that thousands of people of the right class could come here and do better than they could elsewhere. The statement has repeatedly been made in this House that there is no land available in Australia, and that in order to obtain suitable areas for settlement, the Federal Government, or the States Governments, must either burst up existing estates by a land tax or by compulsory purchase. A very interesting table has been prepared by the Government Statistician, showing the area of land alienated in each of the States up </para>

                            <para>- No; because the Government of that State will not sell to one individual a block of more than 240 acres of first-class land. The honorable member for Macquarie has said that the unalienated land of the States is not available because it has been leased. The whole of the land leased here is, however, subject to resumption. The land policy of Queensland is distinctly liberal. There a man may take up 240 acres of first-class land, which be comes his own after he has resided on it for five years, and paid during that time an annual rental of1s. per acre. </para>

If their statements are correct, it is idle to talk about attracting to our shores hundreds of thousands of people to be settled on the land. The figures as to the lands leased by the Crown are as follow :  - New South Wales, 62 per cent. ; Victoria, 29 per cent. ; Queensland, 57 per cent. ; South Australia, 37 per cent. ; and Tasmania, 24 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that the &#34; stinking fish &#34; cry comes rather from those who declare that, although in some of the States practically no land has been alienated, there is really no land available for settlement. Either the unalienated land in these States is of such a quality that it offers no inducement to the people to settle upon it, or it has been so mismanaged by the authorities that the cry that there is no suitable land available is all moonshine. I differ from the majority who say that it is essential that a High Commissioner should be appointed. Up to the present nothing has been put before the Committee to show what duties the High Commissioner could actually perform. Some say it is necessary for the Commonwealth to have a High Commissioner to act as an immigration agent, but, in the next breath, they tell us that it is impossible for the Commonwealth to establish a system of immigration. I believe that it is. Then we are told that it is necessary to have in London a High Commissioner to refute the slanders on Australia that are published from time to time in the press of England. I think that articles published in the English press decrying or belauding Australia have no more effect upon the Commonwealth than have the articles which appear from time to time in our own newspapers. I believe that for the next five or ten years the duties of a High Commissioner would bp practically those of a showman, who would merely represent the Commonwealth at various functions in London. Certainly his services would be of no practical value to Australia until the States debts had been taken over by the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- They should have been taken over long ago, and I believe that they would have been had the right honorable member for Swan been permitted to carry out his scheme. I come now to one of the most important questions with which we shall have to deal during the current session - the administration of Papua. I hold that the Commonwealth, in taking over that territory, has incurred an enormous responsibility, and one which has not yet been adequately recognised. We have taken over the control of practically half-a-million natives there, and I say that our system of indenting them has been a standing disgrace to the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, 25 per cent.&#39; of the natives employed as carriers by white miners at the miserable wage of 10s. per month were dying annually., and the Commonwealth has closed its eyes to the fact. I am very glad to learn that there has been a decided diminution in the mortality rate amongst this class. </para>

                            <para>- That is no reason why the miners should employ these natives of Papua at10s. a month. In addition, the former have instituted a system of fines, so that in some cases the natives receive very little in return for their labour. Thus we, who have made such a fuss about the employment of cheap labour on the Rand, have been permitting the employment of the natives of Papua under the most disgraceful conditions. </para>

The system which obtains in Papua of allowing white miners to employ natives as carriers for10s. per month, and to rob them of their wages by means of fines, is one which is not creditable to the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>.- Of course there is no harm in an arrangement such as has been mentioned being made between the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition. At the same time, quite a number of members of the party to which I belong desire to speak upon the question of land settlement, and the  Chairman  has already ruled that when the first division has been disposed of the general debate must be regarded as closed. He will, therefore, be bound to restrict subsequent speakers to particular items. In my parliamentary experience I have observed that any attempt to restrict discussion usually leads to waste of time. I am sure that we shall not make any headway by attempting to adhere to the arrangement alleged to have been made between the Prime Minister and the  deputy  leader of the Opposition, seeing that a number of honorable members desire to speak. The question which we have been discussing is one of the most important that will be considered in connexion with the Estimates. </para>

                            <para>- The intimation which I received from the Prime Minister was conveyed to me by the honorable member for Barrier, and it occurred to me that it was a very reasonable proposal for the Prime Minister to make. In my judgment &#39;there can be no restriction applied to a debate such as that in which we are now engaged. For instance, we have not yet come to the item relating to immigration. There will be an absolutely unfettered discussion upon that item when we reach it. </para>

In the past we have frequently been misled into the belief that by sacrificing the right to speak at a certain stage we should be allowed ample opportunity later. I suppose, however, we shall have to respect the arrangement which has been entered into. I think the Minister should explain the policy of the Government on immigration and the land question. I understand, however, that the Minister is not disposed to make such an explanation&#34; although we are asked to spend a very large sum of money in this connexion. No declaration as to how the money is to be spent has been made . </para>

                        <para>.- Circumstances alter cases, and I suggest that the arrangement which has - been entered into might be altered. I am anxious that we should get on with the Estimates; but, according to the Minister, we are to have a full and open discussion at a later time, and, if that be so, we might as well have an open discussion first as last. But another reason, which must be just as urgent with the Minister, is that the leader of the Labour Party has made a firm request that there be a postponement. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the Minister can overlook the necessity of meeting the convenience of one or two members of the Labour Party.I understand now, however, that the request or suggestion by the honorable member for Wide Bay was not made very firmly. But when that request or suggestion is backed by the interjected declaration of the honorable member for Maranoa that it is time for the Government to &#34; turn it up,&#34; I do not quite see what other course the Government can take than to report progress at this item. </para>

                        <para>.-I think the Minister is making a mistake, but that, of course, is a matter for himself. I take no exception to the agreement, nor do I propose to take any notice of the remarks made by the honorable member for Wentworth. I may point out, however, that younger members of Parliament always have every facility and courtesy extended to them when they are particularly anxious &#39;to speak; and that is the reason I made the suggestion in regard to the postponement of the item. Therefore, while am always anxious to observe any arrangement that has been come to, I think the Minister might give way on the present occasion. The honorable member for Barrier informed me that the Prime Minister had consented to adjourn when a certain point in the Estimates had been reached. I do not claim any right in my position to be consulted in matters of that kind ; but when I make an appeal for others I expect my remarks to receive some consideration. In view of the arrangement arrived at, I suppose it is useless for me to protest. I should like, however, to refer to the remarks of the honorable member for Franklin - remarks which I do not think will prove gratifying to that gentleman when he reads them in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to-morrow. There may have been a high mortality amongst carriers in the mining fields of Papua, but it is absolutely wrong to charge that mortality to the act of any of the miners. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Franklin said that those miners, if in Australia, would be vigorous supporters of a White Australia and opponents of black labour. The inference from those remarks is that these miners are not only misleading, but misusing the native carriers and causing their deaths. </para>
