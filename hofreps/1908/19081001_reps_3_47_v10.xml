All members of the Forces were asked to express their opinion on the Government's proposal, and their views were duly tabulated and considered. Lt.-Col. Legge was chosen by the Minister to prepare, under Ministerial direction, a draft Bill. That Bill was then referred to a Board consisting of the Adjutant-General, the  Deputy  Assistant Adjutant-General for Instruction, Victoria, the Acting Secretary to the Department, and Lt.-Col. Legge for criticism. It was then again submitted to the Minister, and after revision by him, each member of the Board was furnished with a copy and asked for a full consideration and suggestions. The Military Board, as a Board, is not intended to suggest to Parliament the defence policy of the Commonwealth. The Board was created purely for administrative purposes, and does not deal with matters of principle. </para>

                    <para class="block">The measure was introduced last session, and has been restored to the business-paper at the stage which it had reached at the time of the prorogation. Its object is to repeal section  50  of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, No.  5,  of  1902,  and to substitute another section in lieu thereof. The Public Service Act has proved defective in some particulars, which was inevitable, seeing the variety of important questions with which it deals, and that it determines the relations between the Commonwealth and all its officers. I quite agree that it would be better if a Bill could be introduced to amend the Act generally. That, however, is far beyond the scope of a private member, and to attempt such a thing would be merely to occupy uselessly the time of the House. The Government no doubt will tell us that we should postpone dealing piecemeal with this matter, in order that we may deal with it more comprehensively later on. The one fatal objection to such a contention is that the state of the business-paper at present does not afford us any reasonable hope that such a measure would be gone on with this year, if, indeed, it might be even proceeded with next session. There is so much dissatisfaction in the Public Service regarding matters that readily admit of adjustment, and which all parties agree ought to be amended, and are capable of amendment, that unnecessary delay is inexcusable. In these circumstances no further apology for the introduction of this Bill is necessary from me. Section  50  of the principal Act relates to appeals, but honorable members will see, by referring to it, that all actions taken in relation to officers under sections  31, 46  to  49  inclusive,  65, 66,  and  73  thereof, are expressly exempted from its operation. Turning to section  46,  honorable members will find that - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Board of Inquiry is to inquire into the truth of the charges without regard to legal forms and solemnities, and under section  49  it may conduct its inquiries in private, and, having heard the evidence, may make such recommendations as may be considered necessary. A quasi-judicial tribunal is thus set up, with power to inquire into charges made, and the Act provides that it shall consist of three persons, one of whom shall be Chairman. Generally speaking those persons are selected from the Department affected, and they are called upon to make a recommendation to the Commissioner. The scope of section  50  is restricted, as I have already said, to matters other than those mentioned in sections  31, 46  to  49, 65, 66,.  and  73.  A person aggrieved may appeal, and that appeal must be made to a Board consisting of an Inspector, the Chief Officer of the Department to which " such officer " belongs, or an officer nominated by " such Chief Officer," and an employe of the service, who shall be representative of the division to which the person charged belongs. Now, under section 8, an Inspector is virtually  Deputy  to the Commissioner. If the Commissioner is indisposed he may act for him, and, in short, the Inspector in each State carries out functions with which the Commissioner is clothed, but which, by reason of circumstances, he cannot personally exercise. The duties of an Inspector, as set forth in section 8, are to inspect every Department, to examine, as far as practicable, the officers therein, with a view of ascertaining the duties of officers and the value of their services. He is also called upon to furnish, in writing to the Commissioner, a full report as to even' inspection, examination, or inquiry made by him. In other words, it is upon the report of an Inspector that the Commissioner takes action with regard to promotions and every other matter relating to individual employes which may be subsequently made a ground of appeal. Obviously, all such inspections could not be made personally by the Inspector, and they are made largely by proxy. The head of the Department and the immediate superior of the officer usually perform this work. Now a charge made against an officer is preferred by his immediate superior, or by the head of his Department, or branch, or division. It is then submitted to a Board of Inquiry, on which the Department is fully represented, the representation of the individual affected being always in the minority. An appeal from the decision of that Board goes to a tribunal, in which the Department concerned is represented by its chief, and by the Inspector who has been throughout dependent upon* reports submitted to him by the officer, whilst a representative of the division to which the person charged belongs is also a member of the tribunal. In these circumstances it cannot be said that such a tribunal is an equitable one. An appeal goes, in reality, from the decision of  an officer to that officer himself, or to his  deputy,  or to some person having similar interests with him. If we are to assume that this tribunal is in any way judicial in its functions - and I think honorable members will admit that the intention of section 50 of the Act was that its functions should be judicial or quasi-judicial - its constitution is at once condemned, because it is a well-known axiom that no man ought to be a judge in his own case. If we put it the other way round, and said that in a case where the head of a Department was charged there should be upon the Board two representatives of the employes and one representative of the heads of Departments, that would be repugnant to one's ideas of natural justice or usual custom. In section' 47 this principle is so far recognised that sub-section 2 provides - </para>

                    <para class="block">Not by the Commissioner, because the inspector is the Commissioner acting by deputy. The Act, therefore, recognises that it would not be fair to appoint a tribunal to decide a charge against an inspector which, on the face of it, would be partial, being composed of either his immediate superior, his fellow deputy inspectors, or his subordinates. It is exactly for that reason that in sub-clause 1 of clause 2 of this Bill I propose to amend section 50 so that the Board shall consist of three persons - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is a perfectly impartial tribunal. In all where two parties are represented on the tribunal, as, for instance, in the State Arbitration Court of New South Wales under the Act of 1901, each representative has almost invariably given decisions favorable to the particular parties which he represents, and the decision of the Judge has determined the matter. But if the  President  of the tribunal is also a party representative, absolute impartiality can hardly be expected. So, if we have  a  tribunal where the person giving the decision is entirely impartial, and from the nature of his appointment is totally unconnected with the parties, knowing nothing at all about them, save what is placed before him in evidence, I think the public servants will have reason to believe that they have a body to which they can appeal with confidence - which is hardly the case now. There is a smouldering fire of discontent in the service in regard to this section. It is not always material that such discontent and dissatisfaction may be ill-founded. That a Judge might give a quite impartial decision, even though personally interested, does not destroy that suspicion of his impartiality which awakes in the minds of litigants. Of course, every man knows that a Judge will decline to act though he has only the most remote interest in a case which he is asked to try. This is so well recognised that the practice has become general. The Public Service Commissioner in this and the preceding sections plays many parts. He has first to appoint a Board of Inquiry. That Board is, therefore, his creation. It submits to him its decision upon the evidence. It must, under the Act, be composed in a way suitable to the Commissioner, except that in a case where an inspector is charged the Governor-General must appoint. In all other cases the Commissioner appoints. On the Appeal Board the Commissioner is represented by his  deputy,  the inspector ; the chief of the Department is also represented, and he presumably, either by himself or by his  deputy,  also heard the case before the Board of Inquiry. In these circumstances it appears that the appeal is only a farcical arrangement, under which, in many cases, the issues are pre-judged, or, if they are not, that appearance is lent to the proceedings, which may fairly be said to give rise to suspicion in the minds of those who have to appear before the Board. The last paragraph of section  50  enacts :- </para>

                    <para class="block">I repeated that error in sub-clause  4  of clause  2  of this Bill, which I therefore propose ' to strike out, because it appears that it operates most unfairly, and is. in effect, a prohibition of appeal, because there is no way "by which intending appellants can discover whether a recommendation has been made or not. If they are to be limited in their right of appeal by some action taken by persons over whom they have no control, it is an unfair limitation. There ought to be no limitation of the right of appeal except that imposed by a reasonable time. If the appeal is not taken within a given number of days, no doubt the right should lapse, but beyond that there should be no limitation. The right of appeal is a necessary and effective safeguard, which is recognised in every country making pretensions to democratic government, and, in fact, in every country where an orderly method of adjusting civil disputes obtains. I therefore propose that the Bill should be read without sub-clause  4  of clause  2.  This proposal has been submitted to and been approved by the various public service associations throughout Australia. It introduces nothing that is new and nothing that is dangerous. At the most it proposes to substitute for the present partial tribunal under section  50,  one which has the sanction of experience. It is. similar to that which is resorted to in every civil case in the ordinary Law Courts, and which has been .approved- in industrial disputes in Courts of Arbitration. </para>

                    <para class="block">Section  49  deals with the procedure before the Board of Inquiry ; section  65  refers to cases of general incapacity ; section  66  to forfeiture of office in certain cases, such as bankruptcy and sequestration, whether voluntary or otherwise; and section  73  to the retirement of officers in consequence of age. Recommendations and reports dealing with such circumstances are not covered by section  50,  which applies to promotion, or, rather, to objections regarding pro- motion or failure to obtain classification. But the ground covered by section 50 is sufficiently extensive to be regarded as of great importance by the employes. They do not take exception to the exemption from section 50 of those offences committed under the sections I have read ; and, therefore, this Bill merely repeats in words the operative portion of section 50 except as to section 65, altering only the <inline font-style="italic">personnel,</inline> and not interfering in any way with the nature or scope of the tribunal. Both this Parliament and the State Parliament of New South Wales have created tribunals to deal with industrial disputes, on which the employer is not a judge of his own cause ; but in which a judicial and impartial individual is appointed to settle questions as to rates of wages and conditions generally. It appears to me that it would be very proper to follow that example in regard to our Public Service. From the stand-point of the Public. Service itself the Commissioner might well approve of such a suggestion, because it would relieve him entirely of that odium which must necessarily attach to any action of his against what the employes may consider their interests, when he is compelled to act on the report or recommendation of the present tribunal. Whereas if there were an impartial tribunal, which gave, in effect, the decision of a Judge, the odium would not attach. Of course, it may be urged that an ordinary private employe 'has no appeal from the decision of his employer, and that, at the worst, the public servant is not so badly off as the ordinary employe. While that is very true, there is really no analogy between the cases. A person who has been in the Public Service and is dismissed or disrated is absolutely helpless. When a man has been in the Public Service for many years, and is dismissed summarily, as he may be in any of the cases embraced by section 50, he is turned adrift in a world with which he is totally unfamiliar. If a man has become thoroughly accustomed to the methods of the Public Service, and is turned out to engage in the world's competition, he is heavily handicapped as against persons who are thoroughly at home in his new environment. Therefore, to dismiss a man from the Public Service, after he has been in it for ten or twenty years, is most serious; and, such a reflection as must result ought not to be cast on anybody's character by a tribunal which, in its nature, is partial. It is for this, amongst other reasons, that I ask the House to accept this measure. I admit, as I said at the outset, that there are many provisions in the Act which require earnest attention ; but these are so numerous that it were idle for any man to attempt to deal with them. all. This section goes to the very root of the matter, and, in any case, it would have to be amended. It is a section which can be amended without in any way affecting the scope or operations of the Act, lending itself with peculiar facility to separate treatment. For that reason I have thought it desirable to ask the House to deal with the question now; and I trust that honorable members will give me an opportunity of arriving at a decision within a reasonable time. It is quite obvious that within the time allotted to private members' business, it is almost impossible to achieve anything like finality, if the Government or a considerable number of honorable members are determined to frustrate the attempt. This is in no sense a party measure, and it will, I hope, commend itself to honorable members. I trust that the Government will facilitate its passing, and that, if a division cannot be come to this afternoon, Ministers will give an early opportunity to press the matter to an issue during the time allotted to Government business, as otherwise its chance of becoming law this session must be remote. </para>

The interpretation which he  put  on the sections of the Act to which he referred was calculated to confuse honorable members, if it did not confuse him, and I shall therefore endeavour, first, to state the actual position of matters . under the Act. A Board of Appeal is constituted of a Public Service Inspector, an officer, who is, so to speak, not in the Service, but over it, and consequently unbiased and impartial </para>

The other members of a Board of Appeal are an officer of the Department to which the appellant belongs, and an officer elected by the appellant and his fellows in his particular subdivision. The Public Service Inspector represents the Commissioner and the public, while the other two officers represent respectively the branch to which the appellant belongs, and the appellant himself and his fellow officers. </para>

                            <para>- That officer might have risen, by a series of promotions, to a position which would make him a nominee member of an Appeal Board, but such a case must be a very rare one. The Bill is framed to alter the constitution of these Boards, by substituting for the Public Service Inspector a Judge or Stipendiary Magistrate, and allowing the appellant to appear personally, or be represented by counsel. Of course, if an appellant chose to be represented by counsel, the Commissioner would have to consider whether the public should not be similarly represented. The reports of the Boards now go to the Public Service Commissioner, but it is proposed that they should be transmitted direct to the Governor-General, and that the determinations therein contained shall be final. Furthermore, certain matters which cannot now be the subject of an appeal may become so under the Bill. Under section 65, officers who are permanently disabled have no right of appeal ; but the Bill gives them such rights. A short time ago an officer, whose mental incapacity was certified to by a board of medical officers, desired to lodge an appeal against his removal from the Service, and under the Bill there would be a right of appeal in such a case. </para>

                            <para>- Precisely ; but 1 desire to prevent the confusion of Boards of Inquiry with Boards of Appeal. An officer who has been before a Board of Inquiry has no right to go before a Board of Appeal. The duties of a Board of Appeal are to estimate the value of the work which is being done, or to be done, and to gauge the relative merits of the officers connected with it, both those who are appealing and those "who may be affected by the appeal. The value of the work is determined after a very exhaustive analysis by competent officers, who make inquiry into, amongst other things, its character, the conditions under which it is performed, the degree of education and intelligence required for its proper performance, the scientific or technical training necessary, and the mental or physical strain imposed upon those carrying it out. The Appeal Boards are purely administrative, being governed by principles underlying classification rather than by strictly legal points. </para>

                            <para>- That is done at the present time, and with this advantage : that legal forms and methods are avoided, and much time saved. The honorable member wishes to import more of the judicial element into the Boards of Appeal, and my contention is that the result would be to create more injustice than is done at present - admitting, for the sake of argument, that injustice sometimes occurs now. The Boards of Appeal inquire into the merits of each case ; but these are necessarily relative. It is not because an officer makes a claim that he must be given the position to which he aspires. Those who hear his appeal must inquire into the merits of other officers who may be affected, and must determine how the service generally will be concerned by a decision in his favour, or <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline></para>

                            <para>- I did not say that these officers would be biased ; I merely said that they might be. As a matter of fact, I have already indicated that Appeal Boards under the Act have been fairly conducted, and I am simply pointing out that since members of the Appeal Board might possibly be prejudiced, it is wise to leave to the Commissioner the final decision in these cases. It is wise in the first place to do so, because, in the event of any member of the Board being biased, the Commissioner would veto the decision, and secondly, because, as the representative of the whole service, he would exercise his power of veto, if he exercised it at all, in conformity with the general principles of the Act, without bias, and with some degree of uniformity. As to the Public Service Inspector himself, I wish to emphasize the point that he cannot be very well charged with that partiality with which the honorable member for West Sydney has sought to surround him. He has to make himself familiar with the work of the officers, and in some cases, no doubt, knows more about it than do the heads of the Departments. He has to visit the Departments, not only to see that the work of the service is being properly carried on, but to personally examine the work of individual officers and all that they do. </para>

The Board of Appeal, under section 5 of the New Zealand Act, is constituted to deal with appeals on classification, status, and salary, and consists of the Commissioner of Taxes, the Superintendent of the Postal Department, and two official representatives elected respectively by the officers of the postal branch and the officers of the telegraph branch of the Department. That Board has to report in each case to the Minister. </para>

                            <para>- No; the Commissioner of Taxes is the presiding officer, and the Board reports to the Minister, whose decision is final. The provisions of the New Zealand Act with respect to appeals are not so liberal as are those of the Commonwealth Act. When the honorable member interrupted me, I was about to point out that the honorable member tor West Sydney, appears to be under the impression that his proposal provides for the appointment of an impartial tribunal, and is really an excellent one. May I say that the proposal that a State officer shall sit on a Commonwealth Board of Appeal is entirely new. </para>

                            <para>- I shall reply to that point. The honorable member's proposal is practically to take out of Commonwealth control officers of the Commonwealth service, and to place them, so tar as appeals are concerned, in the hands of a State official. In my judgment, that is an unwise proposition. " A State Judge, stipendiary magistrate, or special magistrate could not be expected to have a full knowledge of the classification, or of the principles governing the classification of the Commonwealth Public Service, and his knowledge of the administration of the Act would not even be that of an officer of the Commonwealth working under it from day to day. He could have no knowledge of the general principles that had guided the Commissioner and his inspectors, in arriving at a decision. As  Chairman  of the Appeal Board, he would have to depend absolutely upon such information as he could glean from outside sources, since he would have none at his own disposal. </para>

The whole procedure, in short,  is  to be free from legal technicalities, and the importation of trained legal minds into the inquiry would introduce that which  the  Act says shall be avoided. A Judge or magistrate would necessarily rely on <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> evidence, and that would tend to create anomalies. How could any honorable member - no matter how familiar he might be with the Public Service Act, with the regulations made under that Act, and with the grievances of the public servants - say what was going to be the effect of a decision given for or against an appellant upon all the other members of the  class to which  the appellant belonged ? The only men who could foresee what would be the result would be the Public Service Commissioner and his officers. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that there is any striking parallel between the position of a Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and that of an Appeal Board of the kind under review. As I have said, these Appeal Boards are not legal tribunals. Their decisions are influenced by the value of the work that is done by the appellant, by a regard for the varying classes of work appertaining to his division, by the principles governing the Act, and by the effect of the decision on non-appellants. What would happen if in five or six States similar appeals were lodged and varying decisions given? We might then have six different Appeal Boards in six different States giving decisions providing for six different and differing rates of pay and status in respect of officers doing precisely the same work under similar conditions. </para>

                            <para>- The result would probably astonish honorable members if I gave the figures. I will deal with that later. My argument was that whereas now we have One Commissioner who acts as the one authority for the Commonwealth service* - which is also one - and consequently gives one kind of decision on a uniform basis, under the honorable member's proposal we might have six different decisions, and so set up six different sets of circumstances in' the several States. That could not possibly be right, and the honorable member must admit that it would never answer. </para>

                            <para>- I am  sorry  I cannot drive the case as I see it into the  honorable member's- intelligence, but I think I have made it fairly clear to other honorable members that there is the possibility of so many different decisions, and that that would be worse than the present situation, however bad that may be. The chances are that with so many tribunals, there would be an enormous increase in the number of appeals, and especially of frivolous appeals. Many officers would take advantage of the new tribunal to try their luck, so to speak, more especially as the honorable member does not propose that a non-successful appellant shall pay at least the cost of conducting his appeal. </para>

                            <para>- Personally I should have no objection to making it cut both ways. A Judge or stipendiary magistrate, as proposed in the honorable member's Bill, being a State officer, the State would necessarily have the first claim on his services. There would consequently be much more delay -than at present. The present system is cumbersome enough, and proper promotions are bound to be delayed by reason of appeals; but if there is to be still further delay, hundreds of officers may have their just promotions held back, increments denied to them, and status withheld from them, pending decisions to be given by a State officer, who is too busy to deal with the cases, because State work claims him in priority to Commonwealth work. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member, I am afraid, has not heard the general allegations concerning the Public Service, or he would know that every employe, from the office boy up to the top of the service, has some grievance which he wants remedied. All those are disabilities which render it impossible to accept the honorable member's proposal with any degree of safety. It would render the conditions under the Act perfectly chaotic, and cause greater injustices to officers, however great the injustices now existing may be. The  chairman  of the Board proposed by the honorable member may change, for he does not propose any one Judge or magistrate as a permanent  chairman,  and so we might not only have a different decision in each of the six States, but we might have six or seven different decisions in each State, by reason of the fact that six or seven different Judges or stipendiary magistrates had been acting. </para>

                            <para>- It is obviously impossible for the Commissioner to hear every appeal. The only possible course, therefore, is to have an Appeal Board of some sort. Those Boards are at present constituted with a gentleman upon them representing as nearly as can be the Public Service Commissioner, namely, the Public Service Inspector. If it had been possible, it would be desirable for the Commissioner, to hear every case, but as it is not, we have to get- the nearest approach to him in the inspector. If, however, we are to have some one further removed from the gentleman who administers the Act and his officers, it will mean setting up all sorts of conditions which will make confusion worse confounded, and chaos as certain as that the sun will rise to-morrow. </para>

                            <para>- The members of the Board may differ each time because the appellant may be in a different grade each time, and, consequently, the divisional representative would be a different man, while, if the appellant is in a different Department, the head of the Department would be a different man. But neither the inspector nor the Commissioner changes, and that gives an element of con.tinuity and uniformity which is absolutely impossible under the honorable member's proposal. </para>

                            <para>- A Judge or stipendiary magistrate could have no possible appreciation of the effect of his decisions upon discipline - which is a serious matter in a huge service like ours - or of the financial results which would follow from a decision that was out of conformity with the general principles of the Act, or with the classification under the Act. Those are all points to which I ask honorable members to give most serious attention. Whilst I am prepared, having some knowledge of the Act, to admit that the present method of appeal is cumbersome, and, perhaps, not altogether satisfactory, I warn honorable members that the system proposed in this Bill will be absolutely unsatisfactory, and will lead to chaos, and possibly to financial disaster. Any one of these varying decisions might lead to the payment of huge sums of money throughout the Commonwealth. I therefore ask honorable members to be very careful indeed before adopting this proposed method of altering the constitution of the Appeal Board. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid the honorable member does not understand his own Bill. To make my argument clearer, I will take two or three illustrations, of what might occur under the honorable member's proposal. They are not strained in any way, but are such cases as occur every day. Let us' suppose that a vacancy occurred for a fourth-class clerk on one of the central staffs - a position to which any officer having the right qualifications might aspire. Under existing conditions, that position would be advertised. Applications would be returnable in, say, three weeks from the first notification, and at the expiration of that time it might be found that seventy or eighty persons had applied. The merits of each of them would, under existing conditions, be considered by the proper authorities. The Commissioner would recommend one of them - let us call him A - for the post, and he would be appointed. He might be an officer from Queensland. That would be the present course. The Commissioner having made his recommendation, the officer would be appointed, and take up his duties, and there would be no more about it. But under the honorable member's proposal, the Commissioner would have to gazette a notice of intention to appoint the man. Thirty days would have to be allowed, during which time any non-successful applicant, or any other who chose, might appeal against the recommendation and the proposed appointment of the officer selected by the Commissioner. </para>

                            <para>- It would be worse under this Bill. Let us suppose, for the sake of argument - though it is quite a possible case - that forty-five of the men who were unsuccessful were senior to A, and that thirty of these decided to appeal. Let us further suppose - this may be stretching a point, but, for the sake of argument, it i,s fair - that) five of the gentlemen were situated in each of the States; either in or about the metropolis, or possibly in some remote district. Each one of these officers would require to have his appeal determined as if it were A against B, A against C, and so on through the whole alphabet, and more. "A" would thus have to stand the racket of a constant round of appeals in the whole of the States, and although he succeeded in, say, twenty, he might finally be upset by a magistrate on the Board in the twenty-first case. </para>

Do honorable members think that in consequence of the successful appeal the twenty-first applicant would get the position? Not at all. All the others who had been unsuccessful would have the right to come in and have a shot at him ; and so it would go on until we should have a roaring farce, to which there would be no end, and at which the public laughter would never cease. </para>

                            <para>- But all the evidence in the appeal has to come before the Commissioner, and he, at least, can have no bias. Let us now take a case, which is of daily occurrence, arising out of the granting of a subdivisional increment. That is hardly promotion in the ordinary sense, but, as seniority is determined by salary, obviously the granting of a subdivisional increment may mean the promotion of some officers over other officers. There might be a recommendation to grant 500 officers a subdivisional increment, while a similar recommendation was not made in the case of 300 other officers. If the right of appeal were carried to the farcical extent proposed by the Bill, the 300 who felt aggrieved might give rise to 110 fewer than 150,000 appeals. Of course, such an occurrence is hardly probable, but it is quite possible. </para>

                            <para>- No ; because the Public Service Commissioner, having made an appointment, simply puts his man in, and they will not appeal when they have to deal with two unbiased men, and face a full inquiry by those who know all the circumstances. On the other hand, under the Bill, they could easily make a sporting appeal when the  Chairman  of the Board was one who knew nothing 'of the circumstances, and might give a decision in their favour. The same remarks apply to the telegraphists, whose position is, perhaps, the most complicated of all from an appeal point of view ; but I shall not labour those instances further. </para>

                            <para>- I have shown that 300 could give rise to 150,000 appeals; and' the position would become ridiculous. I admit at once that the present method of appeal is cumbersome and costly, and, perhaps, not altogether effective ; but I contend that the position under the Bill would be infinitely worse, leading, as it would, to much more- confusion and to financial trouble the end of which we cannot see. I ask honorable members to be very careful before they accept this measure. Let me say one thing more, though it is not perhaps in line with my arguments. Inasmuch as there are by far the largest number of public servants in the Post and Telegraph Department I remind honorable members that there is now a Postal Commission in existence, which is carefully and conscientiously about to investigate the grievances suffered from the present Appeal Boards or any other cause. </para>

                            <para>- I can tell the honorable member that there are some thirty-four associations of postal employes alone, and every one of these desires to have two, at least, and, in some cases, more witnesses heard in evidence. In consequence there will be an immense mass of testimony accumulated, and surely the case  of the employes will be properly stated. The very men who are said by the honorable member to have approved of this Bill, will, when they realize what it means, scuttle away like rats from a sinking ship. </para>

                            <para>- We know nothing at present, but we hope to know all before we are done. For two reasons, therefore, there is every justification, not, perhaps, for discharging the Bill, but for postponing it. The arguments I have adduced are sufficiently strong to show that the honorable member is proposing to set up a Board of Appeal which will not effect his purpose, and which will make the conditions worse than at present; and, in view of the fact that all these associations to which I have referred have already intimated that they intend to ventilate their grievances, I submit that, until they have been heard, it is only fair and equitable that this measure should be delayed. The Postal Commission presents an opportunity to have the case clearly, fairly, and impartially stated, and a report presented which will have the merit of careful consideration by men who desire to do the right thing by those who at present say they are not properly treated. </para>

Therefore, the honorable member will be well advised not to press the Bill to a division, but to consider the arguments against it. If he can substitute a better proposition, or can advise the Government of a better constitution for Boards of Appeal than the present one, or that contained in the Bill, every consideration will be given to it. The constitution proposed in the Bill, however, cannot be accepted, because of its unwieldiness, and because it will promote grave injustice to the Public Service. </para>

                        <para>. - If honorable members had any doubt as to the need for a new constitution for the Public Service Appeal Boards, it must have been dispelled by the Minister's speech, which showed that appellants have no hope of obtaining justice from the present tribunals, except when the findings of those tribunals are acceptable to the Public Service 'Commissioner. Should the finding of an appeal Board not be acceptable to the Public Service Commissioner, that officer will veto it for the sake of uniformity. I do not know that the proposal of the honorable member for West Sydney is the best that could be put forward, but he has certainly proposed an improvement upon the present system, and I am convinced that it is necessary to make a change. The Minister asked him to give the matter further consideration ; but I suggest that Parliament might well pass the Bill, and give the proposed system a trial, since the Postal Commission will have an opportunity to report upon it before concluding its labours. The honorable member for West Sydney proposes three very important departures from the present law. In the first place, he wishes to substitute in the constitution of Appeal Boards a Judge or stipendiary magistrate for a Public Service Inspector. I think that some other person should fill the position now occupied by Public Service Inspectors on Appeal Boards. At present there is only an appeal from  Caesar's  understudy to Caesar himself. I do not say that any one of the Public Service Inspectors is biased, but there must always be suspicion where the officer who makes a charge is himself the judge in appeals against his finding. If the proposal in the Bill does nothing more than dispel that suspicion, and the irritation which it is creating in the Public Service, it will do a great deal. One of the Minister's objections to a Judge or a stipendiary magistrate is that these officials are under State control, but, as under the Arbitration Act we empowered a Justice of the High Court to delegate any or all of his powers to a stipendiary magistrate or to a Judge of a Supreme Court, I see no objection to employing Judges or stipendiary magistrates for the hearing of Public Service appeals. The most important departure proposed in the Bill is the taking away from the Public Service Commissioner of the power of veto, by making the finding of the Appeal Boards final. The Governor-General is to come to a decision, not on the determination of the Public Service Commissioner, or of his understudy, but on that of an impartial tribunal. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. I refuse to believe that our public servants will make frivolous appeals. At the present time, however, it is felt that officers suffering under a real grievance may not get justice. The Minister has informed the House that a Public Service Inspector is thoroughly acquainted with the career of every officer in the State which he inspects. Now, it is possible that he may have a black mark against the name of some of those officers, and should one of them commit an offence, there would be a natural prejudice in his mind against him. An appellant may therefore, on coming before the Appeal Board, of which the Public Service Inspector is a member, be in the position in which an accused person would be if he came before a Court and was faced with the record of his past convictions. An officer may have been guilty of some trivial offence or neglect of duty, the knowledge of which may influence the Public Service Inspector should be appeal on any other matter. The position would be altogether different if the appellant came before a stipendiary magistrate. I agree with the honorable member for West Sydney that the Public Service Commissioner should be pleased to support any proposal for relieving him of part of his present onerous duties. </para>

                            <para>- A Public Service Inspector is governed by instructions from the Public Service Commissioner, and knows that uniformity must be insisted upon. Consequently, he is prejudiced from the first. He would say to himself, " If the Board comes to a certain finding, it will not please the Commissioner, because it will be opposed to uniformity." Consequently, the inspector is prejudiced in a way in which a magistrate would not be prejudiced. Under the present system an appellant has the Public Service Inspector and the Commissioner against him. </para>

Therefore, I am prepared to give the proposal of the honorable member for West Sydney a trial.  His  system could not be worse than the present one, and, I am sure, would give greater satisfaction to the service. This is not the first time that the  constitution of Appeal Boards has been discussed. The question has constantly arisen in the States Parliaments, the difficulty being to prevent the appointment of Boards which must be one-sided. The Minister cannot say that the present Board is not one-sided. </para>

                            <para>- That does not affect what I am saying. It is our duty to see that every employe obtains justice. If the head of a Department wishes to promote a friend who is under him, he can suggest his promotion, which the Public Service Inspector will ratify, and the Public Service Commissioner agree to, and no appellant would have much chance of getting the position. In nearly every case the Commissioner must indorse, without inquiry, the recommendations of the Inspectors ; he has not the time to make inquiries. The proposal of the honorable member for West Sydney, that an appellant may be represented by counsel, not necessarily a lawyer, is a wise one. Very competent officers may be nervous when before a Board, or unfitted to cross-examine, and, consequently, unable to bring out the facts of their case. They ought to be brought out by an officer who has made himself thoroughly acquainted with them, and is able to place them clearly before the Board. As the time allotted to the consideration of Orders of the Day, general business, has almost expired, I desire leave to continue my remarks on a future occasion. </para>

                    <para>.- I have to apologize to the honorable member for Wentworth for the somewhat abrupt way in which I interfered yesterday to obtain what I regarded as an important amendment of his motion. I have had somewhat the same difficulties in connexion with my own electorate as he appears to have experienced in his, and I think that the return would be far more useful if it were so expanded as to embrace the suburbs of each State capital. </para>

The practical difficulty is that, unless there be embodied in this measure some requirement that the elections for the Senate shall be conducted under either the Hare system or a modification of it, the effect will be to place the whole representation of the Senate in each State in the hands of the majority of the voters going to the poll on any particular day. </para>

                    <para>I think, however, that it would allay the apprehensions which have been awakened by this proposal for a single electorate which has been laid before us in its naked form, "that is, without any requirement for the representation of minorities, if the skilful members of the Drafting Committee could propose an amendment requiring that, while the senators should be elected by each State as one electorate, some provision should be made for the representation of minorities. What we desire is the representation, not merely of the metropolis and of the country towns of each State, but of the agricultural and pastoral interests, which are the backbone of Australia. </para>

                <para>I also spoke, offering a general opposition to the proposal that each State should he polled as one electorate, as I was in favour of some division of the States for the election of senators. I may say at once that I do not submit this motion in the interests of any particular section of the community. If it is thought to be opposed to the interests of any section, that section may naturally be expected to oppose it. I am of opinion, however that it will deal fairly with all, and that if the present system advantages any particular part of the community, it is unfair. I hope that I  shall be acquitted of a desire to attack any party. The party which some might think I should be disposed to attack suffers, in my opinion, as much from the present system as does any other. In my own State that is not the position, but I am dealing with this question in the interests, not of one, but of all of the States. The interests of the Labour Party are quite as adversely affected by the present provision of one electorate for each State, as are those ot any other section of the Parliament, and if my proposal is thought to be opposed to the interests of any party, then I cannot expect to receive any support for it, since no one is desirous of injuring himself or his party. In the Convention of 1891, which met in Sydney, a proposal that the members of the Senate should be elected by the local Parliament in the same way as are the senator's of the United States, was carried by thirty-four votes to six.. But in 1897-8 a great change came over the feelings of the representatives of the States. The system of election by the people, which finds a place in the Constitution at the present time, was adopted, if not unanimously, at any rate -by a large majority. It will be noticed, however, that the Convention decided that the mode of. election of members of the Senate as regards the electorates should not be fixed in the Constitution, but should be left to this Parliament. There was so much difference of opinion at the time in the Convention that a compromise was arrived at by which the Federal Parliament should have the absolute power of legislating as to the electorates for senators, but, if no arrangement was made by this Parliament, each State was to become one electorate. Consequently, we have power by means of an ordinary Act of Parliament to divide the States into electorates if we choose. I mention this because some people think that to divide the States into electorates would mean an amendment of the Constitution. It means nothing of the kind. We have tried the one electorate system for two elections, and I admit at once that that is not a long experience. I hardly think it fair to count the first election. We had then hardly got into working order. At least, that was the case in my own State, and it was probably so in the other States also. At any rate, I do not wish to base too much of my argument on what happened at the first election, but the second was deliberately arranged, and the results show that the system of having one electorate for the whole of a State is not working satisfactorily. There can be no doubt that with such an immense electorate, it is impossible for candidates to visit the whole of their electors in any one of tha States. It would take too long altogether. If they travelled all the year round, I do not think candidates for the Senate could visit all the places in Western. Australia, and, therefore, people have to vote for candidates whom they do not know, and' of whom, in some cases, they have never heard by name before hearing of them as candidates for the Senate. This matter was brought before the House on 30th- July, 1902, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Skene,</inline> the then honorable member for Grampians. He said' in his speech, that since the last Senate election, he had made an analysis of the town and country votes, and found that the same men would have been returned for Victoria if there had not been a single country vote polled. It is not a very satisfactory state of affairs that the Melbourne votes should decide the election of senators for Victoria. Referring to the same subject, the present honorable member for South Sydney, who was then the honorable member for Bland, made some very interesting observations. He said - and, in my opinion, this is an absolute fact - that - </para>

                    <para>Though it is an admirable theory that the States should be represented by men returned1 by the whole of the electors, it is one which does not work out in practice. . . . The condition of one electorate results in a newspaper-made Senate or in a machinemadeSenate. </para>

                <para class="block">That is a strong observation, coming from the then leader of the Labour Party. It means that senators are elected on a ticket by some organization. It is interesting to notice who voted for the motion of the honorable member for Grampians in 1902, while I was absent in London. It was not exactly the same motion as I move today, but it is the same in principle - the division of the State into electorates. Those who supported the motion then were Messrs. Isaacs, McLean, Salmon, Brown, McColl, McDonald, Spence, Watson, McCay, Watkins, Crouch, W. Cooke, Manifold. Sawers, and Bamford. That division list shows that the motion was not made a party question, and I hope that my motion, when it is voted upon, will not be. All the parties were represented in support of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Skene's</inline> proposal. </para>

Those men had never been heard of previously, and yet they became senators in the Commonwealth Parliament.

Western Australia seems to be admirably adapted in a way for the adoption of the proposal, because the natural divisions are metropolitan, rural, and mining. In Tasmania, I suppose the divisions would be Hobart, Central, and Northern. The result would be that each State would have its representation of three distinct parts, and the varied industries would have their interests voiced. The metropolitan districts would not, by virtue of the concentration of population within a very limited area, have the control over the elections that they have at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that ' the honorable member is correct, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Skene,</inline> who was the member for the Grampians in this House in  1902,  said that if there had been no voting elsewhere except in Melbourne, the result of the election would have been the same. The fact that the Free-trade Party, the Labour Party, or any other party have gained an advantage here or there, should not be our guide in dealing with a question which affects the whole of the continent. For instance, in New South Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania, the Labour Party lost all the Senate seats at the last election, whereas in Western Australia that same party gained the whole of the Senate seats-; and it does not seem- to be right that the Labour Party should lose the whole of the seats in three States, and gain the whole of the seats in another. In Western Australia the Labour Party were victorious, but I do not think any disinterested person could consider the result satisfactory from a national point of view. In that part of the State, where  200,000  people lived, there was a majority of several thousands against the Labour Party, whereas in the part where  70,000  people lived there was a larger majority in their favour. </para>

                        <para>- It is a question that was thought worth discussing at the Federal Conventions of  1897  and  1898,  and it was a good deal discussed in this Parliament in  1902.  I make no apology for bringing this matter before honorable members, because it is one which affects every individual and party here. We have the fact that three of the States at the last election returned a large number of Labour members to this House, and did not succeed in returning one representative to' the Senate. New South Wales returned eleven Labour members to the House of Representatives, and not one to the Senate, and I ask whether this is an equitable and reasonable state of affairs? The fact is that, under the present system, a party must either win all or lose all. - </para>

                        <para>- If proportional representation, or any other method will bring about the result at which I aim, I shall be quite content to adopt it. But the fact that the large State of New South Wales, which returns eleven Labour representatives, or nearly half of its whole representation in the House of Representatives, has not a Labour representative in the Senate, shows that there is something wrong. In the case of Western Australia the representation in this House of interests other than those of the Labour Party is two-fifths, or two out of five members; but those interests nave no representation in the Senate. That, in my opinion, is not equitable, and I should take the same view whether I were affected or not ; I hope I am just and honest-minded enough to urge that here there is something that requires to be rectified. The framers of the Constitution saw the difficulty and left it to the Federal Pailiament' to decide. There were one or two, including <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, who, in  1891,  were in favour of the State Legislatures electing the senators. In  1898,  however, at the Melbourne Convention, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton strongly advocated, and was anxious to have placed within the Constitution, a provision to provide for the one electorate system ; but that idea was not carried out, and, as I say, it was left to this Parliament to decide the question. In my opinion, the idea of a single electorate for the whole State is founded on a fanciful ideal, and not on practical knowledge or on a business basis. As the honorable member for South Sydney so accurately said in 1902, " It is an admirable theory which does not work out in practice." My opinion is that if the present system is continued it will result in the future as it has generally resulted in the past - whichever party gains one seat will gain all. </para>

                        <para>- There may have been some special reason for that ; but, at any rate, what I have stated is the tendency, seeing that in four out of the six States parties either won or lost all- - there was no middle course. No one can say that the present system results in the fair representation of interests in the Senate. Is New South Wales, which returns eleven members to the Labour Party in this House, not entitled to any Labour representation in the Senate? In the case of Tasmania, only one Labour member is returned to this House, but that State does not return a single Labour representative to the Senate. All these facts show that there is something fundamentally wrong. Owing to the immense size of the electorates the electors do not have a chance of knowing anything about the candidates for whom they are asked to vote ; and I have known men in my own State who are senators whose names were practically unknown before they were elected. </para>

                        <para>- I do not desire to say that one party is in a better position than another in this regard, but merely to place a fact before the House. Candidates cannot possibly travel over the large electorates, they must depend on others for their advocacy. I believe that the system I have advocated will give greater-satisfaction and be fairer" to the States than the present system. There will always be cliques, unions, and  societies, but it would be desirable to localize- them somewhat, and not allow them to so strongly influence elections. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but only three would be elected at one time, except in the case of a general election of the Senate. I do not desire to unduly labour the matter, .and I think I have said enough to show that the present system is in-inequitable and unfair to the. electors seeing that minorities have no representation over the vast area of Australia. They may be represented largely in the House of Representatives, and yet be without representation in the Senate. This difficulty was foreseen - by the Prime Minister among others. I hope, therefore, that the motion will be carried, or that the Ministry, in the interests, not of any party, but of the good government of Australia, will take action to alter the present inequitable and unhealthy state of affairs. </para>

                        <para>- I asked leave last night to continue my speech this afternoon, because I wished to explain an amendment which I intend to move in order to give new and old members an opportunity to determine, by exhaustive ballot, which is the best site in New South Wales for a Federal Capital. As matters stand, we have no choice. A great deal has been said about Canberra, which was not amongst the sites previously ' balloted for. Dalgety was chosen by Parliament in 1904, and we are now being asked to vote for or against that site.  1  think, however, that we should have more facts as to the contour, rainfall, and characteristics generally of other sites. </para>

Some honorable members, the Treasurer among them, declare that the place is so cold that we could not live there, while others extol its climate. This conflict of opinion is bewildering. I, for one, am loth to vote for a site which may be condemned by future generations ; and rather than be confined to one or two sites, desire an exhaustive ballot to enable the wisdom and knowledge of the House to determine which of the available sites is the best one. I said last session to members of the direct Opposition that, if the representatives of New South Wales agreed as to the site which they considered the most suitable, not only to New South Wales - with which State I wish to keep any bargain that has been made - but also to Australia, I should support it. We do not wish- to place our Capital in a desert. That is what Dalgety has been represented to be by some, though others say that it is a magnificent place. Who are right? </para>

                            <para>- But the three may be right, and the others wrong. As business men, we wish to choose the best and most convenient site, not only for ourselves, but for generations as yet unborn. If the Capital is placed in an undesirable situation, the development of the country may be retarded. I possess an open mind in regard to this matter, but unless there is an exhaustive ballot such as I propose, I must either vote for or against Dalgety, or walk out of the chamber. That is an unpleasant position in which to be placed. The amendment is not being moved to enable any one to shirk his responsibility; my desire is' to take advantage of the information of honorable members generally. In commencing a business, one tries to start on proper lines; and in building a house one tries to get proper foundations, so that the structure shall not fall down, or be blown away. To make a proper selection in the matter of a Capital site, we should have as wide a choice as possible. If I went into an eating house, and ' the waiter placed a chop before me, I should ask for a menu, and! in this case T decline to be tied down to the chop. I do not wish to be compelled to vote for or against Dalgety ; but desire to exercise my choice in regard to all the available sites. The honorable member for Indi wanted to move an amendment to give this opportunity, bet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> no doubt properly, ruled it out of order. The amendment which I now propose to move has been drafted by the honorable and learned member for Flinders, and has been approved by those who have seen it, so I hope that the Government will accept it, and that it will be carried. I do not think that we should be compelled to exercise Hobson's choice. I am fully seized of the need for settling this question, though twenty years hence will be early enough to commence the building of the Capital. The selection of a site, however, is imposed upon us by the Constitution, and the Government have dene their duty in bringing the matter forward. I wish to observe the letter and spirit of the agreement, and so, too, do other honorable members. But the House, as now constituted, contains members who have never yet had an opportunity to vote on this subject, and they should be given that opportunity. I am sorry that the representatives of New South Wales are not unanimous in the recommendation of a site. </para>

                            <para>- More than twenty will vote against Dalgety, but not for any particular site. If there were twenty New South Wales representatives ready to support any particular site, it would be carried. I do not want the representatives of New South Wales to accomplish their object by a subterfuge. Subterfuge is unnecessary. I listened with regret to the remarks made by some honorable members regarding the attitude of the right honorable member for Swan, and the report made by him on the Federal sites, for, to my mind, they were wholly undeserved. And so with some of the criticism to which the honorable member for North  Sydney  has been subjected. I am satisfied that both he and the right honorable member for Swan have been actuated bv patriotic motives, and have attempted to do what they believe to be right. In dealing with this question, we should free ourselves from parochial considerations, and endeavour to do what is best for the Commonwealth. That is the attitude that T take un in submitting this amendment, and in asking the House to support it. I hope that the Prime Minister and his followers will see their way to agree to my proposition, for I, as a new member, certainly do not want to take a leap in the dark. I want to know, from the evidence placed before Parliament - from all the evidence available - what site ought, in the best interests of the Commonwealth, to be selected. I therefore move - </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot accept the amendment moved by the honorable member for Grampians, and I must say that I have found it difficult to follow the line of argument adopted by him in support of it. He said, at the outset of his remarks, that he desired the consideration of this question to be postponed, because he knew nothing whatever of Dalgety or Canberra. Almost immediately afterwards he submitted an amendment not to enable him to obtain information with respect to those two particular sites, so that he might give, so far as they were concerned, a judgment based on knowledge, but to allow a ballot to be taken on the whole question - a ballot that would involve a knowledge, not only of Dalgety and Canberra, but of all the sites that have been suggested.  His  rea.soning in support of his amendment, therefore, cannot be accepted. The only conclusion I can draw under the circumstances is that he desires the postponement of this measure. When I asked him how he would obtain the information that he sought, he declined to say. I cannot accept his amendment, because, in submitting the motion for the second reading of this Bill, I said that the selection of Dalgety by the House was mandatory and binding on those administering the law. </para>

                            <para>- I pointed out that, in the circumstances, it was necessary for the Government to take certain steps ; that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, and the Attorney-General of New South Wales, when they met in Sydney some time ago, decided that since Dalgety had been selected, the next step for this Parliament to take was to define the territory proposed to be acquired. But, since honorable members had expressed a desire to have the whole matter re-discussed, I outlined a course of procedure which, I understood, met with the approval of the House. The honorable member for Wentworth then withdrew an amendment that he had submitted, and I stated that if,- in Committee, any word were omitted from the Bill, I should take that as an indication of the desire of the House to reconsider its decision. What I wish to do is to push on with the Bill as rapidly as possible. Let us get into Committee without delay, and, if the House then decides in favour of Dalgety, let us proceed immediately to pass the Bill through all its stages, and send it forthwith to the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- I have equally good authority for the statement that he will. In justice to the  Chairman  of Committees I think that I ought to explain that I should not have consulted him but for a rumour that he had been interviewed with respect to this matter. I have also informed the House that in the event of such an obstacle arising, as has been suggested, I shall be prepared to consider any method by which it may be obviated. </para>

                            <para>- No. The mere omission of the words I mention from - the Bill would be taken by the Government as a direction from the House that the question was to be reconsidered. My desire is that the Bill should be taken into Committee without delay, and finality reached. I do not suggest that the honorable member for Grampians is actuated by any improper desire in submitting his amendment, but I urge that the procedure I have laid down will enable the House to attain its object. I think that when I outlined it the honorable member for Wentworth said, " We are satisfied," or used words to that effect, and withdrew his amendment. </para>

                            <para>- It is not. It will be sufficient to move the omission of any word or words that will indicate that the majority of the House is of opinion that the matter should be reconsidered, and an exhaustive ballot taken. By the adoption of my proposal, the House would have an opportunity to vote again for Dalgety if it chose to do so ; time would be saved, and it would simply be necessary to restore the word struck out, and to send on the measure to another place. </para>

                        <para>. - Since the Attorney-General has mentioned my name, and referred to an amendment which I had before the House at an earlier stage, I should like to say that .1 still stand by the position I then took up. My position, however, is not that of honorable members who, in the final ballot, would be found voting for Dalgety. I am against Dalgety all the time. I find that the procedure laid down by the Attorney-General is designed to permit us to take a vote on a proposal to omit the 'word's " Schedule A," which embraces the area of Dalgety. </para>

                        <para>. - I am afraid that some of the amendments that are being circulated are so catchy that it is quite possible for one to be placed in a totally false position. The honorable member for Wentworth, who is a Sydney member and Opposition Whip, two or three days ago stated exactly the position in which I find myself to-day with regard to the amendment moved by the honorable member for Grampians, a Victorian, and seconded by another Victorian member. I should like to quote his remarks - </para>

                        <para>At the present juncture, we are in this peculiar position. : By voting for the second reading of this Bill, an honorable member must declare himself in favour of fixing the site of the Federal Capital at Dalgety, and by voting against the second reading of the Bill, he must declare himself against determining more definitely the Federal Capital question. So that honorable members who take either course will lay themselves open to a misunderstanding. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly, according to the wording of the Bill ; but my honorable friend is aware that political opponents are not too scrupulous in these matters, and an honorable member who votes against the second reading of this Bill because he is opposed to the selection of Dalgety, will be taunted with being against " determining more definitely " the Federal Capital question. Let us assume that we agree not to take a vote on the second reading, and permit the Bill to go into Committee, with the object of striking out the word " Dalgety." What will then be our position ? Some honorable member may raise a point of order in Committee, and ask whether it is competent for any honorable member to seek to omit from this Bill a word - Dalgety - which comprises the whole sum and substance of it, since its object is " to settle more definitely the Seat of Government in the neighbourhood of Dalpety." I am afraid that a Chairman of Committees might rule against an amendment for the omission of the word, and we should find ourselves in another pitfall of the Government's making. The motion at present before the Chair is - </para>

I regret that the honorable member for Grampians was not present then, for he now asks us to go over the whole of the ground again, and brings the Attorney-General to his feet once more to give an even more explicit undertaking than he did on two previous occasions. In introducing the Bill, the Attorney- General said- </para>

It is only fair to say that we know the site is to be attacked; and the procedure, if that site is not adopted, will be to give the House an opportunity to express an opinion on any site, and not only as between two particular sites - there will be the fullest opportunity for arriving at a fair and unbiased judgment..... If any step is taken which indicates a desire to review the selection, the Bill will be immediately reported, when fresh names may be nominated and an exhaustive ballot taken. </para>

                    <para class="block">I for one am most desirous, in the interests of New South Wales, that no more time should be lost in settling this question. I cross-examined the Attorney-General this afternoon as to how the test vote would be taken. He said it could be taken on any word which the Committee selected as a test word - the word " and," for instance. He stated that if a majority voted to leave that word out of the Bill, the Government would immediately take it as an indication  that the House desired a fresh exhaustive ballot on the whole of the sites, would report the Bill to the House, and arrange for the ballot accordingly. That is a perfectly fair way of doing the business. A reference to the speech of the Attorney-General a few moments ago will prove what I refer to. It is nonsense to say that the  Chairman  would rule out of order an amendment to strike out some particular word. Any member of the Committee could move to strike out the word " and." </para>

To carry this amendment would be tantamount to postponing the measure. It is far better that the second reading should go through formally, and that a test vote should be taken in Committee. The honorable member for Grampians said that honorable members on his side did not wish to gain their ends by subterfuge. If the majority desire now to reject Dalgety in favour of some other site, the clearest possible way to do it is that outlined by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- The objection is that we shall delay dealing with the second reading of the Bill. By the other course we could go right through with the second reading. This is quite simple and clear, and I do not propose to place myself in the hands of unscrupulous opponents by voting for an amendment which complicates the position. It is said that both  sides of the House have been canvassed, and that the numbers are up in favour of retaining Dalgety. If so, we ought not to humbug about the question, or resort to that subterfuge which the honorable member for Grampians says he wishes to avoid. If in Committee the test vote shows that a majority wish to go on with the Bill as it stands, the matter can be settled in a few minutes, and in that way we shall see that the compact in the Constitution is carried out by the Bill being passed as early as possible. </para>

                            <para>- If this were new legislation, the honorable member for Grampians' amendment might have some justification, but we are asked now to adopt the extraordinary course of reviewing a decision arrived at by Parliament after a most exhaustive process, in which of course some honorable members had no part, although that was not our fault, or the fault of the Act which was finally passed. Those honorable members who desire to vote for other sites will have an opportunity of doing so if the feeling of the House is against the previous determination of Parliament. I do not wish to say anything as to the merits of the various sites. I have studiously avoided speaking on them, as, having strong opinions, I might be tempted" to make somewhat strong remarks, and I am anxious to see the legislative machine work without friction. As to the plea put forward that certain honorable members have not had an opportunity of voting for any other site than that which appears on the face of the Bill, I point out that that will inevitably happen whenever the question is brought <inline font-style="italic">up.</inline> The <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the House is constantly changing, and if we were to take heed of such arguments, it would be necessary to review in every Parliament the work done by previous Parliaments. Opportunity or excuse would certainly be found for adopting some such procedure as it is now attempted to force on the House, if we were in a similar position in the future. I desire to point out the significant fact that the honorable members who are in favour of postponing the question indefinitely, are, I believe, without a single exception, going to vote for the amendment. I am convinced that when the division is taken, I shall be found to be substantially correct in my statement. </para>

                            <para>- My objection is that it is an unusual way of amending an Act. When a Bill is brought down to amend an Act, the results of an amendment are usually more serious than would follow the carrying of the amendment on the present occasion. </para>

                            <para>- If the Government were to introduce any other measure, and if it was, in effect, emasculated or altered before the second reading was carried, there would probably be another Government in office very soon ; and the fact to which the right honorable member for East Sydney alluded - that a member of the Government will be found voting in favour of the amendment - shows conclusively that that very unfortunate result need not be feared. I ask honorable members not to adopt this amendment, seeing that everything they may legitimately desire will be secured to them when the Bill reaches its Committee stage. The Attorney-General has said over and over again that, in the event of Dalgety being rejected, every opportunity will be given to review the whole subject, so that there will be nothing to prevent every honorable member expressing his opinion in the manner suggested. I urge that we proceed as rapidly as may be to deal with the motion for the second reading; because I object to the question being reopened in this fashion time after time, with the object of causing further delay. It is desirable that we should come to a decision as soon as possible; and I can only say that if the amendment be carried the only result, in my opinion, will be delay and disappointment. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Laanecoorie made out, as he had a right to do, the best possible case for the attitude the Government have taken up on this matter. I frankly say for myself that I desire to see another ballot taken before this matter is finally settled. I do not believe that Dalgety has ever received a majority of the votes in this House on a square straight-out vote. Dalgety was selected on the last occasion because we were forced into the position, by reason of the turn the ballot took, of voting for that site against some other site we approved less. I have always held the opinion that any site which is finally selected by this House should be so selected after it has defeated every other site in single combat. That has never been done, and, therefore, in my judgment, Dalgety has never received a decisive vote on its merits. To use a vulgarism, I desire to see a " fair go " in the shape of a new ballot before we are finally and irrevocably committed. I hope that we are about to make a final determination of the future home of the Capital of Australia. We are told that the Government offer a perfectly fair proposition ; but I submit that it is not at all fair. We are asked to affirm the desirability of determining more definitely the Seat of Government in the neighbourhood of Dalgety, and we are asked to do that before we are offered the privilege of voting on another ballot. I object to this most strongly, because the alternative offered is to vote for a site in which I do not believe. First of all, I have to affirm the second reading of a Bill of which I do not approve before I am at liberty to exercise a choice such as the Government apparently offer. That is my preliminary objection to the procedure pf the Government. Moreover, there sire  a number of new members who have never voted on the Federal Capital site question. It is idle to say that the choice has been fixed ; indeed, the Bill itself is the best of all proofs to the contrary, and until there is a definite decision, the question is still in the political melting pot. The Government tell us that before we can have another ballot, and exercise another choice in regard to the final determination of the question, we must vote for or against Dalgety. There are a number of honorable members who, at present, are in favour of Dalgety ; but they rightly say - and the Government ought to meet the position fairly and reasonably - that, before finally fixing the site, they desire to have another choice in the shape of a ballot. </para>

                            <para>- But that is what the honorable member means; and in any case I do not think he will be able to move from Melbourne to Dalgety very soon. The affirming of Dalgety will mean that the Federal Parliament must continue to meet in' Melbourne for some years to come. Honorable members opposite who protest against further delay must do so, as the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> suggested the other day, with the tongue in the cheek. The amendment is fair and reasonable, and I ask the Government to put no obstacle in its way, so that we may have a fresh ballot on the various sites. I object strongly to being compelled to vote for the second reading of a measure of which I disapprove ; but if the amendment be not carried I must vote for it to obtain an opportunity to vote for an amendment in Committee. Thus the Government is forcing us into an unfair position. This is the proper time to decide whether Dalgety or some other site shall be chosen. The Government is not acting rightly in declining to allow honorable members to vote freely on the greatest of all the questions at present agitating the public mind. I understand that under your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> we must not debate the merits of the various sites, and therefore I content myself with urging Ministers to allow us to proceed at once with a ballot to determine which site should be selected, </para>

                        <para>. - I understand that I cannot debate the main question as I intended to do, but must confine my remarks to the amendment. I wish, therefore, to point out that the proposal before the Chair gives honorable members an opportunity to express their preferences as to which of the sites discussed shall be chosen. The Government, however, asks us to reaffirm Dalgety, and to pass the second reading of the Bill, and tells us that in Committee, on the. schedule, we shall have an opportunity to do indirectly that which the honorable member for Grampians proposes that we shall do directly. This action places us in a false position. In previous ballots Dalgety has never commanded a majority of primary votes. The history of the matter is very interesting. When, on the occasion of the first ballot, Dalgety and Bombala were treated as independent sites, not a. vote was recorded for Dalgety, and, on the second ballot, . those who cast their votes for Dalgety were those who originally voted for Bombala. Had not Bom  ba.1 a been a competing site at the taking of the first ballot, they would probably have voted for Dalgety then. The result of the first vote in the ballot of 1903 was to give Lyndhurst 23 votes, Tumut 21, and Bombala i  6,  Tumut being ultimately chosen because, on a later vote, the Bombala supporters transferred their allegiance to it in preference to Lyndhurst. In the ballot of 1904, the Lyndhurst, or Western site, secured 28 primary votes, the Southern, or Dalgety site, 22, and the Tumut site 21, and the Treasurer informed us last night that, but for a train being late, the Tumut site would have received two more votes, as two members who intended to vote for it reached the chamber just after the voting was finished. Therefore the Dalgety site secured second place by a mere fluke, and as, when it came to be pitted against Lyndhurst the second time, the Tumut support was transferred to it, it was ultimately chosen. But the Act subsequently passed was merely an Act to enable the Government to negotiate with the Government of New South Wales in respect to a certain territory. </para>

                            <para>- I am justifying its submission. It was assumed that the negotiations under the Seat of Government Act would result in a satisfactory agreement, but as that has not happened, we may reasonably be asked to reconsider the whole question. There is all the more reason for this, seeing that the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the House is changed, and a number of honorable members have never voted on the question. Should we not, therefore, first determine which is the best site available, and then deal with the matters covered bv the Bill? I hope that the House will clear the way for the expression of members' opinions in respect to the various sites by voting for the amendment. We should not tie ourselves down to a vote for or against Dalgety. If we are so restricted, a number of honorable members will be placed in a false position. They may consider Tumut, or some other southern site, better than Dalgety, and to get a chance to vote for it must vote against Dalgety - a vote which they may ultimately find it difficult to explain. The way for a clear expression of opinion will be made by the acceptance of the amendment, honorable members being able to state their primary and secondary preferences in respect to all the sites before proceeding to consider the  legislative proposals of the Government. The course proposed by the honorable member for Grampians will do no injustice to Dalgety, or to any other site. If a majority still favours that site, the Bill will remain unaltered. I disagree entirely with the view expressed by the honorable member for Cook, that the amendment moved by the honorable member for Grampians will cloud the issue. To my mind, it will place it clearly before the people. It will enable them to ascertain in what way honorable members would record their primary votes when the question at issue was not that of eliminating- from the Bill the word "Dalgety " - a site for which votes were cast, at a certain stage, by some honorable members on the assumption that it would be selected - but of dealing with every site on its merits. The honorable member for Cook says that he is not a supporter of Dalgety, and that from the whipping that has already taken place, he understands that that site has a majority in this House. If it be true that it can secure a majority of straight-out primary votes, its supporters need not fear the proposal made by the honorable member for Grampians. By agreeing to it, they will make their position stronger in the eyes of the people of New South Wales and of the Commonwealth generally. I propose, for the reasons I have indicated, to vote for the amendment, and think that the supporters of Dalgety will be well-advised in doing likewise. The adoption of the course outlined in it will give much greater satisfaction than would be possible if that proposed by the Government were followed. </para>

I am not prejudiced against them. I come here as a new member desiring an opportunity . to record a vote on the various sites. It appears to me that the Government are asking those who, on a previous occasion gave a secondary vote for Dalgety, and who have a- primary preference for some, other site, to either vote against it - with the possibility of some site other than their primary choice taking its place - or to vote straight out for it. The only conclusion one can come to is that they are endeavouring to force the selection of Dalgety. I cannot see why this House, which has been elected since the question was last discussed, should not have an opportunity to proceed to a ballot on the different sites. The Government are not giving the new members a fair opportunity to record an absolutely unprejudiced and well-considered vote on them. </para>

It is well known that some honorable members who would, in certain circumstances, vote against Dalgety, if the opportunity offered, feel that their action would be misunderstood, and that they would lay themselves open to  a  charge of inconsistency if they voted that site out of the Bill - as they would have to do under the Government proposal - and then later on, owing to the exigencies of the ballot, and the conditions existing, we're compelled to cast a vote for it again. I therefore think that the new House should have every opportunity to exercise its rights in an exhaustive vote. </para>

                        <para>. - I am rather surprised at the direction which the debate has taken. Judging by the speeches to which we have listened during the last few hours, many honorable members are not in earnest with regard to the selection of a site. If they were, they would allow the matter to go to a straight-out vote. I do not object to such a vote, but evidently some honorable members who have recently addressed themselves to this question do. The various proposals for delay that have been made amount to an insidious attempt on the part of the opponents of Dalgety to prevent its final acceptance. I notice that even the advocates of Canberra have practically dropped it. </para>

They have simply been sparring for wind, so to speak, with a view to ascertaining whether some other site would not be acceptable to all those who are opposed to that already selected. The representatives of the other States seem to be far more anxious to deal fairly by New South Wales than do the representatives of that State. </para>

No substantial reason has been given for the amendments that have been moved, and they have been ridiculed to such an extent that those responsible for them have been forced to withdraw them. </para>

                            <para>- I am opposed, to the proposed ballot because, even if it were taken, we should have a repetition of the objections taken to the result of the last. Some train would be late, some cab would break down, or something would happen to prevent, in the opinion of some honorable members, a fair vote. The advocates of delay are hopeful that in the new Parliament they will have good reasons for demanding that the whole question shall be re-opened, and for contending that a straight-out vote was not taken on the present occasion. It will never be possible in this House, where members have to attend to their constituencies and travel such long distances, to have all the votes accounted for by ballot. We can have them all accounted for on a straight-out division by means of pairs. For that reason a straight-out vote should be taken, not on an amendment in favour of having a ballot, but for or against the second reading of the Bill. </para>

To show that I am really anxious to do what is fair for New South Wales, I have paired with a member of the Opposition, who had to go home by train to-night. If I had been determined to secure Dalgety at all hazards, I should have refused to pair. Another of my colleagues who favours Dalgety has paired with another honorable member on the other side who favours the ballot. We want to do what is fair and right, but we ought to" settle the question once and for all. If those who want a ballot are defeated they ought to be content and admit that, having had the opinion of two Parliaments, it is the duty of the House to proceed to carry out the expressed will of the House. </para>

                            <para>- That is the very objection that will be raised again if a ballot is taken. I want no accidents to happen. If the honorable member, or any of his colleagues, cannot be present for a straight-out vote there will be no difficulty in getting pairs from those who favour Dalgety. In that way the vote of every honorable member can be accounted for, and there will be no reason for wriggling out of the decision. I am dissatisfied' with the tactics that are being adopted, not from my own point of view - for it is immaterial to me personally where the Capital is fixed - but from a New South Wales point of view. It is high time that, we were in earnest. </para>

                            <para>- I will tell the honorable member the tactics I have seen on the part of New' South Wales representatives. I have seen ardent supporters of a certain site, which might be in the running again, immediately they changed: their constituencies, just ss ardently engineering for another site - not standing up in this Chamber and giving their views, but anxious for the ballot, because they had been engineering as hard as they could; to induce honorable members to support,, not the site they favoured before, but some new site - for reason which I am notable to fathom. </para>

                        <para>. - I welcome the amendment of the honorable member for Grampians as a good way out of the difficulty into which the Government have led us. The difficulty that we have seen from the beginning is how to get that straight-out vote which the honorable member for Hindmarsh asks for. When it was first proposed, that we should vote against the second reading, it was pointed out that if we did so we should perhaps block the settlement of the question altogether. The Government did not want the test vote taken on the second reading, and suggested that the Bill should be allowed to go into Committee. That meant that those who were against Dalgety were asked to vote for a Bill " to determine more definitely the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth in the neighbourhood ot Dalgety." That was not a fair issue to put to the House. The very fact that many of us were against Dalgety made us reluctant to vote for the second reading, and yet we were told that if we did not vote for it we should be blocking the settlement of the question. It was thrown in our faces that New South Wales members were not in earnest. We were asked in the Committee stage, after the principle of the Bill had been affirmed, to vote to leave out one of the schedules, which would have the effect of striking out Dalgety. It was then discovered that in all probability that course would not be allowed in Committee, as it would defeat the end for which the Bill was nominally introduced. So the Government suggested another arbitrary amendment, leaving out one word, and said that if that were carried they would consider it an indication that the House wanted another ballot. But the amendment of the honorable member for Grampians puts directly before the House the straight-out issue that we desire. The question .that the Attorney-General put before us was whether we were or were not in favour of reopening the question.. That is the very issue raised by the amendment. I favour reopening the question. The fact that an Act naming Dalgety as the site was passed in 1904 is not a sufficient argument why the question should not be reopened. The very fact that it was passed so long ago, and that nothing has been done since is rather a very good reason for going into the matter afresh. Since that Act was passed a general election has been held, and there are in the House twenty-four or twenty-five new members who have never had an opportunity of voting by ballot for any site. The question should be reopened to give every honorable member an opportunity of exercising his choice among all the sites in the same way as the members of the last Parliament did. Dalgety was never pitted in previous ballots against some of the more important sites put forward. It was adopted in the end only because some honorable members who were strenuously opposed to it were left with the option of choosing it or Tooma. Of the two bad things they chose the one which they considered the least bad, but which to my mind was, after all, the worse of the two. The site which gained the most votes in the first ballot was Lyndhurst, which I advocated the other day, but there was never a straight-out vote between Dalgety and Lyndhurst. Even in the last Parliament, if those two sites alone had been voted upon, the decision of the House as then constituted would have been different, and I am certain that the decision of tins House would be  different if we had a similar choice. All that the amendment affirms is that a new ballot ought to be taken. That will" not debar Dalgety. If a majority of honorable members are in favour of it, Dalgety will be carried again. It will be considered with the other sites, and voted upon on its merits. All that -we ask for is that all the new members, and those old members who have changed their opinions, should have an opportunity of voting for the site which they, consider best in the interests, not of their own particular State, but of this great Commonwealth. The adoption, of a procedure which By some technicality may prevent that being done would be unworthy of the importance of the issue. It is time that we indicated definitely which site amongst all those submitted we favour. The attitude of those who oppose the amendment is - " Dalgety has been selected, and we will not give you a chance to vote for any other site." I hope that attitude will not be indorsed by the House, but that the amendment will be carried, so that we may have the opportunity of voting on the different sites on their merits, and according to our judgment of what is best in the interests of Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot allow the amendment to be put to a vote without saying a word or two. Some honorable members have, to my mind, spoken with a bias that does not indicate a desire - at any rate, this is so on the part of the honorable member for Laanecoorie and the honorable member, for Hindmarsh  -  to have a fair expression of opinion. One honorable member pointed out that several votes have already been taken on the question, and that another Parliament has arrived at a decision; but the honorable member for Grampians has moved this amendment in the interests of a large number of gentlemen who are new members of this Parliament, and who ought not to be placed at any disadvantage in dealing with what I regard as a momentous question. The object now is to rectify the mistake of another Parliament ; and it must not be forgotten that we have been charged over and over again with neglecting our duty in this matter. That charge means that we are to hurry on the selection for some party purpose, to which I shall not allude more definitely; but I point out that in other countries where similar great national questions have had to be decided, the business has taken a great many more years than the Commonwealth has been in existence. When the agreement was arrived at that the Capital should be somewhere near the 100-miles limit, surely it was thought then that .there would be no difficulty in finding a suitable site. To-day, however, we find ourselves confined to Dalgety and Canberra; and there would appear to be a consensus of opinion that neither is suitable. We ought to be prepared to rise to the occasion and accept the amendment, which, if it does not mean postponement for any great length of time, means, at any rate, a ballot. In dealing- with such a matter we ought to be above any geographical or time considerations; and the amendment offers to the House fuller opportunity of arriving at a wise decision. I venture to say that no one contends that either Dalgety or Canberra is the best site obtainable; and I point out that if Dalgety be selected the South Australian representatives and Tasmanian representatives will be placed at an additional disadvantage. </para>

                            <para>- I am endeavouring to speak to the- amendment, but it is almost impossible to dissociate it from the main question. The amendment that I submitted was ruled out of order ; and I really think I am entitled to say a word or two in favour of the amendment of the honorable member for Grampians, and to suggest why both Dalgety and Canberra should be rejected in favour of a better site. I hope we shall have a division on the amendment ; and that the House will appreciate the importance of this matter to the life of the Commonwealth, and come to a wise choice. This question must be settled, not in the interests of the 4,500,000 people here now, but in the interests of many more millions yet unborn. If the amendment be carried it will give time for fuller consideration, and we shall convince the people of the Commonwealth that we have risen above parochialism, and acted in the interests of the future of the nation. </para>

                        <para>.- It has been alleged that those who support the amendment do so because they desire to block the settlement of the  question : but I shall vote for the amendment for absolutely contrary reasons. I support the amendment with a view to giving the new Parliament a say in the selection, and if, after discussion, and the final ballot, Dalgety is selected, I, at least, will make one to urge the Government to undertake the early establishment of the Capital. The amendment cannot do any damage; it simply gives a chance to all the various sites, leaving the Bill then to be carried straight through. I am uncertain as to whether there is a majority in favour of Dalgety ; but if I were certain that there was I should vote against the amendment as absolutely unnecessary. However, I cannot imagine that to be the case after what I have seen during the last few days. I also support the amendment, so that I may be given an opportunity of submitting the Armidale site, which, I consider, has not had fair play. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Indi expressed the hope more than once that we should rise to the occasion, and support the amendment. I may say, however, that I am not enamoured of the amendment, because, blunt man that I am, I prefer the direct course. I respect the axiom that a straight line is the shortest distance between two given points. .There is, however, a good deal of human nature in this House, and, very often, as may be on the present occasion, the longest way round is the shortest way home. The Government have intimated that, if any amendment is carried in Committee, they will take that as meaning! the deletion of Dalgety; and, if this amendment is submitted with the object of enabling us to have a ballot, I, as opposed to Dalgety, will vote for it with a view to securing another site. But if the opponents of Dalgety are not strong enough to have that site struck out by a straight vote, how can they be strong enough, unless some honorable members _ "go back" on their expressed opinions, to have it rejected by the course indicated in the amendment? When I find honorable members on this side declaring themselves to be noble-minded patriots, and not backyard statesmen, like myself, why should I refuse them the opportunity of proving their professions? The honorable member for Indi, in common with others, has intimated a burning desire not to cast a vote which will be inimical to the best interests of Australia, and has asked for a second ballot. But if the amendment is carried, am I to understand that the ballot would take place immediately? If so, in what better position will those gentlemen be in to vote then, than they are in to vote directly on the Bill?  I  shall vote for the amendment, because  I  do not like the Dalgety site, and shall take every opportunity to bring about its rejection ; but  I  know that as soon as the amendment is carried the claim will be made for delay, so that new members may visit the other proposed sites. And unless those honorable members do visit the sites, how will they be in a better position to vote by ballot on the relative merits of each proposed site than they are to vote on the Bill? If they think that Dalgety is not an acceptable site, why do they not vote against it directly? We have been told that the numbers are up, and that this is really only another attempt to cause delay. If Dalgety is to be re-affirmed, delay may as well be caused in this as in any other way ; but  I  have been led to beware of the Greeks when they bring presents, and though it may seem, unkind,  I  must say that  I  do not think that the amendment has been moved in the interests of New South Wales. That may be regarded as a narrow, provincial view ; but  I  find that other honorable members, when they throw aside their garment of nationalism, are always awake to the main chance. A Victorian opens his eyes first thing in the morning, and keeps them open all day. </para>

                            <para>- It might be thought that I did if I were to accept the reasons which have been given for the amendment. Would you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> if you held the views of most on this side of the Chamber, and could, by voting in Committee for the omission of certain words, provide for the striking out of Dalgety, support this amendment for another ballot? However, the honorable member for Parramatta appears to be enamoured of the proposal, and he is even less verdant than I, so I think it safe to follow his footsteps. As for the argument that the amendment has been moved to give new members a chance to express their opinions, I would point out that they themselves have declared that, not having visited the sites, they are not in a position to vote on them. The honorable member for Indi says that he does not wish to give a vote' which may harm the interests of Australia; but does his position to-night differ from what it will be on Tuesday night - will he be any better informed then? Of course, if this is an attempt to whip the devil round the stump by honorable members who, though opposed to Dalgety, do not wish to say so, I have nothing to say; but I object to the suggestion that we shall gain anything from it. When it is carried I shall be prepared to see some strong patriot from Victoria at once put forward strong reasons for delaying the ballot until further information can be obtained about the various sites. </para>

                        <para>.- I agree with the honorable member for Dalley that the carrying of the amendment will cause delay, and the moving of it, taken in conjunction with the interjection of the honorable member for Flinders that it was thought a safer course than to let the Bill get into Committee, was an insult to the Ministers. The Prime Minister has said that if the second reading is carried, and in Committee an amendment is agreed to as an indication of the wish of honorable members for a ballot, the Bill will be reported to enable a ballot to be taken, and that statement was repeated by the Attorney-General, and the course concurred in without dissent. </para>

                            <para>- If the Bill is not amended there will be no ballot, and if there is any likelihood of the Bill being passed without amendment this proposal for a ballot will not be carried. We might very well have come to a vote last Friday, and were on the point of doing so last night, when the honorable member for Grampians announced his intention of moving the amendment which has now been under discussion for a couple of hours. If another ballot is taken to give new members an opportunity to select a site - which we have been told, is why the amendment was moved- </para>

                            <para>- It may be pointed out that several honorable members are temporarily absent who would have been present had they known that a division would have been taken on the Bill. It is unfortunate that this question should be thrown once more into the melting pot, with the result that we shall have to proceed to a further ballot. The argument that since the question was last dealt with the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the House has considerably changed falls to the ground. If that doctrine has any force, it might as well be argued that we should review all the legislation passed by previous Parliaments. We should never make any progress if every new Parliament is to review the Acts of its predecessors in this fashion. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing behind it. The procedure I propose is that which was adopted on a previous occasion, and the motion has been drafted with a view to simplicity and fairness. I ask honorable members to agree to the motion at once. If it is passed nominations will be invited to-night, and since the matter has been discussed very thoroughly, we propose that they shall be made without debate. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is of opinion that sufficient time has been given to enable every honorable member to nominate a site if he desires to do so, he will declare the nominations closed. The question will then stand over until Wednesday afternoon next. In fixing upon that date we are actuated by the desire to give every honorable member full notice and to afford representatives of the different States an ample opportunity to attend, so that we may obtain a determination by a full House. </para>

                        <para>- I have not put the reduction down yet. It will be something fairly considerable; but that question can be more properly dealt with when the Bil] is reinstated in its previous position.. I wish to make paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause  14,  regarding the payment of wages, clearer than it now appears to be. When I dealt with the question before, I had to get an amendment hurriedly written out. I . do not think its wording is as conclusive as it should be as to the wages. I wish to make the provision as to the power of the Commonwealth to take over the works at any time clearer also. </para>

                        <para>- I understand not; but that the industry could be taken over in order to manufacture for defence purposes. I want to make the clause, which gives power to take the industry over, clearer and more conclusive, and probably will put in a provision referring to the points to which honorable members have just alluded. The wording regarding Australian ore and Australian manufacture also requires a little strengthening. I hope I shall be able to meet the honorable member for Illawarra somewhat in regard to his amendment, and to overcome at least some of the objections that he had to the Bill. We might, I think, limit the time as to when wire-netting should be made here, and in the meantime, let the bounty be paid. </para>

                        <para>- Will the Prime Minister allow me to point out that there is no possible misunderstanding ; and I think the whole House is aware of the facts. After a number of interjections, I had risen more than once to call attention to their frequency. I then rose again, and said I should be compelled, much against my will, to take further steps unless the interjections ceased. One or two honorable members again interjected, and I called them to order by name, those honorable members being the honorable member for Dalley, the honorable member for Wimmera, and the honorable member for Kennedy. Almost immediately afterwards the honorable member for Corangamite made an interjection, and I was obliged, unless my intimations to the House are to be laughed at and treated with scorn, to do what I had said I would do, What the honorable member for Corangamite did, in spite of my direction earlier, was to interject in such a way as to interrupt the Treasurer. If, however, the honorable member for Corangamite expresses his regret, I am quite sure the House would be glad to accept an apology. I hope, in any case, that I shall not be driven again, by the persistency and multiplicity of interjections, to take steps that would be very much to the detriment of the House. I have recognised, and have done so ever since I have occupied this position, which honorable members were good enough to confer upon me, that there are interjections of a kind very helpful to a debate, in eliciting information and making speeches more clear, but I do think that, especially during the last two or three hours, there have been interjections of a character  and a  frequency that were not calculated to help debate, but rather to harass the  speaker.  Interjections so persistent in their character are most distracting to an honorable member addressing the Chair, and are bound, if not diminished, to very much reflect on the dignity of the House. I ask the honorable member for Corangamite if he desires to make an apology ? </para>

If the Government had intended to proceed with the Bill to night, I could have understood the attitude of honorable members, but that  is  not the intention. My own opinion was that the motion was being regarded  as  formal; and, if it can be carried without unnecessary  Belay,  I shall be very much obliged. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that there is not much gained by this procedure, if, on the introduction of the message at any stage, we can have a debate practically equalling that on the second reading. In South Australia, a motion for the reinstatement of a Bill was put without debate. As this matter has been partially discussed, I am surprised that the Treasurer has not shown how funds can be found for the carrying out of the measure consistently with the decent administration of the Departments. Mention has been made of the Postal Department. The honorable gentleman seems to have forgotten that in May of last year it was reported by the experts of that Department that within three years there would be required for pressing works ^2,250,000, including about ^300,000 of ordinary expenditure. As half the votes asked for have been reduced by the Treasurer- </para>

Therefore, before we agree to restore to the notice-paper a Bill involving a certain expenditure of ^300,000, and probably a still greater outlay, we should be given an idea as to how the money will be found. </para>

                    <para>.- Why has not the honorable member for New England moved the postponement of the discussion until the day after the resurrection? He might as well have done so. We were told by the Governor-General that the session is to be a short one, and it is understood that the financial statement is to be delivered about three weeks hence. Surely the honorable member for New England, and those who think with him, will not be content to accept the Budget without criticising it. This criticism, judging by past experience, will occupy several weeks, and the honorable member's amend- ' ment will only further delay an important measure which has already been delayed too long. The proposal to grant bounties for the production of iron is not new. It has been before several Parliaments, and our decision is awaited with considerable interest. In my opinion, no sufficient reason for the postponement has been given. I shall vote for bounties on iron, and leave it to the Treasurer to find the necessary money. He has told us that the finances are better and healthier than he expected to find them; and, therefore, I think that the measure should be proceeded with forthwith. The honorable member for New England has spoken about nationalization. Now, there are other ways of killing a pig than by choking him with' butter, and there are other ways of killing this measure than by talking about nationalization, to which I am entirely opposed. </para>

                        <para>- If honorable members are opposed to the granting of bounties for the production of iron, let them say so; but I ask them not to advance excuses for delaying the measure. Every honorable member can roughly forecast the state of the finances. The introduction of the Defence Bill was not objected to on the ground that there had been no financial statement. If we conducted our business on proper lines, no doubt the delivery of the Budget would be the first work of the session. When I find honorable members displaying so much caution in this connexion, I feel impelled to ask them to be equally cautious when a Supply Bill is introduced. The Bill relates to an industry that affects my State, and also many thousands of operatives of the right class. I am inclined therefore to vote for it, and certainly shall not do anything to delay its consideration. I ask honorable members, if they are opposed to the measure, to fight it out when it is introduced, and not to take advantage of the present motion to demand a full statement of the financial position of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I am rather surprised at the attitude of some honorable members who, whilst realizing apparently the full importance of the industry to which the Bill relates, are prepared to make what I consider a petty plea in opposition to it. I describe their objection as a petty one because, although I do not underrate the importance of finance, I certainly do not underestimate the re sources of Australia and the possibilities which lie within the power of the Government to raise sufficient money to assist the iron industry. The industry, if it is worth supporting, is going to be supported ultimately, and I have no doubt that Australia is capable of supporting it to the limited extent that we are now asked to. sanction. To raise the bogy that the Treasurer has not at his disposal, at the present moment, the funds necessary for this purpose, is ridiculous. Honorable members who raise such a cry are apparently questioning the soundness of the financial resources of Australia. We have voted enormous sums by way of bounties for the encouragement of what, as compared with the iron industry, are second-rate enterprises, such as the cultivation of flax and the production of ginned cotton, hemp, and goat hair. </para>

                        <para>- Then the money which has been hypothecated in respect of them might very well be devoted to an industry that can be successfully carried on in Australia. We have sanctioned an expenditure amounting to about £300,000 in respect of bounties for the encouragement of minor industries, and we are now asked to grant a sum to assist in the establishment of an industry that is of the greatest importance to Australia. We are not called upon to vote more than , £25,000 or £30,000 a year by way of bounties on the production of iron. The Lithgow works are not at present capable of turning out more than would absorb that amount, and yet, on the flimsy plea that the necessary funds do not happen to be actually in sight, honorable members would hang up the establishment of what every one considers is a vital industry. One would imagine from the outcry raised by some honorable members that the Commonwealth was insolvent. We cannot be come self-supporting, self-reliant, or self contained without this industry, and. yet. some honorable members hesitate to assist, it on the ground that we cannot see our. way to provide for an outlay of £25,000 a year upon it for the next few years. I am surprised that honorable members and more particularly members of my own party, who say that we ought to be self-reliant - should take up so ridiculous a position. As I understand that I cannot on this motion enter upon the larger question of the industry and its claims, I am confining my remarks to the financial aspect of the matter, and I appeal to honorable members to say whether they do not think Australia can afford to expend  .£25,000  or  £30,000  a year to establish this basic industry, upon which all modern enterprises depend. It is disgraceful that an industry without which we cannot develop Australia should be denied assistance at our hands. Honorable members are aspersing the fair name of Australia by asserting that we are not in a position to grant the industry the little help now proposed to be given it. </para>

No one doubts the ability of Australia to raise the funds necessary to assist the iron industry. The only contention is that, having regard to the responsibilities that have already been incurred by the Government in respect of bounties for the encouragement of other industries, and under various Acts of Parliament, it is necessary that a business-like financial statement should be made to the House before further large appropriations are made. When we are entering into, obligations, we must take care to provide the ways and means to meet them. The Prime Minister promised that before the Government would seek to reinstate the Bill a full financial statement would be made. </para>

The Government are anxious to avoid traversing the ground already covered by introducing the Bill at the stage which had been reached at the end of last session, and it is now contended that before that is done, a financial statement should be submitted. The Treasurer has stated that he can provide for the expenditure which this Bill will involve. That, however, is a very bald assertion, and we need something more. It does not follow that, because an honorable member demands that before he votes for this motion a financial statement shall be made by the Treasurer, he will not vote for an iron bounty. </para>

Every man who enters into an obligation before he has made his way clear to meet it, lowers himself in the estimation of the people, and we contend that before we appropriate large sums to encourage the iron industry, it should be shown that we shall be able to meet our responsibilities in that regard. I claim that the promise made by  the Prime Minister shall be carried out before I vote for the reinstatement of the Bill ; but it does not follow that because I take up that attitude, I shall oppose the bounty. </para>

                    <para>.- The position, as I understand it, is that honorable members who. like myself, are anxious to vote for the bounty, desire that faith shall be kept with them. The Prime Minister, some little time ago, promised the House that a financial statement would be submitted before honorable members were asked to vote the money necessary to provide for the bounties under this Bill. The starving of the Post and Telegraph Department is a matter of great concern to country districts, and honorable members are naturally anxious to learn why severe retrenchment should take place in certain Departments, whilst money is being found for other services. I regard the iron industry as of supreme importance, and no technicality should' stand in the way of a bounty being granted for. its encouragement. I claim only that the promise made by the Prime Minister shall be fulfilled. As I understand the position, however, we are merely asked now to reinstate the Bill at the stage reached last session. After that has been done,_ and after the Bill is proceeded with, the financial statement will be made. On that .understanding, I fail to see why the House should not agree to the motion. It will then be the duty of honorable members to demand that the Prime Minister's promise shall be faithfully observed. </para>

                        <para>- I will not say that more than £2,000,000 will be required, but the amount will certainly be more nearly £2,000,000 than £1,800,000. That being so, it is right that we should consider what was our balance last year. I believe we obtained an enormously increased revenue, and a much Higher revenue than we are likely to receive this year or in the succeeding year, and we had not even then such an enormous balance that we could afford to play fast and loose with the money. In addition to that big responsibility, we have other claims upon us equally pressing in the acquisition of the Northern Territory, the defence proposals, and the taking over of light-houses. </para>

                    <para>There are these matters of real urgency from a national stand-point staring us in the face, and it is due to the country that the Government should give some indication of where the money to finance them is coming from. If the Manufactures Encouragement Bill is carried, it will involve claims upon the Treasury to the extent of at least £250,000, assuming that the manufacture of wire netting, and trivial matters included in the schedule are left out of account altogether, and only the £250,000 bonus for the manufacture of iron is. provided for. As the industry is in some measure already in existence. it is certain that the Treasurer will be asked for that money. Personally, I view with some concern the question of where the money is to come from. If we are to impose direct taxation, I shall not grumble, but I do think that we should know exactly where we are being landed. </para>

Indeed, such a statement would have had to be made even if no request had been preferred for it. </para>

                <para>Mr.J. H. CATTS.- If the honorable member can show me in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> any such reference I shall be prepared to resume my seat without further remark. It is known that the debate on this motion was adjourned. If there was no intention to make a financial statement before the motion was proceeded with why did not the Government go straight on with the debate at that time? As a matter of fact, the adjournment was agreed to, as every honorable member present understood, for the express purpose of enabling the Treasurer, who was then absent, to make a general financial statement before the motion was further proceeded with. I admit that the Prime Minister's words, if read apart from the debate, can be interpreted in the way he has explained them to-night. Like a number of his utterances, and like some of those of the leader of the Opposition, the words are quite capable of two interpretations. The Prime Minister puts on them the interpretation that suits his particular purpose to-night, whereas the understanding given to honorable members was quite different. If that is the course to be pursued by the Government, honorable members will not be prepared on similar occasions in the future to resume their seats in the belief that an undertaking given by the Prime Minister will be carried out. We recently passed an Old-age Pensions Act which, according to the estimate of the Government, will involve an expenditure of £1, 500,000, and, on the showing of other honorable members, considerably more. The right honorable member for Swan had an idea that a certain amendment rendered the Bill so much more liberal as to increase the cost from , £1,500,000 to , £3,000,000. If the Labour Party vote this money for an iron bounty, and it absorbs money which should pay old-age pensions, we shall deserve all the odium that will be heaped upon us by the poor old men and women of Australia.. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry to have been led away by an interjection. .When certain honorable members are under the impression that an understanding was arrived at for a financial statement to be delivered, a statement should, I think, be forthcoming; and the Prime Minister would be very well advised, in view of the difference of opinion on the point between himself and other honorable members, to fall in with the view which so many honorable members have expressed. Some of us are placed in a rather awkward position in regard to this Bill, because, if we understood that there was plenty of money for the purpose, we might be prepared to support it; but, as a matter of fact, we are altogether in the dark, and we have to see that the old-age pensions scheme does not suffer. It would be of no use our telling our constituents that we did not know there was no money available; we should be told that it was our business to know. We may be told that we ought to pass the Bill, and throw on the Government the responsibility of finding the money ; but the Government might feel inclined to provide the means by imposing duties on lea and kerosene. There, again, what would be our position before our constituents when we had, as it were, been the means of casting still further burdens on the poor? </para>

                        <para>- There is not only the £27,000 a year for an iron bonus, but other large expenditure contemplated ; arid in the face of it we are told that there is a considerable falling off in the Customs revenue, while at the same time negotiations are going on for the handing over to the States of a large portion of that revenue. Amongst the larger items of expenditure in the near future is that entailed by the defence scheme, and I ask what would be the position if the proposals of the Government were amended in such a way as to provide that men shall be recouped the loss of their wages ? Then there is the taking over of the Northern Territory,, and, possibly, the Federal Capital, though it is very likely that we should be told that there was no money available for the latter purpose. The further- proposal is to give a bonus on wire netting, wire making, and on shale oil, and, under the circumstances, it is not fair to ask honorable members, especially those who have any objection to the Bill, to give another vote to further its progress until there has been a financial statement. As one who has very great objections to revenue duties, I do not propose to vote for an expenditure which must be met largely from that source, because it only means further taxation of the poor, to which I offer my strongest opposition. Those people who have taken over the iron industry are reputed to be wealthy already, and I am only afraid that the money paid to them must be taken from that class of people who can least afford it.. I have had occasion before to think that understandings arrived at in this House are not carried out. Before the close of last session a number of statements were made by the Treasurer in regard to this Bill - though I know the honorable gentleman is reported in <inline font-style="italic">H amaral,</inline> to the contrary - and I left with a distinct impression that the Bill would not be gone on with ; but in Sydney the next day I saw that it had been brought under the notice of honorable members. Owing to the collapse of the debate on the Seat of Government Bill, this motion was introduced quite unexpectedly, and I know that the honorable member for Adelaide, who obtained the adjournment, desired to speak. The Government tell us that if we go on with the matter now we shall have an opportunity of considering any objectionable clauses on recommittal. But suppose that those who object to certain clauses are in a minority, and the majority refuses to recommit the Bill. Can the Government guarantee to the minority an* opportunity for discussing those features of the measure to which they object? There are clauses in the Bill which I have not had an opportunity of discussing. The Government would be well advised in furnishing the House with a general financial statement in accordance with the understanding that we had when the matter was last under consideration. Had the honorable member for South Sydney been present, I guarantee that he would have protested vigorously, because he went away under the impression that a financial statement would be made before the Bill was proceeded with further. I am sure that the honorable member for Flinders will also bear me out that there was an idea that a financial statement would be delivered. I certainly protest against the question being carried further until we have received an indication of the financial position such as we were lead to expect when the question was last before the House. </para>

                    <para>. - I have not addressed myself to the proposal now under consideration during the present Parliament, and I do not now propose to debate the merits of the question in detail. I am hot fond of the policy of granting bounties, but I recognise that there are occasions when an industry may be considerably helped by such means. If there are any industries that deserve consideration of this character the iron industry is certainly one. It is much more important than many other industries that have already been helped by bounty legislation. I have noticed that whilst a twopenny industry that perhaps employs three boys and a man can readily obtain assistance under Tariff legislation this very important iron industry, which is the mother of all other industries and without the development of which the country can never become great, receives little consideration at the hands of Parliament. I am prepared to consider the claims of the iron industry to consideration by means of a bounty, but I am not prepared to sacrifice other industries and other claims upon the financial resources of the Commonwealth. I want to be in a position to judge honestly upon all the available information what we can afford. The Treasurer has intimated that he can finance the present proposition. What I want to know is, to what extent other functions of the Federal Government will suffer as the result of the Treasurer's attempt to finance the iron industry. I want to know whether we can afford to permit other interests to suffer for the sake of the industry now in question. To what extent, for instance, shall we be prevented from overcoming the chronic condition of inefficiency reigning in the Post and Telegraph Department, and to what degree shall we dry up our resources for those purposes, if we grant  a  bounty to the iron industry? </para>

The Department furnishes the only means of communication between them and other centres of civilization..

                        <para>- I do not propose to discuss now the condition of. the Post Office ; I hold that in reserve for another occasion, when there will be a better opportunity to do justice to it. My present object is to give reasons for the postponement of this measure. I hold that it should not be gone on with until the Treasurer can inform us what money he will have for Postal development, Old-age Pensions, Defence, and other important matters. My position is not to be interpreted as one of hostility to the Bill. I shall do all I can to assist the iron industry ; but I must be seized of the facts. I cannot vote with my eyes shut, and must know first that money is legitimately available without the starvation of important Departments, and the lessening of the provision for the relief of the aged and invalid ; and, secondly, that the proposals will effect the object intended. My position is that the Minister cannot be given <inline font-style="italic">carte blanche</inline> at this stage. </para>
