                        <para>- I do not think that the States are likely to go to the banks, for an overdraft. The Commonwealth would see them through, should their financial position become serious; but I cannot promise to return, monthly, money which we' have determined shall be placed to the credit of trust funds for certain purposes. </para>

                        <para>- In the summary of the finances given by the Treasurer last night, the Post Office revenue is set down at £3,430,000, an increase of £200,000 or £300,000 upon that of this year. Is there to be a corresponding increase in expenditure, and is penny postage provided for? The expenditure during this year was larger by over 11 per cent. than that of last year ; but the increase in revenue was only 5 per cent. Is there to be a similar increase in the expenditure next year? </para>

                        <para>- I informed the honorable member, in reply to the representations of a deputation headed by him, that all I can do is to refer the matter to the Public Service Commissioner. It is only fair to that officer to say that the men who have unfortunately lost their employment at this particular season of the year, which makes their case all the harder, were really temporary employes, having no legal' claim to continuous work. However, I sympathize with them, and have asked the Public Service Commissioner to see if occupations can be found for them. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt that South Australia has suffered, and that some loss has also been incurred by Western Australia. I shall have a conversation with the Prime Minister regarding the matter, with a view to our determining whether some consideration cannot be extended to South Australia in respect of the loss she has suffered by the transference of a large body of work from the Eastern to the Pacific cable. I am sure that the honorable member will acknowledge that in the interests of the. Pacific cable, which is owned by the British Government and the Governments of other parts of the Empire - I think that we suffered in connexion with it last year a loss of£15,000 - it is our duty to utilize it as far as possible. </para>

Will he ask the Prime Minister and the rest of the Cabinet to consider the policy of the Government acquiring on behalf of the Commonwealth all the cable connexions in Australia, and of making them a means of safeguarding the defence of the Commonwealth? Further, will he make himself familiar with the attitude of the British Government and some of the most prominent statesmen of the Empire upon that phase of the question ? </para>

                        <para>- It has been brought to my knowledge that instructions, apparently emanating from the 'Defence' Department, have been issued to officers of the military forces requiring each to answer a question as to whether there is in his employment any Japanese person or persons. I, first of all, desire to ask whether that information is true, and, secondly, whether the Minister thinks it part of his duty to institute inquiries into the establishments of officers, and, then, whether, in his opinion, it is necessary for the discipline of the forces that the officers should be required to answer such inquiries ? </para>

                            <para>- There has been, altogether too much publicity in regard to our preparations at the forts. To obtain such information seems to be so simple that everybody knows all about everything. Very soon after I took office, various statements as to the publicity of information  relating to the whole of our forts having been made, I had the matter investigated, and found that, unfortunately, there was a good deal too much truth in the allegation ; and definite instructions have been given, which, if carried out, should have brought such publicity to an end. However, I shall make further inquiries. </para>

                        <para>This leakage is not confined to one political section, because every section seems to participate. I have come to the conclusion that a man who would be mean enough to give such information would be mean enough to deny having done so. There the matter at present rests, but if I find any member of the Forces guilty of such conduct as I have indicated, there will be no need for a Royal Commission. </para>

I desire to know whether' the Minister considers it necessary, for the efficiency and discipline of the Forces, that officers, living with their families in their own homes, should be interrogated as to the class or nationality of the servants they employ. If so, will the Minister go further and issue instructions for questions to be answered as to whether an officer employs a French cook or a German governess? And further I should like to know, in the event of an affirmative answer to these questions, why it is' thought necessary to make a distinction between the subjects of one friendly power and the subjects of another friendly power? </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to delay the course of public business, but I think that the position to which my attention was called last evening by a deputation from the Agricultural Implement Makers' Union is of sufficient importance to warrant me in bringing it under the notice of the House. The deputation informed me that at a meeting of the Union, which had been previously held, the following resolution had been adopted - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>That this union protests against the inaction of the authorities in the matter of the new protection policy, and the injustice thereby thrust upon the employes who were induced to favour protection to the employers on the understanding that protection would also be afforded to the workers, and who have also incurred heavy legal expenses in establishing their claim. </para>
                <para class="block">They further informed me that the award which they. had secured was not being faithfully observed, and that, though' specific cases of evasion of its terms have been reported to the Registrar of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, no action has been taken to compel employers to observe the award. They are of opinion that the authorities should at once enforce the award as they are entitled to the wages prescribed in the schedule laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, whatever the decision of the High CoUrt may be in the cases now pending. They further hold that the award is legal until proved otherwise by such decision.' When I was apprised of the fact that specific instances of evasions of the award of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins had been reported to the Registrar, I deemed the matter of sufficient importance to request the deputation to supply me with particulars. I came into the city early this morning, and they then furnished me with the information for which I asked - information which proves incontestably that specific instances in which the rates prescribed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins are not being paid have been reported to the Registrar. That being so, I submit that the Government cannot further evade their responsibility in this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, in referring to the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act of 1906,. in the first paragraph of his judgment, says - </para>
                <para>The Commonwealth Parliament has by this Act imposed certain Excise duties on agricultural implements; but it has provided that the Act shall not apply to goods manufactured in Australia " under conditions as to the remuneration of labour which are declared by the  President  of . the Court to be fair and reasonable." My sole duty is to ascertain whether the conditions of remuneration submitted to me are " fair and reasonable." I have not the function of finding out whether the rates of wages have, or have not, in fact been paid since the 1st of January, 1907, when this Act came into force. </para>
                <para class="block">That paragraph lays down a definite principle, namely, that the  President  of the Court was not charged with the duty of ascertaining whether or not the proper rates of wages had been paid since the 1st of January, when the Act became operative. But I am now directing attention to what has occurred since that decision was given. Upon page 2 of the report of the same judgment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins observes - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The ' provision for fair and reasonable remuneration is obviously designed for the benefit of the employes in the industry ; and it must be meant to secure to them something which they cannot get by the ordinary system of individual bargaining with employers. If Parliament meant that the conditions are to be fair and reasonable, where employes will accept and employers will give, in contracts of service, there would have been no need for this provision. The remuneration could safely ' be left to the usual, but unequal, contest, the "niggling of the market " for labour, with the pressure for bread on one side and the pressure for profits on the other. The standard of. " fair and reasonable ". must therefore be something else, and I  cannot  think of any other standard appropriate than the normal needs of the average employé regarded as a human being living in a civilized com'munity. ' </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">In the schedule . attached to his judgment the learned Judge set .out the wages which should be paid to each employe in the industry. In this connexion, I would remind honorable members that a very  handsome measure of protection has been extended to the manufacturers of agricultural implements - Parliament having imposed a duty of £12 per machine upon stripper harvesters, and of <inline font-style="italic">j£6</inline> per machine upon strippers. </para>

That fact indicates that, since the information was placed in -his possession, he has not lost any time in bringing it under the notice of the House. In the second place, I would remind the honorable member for Parramatta that  we are now at the close of the .session, and that if the honorable member for Wide Bay delayed.  taking action in the matter, he would lose the opportunity of bringing it forward. </para>

It is only fair I should say that the deputation informed me that there are quite a number of firms in Melbourne, who are absolutely obeying that award. The real difficulty is that if these firms are permitted to pay less wages than are being paid by more reputable firms, they will, eventually, drag the latter down to their own level. I have been told that the award is being violated so far as strikers are concerned, by a certain firm, the name of which, perhaps, I had. better withhold. </para>

It is also alleged that a contractor under another firm is paying less wages than he should pay under the award of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins.

All these facts have' been made known to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart,</inline> the Registrar of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. .

This would have been before the House had we the advantage of the High Court decision on several important aspects of the question. The Act came into force on 1stJanuary, 1907, and nothing could properly be done until the Court of Arbitration and Conciliation was able to deal with applications for exemption. The regulations governing the practice of the Court were issued by authority of the  President  on 27th March, 1907, and the  President  urged that no action should be taken in regard to enforcing payment of Excise until manufacturers interested had an opportunity of applying to the Court for exemption. A number of applications were dealt with by the  President  in New South Wales and South Australia in May and June, 1907, and exemptions were granted. The Victorian cases, which constituted the majority, were not heard until November, 1907, and exemption was refused in a number of cases. For that delay the Government cannot possibly be held responsible. But so soon as the applications were refused, we at once issued directions for the collection of Excise and the licensing of all manufacturers who had failed to comply with the conditions of exemption. The manufacturers so affected then associated, with a view of resisting the demands of the Government. </para>

                    <para>There was a uniform reluctance to. afford us any information, and whilst we met with few positive refusals there was an equally effective passive resistance to our requirements. On 10th January, 1908, a writ was issued against H. V. McKay for recovery of the duties on all excisable goods manufactured by him from 1st January,1907. A further writ was issued against W. Barger for manufacturing without a licence, the manufacturer having failed to pay the standard rates of wages. These were typical cases on which the liability of all the manufacturers would be determined, and no good purpose would have been served by issuing further writs. </para>

                    <para>We had an alternative of seizing all goods subject to Excise in the hands of the manufacturers who had not complied with the conditions. It was not wise or expedient to take such a course. Upon the decision of the High Court being given in favour of the Government there will be little difficulty in enforcing the law in regard to payment of Excise in every case where a manufacturer has failed to pay the standard rate of wages. As some misapprehension exists on the subject it may be pointed out that we have no power to enforce the payment of the standard rates of wages. </para>

                    <para>We may only enforce the payment of excise if such standard rates of wages have not been paid. The excise provisions are for the purpose of encouraging the payment of the standard rate of wages, but the Act gives the manufacturer the alternative of paying such wages, or, in default, to pay the excise. It need hardly be said that the Government is entirely in sympathy with the principles of the Act, and that every possible effort has been and shall be made to enforce its equitable and highly necessary provisions. Whilst, however, the steps for its enforcement are before and subject to the decision of the High Court, honorable members will realize that until such decision is made known, it is impossible for us to take any further definite proceedings. </para>

The onus of enforcing the law should not be thrown on the employes ; the Ministry should see that this, like other laws, is obeyed. On the face of it. the Act is sufficient. It enacts that certain duties are not to be imposed, if, and so long as, manufacturers pay fair rates of wages. What such rates are has been set forth in a decision by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. Some manufacturers are not paying such rates. It is of no use talking about the decision of the High Court, because the Act automatically comes into force  immediately a machine is placed on the market, if it has not been made under the conditions set forth by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. </para>

                        <para>- In reply, I say that it is no part of the duty of the Government to anticipate the defeat of it's policy by the Judicature. If we are here, under the sword of the Judiciary, and we are never to enforce our legislation unless and until it has been approved after appeal, we are no longer the supreme body in the Commonwealth, and are in danger of degenerating to that position which has so keenly exercised the minds of the wisest in America, where legislation has long been altogether subservient to the Supreme Court, and where the government is said to be government by injunction. Here we have a class of persons, who are everlastingly decrying class legislation, and setting up the " law-abiding faculty and instinct as being essential to civilization, deliberately flouting and disregarding the law - resorting to every trick, artifice, and shift to evade  legislation passed for the benefit of the people. The contract which has been entered into is a three-sided one - it is between the Government as representing the people, the manufacturers, and the employes. The employers are receiving all that we, on behalf of the people, declared they should receive, and yet they, in the most contemptible way, decline to pay their employes a reasonable wage. Every effort ought to be strained to bring those people to book, and I think that, under section 6 of the Australian Industries Preservation Act a remedy may be found. Section 4 of that Act provides - </para>

                <para class="block">It has been laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins what is an adequate remuneration for persons engaged in this industry; and it has been alleged by the honorable member for Wide Bay that certain persons are not paying that wage. It is very clear that competition between the persons who are paying the statutory wage, and those who decline to pay the statutory wage, cannot but be unfair. As suggested by the honorable member for Wide Bay, it is pretty obvious that the employers who are now paying the statutory wage will say, "If other manufacturers can be permitted to have their machines made at a lower wage, why should we pay the higher rate?" Therefore, I contend that such competition is calculated to bring about inadequate remuneration over the whole field of this particular industry. Under the circumstances I am of opinion that the offending manufacturers can be proceeded against under the Australian Industries Preservation, Act, quite independently of the fact that the High Court has not yet decided whether the Excise Act is constitutional. This adequate remuneration which is spoken of is not determined by Statute - it must be adequate remuneration, whether determined by Statute, by arrangement amongst the employers, or by arrangement between the employers and the employes ; and if it is inadequate, and calculated to bring about disorganization and unfair competition, it constitutes an offence. In my opinion the Government ought to set this part of the Act into force at once, because, as I have said, it is quite independent, and will remain independent, of any decision of the High Court on the Excise Act, on which it is in no way contingent. The possibility of good employers reducing their rates to the level of those paid by bad employers must, of course, be considered, but independently of that, the Government have a very clear opportunity for showing the utility of the Act, which was brought in with a great flourish of trumpets, but which apparently stands on a level with the Excise Act as absolutely futile, and in grave danger of becoming farcically futile, thus placing the Parliament of the country in the most humiliating position. The Excise Act was the standard-bearer and the trumpeter of the great forces of the new protection which were to rectify anomalies and injustice ; but the Government come down now and say that they cannot do anything because the red-tape of the High Court has bound them up.  I have pointed out, however, another Act under which they could proceed,' but they decline to try to put it into force ; indeed, so far as I know, such an idea has never dawned upon them. </para>

                        <para>- During the last few days legislation of the most supreme importance has been passed within a few hours; and yet the Treasurer told us, a little while ago, that in the case of the stripper harvesters nothing can be done. We only need a Government determined to carry out its policy - nothing is impossible to a Government with a majority behind them. As I say, we have, during this week, sufficient evidence of what can be done by the legislative machine when it makes up its mind ; and, therefore, there is absolutely no reason why effect should not be given to this legislation, which is one of the vital parts of the Government's policy. If we go into recess, not knowing' what is to become of this most important corollary of the Government policy, we, who are supporting the Government, will be placed in a most unfortunate and invidious position.

                        <para>- The present position in regard to the policy and intentions of the Government is quite unsatisfactory. First of all, if the Excise Act is useless, it ought to have been amended ; it ought not to have been allowed to be demonstrably futile for a single day. Legislation may be good or bad, but, at any rate, it ought to be capable of being given effect to ; and as the Australian Industries Preservation Act provides a means for dealing with the employers, I call upon the Government to put in force the sections I have read. If these sections are not sufficient, the Act ought to be sent to the legislative lumber room, and we ought to start afresh with legislation capable of dealing with a matter so important. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to refer to the constitutional question which is now before the High Court, nor to the policy of new protection, which, later on, there will be' an opportunity to discuss. As one who has had some communication with the manufacturers, having introduced deputations on their behalf to the Minister, I have no hesitation in saying that the administration of the Act has been characterized by the most lamentable ineptitude of which any Government could be guilty. The Act came into operation in January, 1907, and it- was not until May or June of that year that the first Court under it was established. Courts were established first of all in South Australia and New South Wales, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor, who presided, fixed the rates of wages payable in the industry in those States, and allowed certain exemptions to certain manufacturers. But it was not until nine or ten months after the passing of the Act that the first Court in Victoria was established, and I have never heard any reasonable explanation of the delay. The result of this delay was that manufacturers who must be regarded as being quite as reputable as any other class in the community, were called upon by the Minister to pay excise for not complying ' with conditions of which it was impossible for them to have any knowledge. . Excise was demanded on machinery made during the ten months prior to the first sitting of the Court in Victoria. . That was manifestly unjust, and reflected seriously on the equity of the administrative power. We now have a complaint made by the leader of the Labour Party respecting the non-enforcement of certain penalties for failure to observe the conditions imposed under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins' award, in respect of the industry in Victoria. My understanding of the position is that some manufacturers here refused to obey that award, in order that a test case might be brought before the High Court. Had the. Act been properly and efficiently administered,  steps would have been taken to have the rates of wages payable in the industry fixed at the earliest possible moment after it came into operation. Had the Act been efficiently administered, the injustice which has been suffered not only by a large number of workers, but by many manufacturers, would not have occurred. The manufacturers were given no opportunity to make arrangements to carry on their industry in accordance with the terms of this Act before the Court in Victoria fixed the rates of wages payable in this State. The administrative bungle which has taken place is due to the ineptitude of the Government now in power, and I enter my protest against the way in which certain people have been dragooned owing to the action of the Minister. </para>

The Bill was rushed through the House without proper consideration.* No division took place upon it, and there was no opposition from this side of the Chamber, save that a few honorable members pointed out the probable consequences of the passing of such a measure. It has become the custom in this Chamber, when an industrial measure is under consideration, to suggest that an honorable member who dares to raise an objection to any feature of it is an enemy to all that makes for the welfare of the working classes. It is time that a better spirit prevailed in the House if our legislation in this direction is to be efficient and such as will contribute to the uplifting and comfort of the workers of Australia. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not want to appear to be nasty ; but I think that I am entitled to make these observations, considering the abuse that has been heaped upon my head when measures of this class have been before the House. The cause of much of the present trouble is the want of careful consideration of such measures on the part of the House, and the denunciation of honorable members on this side when they dare to criticise them. We have had a lot of legislation rushed through the House, for the most part without any knowledge of its features on the part of those who voted for it. This is not a solitary example. We have had illustration after illustration of the evil results of hasty legislation. And honorable members will never secure the new protection until they are prepared to spend more time in preparing and considering the necessary machinery, and bringing their intelligence to bear upon it as we all ought to do. I say this altogether apart from any question of policy. There is certainly something in the contention of the honorable member for West Sydney .that action ought to be taken in regard to this matter. But when he made that statement the only reply he got from the Treasurer was " Talk sense." That is the answer given to the appeal of the Labour Party after they have passed the Tariff on which this question is founded. To-day they are told to " Talk sense " ; when the Tariff was before u= they were -told that the millennium was approaching. It is about time that honorable members of the Labour Party who, I am sure, are sincerely interested in legislation of this kind resented such treatment. It is the duty of the Minister administering this Act to see that any manufacturer who is not complying with its conditions, pays the Excise into a trust account, pending the decision of the High Court. That surely could be done. </para>

                        <para>- And the honorable member and his colleagues are responsible for permitting them to do so. We are discussing not the policy of this question, but the need for honorable observance of the legislation of this Parliament. Either the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act is a mere political placard, on it is to be observed. It seems to me, however, that it is not intended for use. The same remark will apply to most of the industrial legislation that has been passed by this Parliament. What about our antitrust legislation ? It is a long time since we passed the Australian Industries Preservation Act, yet no action has been taken under it to bring any trusts to book. We have had nothing more from the Ministry than a promise to take action. Most of the industrial legislation that we . have passed has simply been used by the Government to cajole the House into passing high protective duties. Having done that, Ministers have subsequently repudiated their part of the obligation. </para>

They say that they are, and if we dare to express sympathy with the workers, we" are denounced by them.. Only the other day in another .place a fierce attack was made upon honorable members outside the Labour Party for presuming even to suggest that they were in favour of old-age pensions. The position is the same here. If a member of the Opposition dares to support an industrial measure, he is denounced by the Labour Party as a hypocrite. On the other hand, if he criticises any provision in it he is described as a traitor to labour. It is time a better spirit was shown if trie workers of the. community are to reap full advantage from our industrial statutes. Ministers should be held to their trust in this matter. If manufacturers in this industry are not treating their employes as this House intended,, they ought to be called upon to pay the Excise <inline font-style="italic">t-y</inline> the Minister to be held in trust pending the decision of the High Court. Either let us enforce this legislation or repeal it. Do  not let us have perpetrated in connexion with this .Act the farce that has been witnessed in connexion with other industrial legislation, lt is enough to bring the cause of labour into the utmost contempt when such proceedings are allowed to take .place. </para>

                        <para>- Then it would appear that if any of the States institute proceedings to test the constitutionality of the Surplus Revenue Bill which we passed the other day the Treasurer, pending the decision of that case, will not retain any of our surplus revenue and no money will be paid into the trust fund for old-age pensions. The two cases are on exactly the same footing, and the Minister is extending an invitation to the States to challenge our legislation. The Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act is the  law  of the land until the High Court rules otherwise. If manufacturers decline to pay the workers the rates of wages which have been fixed according to law, we are not going to do anything to assist them. Men in this industry are being sweated by their employers. The workers, at their own expense, took proceedings before the High Court, and won. The' honorable member for Franklin has asserted that the facts, to which the honorable member for Wide Bay has called attention, were known when the members of the Agricultural Implement Employes Union brought their case before the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. But I would point out to him that the position to-day is a very different one, inasmuch as an award has since been given. That award, I maintain, should be faithfully observed. But I do not suggest that we ought to suspend the duties levied upon agricultural implements until the terms of that award have been complied with. It is admitted by the members of the Union that many employers are paying fair wages to their workmen, and I contend that we have no right to penalize them, because of trie action of unscrupulous employers. The Treasurer has stated that the only way in which the Government could enforce the observance of the "award of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins would be by seizing the implements manufactured by the firms who are disregarding it, and, in the event of. such action being taken, those firms might sue the Government in the High Court, and, perhaps, obtain substantial damages. I hold that, if only one workman is being deprived of his right wage, it is the duty of the Government to take. action. They should compel the observance of the terms of the award of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. I trust that some action will be taken to insure that the workers shall obtain their fair share of the protection which has been granted to our agricultural implement makers. </para>

                    <para>.- I am glad that this question has been brought forward, but. I regret that it has been raised in the form of a motion for an adjournment. I am one of those who voted for the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, not as a mere make-believe dr a placard, but as a law which was intended to be enforced. Indeed, my main objection to a protectionist Tariff has been that it takes from the many for the benefit of the few. That objection, however, will be materially minimized if the workers are granted their fair share of the protection afforded. I am sorry that' the honorable member for Wide Bay has not attempted to bring the Government to the bull ring in connexion with this matter, just as the honorable member, for Gwydir did upon the question of postal administration a few weeks ago. Apparently, we are now awaiting the tardy decision of the High Court in the cases in which the validity of the new protection legislation, enacted by this House, has-been challenged. In the meantime I submit that the law should be enforced. The analogy drawn by the honorable member for Yarra in reference to the action of the Treasurer in connexion with the Surplus Revenue Bill was a singularly appropriate one. I am ' surprised that the Labour Party should allow the existing state of things to continue without taking further action. </para>

I regret that a straight-out motion has not been submitted, in which' case I. should have moved an amendment somewhat similar to that which I moved when the honorable member for Wide Bay brought forward his proposal  affirming the urgency of the question of old-age pensions. </para>

                    <para>. - I have never heard a more unsatisfactory statement than that given by the Treasurer to-day in reply to the remarks of the honorable member for Wide Bay. He told us that the employers had adopted an attitude of passive resistance to the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act. Yet the Government, instead of dealing with them, remain absolutely inactive, I venture to say that if 100 employes in different parts of the Commonwealth had flouted any law upon our statute-book they would have been punished for their transgression long ago. The Treasurer has sought to shelter himself behind the High Court from the responsibility which should attach to the inaction of the Government. But I say that this matter might have been settled by that tribunal more than twelve months ago. ' At that time I brought under the notice of the House specific cases in which the award of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins was not being observed by employers. . An inquiry was instituted by the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the employer admitted that he. was not complying with the law. . But yet no proceedings have been taken against him. Had he been prosecuted the whole question of the liability of employers under the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act would have been settled before the new Tariff was passed. I do not think that it would be wise to suspend the operation of the Customs duties levied upon agricultural implements. </para>

                    <para>. - Though I am opposed to the new protection policy of  the Government, I maintain that the provisions of- the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act ought to be enforced. It seems to me that the Treasurer is more in favour of granting protection to the manufacturer than he is of  extending it to the worker. Otherwise he would see that effect was given to the Act upon our statute-book. We ought not to suspend the operation of that Act, pending the decision of the High Court. It is the duty of the Executive to give effect to it. If the honorable member for Wide Bay presses his motion to a division I- shall be Found voting with him. Let us bring about a crisis by insisting that the pro: visions of the Statute to which I have alluded shall be enforced. The working classes of this country are being called upon to pay 'an excessive amount in order to. extend protection to our manufacturers, and yet the Government decline to grant them the benefit of our legislation in regard to the new protection. As an excuse they plead the law's delay. Evidently they are anticipating that the judgment of the High Court will be against the validity of that legislation. The Labour Party supported the extension of a high measure of protection to manufacturers in order to enable the latter to pay reasonable wages to their workmen. The Government are now going back upon their supporters. By their inaction they have conclusively proved that they are not in favour of the new protection, but that they prefer the old protection, which means protection for manufacturers alone. </para>

Had the scheme suggested by the honorable member for Wide Bay been adopted, there is no doubt whatever that effect could have been , given to it constitutionally. It may have been somewhat cumbersome, but it was certainly a practicable scheme, following as it did exactly upon the lines laid down in connexion with 'the sugar bounty. The Government, however, chose to bring forward a different scheme, and it is their duty to give effect to it. </para>

                    <para>. - I enter my protest against this Bill, notwithstanding that the majority has assented to it's general principles. The objections which I first urged to the granting of bounties for the production of iron have become stronger with time. When  this proposition was first made our financial position was not so unsatisfactory. We had an overflowing Treasury, and comparatively few calls upon the revenue, whereas at present, apart from the old-age pensions fund, it is doubtful whether our one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue will be more than sufficient to pay for any services necessary for the good government of the Commonwealth. In dealing with this question nearly two years ago I showed what our financial commitments 'were, and urged the unwisdom of expending £250,000 on bounties when the same amount of encouragement could be given "to the iron industry by the imposition of protective duties. Those interested in the production of iron in Australia stated before the Iron Bonus Commission, and have repeated since, that they prefer a duty. That statement has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jamieson,</inline> who owned the Blythe River mines, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins,</inline> the present proprietor of the Lithgow ironworks. </para>

                        <para>- Such a duty would do no injustice to if. It has been calculated by the Customs Department - and I myself arrived at the same conclusion by an independent investigation - that a duty of121/2per cent. on pig iron would be equivalent to about21/2 per cent. on the finished product. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is more than that. There was a substantial increase in the duties on many kinds of machinery, though I regret that in some other instances the increases were not much. As a member of the Iron Bonus Commission, I asked representatives of leading engineering firms what it would be worth to them to be able to get supplies at short notice from local iron-works for any order they might have to fill, and their estimate was that they could afford to pay from  5  to71/2percent. more for their iron to obtain that advantage, because it would obviate the necessity of keeping large stocks. Furthermore, the engineering firms have been benefited by the new Tariff, and should share their advantages with those who are endeavouring to establish the basic industry. I do not suppose that a speech at this stage will have any tangible result. Personally, I think that the production of iron should be a Government monopoly, but I recognise that the majority is against me, and that therefore it is useless to insist further. Australia has a great deal at stake in this matter, and the position of our finances certainly makes it wiser to impose a duty of  121/2  per cent. than to expend  £250,000  a year in bounties.. </para>

                        <para>-Yes. One never knows where the adoption of a bounty system will lead. I recognise that the Treasurer desires to establish the iron industry, and therefore I point out to him that in this Chamber probably at least as many honorable <inline font-style="italic">members</inline> would support the imposition of a duty as would support the granting of a bounty. </para>

                        <para>- In that connexion, those honorable members who are now crying out for a duty voted against me, with the result that150 men were discharged the other day ; and the statement is made that it is practically impossible to carry on the industry without using inferior material, and, of course, producing an inferior article. I should certainly like to see a bonus given on the. manufacture of wire netting in the absence of any protective duty. There is a provision in the Bill that at any time the iron industry may be taken over by a State, and, whether or not that be called Socialism, it provides a start on a sound footing. I should be rejoiced to see any State lend its support to an industry of the kind. On one occasion, an effort was. made to get one of the States to undertake this enterprise, but that effort was not successful ; and I am sure that the Federal Government would be only too glad to assist any State which purposes to take over the industry under the clause I have provided in the Bill. This iron industry is not only most desirable as a means of developing the wealth of the country, but it is necessary for the manufacture of defence material, all of which we should be able to manufacture here, ' instead of purchasing abroad, as we had to do in the time of the South African war. I am not particular as to what means are adopted to inaugurate this industry, so long as it is inaugurated ; and  to that end I hope I shall have the. support of honorable members who may not quite approve of the present proposals. </para>

                        <para>- The cost is £304,000, or £60,800 per annum for five years. I do not know how far it would be wise to reduce the amount or the time limit. However, I shall consider that question when we come to deal with the schedule ; but I think that if the work were once commenced, the time might be reduced to three years, and the amount proportionately. I am sure the establishment of this industry will prove acceptable to the people, both on the ground of sentiment and on the material ground of profit to the community. I have had a conversation with the proprietor of the Lithgow works, and I do not think that he would be opposed to some modification of the kind I have just indicated. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for South Sydney fears that the financial position of the Commonwealth does not justify the payment of a bounty in the iron industry. I point out, however, that, up to 1922, bounties on cotton, fibres, oil, coffee, and so forth - the production of which is not really so important to the country as that of iron - will involve an expenditure of £339,000. This means that we are prepared to vote £70,000 a year in bounties on tropical productions, while we deny assistance to the same extent to the iron industry. I should think that the honorable member for South Sydney ought to welcome the proposal, even from his own point of view, . because, if his fears prove to have any foundation, the nearer we shall be to that stage when taxation of a direct character will be necessary. </para>

Surely honorable members opposite are not merely protectionists within a certain area of the country, though I understand that the honorable member for Nepean is very anxious to have a bonus on iron ? ' Some of the New South Wales industries do require protection, and I am pleased to note that the Government intend to do something for the wire netting industry. </para>

                        <para>- I am going to show that an expenditure of £50,000 per annum for the next five years, will be totally inadequate to establish the iron industry here. In Canada, which has a population nearly double that of Australia, the application of the bounty system to the industry has been a failure. As far back as 1883, the Dominion Parliament voted a bounty of 6s. 3d. per ton on all pig iron manufactured there. That bounty was continued until 1889, when it was reduced to 4s. 2d. per ton. It was. then found that the industry was dying out under the reduced bounty, and in 1892, the payments were accordingly increased to 8s. 4d. per ton. That scale of payment was. continued for some years, and in 1894, during the operation of the Act of 1892, a further Bill was passed, authorizing the Governor in Council to pay not only a bounty of 8s. 2d. on every ton of pig iron produced in Canada, but an additional bounty of 8s. 2d. per -ton on puddled bars made in Canada from Canadian pig iron, made from Canadian ore. Those bounties were applicable till March, 1899, to furnaces in existence in 1894, and from 1899, for five years after the furnaces commenced operations. The Act was repealed in 1897 by an Act which authorized the Governor in Council to pay a bounty of 12s. 6d. per ton on steel ingots, manufactured from ingredients not less than 50 per cent. of the weight of which consisted of pig iron, made in Canada. It was found necessary to give a bounty for the manufacture of steel ingots, 50 per cent. of the raw material of which was imported. That course was taken because it was found, as it has been elsewhere,' that it would be impossible to make a success of the industry if manufacturers were limited to one class of iron. The Act of 1897 also authorized the payment of a bounty of12s...6d per ton on puddled iron bars, made from Canadian pig . iron ; a bonus of 12s. 6d. per ton on pig iron made from Canadian ore, and a bonus of 8s. 4d. per ton on the proportion produced from imported material. An Act of1899 limited the time during which the payments should be made, and provided for a yearly diminishing -rate of bounty. It was found that under that Act the iron industry was practically dying out, and in 1903, it became necessary to introduce another Bill providing for the payment of a. bounty of 25s. per ton on rolled-wire rods; 12s. 6d. per ton on other rolled shapes ; and 12s. 6d. per ton on rolled plates, manufactured in Canada, of which not less than 50 per cent. consisted of pig iron, made in Canada. A point to which I wish to draw special attention is that it was found necessary, in order to encourage various manufactures of iron, to grant a bounty on the production of rolled plates, made partly of imported pig iron. That was necessary to secure the variety absolutely essential to various industries. In 1904, the aggregate capacity of the furnaces started in Canada under the bounty system was equal to an annual output of over 1,000,000 tons per annum, but they were turning out only 278,219 tons per annum. In 1904, the bounty paid on the material produced from Canadian ore, was only £25,000, while that paid on manufactures from imported material was £110,000. Those who say that we shall be able, by the payment of bounties amounting to £250,000, to establish the iron industry in Australia, are flying directly in the face of the experience of Canada, where there is a much greater variety of ore available. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that we have in Australia ample supplies of iron ore to establish this industry, but the application of the bounty system to the industry in Canada has proved a failure. Between 1895 and1906, there was paid, by way of bounty, £900,000 on the production of pig iron, £23,000 on puddled iron bars, £600,000 on steel bars, and £134,000 on manufactures of steel, or a  total of £1,717,000. Those payments were made after the industry had been bounty-fed for nearly twenty-five years. Then, again, we have to remember in this connexion that Canada has a population of some 7,000,000, whereas the population of Australia is less than 4,500,000. As the result of the introduction of the sliding scale of payments, the production of iron in Canada fell from 404,000 tons in 1902; to 264,000 tons in 1903, or a decrease of about 40 per cent. In view of these facts, is it not absurd to imagine that we can establish the industry by expending £50,000 per annum for four years? </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to take the responsibility of my action. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jamieson, Mr. Keats,</inline> End <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline> all appeared before the Commission, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keats</inline> stated that £250,000 was too insignificant a sum to provide for the establishment of the industry. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keats</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> urged that a duty would be necessary. Indeed, the evidence of all the ironmasters examined was that as soon as the payment of bounties ceased, a duty would be absolutely necessary. If that be the case, would it not be more businesslike to impose a duty upon iron, and thus enable them to understand exactly their position? If men embark upon this industry with the aid of a bounty, and, on the expiration of the period over which that bounty extends, find themselves unable to continue operations in the absence of such assistance, is this House prepared to continue that bounty indefinitely? Let us treat the iron industry' in exactly the same way as we have treated almost every other industry in the Commonwealth. What has been the experience of Canada in connexion with the iron bounty? Despite the fact that its Tariff duties range from 25 to 30 per cent., the Government of that Dominion have been paying a bounty upon the production of iron ever since 1883. No later than the year 1905, a special plea was made to that Government, not merely to continue the bounty, but to increase it from $2 to $3 per ton, as otherwise the industry would cease to exist. Upon the last day of the session, why should an attempt be made to rush this Bill through the Parliament? I submit that it should have been dealt with a month ago, when honorable members would have been afforded an opportunity of inquiring into the effect which it is likely to have upon the iron industry. </para>

What possible interest could I have in opposing this Bill if I thought that its effect would be to successfully establish the iron industry? As a matter of fact, there are very close friends of mine interested in the industry, and I am glad to say that they view my attitude towards the Bill in a very different light from the Treasurer. They credit me with sincerity. I ask : " Is it right to bring forward this Bill upon the last day of thesession?" </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Franklin has practically delivered a second-reading speech upon this Bill. I understood that the general principle of the measure had already been affirmed by the House. I quite agree with the honorable member that "we ought not to be called upon in the dying hours of the session to consider such an important question1. But I know that the matter is one of urgency, on account of the critical condition of the ironworks at Lithgow, which require immediate assistance. I would, therefore, suggest to the Treasurer that the whole question should be re-opened next session. The honorable member for Franklin is quite right in his statement that a bounty of £250,000 will prove utterly inadequate to successfully establish the iron industry. If we are going to attack this problem in a practical way, we shall require to authorize an expenditure of not less than £1,000,000. However, I believe that an understanding has been arrived at that this Bill shall be allowed to pass without 'opposition. That being so, I shall not occupy the time of the Committee any further. I suggest that we should pass the Bill without delay, so as to afford another Chamber an opportunity of dealing with it. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad of that assurance. It is only right that the expenditure authorized under this Bill shall find its way into the pockets of those whom it is intended to assist, and not into the coffers of the New South Wales Government. I understand the Treasurer has intimated that he intended to consider the question of whether it would not be wise to reduce the period over which the  proposed  bounty will extend. I would point out to him that if that period be reduced the whole of the bounty will be pocketed by one firm. </para>

                        <para>- In that case I am perfectly satisfied. I should like, however, to make one or two remarks in reply to the observations of the honorable member for Batman, who taunted the representatives of New South Wales with having voted against the imposition of high protective duties during the recent Tariff debate, whilst supporting the granting of a bounty to the iron industry of that State. Upon every occasion I voted to give effect to a policy of free-trade. But there are some honorable members who profess to be protectionists, but who are merely geographical protectionists - who voted to extend protection to the industries of their own State, but adopted an entirely different attitude where the industries of other States were concerned. Some of those honorable members were prepared to vote in favour of extending protection to the twopenny half-penny mushroom industries on the banks of the Yarra, but, fortunately, their vaunted protectionist principles did not extend beyond the limits of Victoria. </para>

                    <para>. - I am in favour of this Bill, and intend to support' it. We want to encourage the iron industry, and we are not prepared to place a duty upon pig or other iron, which is the raw material of so many industries. But, whilst I desire to assist those who have exhibited a great deal of enterprise in embarking upon the industry, I do not wish to pass a Bill of this character for their exclusive benefit, and I think the opportunity should be given for  others to enter upon the business and secure a portion of the bounty. I noticed that under class 1 of the schedule the bounty is to be operative over a period of only four and a half years. The production of goods coming under class 2 will be encouraged by bounty for only two and a half years, and the production of reapers and binders for only a year. Those provisions seem equivalent to paying bounties to those already engaged in this business with a view to increasing their profits, and I intend, when we get to the schedule, to ask the Treasurer to extend the period during which bounties will be payable. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the Treasurer has considered the financial side of this question. Does he propose to place to a trust. fund the money required for the payment of these bounties? We have been appropriating so largely during the past twenty -four hours that I am afraid some of his proposed trust funds accounts will have to go short. Under the Bill we are entering into a contract with manufacturers, the payment of bounties must take precedence of everything else. We have now appropriated £750,000 for old-age pensions, £250,000 for defence, £250,000 for agricultural bounties, and a very large sum for the sugar bounties. </para>

We should be informed by the Treasurer how he proposes to get the money to meet all these appropriations.

                        <para>- I have corroboration all round as to the truth of what I say ; and, so far as I am concerned, there will be no Manufactures Encouragement Bill unless the workers get a share of the benefit. I agree with the honorable member for Wide Bay that it is preferable to refer this matter to an independent tribunal rather than to the Minister, especially if the Bill is to be  administered as has been the Excise (Agricultural Machinery) Act. . The trouble is that, although there are a few Wages Boards in South Australia, there is not one  which  applies to the iron industry; and it is not unlikely that we may give a bounty to induce the Broken Hill Proprietary to provide furnaces at Port  Pirie, in close proximity to the finest iron deposits in Australia. In South Australia we have been trying for years to have Wages Boards created. </para>

                        <para>- The experience is that it is necessary to have a tribunal to deal with every industry in . the Commonwealth. There are, of course, employers prepared to pay fair wages, but there are others who do quite the opposite; indeed, there is one man in Victoria, who calls himself a reputable employer, and yet he pays married men wages as low as £i per week. I 'may add, however, that the men employed in the industry to which I am now incidentally referring will very soon be under a Wages Board. In South Australia a Wages Board cannot be created until a resolution has passed both Houses, and those who know the Legislative Council in that State will realize the difficulties in the way. </para>

                        <para>- The difficulty is that we cannot leave this matter to the Commonwealth authority, because, under the Constitution, its power in industrial matters is confined to disputes which extend beyond the limits of one State. There may be no dispute, or, if so, it probably may not extend for some time into another State. It will not do to leave this power to the Minister. Not only is it extremely undesirable that the political head should control, and have the power from time to time to control, the conditions of a particular business, but there is a constitutional difficulty- </para>

IRVINE.- Whatever the differences may be between the Minister and the honorable member for Hindmarsh, I certainly agree with the suggestion made by the latter that we ought to embody in this Bill, before we send it to another place, a clause that will give effect to our desire.

                        <para>- I admit that; but I would remind the honorable member that there was recently an extended argument on this subject before the High Court. Without desiring to anticipate the judgment, I would point out that lengthy arguments took place on the question of whether it is constitutional for this Parliament to attach to a bounty conditions with regard to rates of pay, and. hours of labour. That is a doubtful point, and has not yet been decided. Therefore, it would be unwise to attempt by this Bill to give  the Minister power to do something which possibly we may not do ourselves. The only form which the suggested clause could properly take is that of providing that there shall be remitted to some State industrial authority the determination of the rates of wages; the hours of labour, and so forth, to prevail in the industry. I recognise that it might be desirable to enable the manufacturers to go on with their operations before such matters can be referred to a State industrial authority. The present conditions may not be unfair, and the Minister should not be prevented from paying bounties even for the period before the questions relating to conditions of labour could be referred to the Court. But either side should have- the opportunity to apply to a State industrial authority, and if the conditions of labour and rates of wages determined by that authority are not observed, the Minister should not be at liberty to pay' any further bounties. There would be no difficulty in drafting such an amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- It is refreshing to see the anxiety exhibited by free-trade members to protect the iron industry. I understand that an amendment has been carried which requires that before a bounty shall be payable upon .galvanized iron it must have been made' from ore produced within the Commonwealth, and that a further proposal has been submitted under which a bounty will be payable in respect of wire-netting - except that produced by prison labour - made from imported wire. I do not object to that. But, of course, the amount provided for the purpose will not go very far. </para>

                        <para>- It will not suffice for one year. However, I am in favour of assisting the industry, and -the amendment will have the effect of keeping the manufacturers of wire-netting "up to the collar." As a result of the expenditure of this £50,000, I believe that our farmers and pastoralists, will obtain their wire-netting cheaper than they do to-day. </para>

                    <para>.- I am  sorry that this matter did not come on for discussion earlier, so that some honorable members who are supporting this proposal might have been' afforded an opportunity, of voting for the imposition of a duty .upon the raw material and for the free admission of the finished article. I do not intend to go back on any vote that I have cast in this Hous'e. But I do know that if this industry had been located in Victoria, or in any other State except New South Wales, the Bill would have had no chance of being passed through the House to-day. Every honorable member upon the other side of the chamber has now been a protectionist upon some item - either upon wire netting, puddled bar iron, pig iron, or something else. I fail to see why prison-made wire netting produced in Australia  should be prevented from participating in the proposed bounty, seeing that it would not compete with any established industry. </para>

The Tariff itself is the best answer to his gibe that we are geographical protectionists. If he will compare the industries of New South Wales with those of his own State he will readily find an answer to all that he said. However, I rise chiefly for the purpose of offering my sincere congratulations to the secretary of the Labour Party in this Parliament upon his magnificent attempt this afternoon to sweat down the wages of the wire-workers of Australia by bringing them into competition with bounty fed prison labour. </para>

                    <para>- Upon the present occasion I find myself in a very unfortunate position. I was a member of the Royal Commission which was appointed to inquire into the conditions surrounding the iron industry, and after listening carefully to the evidence adduced by that body, I cast my vote with the minority. I did not intend to alter that vote, but in view of the fact that the gentlemen with whom I have been associated fiscally for so long have seen fit to support this measure, I can only follow in their admirable and honorable footsteps. I cordially echo the remarks of the honorable member for Parramatta in denouncing in the most enthusiastic way the attempt of Victoria to compete by means of prison labour with the free labour of the State which I represent. If that sort of thing is to be encouraged, obviously it would be wise for this State to incarcerate as many able-bodied wire-workers as possible with the object of building up the industry. Such a state of things ought not to be tolerated for a moment. Since we have to choose between the imposition of a duty and the payment of a bounty I shall vote in favour of the adoption of the latter course. </para>

                    <para>.- This is a Bill which has been introduced for the purpose of encouraging the production of iron in Australia. Under these circumstances it is only right that that iron should be manufactured from the raw material produced in Australia. I have no objection to urge against the imposition of a duty upon wire-netting. But this House has already decided that a certain duty shall be levied upon that article. The Bill is designed to assist Australian manufactures ; but, as the schedule is drawn up, those who are now making wire netting will be able to mop up the whole of the bounty for the manufacture of wire. </para>

I cannot understand the Treasurer suggesting that this provision  is designed to give a bounty to Messrs. Lysaght. If he wishes to do that, he should embody the proposition in a special Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- When the Tariff Commission was taking evidence, it was informed that a man working an imported machine received 8s. 6d. for turning out 1,200 yards of wire netting, the labour cost of making the netting being about 12s. .a mile. But the bounty now being offered is equivalent to 48s. If the netting were being woven out of wire made in Australia, I should not mind giving a bounty of £3 a ton to encourage the industry ; but we are asked to do too much for an industry which uses imported wire. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot understand the action of the Minister in regard to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. It seems to me that, if the Senate will wait for the Supply Bill, it would have waited for that Bill. We are now being "asked to grant supply for the first three months of the next financial year. I hope that this will be the last of such Bills, though, as honorable members are desirous of getting away, I shall forego the remarks which I had intended to make at this juncture concerning the finances of the country, on the understanding that the Bill provides only for- the ordinary services, at rates already authorized. </para>

I protest against being hurried in this fashion when dealing with the people's money. It all comes about because our procedure is out of gear. For twelve months the Government has lived on Supply Bills, Parliament giving up its right to control the expenditure.

The Government have chosen the latter course, and I wish honorable members, before they vote the money, to know what was the offer made by the company, in order that they may judge whether good business has been done. As I say, I am not dealing with the reputation of the company. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think these slurs should be cast on any Parliament. I had something to do with the original negotiations between the company and the South Australian Government, and the arrangements were mostly made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Todd, on the one hand, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Warren</inline> on the other. Such imputations as are being cast would fall off <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Todd like water off a duck ; that gentleman was above any unfair or corrupt dealing. Undoubtedly, the result of those negotiations was to make much better terms for the Commonwealth in cable matters, though I admit that it was the competition or the expectation of the competition of the Pacific Cable which put pressure on the company to reduce their rates. But it is not fair to attack the integrity of the company. The Government, having decided that they should own the cable, the next question arose as to what method should be adopted ? Should the cables of the company be bought as a going concern, or should the Government lay down fresh cables alongside? Obviously, the latter course would mean a great waste, and would be unjustifiable, unless the company adopted the " stand and deliver " attitude, and tried to extract unfair terms. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that we are now dealing with an ordinary Supply Bill containing no provision for new works and .buildings. But from the schedule which has only been accidentally produced, it appears that we are passing, not only an ordinary Supply Bill for the ordinary payments for (he next three months, but an appropriation for new  works  which have not yet been authorized, and which are  sought to be authorized in this indirect, and it seems to me not altogether legitimate, manner. . Is there another Bill to be intro.:duced? </para>

                            <para>- I repeat that the company offered to allow the Government to inspect the cables when they were lifted and tested. It is true that at a later stage the Government demanded that the company at its own expense should enable the cables to be lifted in two places and inspected by its engineers. The reply which it received was that the request was a most unusual one, and that the company ought not to be called upon to pay the cost of testing the cables. It further pointed out that the lifting of a cable very frequently injures it, and consequently the Government ought to pay the cost of the inspection. I submit that the proposal of the Government was a most outrageous one. . </para>

                            <para>- I can only judge the position by the facts. The Governmentpropose to purchase a new cable for £50,000, and to expend an additional £15,000 upon plant and accessories, making a total of £65,000. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company made a <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> offer to the Government, which the latter refused - not upon the ground that' it was unfair - but because the company would not agree to provide for an inspection by lifting the cable in two places at its own expense, notwithstanding that such  a proceeding would be likely to injure it. </para>

                            <para>- Let the Postmaster-General bring his own commonsense to bear upon the question. Surely it is obvious that the lifting of a cable which lies in forty-eight fathoms of water is likely to strain it. The company took up a perfectly fair position when it held that the Government should inspect the cable at their own expense, seeing that the Department had refused to examine it when the opportunity of doing so was presented. </para>

                            <para>- The Postmaster-General jumps at conclusions. The correspondence shows that the reason which the Department gave for refusing the offer of the company was that negotiations had not then begun. As a matter of fact, they had been proceeding for some months. Now the Postmaster-General says that the reason the Department refused to inspect  the cable was that such an examination would have been of no value.' Why did not the Department think of that excuse before? No better opportunity for ascertaining the condition of the cable could have been offered than that of accompanying the company's steamer, which Was engaged in the task of lifting, cutting, and splicing that cable. ' The honorable member for Fremantle reminds me that one of the reasons advanced by the manager of the company for refusing to lift the cable at their own expense was that when once a cable has been bedded it is very much safer than it is for some time after it has been lifted and relaid ; because it has then to find a new bed. That fact must be obvious. I have no desire to prolong this debate, but I ask honorable members to seriously consider whether we ought to vote £65.000 for the laying of one cable alone when we can obtain a going concern which, so far as tests have disclosed,  is in a satisfactory condition, for  £33,000.  Is not valuable material being sacrificed for mere prejudice? I am absolutely disinterested, in this matter, but that is the conclusion which I have come to through reading the correspondence. The Government has transacted this business badly. All sorts of objections were raised, and when they were met by the company, further objections were pressed, the desire being shown throughout not to purchase, but to leave the company stranded with its cables. Had the Government purchased the company's cables, it would have obtained the whole of the Tasmanian business ; but, under present arrangements, it will have to compete with the company.I do not say that the  £33,000  asked by the company is or is not a fair price ; that is for experts to determine. It is, however, obvious that the offer was rejected, not because of the amount, but on the ground that the company should bear the expense of lifting the cable to enable it to be examined. This work would not have cost the Government more than £200. </para>

If the honorable member offered a turnout, consisting of a buggy and horse, for £50, and afterwards, learning that only the horse would be purchased, asked £20 for it, . he could not be accused of having made an extortionate demand in the first instance. Having placed this information in the possession of honorable members, I ask them to consider it without prejudice, and to act, not as supporters or opponents of the Government, but in the public interest. I hope that the Government will leave out of. the Bill the item providing for. payment for the cable. </para>

                        <para>. - It seems to me that if there has been any special pleading in this matter, it has been on the part of the honorable member. The company, in  its negotiations with the Government, continually wasted . time by informing us, through its local agents, that the Central "Board must be cabled to for authority, and at length it became apparent that, unless we took definite action, we should ultimately find ourselves in its hands, without an opportunity to lay a cable of our own before our contract had terminated. The first test proposed would have been of no value, because of the conditions surrounding it, although it might have committed the Government to the purchase of the cable. </para>

                            <para>- It was demonstrated  to me. The correspondence does not show all the negotiations. It was pointed out to the company that it, having the cable for sale, was the vendor ; and whoever heard of a vendor requiring an intending purchaser to pay the cost of exhibiting an article which was for sale? The Government naturally declined to bear the expense of testing the cable. These negotiations have cost me a large amount of thought and attention; and I urge the House, in the interests of the. public, tq permit of the tender for the new contract being accepted by passing this. Supply. Bill. My experts assure me that the life of the present cable, at most, will not be more than nine and a-half or ten years, while that of a new cable would be from twenty to twenty-five years. </para>

                            <para>- At present, the price of copper is very low, and if we do not get authority and accept the tender submitted, we . may find ourselves at .the mercy of the market, which in all probability will rise. I ask the House to accept mv assurance that I did everything possible to secure a fair and reasonable offer from the company. I believe that I am acting in the best interests of ' the Commonwealth in urging the acceptance of the tender for a new cable. If the item is struck out, honorable members must take the responsibility of a course which may result in forcing us to buy the company's cables at whatever price they choose to fix, or of laying another cable at a time when the price of copper wire will be much higher than it is now. </para>

                        <para>-- Although the session is in its dying throes, and honorable members are impatient of long speeches, the importance of the Bill justifies a few remarks. We have already passed five- Supply Bills during the current year, and we are now asked to grant Supply for the first three months of the next financial year. Last time, and the time before, I protested as strongly as I could against this course, showing that if resulted in Parliament losing control of  finance, and the Treasurer promised that further Supply Bills would not be- introduced. I admit that the session has been a long one; but some excuse is always offered for the introduction of a measure of this kind. When we meet next September, another Supply Bill will be put before us. </para>

                            <para>- Experience shows that they will not be ready. The honorable member- for Boothby has pointed out that, while nominally asking only for Supply to cover expenditure on ordinary services, the Government is really asking for authority to spend out of the Treasurer's Advance for works and buildings. </para>

                            <para>- It must be recognised that the- Treasurer's advance is to meet not ordinary, but extraordinary, expenditure. Apparently, however, the Treasurer likes to have- a little money box of £200,000, into which he can dip, and then afterwards, as he did three weeks ago, come to Parliament for an indemnity. Why, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> when we passed the Additional Estimates, we had to ratify expenditure made while the right honorable member for * Swan was in office. This I regard as a slovenly way of handling the finances ; and the most serious work of a representative is to see that the finances are properly administered. I am not prepared to say, whether the honorable member for Boothby, is correct in his contentions in regard to the Tasmanian cable: but the speech of the Postmaster-'General in reply reminded me of- the old Scotch jurist who divided human nature into three classes - prevaricators, infernal prevaricators, and experts ; and I must class the honorable gentleman under the last head.. I know that we are all weary of the long session; and I have no desire to inconvenience honorable members by bringing them back next week to resume the consideration of this Supply Bill ; but for that consideration, I should have felt compelled to resist this measure to the bitter end. All I can do now is to protest against Bills of the kind being introduced in the dying hours of the session. ' No member, however clear his perceptive powers, could possibly deal effectively with a Bill introduced in this sudden way,' but he must accept it in confidence ; and, while I do not think the Government' would dp anything that was disreputable, items might be passed that we should afterwards regret. However, if the Government will not accept the suggestion of the honorable member for Boothby to postpone one or two of the items, then Ministers must take the responsibility. I admit that that is an easy way of avoiding my own responsibility; but if I spoke for hours, I should not be able to get a vote against the passing of the measure. It is a great wonder to me, however, that the. press have not commented on the unfortunate policy of a Government in living on a series of Supply ' Bills; and the position can, I think, be most aptly described in a phrase which was very popular in a comic opera some years ago - "Ain't it sickening?" Here we are beginning a new year with a three months' Supply Bill, although the Government have declared themselves against the practice. When I opposed the last Supply Bill, I suggested that we ought to make an effort to complete the business, so as to commence the new year. under a proper system. Before I sit down, I should like to express regret that the Seat of Government Bill has not been disposed of. While I think that  Parliament will re-affirm its original decision, I submit, although I opposed that decision, -that it would be in the interests of Australia and of New South Wales to have the matter finally settled. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope honorable members will not unduly protract this discussion. We are bound to admit that the Government are in a somewhat singular difficulty due to no fault of their own, but mainly to the fact that, in another place, where there are thirty-six members, the Government and their supporters now consist of only three - that is when they are in health. In the pitiable circumstances in which the Ministry find themselves, in having considerable difficulty to keep a quorum to consider their financial measures, it is the duty of the House to treat them with as . much consideration as possible. A number of honorable members of the Labour Party iri the past always maintained a quorum in order to ' prevent such difficulties' as the Government are experiencing this afternoon ; and I think they would have shown more gratitude for all the favours the Government, have shown to them, had they " stood  bv "  to-day in order to pass into law the Bill for granting a bonus to the iron industry. However, that 'measure has passed away, and I shall not refer to it further. Inasmuch, however, as the. Government Party, which in this House only numbers sixteen - in other words, a supporter for each Minister - and only three supporters in the Senate, find themselves in difficulties, which are inherent in a party, the numbers of which cannot themselves constitute a quorum, honorable members generally ought to take pity on their helpless and hopeless position, and allow the Supply Bill to pass at the earliest moment. </para>

                            <para>- I am not so sure; and unless I can get some kind of assurance that the Postmaster-General will listen to me, I am prepared to stand here for another hour, and to extend the time if necessary. For months past, certain, districts in my electorate have been crying out for telephone facilities. I refer particularly to Lostock, where the people  bitterly feel the absence of telephone ' communication ; and yet over and over again the departmental inspectors have declined to recommend the granting of their request. In my opinion, we have far too few inspectors, and those we have, according to my experience, are incapable of satisfactorily performing their duties, although they are highly paid, and ought to be thoroughly efficient'. In the Underbank district, the people have over and over again requested telephonic communication extending only a few miles, and have offered to supply the posts ; but their requests have been refused, and, as- a matter of fact, the departmental estimates of the cost are so great that I do not wonder at the refusal. I do not believe that the inspectors send in very satisfactory reports ; and, therefore, I urge upon the Postmaster- General the necessity of looking a little closer into the matter. The Postmaster-General, with his thirty years' experience,' ought to know how to conduct business in a business-like way ; but, as a matter of fact, while there are daily applications for instruments, which do not come to hand, the Department is full of both instruments and wire ready for use. It is only owing to the red-tape system that the wants of the public are left unsupplied, and if something is not done, there will be an outcry which will affect, first, the unfortunate parliamentary representatives, and, secondly, the Parliament itself. I am satisfied that the Minister will, as far as possible, endeavour to right the wrong; and if he does not, there ought to be, and may be, some united effort made to bring him to reason. </para>

                        <para>.- I regret that this debate has been prolonged, and I shall not detain honorable members more than a few minutes. I do not think that we have been well treated by the Government during the past few days, in view of the great rush of business pressed upon us without any justification. Surely the convenience of a few members, or of all honorable members infact, is as nothing compared with our public duty ? What necessity is there to prorogue to-day ? Surely honorable members could have given a few more days to permit of many important matters being decided after full discussion in the ordinary way ? I have no objection whatever to the Supply Bill now under consideration, although it may, perhaps, be for a period a little longer than is usual. I point out that there is no three months' Supply Bill for works before us, and, therefore, those works in course of construction will suffer from want of funds on the  30th  June, unless the Treasurer comes to the rescue with his Advance. Further, the Treasurer has no provision for any new works that may be required ; indeed, we have not been consulted at all in regard to the Works Estimates. I submit that the Treasurer's Advance Account is not intended for the purposes to which the Treasurer informs us to-day he proposes to apply it. He certainly has no right to pay out of it a sum of over  £40,000  in respect of new cables between Tasmania and the mainland without the specific approval of this House. We have not approved of any vote for such a work, and the Postmaster-General informed the House on  29th  May last that " this House will be asked to deal with the matter in some way before any tender is accepted." The expenditure of moneys out of the Treasurer's Trust Account on new works that have not been approved by this House is contrary to the Constitution, section  8.3,  and to the general practice. </para>

                            <para>- Even when the Government cables are laid the company will not be prevented from continuing messages over its lines. It seems to me that the negotiations have been characterized by a want of ordinary business methods on the part of the Department. I am not impressed with the statement made by the Postmaster-General. The company invited the Department to send one of its expert officers on board a steamer with a party which was to lift the cable at two points,' pointing out that the officer would thus be afforded an opportunity of ascertaining its condition. One would imagine that such a fair and reasonable offer would have been promptly accepted, but, as a matter of fact, it was curtly refused. The Postmaster-General says that no good would have resulted from such an inspection. Business men will not be inclined to agree with that view. Four months after that offer had been declined, the Postmaster-General requested the company to raise the cable for inspection. In the meantime the company's steamer had probably sailed for other parts, and the company's representatives naturally demurred to incur the expense of engaging another vessel to lift the cable unless it was remunerated by the Government, and without any condition as to purchase if the inspection was satisfactory. The price asked  by the company for the purchase of its cables and plant - £33,000 - was not, in my opinion, too high, but, if it was so, that ground would have been a good one on which to go to arbitration. I am inclined to think that it will cost the Government twice as much to lay the new cables, more especially as twelve miles of cables have to be laid underground. The Government should have made an effort to come to terms with the company. The taking over of its cables would have been a more economical arrangement than that now proposed by the Government, and it would have removed a competitor from the field. This company has a world-wide reputation. Its business association with the States extends over thirty years, and one would naturally imagine that in the circumstances the Commonwealth Government would have a friendly feeling towards it. I have never known- the company to fail to carry out properly and well any agreement made by it. When I was Premier of Western Australia it laid the cable from Fremantle to. the Cocos Islands, , and my relations, with it were most satisfactory. One would think that friendly relations would exist between the company and the Government ; but the correspondence throughout suggests an unfriendliness on the part of the Post Office, which is to be regretted. There seems to lie an idea on the part of the Postal Department, as at present administered, that it must pick a quarrel with every one with whom it does business. </para>

                            <para>- That is no reason why the Government and the representatives of the company should be at arms' length. Mutual concessions will always remove difficulties, but we find that the Government, .instead of being prepared to negotiate with a view to an amicable arrangement for the purchase of the company's cables, declared in effect to its representatives, " We will lay cables of our own and do our best to render your cables between. Tasmania and the mainland' absolutely valueless to you." Such an attitude towards  a company that has been working with the States for thirty years is to be strongly deprecated. No doubt the directors are keen business men, but that is no reason why we should look upon them with distrust. This company has at present interminable, agreements with four of the States, and may be carrying on business here for hundreds of years to come. It is certainly not to the advantage of those States that we should adopt that high-handed procedure in which the Postmaster-General appears to delight. I do not know whom he thinks he is pleasing by carrying on negotiations in such a manner, but it would seem, by his action, that he thinks he is pleasing somebody. I am sure it is not the desire of the House that he should treat with contempt every one with whom the Department does business. ' We expect not only friendly, but generous, treatment to be' extended to those with whom we have business relations. The purchase of two new cables has not been submitted to this House for approval, as promised by the Postmaster-General on 29th May. There is also nc provision- for it on the " Estimates, and it has never been considered by the House. The Treasurer's Advance Account is designed to meet extraordinary or unforeseen expenditure in connexion with ' ' the ordinary annual services of the Government," and not to provide for new works for which this House should be asked to provide by a specific vote. If the Treasurer insists upon doing an illegal act by advancing this large sum out of his Advance Account without a vote of the House he will have to answer for it. I believe' that he will think twice before he does so, but I warn him that if he does attempt to provide for this work out of his Advance Account we shall try to bring home to him the fact that he is acting illegally, and that he must accept the responsibility for his action. This is a new work, arid cannot be included in the appropriation for the Treasurer's Advance Account, which is provided for " ordinary annual services." I have no desire to place the Government in a difficulty, but they alone are . responsible for the trouble that has arisen. We have a duty to perform that is far more important than any consideration as to the prorogation to-da.y. I am anxious that Parliament  should be prorogued without delay. I am  opposed to the Treasurer providing for these cables out of his Advance Account. I do not think it is reasonable, and certainly is not legal. If he has power to do that, he has power to do anything since the Constitution Act forbids his doing that. The work has not been included in any Appropriation Act ; it has not been recommended by the Governor-General, and cannot therefore be legally proceeded with. I regret having to delay the House at this stage, but I have a public duty to perform. I am here, not in' the interests of the company or of the Government, but in the interests. of the country. To me it matters not whether this cable is purchased, so long as the best possible arrangement is made, in the public interest. I have read the correspondence relating' to this matter, and I say that the Postmaster-General has not treated the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company with the courtesy to which it was entitled. If all the negotiations are disclosed in that correspondence, I do not think he will find it an easy task to justify his action. </para>

On Wednesday last, it became my duty, in defence of my honour, to deal with the statements made by several gentlemen - reverend and otherwise - who formed a deputation which had waited upon the Prime Minister. Exception has been taken to some of my remarks upon that occasion, and after perusing the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of my speech, I wish to express my regret that - smarting, as I was, under a sense of injustice - I - allowed my feelings to carry me away. For instance, in replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> McCutcheon's  statement that the Council of Churches was unanimously behind the Postmaster-Genera! in the action which had been taken, and that the prohibition had been issued only after the fullest inquiry and consideration, I stated - </para>

I recognise that it is a very strong one to make in respect- of a member of the cloth. I know now that these gentlemen based their statements upon a certain letter which has been read to this House. At the same time, I regret that they were misinformed. In conclusion, I desire to say that, in the action which I took in the case of Messrs. Freeman and Wallace, I had only one object in view - a desire that justice should be done. I was influenced by no personal feeling whatever. I simply held that, as a matter of British justice, an accused person should be found guilty before punishment was inflicted. I wish to express my sincere regret for what may be regarded as. insulting references to two gentlemen who had made accusations which were not' warranted by facts. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not wish to prevent what the Treasurer desires to do ; but the only excuse for the course being taken is that we are right at the end of the session. I am not approving of the proceeding which, under other circumstances, might lead to the most serious consequences. Besides, as the right honorable member for Swan was good enough to remind me, section 54 of the Constitution Act clearly enacts that an Appropriation Act can cover only expenditure for the ordinary services of the year in which it is passed. As in this case, the expenditure can be covered by the Treasurer's Advance, and the reasons for it are generally understood, I am content to allow the Bill to go through. The Treasurer has shown himself very astute in the position which he has secured for himself in this instance. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill authorizes the appropriation of £1,315 for the payment of the expenses incurred in connexion with elections declared to be void through the fault of the Electoral Department. The names of the persons concerned, and the amounts proposed to be paid to them, are :  - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon,</inline> £467 3s.9d. ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blundell,</inline> £259. is. ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Loghlin,</inline> £37 8s.1d. ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Palmer,</inline> £367 11s 2d.; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy,</inline> £182 18s. 9d. These names and amounts are not in the Bill, because, although I  desire parliamentary authority for the payment of the sum I have mentioned, it is my intention to again go through the claims with the Crown Law officers, to see that they are not at all excessive. I propose also to pay £45 to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Crosbie,</inline> whose late husband was a candidate for the Senate, and would have been elected had he not died very shortly after the poll was taken. This is a matter of pure charity. </para>

                        <para>- This is not the first occasion when the faulty character of bur electoral machinery has been made manifest, and I hope Parliament" will be afforded an early opportunity to amend the electoral law. It will be a serious thing if every election is to cost the country £1,500 because of the mistakes of electoral officers. Furthermore, as I contended when the measure was before Parliament, it offers . a temptation to speculative lawyers to bring cases against sitting members, not for the benefit of any candidate, but in order to obtain fees. I do not say that any of these candidates should" not be reimbursed, but the Treasurer in cases of this kind should be careful to do nothing which is opposed to the public interest. His action should be directed not by charity but by justice. </para>

Had he not borne the cost of an election, she would have been left better off than she is now. I understand that his death was due partly to the exertions made by him when a candidate, and I think that the Government should show consideration to his widow. I wish to be able, either out of the sum now being appropriated, fir. from some other fund, to return to her some part of the expenses incurred by her late husband. </para>

                    <para>.- While I agree with the honorable member for 'Wide Bay as to the amount which should be given, I regard the vote as an act of grace, because it would be straining the meaning of the word to call it an act of justice. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosbie,</inline> unfortunately, died before the declaration of the poll but,, supposing he had not died until after he had been returned, and the election had not been questioned, he would have had to pay his own expenses. I know the view I am taking may not meet with general approval, but I think it right to point out that similar cases may arise in the future; and that, therefore, this ought to be regarded, as I say, as an act of grace. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not desire to be misunderstood. If the honorable member for Dalley thinks that I regard this vote as an act of grace, he is mistaken. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosbie.</inline> incurred expenditure during the election, . which was declared void; and, in my opinion, it would have been declared void, even if he had lived. Therefore, I say that we ought to return to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Crosbie</inline> the money which would have been returned to her husband had he lived ; and on that ground I favour a higher sum than that asked for. </para>

I have never' willingly made an untruthful statement in this House, though, of course, I have made mistaken statements, which I have always willingly withdrawn. During the discussion on the Tariff the honorable member for Batman accused me of exhibiting certain shoddy articles to honorable members ; but I (have had those articles examined, and I have ascertained that not one was shoddy. I gave the honorable member every opportunity to withdraw his statement, and offered to prove that I was right, but that offer was not accepted. I now, desire to say that the articles exhibited were not shoddy; and if the honorable member choose to make a statutory declaration to that effect the law will take its' course. </para>

                    <para>. - The Senate has agreed to the whole of the Bill with this one exception. The clause, which it is proposed shall be left out, gives special protection to newspapers which publish extracts from parliamentary papers. As to whether the clause omitted is only declaratory of the existing law, I do not desire to express an opinion. The clause was inserted in the Bill because it is part of the English law. However, it is essential that Parliament should publish parliamentary papers) and have protection against action for libel; and therefore I move - </para>

                        <para>- In reply to the honorable member's questions, I beg to state that the correspondence which has passed on this subject is very small, and practically consists of one . general letter from the Admiralty, which suggested to the Government a number of specific questions which have been answered. The only reason why the papers have not yet been made public is that the matter is at present quite incomplete, and publication would not add materially to knowledge of the subject. </para>

I desire to ask the honorable gentleman whether he will intimate the date on which the next session will open ? I do not want to bind him absolutely to any date, but should be glad if he would say when, within a few days, the Government hope to meet the House again. </para>

I do not think that it is likely that Parliament will be called together again before, at the earliest, the middle of September. Personally, I intend to ask the Prime Minister to make the date of the opening of the new session near the end of that month. </para>

I also wish to thank honorable members, upon behalf of the Government, for the attention which they have bestowed - especially during the past two or three weeks - upon the measures- that have been brought before them, which has enabled us to dispose of so much work during that period. Of course, we cannot get on without occasional "jars," but I think that we may congratulate ourselves upon the fact that nothing very serious has happened. For the progress we have been enabled to make I thank honorable members. I hope that during the three months' recess that we are likely to have, the officers of the House, who have been kept here very late at night, and who have had very strenuous work to perform, will enjoy a nice holiday, and I thank them all for the courtesy which they uniformly display to all honorable members. The Governor-General is now absent in the country, and, as it is necessary to secure his signature to all the Bills that have been passed, I have been advised that it will be better to move the adjournment of the House until Tuesday week, instead of until some day next week. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to express my gratification at the legislation which has been enacted this session. It is remarkable from two points of view. We have effected a large measure of Tariff reform, in which the whole commercial community was interested, and we have also enacted social legislation, the like of which has not previously been enacted in Australia. I hope that we shall all return next session invigorated by our holiday, and that we shall then complete some of the work upon which we have entered during the life of the present Parliament. I trust that we shall all spend a pleasant recess, and that, whatever changes may take place, the harmony which has generally characterized our proceedings in this House will be preserved. </para>

                        <para>- He keeps such an eagle eye upon me that I shall leave the love which I bear him unexpressed. I am sorry that the Prime Minister, owing to the bereavement which he has just suffered, is not present this evening.. But I desire to say that communications have been opened up with him upon one subject which I feel sure will in the near future loom as largely in our political firmament as did the question of old-age pensions.' Just as I am proud of the work that has been done in that connexion, and while I am delighted that ho dissentient voice was raised when the Old-age Pensions Bill was under discussion, so I hope that, at a future date, we shall have a unanimous House in favour of granting provision for children when their parents have not sufficient means to properly feed and clothe them. Of course, I recognise the difficulties that will be experienced by the Treasurer in sparing more money. But, during the recess, I ask him to take into consideration an Australian institution which I believe is unique in the world. In the Old World there are foundling hospitals in which young children can be left. The death rate in such institutions is enormous; but in the Waitara Home, a little outside of Sydney, and in a lesser degree in a similar institution near Melbourne, we have the finest institution of its kind under the British flag- an institution which offers to a mother carrying a child a home for three months prior to its birth, and for six months subsequently, thereby promoting the ties of affection. I want the Treasurer to consider whether there is not some way in which that institution, and any kindred institution, can be assisted. I may add that it takes no cognisance of creed or religion, but is prepared to help any prospective mother who is in difficulty. 1 hope that when we have any money to spare, the Treasurer, out of the kindness of his heart, will look to these charities. The Prime Minister is heartily in accord with the object that I have in view. In glowing and eloquent language he has promised to assist this institution in any way that he can. With the knowledge that his chief is so sympathetic, and his own heart beating in sympathy with the little ones, I hope that when he can spare any funds for the purpose he will bear my remarks in mind. I feel certain that if, after the last session of this Parliament, members can go to their constituents, and tell them that, in their wisdom, they have passed legislation for preserving the best immigrant we have- - the Australian baby - they will have no cause to regret it. </para>

                    <para>. - Asa new member, I wish to express my pleasure that, during the session, Parliament has succeeded in passing two such important measures as the Tariff - which, I believe, while not doing everything that we could hope for in the development of our manufactures, will largely assist them - and the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill, which was agreed to without a dissentient voice. I have been very much impressed with the conscientious manner in which honorable members have fought to secure effect to their political convictions, and the uniform good feeling and kindliness displayed in their private relations. Political experience is new to me, but what I have seen and heard within the walls of this building has given me a better opinion of human nature. I hope that the great Par-  liament of the Commonwealth may long continue an instrument of beneficent legislation for the welfare of the people of Australia. </para>
