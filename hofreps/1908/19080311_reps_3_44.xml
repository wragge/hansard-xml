              <para>- I have no desire to attempt impossibilities, so I will leave the question of the mental limitations of the honorable member severely alone. The Government defence policy was formulated by the Ministry, and they accept full responsibility for it. Before the Prime Minister laid his proposals before the country, the officers who aid the Government in the administration of the affairs of the Defence Department were not consulted with regard to the main principles of that scheme, because these can be decided by Parliament alone. But every one of those officers in his individual capacity has been approached and asked to make any suggestions that he may deem fit. </para>

            <para>- The question of the relative importance of particular Bills is really immaterial to the matter in hand. I am unable to. give the promise the honorable member desires, because I have no knowledge . as to the time the Senate will be occupied with the Tariff, and I am quite, certain that whatever that time may be, we have before us quite sufficient business to occupy us. But it is the intention of the Government, if the opportunity arises before the session ends, to submit the question to which the honorable member refers. If that does not prove a means qf finally determining the site, it &#39; is . intended to make this one of the first measures submitted in the next session. </para>

            <para>- I do&#39; not expect an answer on the spur of the moment ; but may I ask the Prime Minister to take into his earnest consideration the fact that there are opportunities of dealing with the question now, whilst the Tariff is occupying the attention of another branch of the Legislature. The honorable gentleman will, I think, agree, with me that, in spite of long sittings, the time occupied over the Tariff by the Senate will be ^considerable ; and I ask him to con-.  sider  at what period he will afford an . opportunity for dealing with and disposing of this question. If he can do so it will give rise to a large measure of satisfaction, certainly in the State which I represent. </para>

              <para>- When I spoke of an &#34;assurance,&#34; I had in mind the common knowledge gained by honorable members of the temper of the House. Honorable members are at times prepared to take a forward step that at other seasons would imply much loss of time. I did not suggest that the right honorable member should give me a formal assurance respecting the matter, nor that any other honorable member should do so, but was alluding to the fact that one often acts upon knowledge of opinions in the House acquired by association with honorable, members inside and outside. If, as I hope, there has been a ripening of judgment, so that the House will be prepared to come to a definite decision, the Government will be ready to give honorable members an opportunity to do so. </para>

That Bill contained certain provisions that, perhaps, might be loosely described in the honorable member&#39;s phrase. The Commonwealth Government required these, provisions to be withdrawn before assent to the measure was given. Except for that, I am not aware of any alterations or proposed alterations. </para>

            <para>- It does not appear desirable to lay this particular report on the table of the House, because it incidentally mentions the various modes which are supposed to be adopted for the illicit introduction of Chinese. Ever since the report was obtained, each steamer has &#34; been tested in regard to these particular methods of introduction j and the officers- are satisfied that the prevalent opinion that the introduction of Chinese, wherever it took place, was of units - one, two, or three persons - is correct. On several occasions one or two men have been captured. In the last instance of which we have heard two escaped for one who was seized. There is a comparatively trifling influx, but we are satisfied that it is kept trifling only by constant vigilance and varied methods of inspection. </para>

            <para>- I should be very sorry to admit, even by inference, that .we think the introduction of the new protection scheme &#34;will be placed beyond Government control. If by any combination of circumstances it were so placed, I believe and hope that the obstacle would be temporary. Until such an -emergency arises it would not be reasonable to make a statement as to what may be done, inasmuch as the particular cause of the difficulty would first have to be ascertained. No one would look forward with equanimity to once more considering the Tariff; but it was passed by this House with the publicly announced intention of the Government to supplement it with what is popularly known as the new protection, and whatever may be the result of present proceedings, the Government is absolutely bound by its undertaking. </para>

          <para class="block">The motion of which notice has just been given by the honorable member provides for the appointment of a Royal Commission. I think that it should.be moved by way of an amendment upon notice of motion No. 1. The honorable member could achieve his object by moving that the words &#34; Select Committee &#34; be left out of the motion, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words &#34;Royal Commission.&#34; I do not think that the two notices of motion should appear on the notice-paper. As to the further point raised by the honorable member, neither the presence of notice of motion No. 1 nor of any other such notice as the honorable member proposes would preclude a general discussion upon the administration of the Department on any fitting occasion. It would, however, preclude a discussion on the advisableness of remitting to a Royal Commission or a Select Committee the work of inquiring into and reporting upon the administration of the Department. </para>

            <para>- I understand from statements made by the officers of a vessel which has recently visited the New Hebrides group that a French Judge has already arrived there. The British Judge has not yet been appointed. The attention of the British Government has been called to these statements. In regard to the question of the removal of the central control from Fiji to the Commonwealth, I may say that some time ago representations were made as to the desirability of this course being adopted. That control might much more conveniently be exercised from Sydney, both in the interests of the New Hebrides and of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>That this House desires to express its deepest sympathy with Lady Linlithgow and family in the great loss sustained by them by the death of the late Marquis, and to place on record its regret and grief at the untimely decease of the first Governor-General of Australia, whose abilities and kindness had endeared him to its people. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">There have been within the last few days so many references to the late GovernorGeneral of Australia that the task - for indeed it is a task - which devolves upon us to-day, so far as the formal expression of our feelings is concerned, has been greatly lightened. It is unnecessary to repeat what  has necessarily been said everywhere. The Marquis endeared himself to the whole of the citizens of the State in which we stand by many years of successful governorship. After a return to the Mother Country he was appointed to the high and arduous post of first Governor-General of the Commonwealth, and in that capacity presided at the inauguration of the new Federation in which the people of Australia have reposed their trust. The burden of responsibility that fell upon him was grave.  His  strength which had been impaired by repeated illnesses, was at times seriously threatened. But we all remember the courage with which he bore up against every physical disability and admirably discharged all the obligations which were cast upon him. We are all acquainted with the singular charm of manner which won him friends wherever he appeared. We all know the unfaltering courage with which he discharged all the duties attaching to his high position. He returned to Great Britain, where his standing was recognised by the party to which he belonged, when he was selected as a member of the then Government. He filled more than one responsible office with distinction. Indeed, from the time when, as a young man, he first set foot upon the shores of Victoria, he displayed a remarkable natural aptitude for public affairs, readily and sympathetica lly placing himself in touch with public opinion, whilst at the same time being resolute in the fulfilment of his duties. The life filled with success in so many different official positions has now been brought to an untimely close. The regret of his widow and children is shared by the whole of the people of the Commonwealth, and by those who knew him in the Mother Country, where he was recognised as one who might be expected to hold even higher offices in the future. Upon this occasion eulogy is superfluous. Nothing said here can mitigate the blow that has fallen upon his family or assuage Australian griefs. While still young, and in the fulness of his intellectual powers, his physical strength, so often threatened, at last gave way. We have to deplore the first loss of its kind in our short history, one which is felt individually and personally by the community, and especially by the members of the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

        <para>This, like its two predecessors, is a Bill to grant supplyfor two months. When it is passed, the Government will have had Supply for ten months. I ask for Supply now because, to enable the Public Service to be paid next week,&#34; the measure must be passed through both Houses by Friday at the latest, and I wish for two months&#39; Supply to give an opportunity for the consideration of the Estimates, which I hope will have been dealt with before that time has elapsed. </para>

            <para>- As soon as the state of public business will allow ; I hope next week. I shall probably give notice to-morrow, or very shortly afterwards, of my intention to bring down Additional Estimates for a considerable sum. Supply is needed, not only to pay the Public Service, but to meet other imperative demands. If I thought that the Estimates in Chief and the Additional Estimates&#39; would be dealt with within a month, I should not ask for more than a month&#39;s supply. The sum asked for is based on the appropriation of the Estimates in Chief, with the exception that provision is made for special payments in connexion with the ocean mail contract and contingencies in the New South Wales branch of the Post and Telegraph Department. I shall attempt to get the Estimates through as soon as possible, and I hope that they will be passed before the Tariff is returned to us by the Senate. I do not wish to open up now a discussion for which a better opportunity will be afforded when the Additional Estimates are before honorable members, which make provision for some very important undertakings. </para>

            <para>- None, except the two which I have mentioned.I am now asking for Supply amounting to &#163;760,499, and the last Supply Bill was for &#163;704,457, the difference being made up by an appropriation of&#163;31,000 for the ocean mail contract and of &#163;21,000 to be expended in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department in New South Wales. One of the reasons why I am anxious to get Supply is that, in consequence of the demands for money, mostly from the Postal Department, I have only&#163;3,000 left unappropriated of the&#163;175,000 already voted as Treasurer&#39;s Advance. I wish to recoup the advance partly by means of this </para>

            <para>- I may have been a miser with the money of the public, though I do not think that I can be accused of having been a miser in regard to what little I have had of my own. I desire to point out that in 1906-7 the permanent officers in the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department numbered 10,932-, and in 1907-8 they number ir,6oi, an increase of 669, which I have approved. The Additional Estimates provide for further appointments to the number of 901, or a total, over that period, of 12,502, showing an increase of 1,570. I have not refused to appoint any permanent officer or officers for which the certificate of the Public Service Commissioner has been given, though I have refused to make permanent appointments otherwise, and that is the reason I have strained the Treasurer&#39;s advance to the extent I have. </para>

            <para>- Between 600. and 700. In addition, of course, there are temporary hands numbering over 800 in New South Wales, and some 3,900 throughout Australia. When I submitted the Estimates last year I told honorable members &#39; that there were applications for the appointment of 1,000 new. permanent hands, and I have agreed to over 600 of these appointments being made. It is not a good system to have so many temporary hands, and I &#39; suggest that, except for manual work, the system be altered. I hope honorable members will support rae in getting this Supply Bill through as soon as possible, because I desire to pay for works which have been in abeyance for a considerable time, and I cannot use the Treasurer&#39;s advance anymore until it has been recouped. </para>

            <para>- As a general rule, a proposal for two months&#39;  Supply  is objectionable, and when honorable members realize the&#39; importance of maintaining their hold of the Government they will be slow to permit such a practice to be followed. One great hold which Parliament has on the Government is the way in which it opens, or keeps closed, the public purse. On- the present occasion, however, we must admit that a special state of things prevails, in view of the fact of the delay caused by the Tariff, which has been before Parliament for so many months. Without forgetting1 what I think is a sound rule I do not propose to offer any strong opposition to the Bill under the , certainly most unusual circumstances. I think it advisable to take advantage of the present opportunity to discuss one or two matters of public importance, because when the Additional Estimates are submitted our observations may be limited to the items therein. At any rate, I invite the Prime Minister, either in the course of this debate ox tomorrow, to make- some definite Ministerial statement as to how he proposes to deal with the public business. This, although it is a resumption of business after a convenient form of adjournment, is practically a meeting after prorogation for another session, and -the Prime Minister ought to give a clear outline of the course he proposes to adopt. That would be a great help to honorable members generally, and it would afford an opportunity for making suggestions in regard to the public business. In any case, at the beginning of a new session, which this practically is, it is a good practice for the head of the Government to submit his programme. We should have a definite indication of Ministerial policy. The leadership, although really in the hands of the honorable member  for Wide Bay, is not constitutionally so, and, so far as public business is concerned, I cannot ask him for a Ministerial statement, but have to go through the timehonoured, in this case, farce of asking. the Prime Minister for a declaration. </para>

            <para>- That is more than many of us do sometimes. My experience is that the man who &#34;knows his own mind&#34; either has not a mind at all, or is unduly positive. However, so far as the present situation is concerned, I desire to draw public attention to the condition of the Post and Telegraph Department. The revelations which have been made through the public press demand our very earnest attention. I suppose that in this Department there are more officers than in any other in the Commonwealth Public Service. I do not pretend to know the inner working of the Department. I am never invited to any of the picnic celebrations in Sydney to which Ministers and members in the Labour corner are asked. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member does not live in Sydney, though I do. I may say, however, that I have had the honour of being invited to the great celebrations in Melbourne, and have always been treated with the utmost courtesy. On any question affecting the Public Service, there should be no party lines; and the less such lines are introduced into the annual celebrations of the Public Service, the better it will be forall. </para>

            <para>- Far better for the service. One of the most objectionable things I have seen of late years is the tendency to give a party complexion even to the festive celebrations of officers of the Public Service That is mast lamentable, because it is eating into the independence and impartiality of the Service. I should be glad to see this tendency stopped. However, I have come to the conclusion, so far as the man outside the Department  and the Government may do so, that there are too&#39; many cases of. individual hardship and injustice in the working of this Department. I have always been identified with the policy of pretty stiff economy in the Public Service. I believe in the most rigid policy in the way of removing undeserving officers and preventing the inclusion, of unnecessary officers. But when officers are necessary and deserving, they, should be treated on  ai  high standard of fair-minded liberality. I am afraid that there are hundreds and hundreds of men in the Post and Telegraph Department who are not treated in that way - whose salaries are not sufficient. I know of one man of twenty years&#39; service, who is in charge of an important branch, and has no black mark against him, and whose salary is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;160 a</inline> year. </para>

            <para>- I do not wish to be too general in my remarks, or to say that allthe officers are underpaid. But if only twenty or fifty employes are treated in the way I have indicated, we ought to wish to see justice done to them.  A  proper state of feeling is created in a public &#34;department when cases of injustice are met and removed. I have another excellent officer in my mind, who has been twenty-three years in the Telegraph Department, as head of an important sub-branch, and, although there is not a black mark against him, his salary is only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;160.</inline> I suppose that a man might be employed as a watchman and commence at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;120</inline> a year. This man came to me, and, though making no complaint, pointed out that his prospects were so wretched that he wished, if possible, to be removed to some other Department where the chances were better. </para>

            <para>- I hope that they will not be of a very controversial nature, because time is very valuable, and we have a number of important measures to deal with. The Capital Site question is worthy of consideration, and the mind of the House in regard to it might be ascertained in a comparatively simple way Dalgety appears in an Act of Parliament as the chosen site, and the Government, without doing any injustice to the Minister of Trade and Customs, who was the leader of the movement in favour of the selection of the site, might test the question of whether or not the Capital shall be established there. My suggestion is that there be inserted in the Additional Estimates an item providing for an expenditure in regard to Dalgety. I do not suggest that the Government should make it a Ministerial question. We have all through voted upon it as individual members ; Ministers have exercised that liberty in all that they have done in respect of the matter. If Dalgety still commands a majority in the House the sooner we know it the better. If it does it is time the matter was settled. If, on the other hand, honorable members do not share the view held by members of a previous Parliament it is time that that fact became known. </para>

            <para>- I happened to know that there was a very strong movement in favour of a site which in my opinion was not evenassuitable as Dalgety.. Dalgety was not my choice. A number of us voted for it, not because we thought it the best site, but because we preferred it to some others that were suggested. If one cannot get the best site, surely one should not vote for what one believes is the worst. The only course open is to vote for that which is nearest to the best, if we cannot obtain the best. I should have stood for Dalgety with the Minister of Trade and Customs at a time when I thought that, if the decision were varied, we might get something worse. The honorable gentleman always endeavours to obtain as good a thing as he can, and when he can, in the public interest. </para>

He is one of the most splendid engineers that a man could have working for him, but one of the worst that he could have against  him. He did splendidly on my job, but was very bad when he was undermining against me. The honorable member was always thorough in what he did. I voted for Lyndhurst, and, naturally, when that site was rejected I exercised my discretion, and selected as the choice of two evils;- </para>

            <para>- I agree with the honorable member, but if I have to submit to a breach of it, I shall take that which I think is the least. When the Seat of Government Bill was before us, I was forced into what I think was a wrong choice. If the House is still in favour of Dalgety, the Minister of Trade and Customs is entitled to have that fact announced, and the matter dealt with ; but if it is not, do not honorable members think it is time that the people of New South Wales were made aware of the position? If the House is against Dalgety, and does not intend to go on with the proposal to establish the Capital there, it ought to let the people know what it means to do. </para>

            <para>- I do not know. It is easy for us to say that the people of New South Wales think that such and sucha thing ought to be done, but we cannot positively say that we know what they think. The only thing that I, as a representative of New South Wales, commit myself to in this regard is that the people of that State look to this Parliament to settle the matter without further delay. They may differ just as much as some of us do as to the way in which it should be settled, but I think that honorable members representing New South Wales will say that I have correctly indicated the general feeling. I repeat that the Government may test the question by including in the Additional Estimates an item for a. small expenditure on Dalgety, it being understood that its inclusion is not to bind the Government to that site, and that every member of the Ministry shall be free to vote as he pleases. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">I have no objection to the word &#34; Dalgety &#34; being used in making such a test, since it appears in the Act. If a majority do not approve of that site, it will be open to honorable members to omit the word. A motion to omit it would give us an opportunity to settle the question, and to express an opinion upon it free from the complications arising from a Bill containing a number of items in respect to which honorable members hold different opinions. It would enable us, for instance, to deal with the question apart from any consideration as to the area of the territory to be acquired. I hope that the Government, if they are really anxious to bring the question to a speedy settlement, will adopt this suggestion. There is another matter upon which I wish to speak strongly. Many conveniences have come from federation, but in the light of experience there is one great disadvantage arising from it. Instead of the Federal administration of the Departments being an advantage to the public, it is becoming a serious and grossly aggravated disadvantage. I refer specially to the centralization of the administration of public business. To-day the administration is centred in Melbourne; later on it will be centred in the Federal Capital. There is a disposition to take the administration of even minor matters out of the hands of the chief officers of the Commonwealth in the different States, and to refer them for settlement to the central offices in Melbourne. </para>

          <para>At the Seat of Government each Department possesses what is termed a central office, where the permanent head exercises his functions. The Customs Department has outports throughout the coast-line of the Continent, and the ramifications of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department extend throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. Each Department is represented in the several States by chief officers - highly paid and responsible officials who, subject to control by the central office, administer  the Department within the territorial limits of the State: The intention of the Legislature was, I take it, that a chief officer should, subject to the control and direction of his per manent head, be personally responsible for the proper conduct of business in his State - </para>

            <para>- That is very likely. But that it is pronounced in the Customs Department can be proved by a multitude of instances. Surely the Collector of Customs in Sydney is a man of sufficient discretion to be trusted to decide comparatively small questions ! Yet there is a marked tendency - whenever any slight trouble arises - to divest the Collectors of their proper, duties, and to have all sorts of- small matters decided by the head office. When such matters are forwarded from a number of out-offices there is naturally a clog&#39; in the work of the head office, which results in public inconvenience. </para>

        <para class="block">In matters affecting the Public Service, the Commissioner is, under the Act, represented by an inspector in each of the States who has a full knowledge of local conditions, is conversant with the qualifications of all the officials therein employed, is in constant touch and relationship with the chief officers of Departments, and by whose recommendations the Commissioner is, of necessity, to a large extent guided in the various administrative actions he performs. </para>

        <para>Under the present system, all recommendations by chief officers affecting appointments, transfers, promotions, &#38;c, are sent to me through the central offices, a procedure which gives rise to unnecessary delays and duplication of work, and serves very little purpose. </para>
        <para>We must recollect that if an officer, in the course of these changes, feels aggrieved, he always has his remedy. He is not prevented from bringing his case before the proper authority by way of appeal. But it does seem to me that right through the Federal service there might be a more generous recognition of the officers at the head of affairs in the centres of the different States. They might be trusted a little more. Of course, I recognise that the pressure of red tape and routine, even in the best of public services, is enormous. But if that evil, which is a serious one when associated with one or two offices located in a city, is intensified by an administration which spreads over a Continent embracing 3,000,000 square miles, we can easily see that unless it is very thoroughly checked, the effect of Federation will not be to increase efficiency, but to increase delay and complications. I hope that Ministers in their respective Departments will encourage the transaction of local business at the local centres. There is no act of any officer at a local centre which would not afterwards be subject to review if it happened to be mistaken. But the complaints&#39; which I hear - and which other honorable members frequently hear - of the delays to which members of the community are exposed in dealing1 with Federal authorities represent a state of things which ought to be improved. The honorable member for Coolgardie, I think, was very hasty this afternoon in jumping to the conclusion that, because the Minister of Defence was asked certain questions in reference to the defence policy of the Government by the honorable member for Wentworth, distinguished officers in the Defence Force had inspired him to put those questions. In so acting he jumped at a most ungenerous and unfair conclusion. Had this scheme been submitted to the Boards which had been created to assist the Government upon matters of defence- had it been submitted to the Military Board, the  Council of Defence, or the InspectorGeneral - when this avalanche of attacks came upon Ministers- </para>

            <para>- That is one of the happiest experiences which a, man can have who is a philosopher. The Minister of Defence views this matter after the fashion of Mark Tapley. Yet, as a mere detail, he had to issue a very important memorandum which multiplied the area and length of service by five. But I do not wish to discuss the merits of the scheme yet. We shall have to deal with it in a more practical way when it comes before us. But I desire to ask the Minister whether he did consult the Military Board, <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Council of Defence, or the Inspector-General before the scheme was unfolded to this House? The fact that he could not say this afternoon that he did is conclusive evidence, to my mind, that he did not. Had the scheme been placed before the Council of Defence we should have heard something about it long ere this. It was rather a bit of amusing fencing in which the Minister indulged, and whilst I do not set up any high standard of decorum, I must say that he strained the limits of parliamentary decency very far in his systematic evasion of the questions put to him. </para>

In not consulting the officers of the Department he considers that he has merely acted in the way that any Minister would act. If that be so, surely nothing was to be gained by declining to say frankly, &#34; I did hot consult these authorities, because no Minister- would have done so.&#34; That would have saved halfanhour of the public time this afternoon. </para>

I do not believe that any Ministry in the world ever submitted a military scheme to Parliament without first seeking the advice of its military authorities. The idea that a layman can sit down in his office - a man who cannot possibly know much of military matters, except those of which he has dreamed - and frame a scheme of defence without consulting experienced military authorities in reference to it- </para>

            <para>- I am obliged to my honorable friend. We all know that it had not. If it had, he would not have had to apply&#39; to the cadets of Australia for their opinions. It is a marvellous thing that the Council of Defence was not asked to assist the Government in framing a scheme of defence for submission to Parliament ; but that, after the scheme had been framed, and submitted, the rank and file and the cadets were asked to express their criticism  upon  it, and to offer suggestions in regard to it. In any other Parliament such a procedure would be received with derision. Before this Heaven-born scheme had been submitted to Parliament, it could not stand the test of examination even&#34; by&#39; the Council appointed to advise the Government. Surely the Council could have given valuable advice on many of its bearings. Had such advice been obtained in regard to its financial aspect, the Government would not have made such blunders as it has made. The Minister of Defence did not pursue a sensible course in ignoring the Council before the submission of the scheme to Parliament, and. after its submission, in asking for suggestions in regard to it from&#39; every member of the force. I do not object to a Minister getting all the advice that he  Cf.n.  But how can one expect to get a good military scheme by ignoring the Council of Defence, and calling some particular officer to the counsels of the Ministry? Before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane</inline> submitted his military scheme, it had been threshed out for months by the eminent soldiers of- the Empire, whose best professional advice was at the service of the British Government. I do not say that our Government should have taken the principle of its military scheme from their advisers ; but surely it is better that a shipwright shall see the ship before it is launched, than that any number shall look at it afterwards. </para>

            <para>- Yes; but most men who are not shipwrights would take the advice of shipwrights before proceeding to build. The honorable member&#39;s scheme1 - which might have- been an excellent one - is so disfigured by amateur work that we may never have the pleasure of considering  it. In conclusion, I wish to know if the Treasurer can tell us the nature of the Additional Estimates ; do they cover a large expenditure ? </para>

          <para>.- I wish, first, to express my personal opinion in regard to the duration of the present session, and, in doing so, I shall not speak for the party which I represent. My idea is that we shall best serve those who have sent us here by proroguing directly we have dealt with immediately urgent business, and commencing a new session early in the next financial year. It is important that we should have an interval, however short, in which to rest and visit our constituents before dealing with the great issues which will shortly be placed before us. </para>

            <para>- In many electorates the summer is not a convenient season for visiting constituents, whereas the early spring and summer are much pleasanter seasons for our Melbourne meeting than is the winter here. Personally, neither heat nor cold inconveniences me; I am considering the matter from the. stand-point of the public good. As to defence, I think that we have yet a long way to go before arriving at any definite scheme for the defence of Australia. The procedure adopted by the Government, in asking every soldier to furnish his private opinion as to the best means of improving our defence, has one large, and several subsidiary, defects. I understand that the criticism of the privates must be forwarded to the Minister of Defence through a succession of officers - corporal, sergeant, lieutenant, captain, major, colonel, and major-general. </para>

            <para>- Any one who has served in theranks will know what sort of criticism is likely to be obtained under that system. Criticism to be of value should be honest and thorough.. A corporal looking to his captain for promotion to the rank of sergeant is not likely to reflect on the captain. Even the most honest will lean to the view of his commanding officer, if he can discover it ; at any rate, he will find a great likeness between his own view and that of the man who is in a position to affect his promotion.He may be none the worse soldier for that. The training of men in the ranks is to have no will of their own, but to obey their commanding officers absolutely, these being supposed to know so much more than their privates that the exercise of individual judgment by the rank and file almost amounts to mutiny. I hope that the Minister will make it known that every private may send his criticism of the military position direct to the head of the Department, and I hope that the honorable gentleman will himself reviewthe whole of the correspondence. He has abounding good nature, and we are always delighted to see and hear him, because we know that beneath a humorous exterior he has a very good heart. He is to be congratulated upon the manner in which he has endeavoured to deal with this very  difficult question. Coming now to the Public Service, I admit at once that more decentralization is desirable. I do not say that it is good that the Customs officers of the different States should give individual opinions on Tariff matters - there must be one governing opinion ; but, as regards minor matters of administration, more power in the settling of disputes should be given to the chief executive officers of the States. I go further than the Public Service Commissioner in this matter. When in office I came to the conclusion that our Public Service is not as Federal as it ought to be, and I embodied my ideas in a memorandum, in which. I stated that in the re-arrangement of offices in the Customs Department officers should not be regarded as belonging to one particular State, but should- hold themselves liable to be called upon at any time to be sent to any part of the Commonwealth. Until we have a Commonwealth service which is Federal in fact as well as in law we shall not have the Federal spirit necessary to make us a nation. The unwritten law at the present time is that no officer shall be moved out of his State. </para>

            <para>- The Treasurer may have transferred a number of high officers. To the credit of the service be it said that, when an officer desires, because of illhealth or other sufficient reason, to be transferred from one part of the Commonwealth to another, the transfer is generally made. The Public Service Commissioner is an excellent man, but he did not approve of that&#39; idea, and, with all respect, I think he was in error. Nothing would do greater service, especially in the Customs Department, than for the younger officers to be compelled to move about the Continent. This would give them extended knowledge and experience of the Commonwealth, and the experiment would, I venture to say, result in less complaint from the public. I have always held that the people of New South Wales have a right to have the Federal Capital within their territory. We must remember, however, that the New South Wales people, on the first vote on the Constitution Bill, decided in favour of Federation without any stipulation as to where the Federal Capital should be placed. </para>

            <para>- I admit that to the full, but it does not affect the point, seeing that the Constitution lays it down that the Federal Capital shall be in New South Wales. On the second occasion, referred to by the honorable member for Parramatta, there was much more excitement on the question in all the States, and, therefore, a larger vote was cast. The choice of the Commonwealth Parliament of. a site for the Federal Capital was deliberately made after careful debate. I saw no unfair combinations, or any desire evinced to injure New South Wales when the Dalgety site was selected. </para>

            <para>- That means&#39; nothing. One of the ablest Presidents of the United States had only one nominator on the first occasion, but that did not prove him to be unfit for the office. While New South Wales may have a legitimate grievance in the fact that such a length of time has elapsed without a site being finally selected, I am suspicious that there is a non-national sentiment in and around Sydney on the question. New South Wales representatives, the newspapers, and some of the people of the State, seem to regard this as not a national question, but as one which concerns New South Wales only. Even if it were stipulated in the Constitution that the capital should be as near as possible to Sydney, we should still have to remember that we were choosing a site for the national capital. We should doubtless be all quite willing to give Sydney all it desires, other conditions being equal. </para>

            <para>- I shall not pursue the question further, because I shall have another opportunity of debating it. I may say, however, that it has afforded me some amusement to read official notices issued by the Government of New South Wales, and to hear the opinions expressed thereon during discussions of this question. At any rate, in my opinion the Federal Parliament is not meeting in the best position; it is not meeting where the people of Australia expected it would meet eight or ten years after the consummation of Federation. I am strongly of opinion that the people in general are greatly misled in regard to the expense of a Federal capital. Nothing is more mischievous or wrong than for public men and great journals to speak of the &#34;enormous cost&#34; which will accompany the establishment of the Commonwealth city. At the present time, as the result of our meeting in Melbourne, we are paying interest on nearly half-a-million of money, and that interest could easily be saved if we were within territory of our own. In my opinion, it would mean less annual expenditure to build and maintain a Federal Capital than will be involved in a few years if we continue to sit in Melbourne. For that reason I regard the matter of the Federal Capital as one of urgency; and I hope that New South Wales representatives will take a broad and national view of the question. I trust we shall have a short, happy, and beneficial session, enabling us to have an early recess, and to return with renewed vigour to our important duties in the next financial year. </para>

            <para>- And I intend to show that there are a great many urgent matters. No man cares to pose as a &#34; croaker,&#34; and yet in the case of every Supply Bill I have had to appear in that character. There have been five or six Supply Bills during the present session, and still the Estimates are not yet touched. On each occasion of the introduction of a Supply Bill we have the same remarks and apologies, and the same criticism. To-day the leader of the Opposition regarded the practice of giving two months&#39; supply as objectionable; but he gave way, although I had hoped he would resist the motion if only in order to show the public that our consideration of the Estimates is not a fiction but a reality. I am old-fashioned enough to believe that the criticism of the Estimates, with the consequent control of the public purse, is one of the most serious responsibilities of a public representative. However, if the new order of things is that we are to be governed by Supply Bills, let us make the fact clear. We have lost control of ten out of the twelve months&#39; expenditure, and in this connexion I have a suggestion to make. The excuse this time is the Tariff ; and my suggestion is that that, and no other excuse, shall serve in the future for a similar number of Supply Bills. We have, as I say, surrendered all control of the Estimates for the present year, and I suggest that beyond the ordinary discussion on the administration of the Departments there be no objection raised. Let the Estimates be passed ; and then, before we go into recess, let the Budget and Estimates for the coming year be dealt with. </para>

            <para>- I understand the Treasurer to say that he agrees with me, and has made a suggestion to the Prime Minister. I recognise that the Estimates must be dealt with in the year to which they relate, and I would point out that a little more than three months hence we shall be able to deal with those for 1908-9. We have many more important measures to occupy our consideration in the meantime ; and if we deal with the Estimates in July,  we shall do away with the necessity for the passing of Supply Bills. Their introduction month after month is admittedly a slovenly system of dealing with our &#39; finances, and has been denounced as a most dangerous one. Coming to another question, I contend, and it cannot be denied, that the centralization of the administration of the Departments is a source of much dissatisfaction. </para>

            <para>- That, at all events, is not the position in connexion with a much larger Department - that over which the Postmaster-General presides ; centralization is its weak spot. We cannot afford to pay &#163;900 or ^1,000 per annum to officers who cannot be intrusted with the responsibility of dealing with even minor matters of administration. A request that a window in a post-office be repaired has to be transmitted to the central office to be dealt with. The  Postmaster-General  must recognise that the present system of centralization is destroying the effectiveness of the Department. No doubt he is endeavouring, as far as he is able, to institute reforms, and has experienced great difficulty in doing so. One of the best schemes yet suggested for overcoming the difficulty is that proposed by the honorable member for Robertson, who has given notice of his intention to move that, in the opinion of the House, the Department should be administered by Commissioners. Why should the  Deputy  Postmaster-General in any of the States be unable to deal with even small matters of administration? I could understand matters of policy being referred to the central office, but surely comparatively, trifling questions of administration ought to be dealt with by the  Deputy  PostmasterGeneral in each State. I am not complaining of any officer. My attack is directed against the system, and I hope that Commissioners will be appointed to administer the Department, just as the railways of some of the States are directed by Commissioners. </para>

            <para>- I have not overlooked that fact ; but I do not think that there are insuperable difficulties in the way of the adoption of the proposal. We have been told that an application has. been made for the appointment of 1,500 men to the Post and Telegraph Department. If that number is required, it is palpable that the Department has been undermanned and inefficiently managed. The Post and Telegraph Department enters as much into the every-day life of the people as does a Water Supply Department, and it has either been undermanned or inefficiently administered. If so large a number of additional hands is required, it is strange that the responsible heads of the Department have failed before this to bring the matter under notice. </para>

            <para>- I certainly do; and that is another reason why we should lose nO time- in dealing with the question of the  undermanning  of the Department. I do not wish to pose as a croaker in respect to the establishment of the Federal Capital, but I have no hesitation in saying that the people of New South Wales feel that they have been humbugged and fooled ir&#187; regard to it by the Commonwealth Parliament, It is true that a site has been chosen, but the Parliament of New South Wales has strongly objected to the selection made. The majority of the electors of New South Wales have come to regard as mere by-play our complaints of delay. They look upon every reference that we make to the subject as a mere flash in the pan - as an effort on our part to remind them that we have not altogether forgotten the matter. The Prime Minister was asked this afternoon when he intended to invite the House .to deal finally with the question, and his reply was, &#34; As soon as I can ascertain the opinion of honorable members.&#34; If he wishes to ascertain our views he can do so through the medium of the very Bill that we are now considering. The only way to bring the Government to its bearings is to refuse to grant it Supply. The representatives of New South Wales should resist the granting of Supply until the Government have shown their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> in respect of the intimation that they intend to deal with the Federal Capital Site this session. In December last the Prime Minister told the Premier of New South Wales that an effort- would be made to have the  question&#39; dealt with this session. - Subsequently, in reply to a question in the -House as to&#39; whether he meant to deal&#39; with it . during the present session, he answered, &#34;After the adjournment.&#34; Now he says he wishes, -first of all, to ascertain the views of honorable members. What is the use of my appealing for a settlement of the question when honorable members more experienced than I am refuse to avail themselves of the machinery by which the Government can te forced to take action? We should refuse to grant Supply until the Government show their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> in the matter. I. trust that the plea of the honorable member for Wide Bay for a short session will be disregarded. We. have only just returned from a three months&#39; recess. Unfortunately, I differ from some honorable members in that I have nothing to do but to attend to my parliamentary duties. I make that statement openly, and I regret that I have not other matters to which I could devote my attention. But the public of Australia expect something more than mere political placards to be brought forward session after session: They expect us to pass urgently-needed legislation. I do not believe in legislating merely for the sake of legislating, but I certainly think that the Commonwealth requires a Navigation Act and an amending Defence Act. It is almost of as much moment to the public that the banking laws of the several States shall be made uniform. The Commonwealth has now been established for eight years, and yet the same facilities which previously existed for designing speculators to impose &#39; upon confiding investors exist to-day. Keen, shrewd, business men. in this House have repeatedly emphasized the absolute necessity of dealing with this matter, and I hope that they will insist upon action being taken in regard to it during the present session. Then I hold that to allow a Government to carry on the administration of the country by means of Supply Bills, and thus to neglect our control of the Estimates, is not the proper way of conducting business. I trust that the Ministry do not intend merely to pass this Supply Bill, to hurry through the Estimates, to deal with !one or two measures of minor importance, and then to enter upon a recess of two or three months.&#39;&#39; I believe that if Ave continue in session we. can do effective work, and conclude our labours by next October.

          <para>.- There is just one matter connected with the Defence scheme of the Government to which I desire to invite attention. It relates to the action of the Ministry in consulting the officers and men of the Defence Forces in regard to that scheme. Personally, I think that in asking the men who will be chiefly affected by this great national upheaval, and who know most about its effect, to express their opinions upon it, they have acted wisely. But I am satisfied that at the present time the public do not realize that the proposals of the Government involve compulsory drill on the part of employes, and the attendance of youths, for eighteen days annually during a period of three .years, in a training camp. Personally, I do not object to these proposals. On the contrary, I approve of them. It is, however, only right that the public should know of them, and I am convinced that they are not yet seized of their very revolutionary nature so far as the economic and family life of the Commonwealth are concerned. But I wish especially to&#39; point out the manner in which the Minister of Defence has allowed his instructions to be rendered nugatory by the officers of his Department. When the Prime Minister announced that the officers and men of the Defence Forces were at liberty to express their opinions of the Government scheme, I asked that they should be permitted to communicate them directly to the Minister, instead of being required to send them through their sectional commanders, who, in turn, would forward them through their captains and commanding officers, by whom they would be transmitted through a Brigadier to the State Commandant. I hold that the men should have been allowed to express their opinions untramelled. </para>

            <para>- In this connexion I wish to quote the statement of a very experienced militiaman - a second lieutenant who has had a long service in the ranks. This officer remarked to me, &#34;I should very  much like to communicate my opinion of the scheme to the Minister, but I have to remember that my commission has not yet been confirmed.&#34; I think that in taking that view he showed himself to be a wise man. As a matter of fact, only one officer out of the battalion to which I am attached, which comprises 29 officers and 406 men, communicated his views to the Minister, and he did so from a sense ot duty because ,he thought that the battalion ought to be represented. I now wish to show how some officers at Head-quarters who do not believe in the scheme proposed by the Government have attempted to block it. An order was issued by the Department that all the opinions of the members of the Defence Forces should reach the State Commandant by a certain date. Accompanying the order, in the case of my own battalion, were fourteen copies of the Prime- Minister&#39;s speech. These had to Suffice to supply about. 435 officers and men. Attention was publicly called to this matter, and then the Prime Minister announced through the press that every man in the Forces who wished to do so was nt liberty to express his opinion of the scheme through the State Commandant. What was the result? On the 14th and 15th January last, almost SUEcient copies of the Prime Minister&#39;s speech were distributed in the Metropolitan Orderly Rooms, Melbourne, and . the replies had to reach the State Commandant by to a.m. on 16th January. So that officers and men were allowed .only about twenty-four hours in which to formulate their criticisms of a scheme which the Minister had taken months to prepare, and to&#39; which he .had devoted a tremendous amount of attention. </para>

            <para>- I can assure the Minister that if he will permit any member oi the Defence Forces to communicate his opinion of the scheme direct to himself within the next fortnight he will get some very valuable criticisms. Personally I hold strong opinions as to the value of the control of the Defence Forces by means of committees. In 1905 I opposed that amendment of the Defence Act, and I think that it has been a failure. In my opinion, . the creation of a Council of Defence and a Military Board have made it impossible to sheet home responsibility to any of the officers of the Head-quarters Staff. I am able to express my opinion freely, because I am a member of this House; but there may be many other members of the Defence Forces who might like to make a similar criticism but find it impossible, because if they criticised they would for ever afterwards be justified in regarding themselves as marked men. I myself have faced a good deal of that sort of thing, and can afford to disregard it. I consider my commanding officer one of the best; but if an ordinary member of the Forces thought his commanding officer inefficient, the State Commandant incompetent, or the system of appointment unsatisfactory, he would hardly risk saying so. In my opinion, it is unsatisfactory that the Military Board should be composed of juniors who are always struggling to obtain better positions, with constant changes as the result. Last year the Chief of Ordnance and the  Chairman  of the Military Board were stated in the press to be competing for the appointment of the Victorian Commandantship.  As an ordinary soldier, I could not make these things known, or if I did, I could never expect promotion at the hands of those whom I had criticised, and yet they are a very necessary part of the fair criticism of the scheme. Indeed, it would be asking too much of&#39; the higher officers. They might be proof against the temptation to express displeasure at criticism, but the general opinion is that they are not. Subordinates ought not to be asked to jeopardize their future by forwarding perhaps vitally necessary criticism of the Defence scheme through seniors upon whom they may have to animadvert. </para>

            <para>- If the Minister is going to observe all the regulations, the criticism he asks for cannot be forthcoming. But as an absolute military crisis is approaching, observance of the regulations should be made subservient to the national good. While the regulations prohibit men from writing direct to the Minister, they also prohibit them from criticising .their commanding .officers ; but as they are to be waived for one purpose,&#34; &#34;why not waive them for another? I am satisfied that the honorable gentleman will consult the Prime Minister on this matter, and I urge him to bring about the only arrangement which will allow him to get valuable information. </para>

The other day I was in a postoffice where six of the eleven persons employed were temporary hands - boys. </para>

            <para>- Yes. It can easily be imagined that very indifferent service is often obtained from lads who know that within a month they will be discharged. Such lads often treat their superiors very insolently. Indeed^ in most of the country towns the supply of persons who would be acceptable as temporary hands has run out, and the Department has to take boys who are absolutely unfitted for their positions. If salaries were provided for permanent hands, there would be the best educated lads in the district to choose from. I should&#39; like to know why the Postmaster-General does not appoint a sufficient number of permanent hands to enable the Department&#39; to be properly worked. Why is public money being spent on temporary service which is unsatisfactory, when good permanent service could be obtained for the expenditure? </para>

            <para>- Yes. Another matter to which I wish to draw attention is the need for more expenditure on telephone and telegraph lines. Instead of making this expenditure now, when the revenues of both Commonwealth and States are buoyant, and the money can well be spared, the Treasurer is handing back to the States sums which are not required by them. </para>

            <para>- Yes; though he talks of bringing in a Bill to prevent him from having to return this surplus. Now that money is plentiful, the Ministry should not only increase the wages vote, but provide the capital expenditure necessary to carry out urgent works required by the Post and Telegraph Department. If this is not done now, adverse seasons will come, revenues will diminish, and nothing will be done without further trenching on the paltry increases and allowances of the officials. I hope, later in the session, to say a few words in regard to a matter referred to by the leader of the Opposition - the poor prospects before many of our public servants. If the Treasurer and PostmasterGeneral carry out the reforms which I have suggested, the postal administration of the Commonwealth will be greatly improved. </para>

          <para>. - I suppose it is quite unnecessary to point out that temporary Supply Bills are most pernicious in principle, and amount really to the passing of the Estimates without consideration. When we have made one more step, we shall have covered the whole ground of a year&#39;s Supply. This action shows us to be quite unfitted for the transaction of affairs in accordance with business methods. No ordinary business man would adopt a method which I regard as discreditable to every honorable member, and particularly &#39; to every responsible Minister. No business man would spend millions of money without considering the scheme as a whole ; but here we have one step taken at a time, though each step, based on temporary supply, commits the Government to the entire expenditure. Any blame for the present lax system I must share as a member, but Ministers cannot be excused for continuing the old system. As to the Federal Capital, we have been considering this question for a number of years ; and it is time that this Parliament showed that it is earnest in the matter. The honorable mem-. ber for Wide Bay talked, about the broad view which he desired the representatives of New South Wales to take, and he spoke of the first vote on the Constitution Bill, when the people of New South Wales, by a majority, declared in favour of Federation. The leader of the Opposition was against that Bill, but when he withdrew his objection, it went through flying. Why did the leader of the Opposition withdraw his objection? He had made a compact in regard to the situation of the Federal Capital ; and that contract has not yet teen complied with. I have heard that the leader of the Opposition, as representing New South Wales, suggested to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, as Premier of Victoria, that the Federal Capital should be anywhere beyond 80 miles &#39;from Sydney, but that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner insisted on a limit of 100 miles, or otherwise the Capital would have been at Moss Vale, which was then favoured. The Constitution Bill would not have been passed by the people of New South Wales, but for the provision in regard to the Federal Capital. There were five States in favour of Federation; and why did they not federate irrespective of New South Wales? Because it was known that Federation could not be financed unless the mother Colony were included. The people of New South Wales were humbugged into believing that the public men of the other States who favoured Federation were honest. Why should there be any hesitancy about settling this question of the Federal Capital? In New South Wales several local Governments have lived on this question, because members of the Parliament have had eligible sites within their constituencies, and no Premier has had backbone enough to single out any particular site. Even the present Government favours Lyndhurstwhich we know to be impossible - simply because a member of the Government has some interest in the place. It is the placing of the interests of individuals before  the interests of the community that is doing all the harm. The Minister of Trade and Customs has within his electorate two or three possible sites. </para>

          <para>.- It is a mistake to assume that any disinclination exists on the part of honorable members from other States to definitely select the site of the Federal Capital. The honorable member for Robertson charges the House with breach of faith in having so far failed to make the selection. The answer to that is a reference to the Constitution, which contains no arbitrary direction in the matter. No time is specified. If it were intended that this question should be settled within a particular time, I apprehend the framers of the Constitution would, as they did in respect to the Customs Tariff, have fixed a time limit which must not be exceeded. In my judgment many arguments might be advanced to show how advisable it would be to postpone the settlement&#39; of this question for another fifty years. Australia, as a glance at the map will show, is practically unoccupied, the settled portion being confined to a fringe of the coast ; and we ought to wait for some years before deciding such an important question as that raised by the honorable member for. Robertson. I am sure that the peopleof New </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>South Wales are too reasonable to hold that they only are interested in this question. All the States are concerned in the selection of a site which will not only suit this generation, but will meet the needs of Australia for all time. That is a point of view which representatives of New South Wales continually leave out of consideration. When this question again comes up for review, I shall endeavour to give a vote in the interests of Australia ; and I see nothing in the written Constitution, or in the Convention debates which preceded it, to justify the contention that the Federal Capital should be close to Sydney. It is only the immense influence of the enormous population of Sydney, and the commercial interests of the local newspapers that have kept this question in front in the objectionable manner with which we are familiar. I know no honorable member from other States who desires to settle the capital at Dalgety, Lyndhurst, the New England table-land, or anywhere else except in the best interests of the Australian nation. That is the point of view from which we ought to regard the matter. The question is where shall we, in the interests of the future of Australia, place the Capital, and not whether it shall be at Moss Vale, Goulburn, or on the heights of North Shore. If it would satisfy the people of New South Wales I should be prepared to support a proposal that the Parliament hold its sittings in Sydney for the next ten or twenty years. </para>

            <para>-We have recently secured an amendment of the Constitution, and a further amendment of it is not impossible. The establishment of the Seat of Government at Sydney would be a distinct advantage to that city. Representatives of Victoria again and again disputed the contention that it was advantageous to Melbourne to have the Seat of Government here ; but it has been proved that it means a very large annual expenditure which must have a beneficial effect upon the trade and commerce of this State. .

            <para>- Dalgety is only 50 miles from Bombala, and there is no reason why, if we secured the necessary territory, we should not include Bombala within the Federal area. Another justification for any delay on the part of this Parliament is the reluctance shown by the - Government of. New South Wales to cede to the Commonwealth the necessary area. I should not be in favour of the acquisition of any territory as the Site of the Federal Capital to which access could not be gained either from another State or by sea. I have an eye to the future. We are all familiar with the complications which arose in the United States of America when the South took up arms against the North. If the Federal Capital were isolated - if it were established on a small area in New South Wales, which could&#34; not be reached except through territory over which we had no control, we should be practically under the domination of the State Parliament. lt would be able to interrupt our supplies and place various impediments in the way of the advancement of the Federal territory. </para>

            <para>- One honorable member could not- hope to do much in the way of passing legislation unless he had the support of the House. I come now to another matter. Those who complain about the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department are entitled to a good deal of sympathy. I heard the leader of the Opposition refer to the sufferings . of postal officials, and speak of an officer who, after twenty-two years in the service, is receiving only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;160</inline> per annum. I do no!: know, whether the right honorable gentleman ever reads the reports of the debates in this House or examines the Acts we have passed. If he does, he must know perfectly well that the salary of the officer to whom he referred is paid to him under an Act passed by this Parliament, and that therefore there is no justification for any complaint against the Department.  Wages  and salaries are paid&#39; according&#39; to the divisions fixed by the Public Service Act, and if there is any complaint to be made, it must be levelled, not against the Public Service Commissioner, or the PostmasterGeneral, but against this Legislature. Complaint has also been made as to the large number of temporary hands employed in the Department. In that respect, too, the Parliament and not the Department or the Postmaster-General is to blame. </para>

            <para>- This Parliament has vested the Public Service Commissioner not merely with the powers ordinarily conferred upon such an officer, but has given him - or he has taken - the power to interfere with the internal management of the Departments. At the present time an officer .cannot be appointed or promoted except upon the recommendation of the Public Service Commissioner. The Executive Council can, of course, refuse to confirm his nominations, but the exercise of that power would not meet the difficulty which exists. The difficulty is the refusal,, not of the Executive Council, but apparently of the Public Service Commissioner to nominate more permanent hands. </para>

            <para>- When the sitting was suspended I was pointing out to the honorable member for Gwydir that the PostmasterGeneral was not to blame for the number of temporary hands employed in the Postal Department or for the number of such employes required to carry on the government of the country generally. The honorable member appeared to think that the departmental chiefs were responsible for the large . excess of temporary hands engaged in the service, and for the failure to make permanent appointments. Certainly in the last report of the Public Service Commissioner there is a sentence which lends some . colour to that assumption. The Commissioner says - </para>

        </continue>
        <quote>
          <para>Another pernicious practice is that of employing temporary hands for lengthened periods in cases where permanent appointments are justified, and should be made. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>I propose to show that the Public Service Commissioner is responsible for the neglect of the Departments &#39;to recommend the appointment of permanent officers. For instance, in his report for 1966, page 1633. Vol. 2, of <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Papers,</inline> I find the following - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Every requisition submitted by Departments for an increase of staff, whether by way of permanent appointment or temporary assistance, is carefully scrutinized and inquired into by my inspectors, so that, before sanctioning the increased expenditure, I may be fully advised as to whether the extra assistance is actually necessary, or whether the requisite help cannot be secured by a re-arrangement of staffs. </para>
          <para class="block">Now, the plan which is adopted may be very briefly outlined. Let us suppose that the  Deputy  PostmasterGeneral in a distant State capital requisitions for extra assistance. Instead of his requisition coming direct to Melbourne and being dealt with by- the PostmasterGeneral - which is the course that should be adopted, because if the  Deputy  Postmaster-General is not competent to decide whether extra assistance is really necessary, he is not fit for his position - it has to await a report by the Public Service Inspector, who at the time may be 1,000 miles distant. That officer at length  presents himself at the office of the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, and probably  says to him, &#34; I doubt whether you have made the best arrangement possible. Why cannot you take a man from this position and place him in that position, thus rearranging your staff so as to obviate the necessity for the appointment of. additional permanent employes?&#34; The inspector next forwards his report to Melbourne, &#39; where it has to be inquired into at the Commissioner&#39;s office. After the report has been scrutinized the  Deputy  Postmaster-General at &#39; Perth will probably be advised by the Department that his requisition for so many permanent hands will be granted. An advertisement will then have to be inserted in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette,</inline> and all the necessary formalities gone through in connexion with the filling of the vacancies. So that the honorable member for Gwydir, who is inclined to blame the Department for circumlocution, ought to remember the cumbrous machinery which we have established, and which has to be put into operation before permanent appointments can be made. In spite of the paragraph contained in the last report of the Public Service Commissioner, I maintain that the stand which he has taken up from the beginning has tended to multiply the number of temporary hands employed, and to impede the appointment of permanent officers. He goes on to add - </para>
          <para>A lax scrutiny is also exercised with regard to the necessity of filling vacancies caused by retirements, resignations, and dismissals. . . . By pursuing this policy I hope in time to gradually reduce and keep reduced the staffs to the last possible limits consistent with efficiency. </para>
          <para>That policy in itself is right enough. I hold that every man in the public service should earn his salary. But when the Departments are blamed for the number of temporary hands employed, I have a right to point out that the trend of the policy adopted by the Public Service Commissioner has been to create the difficulty which now exists, the responsibility for which he and some honorable members of this Chamber are inclined to place upon shoulders which should not bear it. The Commissioner adds - </para>
          <para class="block">I hope . . not only to check unjustifiable attempts to swell the number of hands in  Departments, but by keeping the staff down to the lowest limits to compel officers to look round for simpler and more up-to-date methods. </para>
          <para class="block">That is a very desirable thing no doubt. But the Public Service Commissioner knew perfectly well from the beginning that there were more temporary hands employed in the various Departments than there ought to have been. The figures and his comments on temporary employment prove that. Yet, while pretending to deprecate the practice of calling in temporary hands, his policy is such as compels the adoption of the alternative. Just when a temporary employe&#34; is beginning to render effective assistance he is cast adrift. </para>

            <para>- I admit that; but Parliament is responsible for that state of affairs, and not the . Postmaster-General. Parliament deliberately decreed that no temporary hands should be employed for a longer period than nine months. The Commissioner, however, must have been aware that an unjustifiable number of temporary employes was engaged in the various Departments. </para>

            <para>- He may be nominally opposed to it. But in his report he states that his policy is to gradually reduce anc! keep reduced the staffs of the various Departments to the lowest possible limits. If that be so, it follows that the Departments.  must be undermanned, so that when an emergency arrives it becomes absolutely necessary to engage temporary employes. The Commissioner himself, and not the Department, is responsible for this evil. </para>

            <para>- Exactly. We can all be virtuous in public. The Commissioner knew perfectly well that the number of temporary employes in the Departments was rapidly increasing, because he had the figures before him. Apart from the exemption list, which runs into thousands, the number of temporary hands employed in 1904 was i,755; a&#34;d their cost was &#163;24,481 ; in 1905, the number had in-  creased to 1,833, costing ^32,511; and in 1906 it had still further increased to 1,936, costing .&#163;34,409. It will thus be seen that within three years the increased cost of these temporary employes was just about &#163;10,000. </para>

            <para>- No. Honorable members who peruse the Commissioner&#39;s report will discover that he occasionally forgets the position which he occupies under the Public Service Act, and apparently is stretching out to assume a measure of control of departmental business which the law does not clearly give him. I admit that the demarcation between his functions and those of the Secretary of the Postal De:partment and the Comptroller-General of Customs is very indistinct. At the same time, it seems to me that if these gentlemen are competent to hold the positions to which they have been appointed, they should not be hampered by outside interference to the extent which now prevails. I sympathize very much with the complaints which have been made in regard to postal administration generally. But I would point out that, after all, the number of complaints emanating from the city and suburbs are infinitesimal when compared with those which might readily be laid against the Department by the residents of far inland centres. I have said something about this before ; but it cannot be too often repeated in this Chamber that there is a tendency to increase the facilities of communication in cities and towns, where the population is dense, and can make its influence felt, .and to starve outlying centres. Great complaint is made if a delay of half-an-hour occurs in the delivery of a letter in a Melbourne suburb enjoying three deliveries a day ; but what about the people in the back country who receive only one mail per week or fortnight? Should we not give more -thought to the pioneering population who are combatting the difficulties incident to the settlement of a new country ? Let me recount what happens when I ask for a new mail service or telephone line to an outlying centre, where perhaps there are 300 or 400 miners 30 to 80 miles distant from a medical man. A guarantee is demanded, though generally there is no local body possessing the legal qualifications necessary to enable it to give such a guarantee. My request for this necessary facility is flatly refused unless the Department is satisfied that the revenue will cover the expenditure. But, while country services are starved, the Commonwealth spends  about &#163;150,000 a year on an ocean mail service, and some &#163;45,000 on a telephone line to connect Melbourne and Sydney. I have always contended that, inasmuch as the bulk of the business between the capitals of Australia and Europe is now transacted by cable, regular and rapid steamer communication is not of so much importance to us as it was. We could very well pay for the carriage of our oversea mails by a poundage rate, and would save nearly &#163;100,000 in doing so. The so-called mail service is really a rapid and more certain service for the transport of perishable produce, for the&#39; advantage of certain favoured classes. To the bulk of the community it would matter little if letters were a week or two longer in transit. While money is squandered on those who are full to repletion, the country is absolutely neglected. Iunderstand that of legitimate charges were made against it, the Sydney-Melbourne telephone line would be seen not to pay anything like expenses. That line is maintained, notwithstanding that the. business men of the two cities have a good telegraphic service, and a rapid train service which enables letters to be sent from one city to the other in about seventeen hours. </para>

            <para>- The merchants of Flinderslane can better afford to give guarantees than can the workers in the back country, who need every penny they have for the promotion of their industries. But it is almost impossible to make an impression upon the representatives of the favoured localities, who, being in the majority, can carry things their own way. Still I shall on every occasion enter my protest against the neglect of country districts in the matter of Postal administration. I understand that this Supply Bill gives the Government money sufficient to enable it to carry on to the end of the financial year; but before it is passed we should have information from the Treasurer in regard to several matters connected with our expenditure. For instance, we should have a statement regarding the Queensland sugar bounty, which is costing &#163;500,000, or a little more, this year. Is it to be increased or reduced? And what is the position of the taxpayer in regard to it ? </para>

            <para>- Apparently the honorable member, although cordially approving of my previous remarks, objects to my comments on the sugar bounty. I recognise that we have to some extent committed ourselves; but that does not absolve the Treasurer from giving us information in regard to the matter. In the Bill . &#163;500 is provided for the repatriation of Pacific Islanders. These people were brought to Queensland by the State Government, for the benefit of a State industry, and to meet the expense of repatriation&#163;5 was paid by the planters for each kanaka imported. As the Commonwealth Government ultimately made itself responsible for the repatriation, the money should have gone to it, but I am afraid that it has been dealt with by the Government of Queensland in a manner which would bring about the imprisonment of a private individual. The. Queensland Government is very loud in its complaints against the Commonwealth, but it should make some explanation of its action in throwing on us the whole cost of the repatriation of the kanakas. I suppose it was necessary that the Commonwealth should undertake that responsibility ; but as the islanders were imported by the Queensland Government solely for the benefit of that State, the money obtained from the planters to pay for their repatriation should be handed over to the Commonwealth. Another matter upon which I wish to touch is this - the High Court being the creation of this Parliament, we should be jealous of its position, and very careful to see that it is not flouted. The Constitution places it above all the other courts of the country, and its interpretation of the law is binding on them. Perhaps it may seem sacrilege to lawyers for a layman to deal with, these matters, but I feel in duty bound to draw attention to a statement by the Chief Justice published in Saturday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> It has reference to a case which came before the High Court on appeal from the  Supreme Court of Victoria, in regard to which the Chief Justice said - </para>

        <para>Those orders are a deliberate overruling of the decision of this Court, which ordered that the inquiry should go on before the hearing by the Privy Council. </para>

        <para class="block">There is also an order as to costs in the second order. That is to say that a successful suitor in this Court is ordered to pay costs for asking the Supreme Court to obey an order of this Court. So far as the order of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges is concerned, there is no necessity to give leave to appeal, but the position is different as to the other order. . In the meantime this Court had decided on an appeal from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> A&#39;Beckett that the Supreme Court had no power to stay in such a case. Another episode also occurred before me in chambers^ when an application was made to me to treat the defendants as in contempt, and I held so, and I withdrew the stay granted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .</inline> Justice Hodges. </para>
        <para>It is a serious thing for the highest Court in the land to be flouted, and if that tribunal has not the power to punish those who disobey its orders, we should confer that power upon it. I do not know whether the Court possesses the power necessary to enforce its orders ; if  so, it is certainly strange that it should permit itself to be treated with contempt. I cannot see any reason why Chief Justice Madden or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges should be privileged to flout the High Court any more than Bill Jones or any other individual in the street. </para>

            <para>- It did not. It merely made a protest, of which no notice was taken. How. did the High Court protect the successful litigant, when he was mulcted in heavy costs because the Supreme Court would not carry out the order of the High Court? This matter is certainly worthy of the attention of the Government. If the High Court haspower to protect itself, and will not do so, there is an end of the matter; but it is to be assumed that if the Court possessed the power, it would not - allow its orders to be flouted. If the . High Court does not possess the power, then this Parliament ought to confer it. There are many other matters to which I could refer, but I shall content myself with those with which I have already dealt. </para>

            <para>- I quite understand it is necessary to ask for supply, but I am npt satisfied as to the urgency of two* months&#39; supply. Admitting the necessity for providing for salaries and current obligations, I think it would have been much better to have asked for supply for one month, and then, if occasion arose, to ask for further supply. The Treasurer, in hisbrief explanation, said that this was a matter of urgency, and that there was not time to prepare the Additional Estimates in one month. </para>

            <para>- We are face to face with the fact that when we grant this twomonths&#39; supply there are only two months of the financial year left unprovided for, so that we have practically passed the Estimates on Supply Bills. However, as the leader of the Opposition has taken no exception to this procedure, I, as a private member, can do no more than express my disapproval of this slipshod manner of conducting the finances. I had anticipated! that the Treasurer would make a more complete statement of the position of affairs from his stand-point, but all we are told, just as we have been told on every previous occasion, is that there is urgent necessity for supply. We are told by the Treasurer that he has already taken .&#163;175,000 of the ,&#163;2.00,000 Treasurer&#39;s Advance Account; and, of the .&#163;&#163;75,000, has absorbed all but .&#163;3,000. I understand that &#163;31,000 has been appropriated in connexion with the ocean mail service, and &#163;21,000 in connexion with the contingencies in the Post and Telegraph Department. I think we might have fuller information as to what these contingencies consist of. </para>

            <para>- No doubt ; and I can say that the telephone service in my electorate is on anything but a satisfactory basis, and is the ground of innumerable complaints. It seems to me that the telephone service is in a thoroughly disgraceful condition. The business has increased at so rapid a rate that the resources of the Department seem utterly inadequate to cope, not only with prospective expansion, but with actual expansion. The two sums I have mentioned account for ,&#163;52,000 of the &#163;:r 75,000, and this, added to the expenditure on new works in connexion with the Department, amounting to ^37,645, leaves &#163;89,645 accounted for, and .&#163;85,355 unaccounted for. Yet I understand that the Treasurer has only ,&#163;3,000 in hand. </para>

            <para>- The position of affairs in regard to the administration and the business, generally of the Postal Department is in the last degree unsatisfactory in all branches. My intention was particularly directed, while I was in Sydney, to the parcels branch, to which I paid two visits in order to observe the working conditions, which I may say are disgraceful from a hygienic point of view. There is absolutely no ventilation except that provided by the doors,&#39; and the place is overcrowded. The branch is in the basement of the post-office, and the only natural lighting is by means of thick prismatic pavement lights. This basement was origi nally used for military&#39; stables ; but, since the Commonwealth have taken over the Department,&#39; it has been utilized for parcels work. Apart from other considerations, the space available is wholly inadequate. My visits were paid when normal conditions prevailed, and I do not know what the place&#39; must be like under such pressure as occurs, say, at Christmas and Easter. In normal times, in the southern division, I found there were employed three sorters and three assistants in a space of 30 feet by 20 feet, and that, these men had to deal with 150 bags daily. These bags are hung on hooks so close together as to make it almost impossible in a rush of work to distinguish the mouth of one from the mouth of the other; and the sorting has to be done on a table 14 feet by 15 inches wide. It must be apparent that nothing short of a miracle can prevent parcels being accidentally slipped into the wrong bag ; and the fact that so few mistakes are made speaks volumes for the care which is exercised by these men in the performance of their work under such disadvantageous circumstances. </para>

            <para>- And they are overworked. There are 150 bags dealt with every day in the southern division, and there is not hanging room for thirty bags ; there are from 700 to 900 parcels dealt with daily in that division. In the western division 600 to 800 parcels are daily dealt with. They cover about 100 bags, and have to be handled in a space only 20 feet by 12 feet. In this division thirty bags, for which there is no hanging room, have likewise to be dealt with. The bags have to be piled up on the floor and dealt with in the best way possible, and that, I need hardly say, is a very awkward way. In the northern division something like 1,000 parcels, equal to about 200 bags, are dealt with every day, including forty bags for which no hanging space is provided. Most of the parcels have to be sorted on the floor. The men are to be seen on their knees scrambling amongst the parcels, and the utmost confusion prevails. As a matter of fact no order-could be maintained under such conditions. The men have to scramble and work under most unfavorable circumstances, and it is surprising that they carry out their duties so well, and with so little cause for complaint. From 11,000 tq 12,000 parcels are daily dealt with in connexion with the Receiving Department. In wet.  weather the rain works through the pavement into the portion of the building devoted to the reception of these parcels, whilst the drains over-flow, and a worse set of conditions could hardly be imagined. The floor is of cement, and in winter time it must be very bad for the men engaged. I visited the officers supervising this branch of the Department, and found them housed in a room measuring 17 feet by 7 ft.  6  in. There are usually three men in this room, and when the auditors are checking the books there are five men at work, whilst the greater part of the available space is occupied by furniture. This room, like the rest of the basement, is un ventilated. </para>

            <para>- The attention of the health authorities of the State should be called to this part of the building. It is deplorable that men should have to work under such conditions. The manager&#39;s office, which is immediately under the footpath, and for which again no ventilation is provided, is about 10 feet by 10 feet, and at least 40 per cent. of the space is occupied by furniture. A like set of conditions obtains in that part of the building set apart for the Customs officials. They are cramped in their operations, and have to work under almost intolerable conditions. The space set apart for the public is also cramped and inadequate for the transaction of business. A state of confusion prevails where the vans are loaded, and the accommodation is an absolute discredit and disgrace to a Commonwealth Department of such magnitude. It seems impossible that any man should be able to work in the building and long retain his health; and I am informed that it frequently happens that applications for sick leave have to be made. A proper strong room should be provided in lieu of the existingsafes also. Before turning to another subject, I should like to point out that a piece of land, having <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> frontage of 94 feet to Castlereaghstreet, by a depth of 145 feet, has been offered to the Government at a rental of &#163;1,100 per annum, and I understand that the owners are willing to erect upon it a building in accordance with any design which the postal authorities may submit. The Government would do well to consider the advisableness of either accepting this offer or inviting other tenders from those who may be able to meet their re quirements in this regard. If nothing else can be. done, surely the Government might very well lease some of the adjoining premises. They are sure to be required at some time or other, and even if the Department did not need at the outset to utilize the whole of the premises in question, it could for the time being sublet them. </para>

            <para>- We shall have to deal speedily with the matter or the service will break down&#39; altogether. The question of temporary assistance is also worthy of consideration. The practice has been in times of abnormal business pressure to employ a number of temporary hands. The fault of this system is that men apply for temporary positions in the belief that, having obtained a footing in the Department, they will have a preferential claim for consideration when appointments are made to the permanent staff. </para>

            <para>- I know that they are; but those with whom I have come in contact seem generally to believe, notwithstanding, that a temporary appointment will give them a preferential claim to permanent employment. At any rate, from the departmental point of view, the principle is very bad. The constant putting on of temporary hands instead of being of any real service is, at the outset at all events, a great hindrance to the Department. </para>

            <para>- I did not wish to make more than a passing reference to the matter. The worst feature of this system is that just as .the men become familiar with their duties, and are able to render efficient service, they have to make room for others, who have to be drilled again from the commencement in the work of the office. Permanent officers have to be taken from their usual employment to instruct them, and to the extent to which they are so diverted from their regular work the efficiency of the service is impaired. Coming to the question of the Federal Capital, I certainly take exception to the contention advanced by the honorable member for Coolgardie that there is no need for the Federal Parliament to consider the settlement of the matter for the next fifty years. He seems to forget altogether that New South Wales agreed to join the Federation on the strength of a compact to which every State was a party. So far no serious attempt has been made to honour th.at compact.- It seems to me to be dishonorable for the representatives of any of the other States to try to defer indefinitely the settlement of a question which, to the people of New South Wales at all events, is of vital importance. It is all very well for the honorable member to talk of viewing this matter from a national stand-point. As a matter of fact we do. </para>

The fact that the representatives of New South Wales are repeatedly calling attention to the want of a serious attempt to grapple with the question shows that they consider it ought to be finally dealt with at the earliest possible moment. </para>

            <para>- The previous Parliament certainly did deal with the question, but did not finally settle it. It is well known that when honorable members were restricted in their choice to three sites they were forced into the position of being unable to give effect to their wishes. They were compelled, by the way in which the divisions were taken, to choose between two sites, neither of which they .approved. As a result some honorable members were obliged to vote for Dalgety in preference to another site, of which they did not approve, but which they considered was even less eligible. </para>

            <para>- I say that it is. i know the place perfectly well, and I know the depth of water to be obtained there, because I have studied the soundings. On the southern side of Twofold Bay there is a little bit of a harbor called Boyd Harbor, which offers an anchorage for vessels of small tonnage during the prevalence of south-easterly weather. </para>

            <para>- What surprises me most, however, is that while the Minister was inviting expressions of opinion upon the Government scheme from every private in the Defence Force he did not propose that our military officers should be elected by the members of that force. If the latter are competent to express an expert opinion upon the defence policy of the Government they are surely capable of determining who are the most eligible officers. The practice of asking for Supply Bills is one that is in my opinion too much indulged in by this Government. It is demoralizing both to the Government and the Parliament. At the same time I recognise that during the life of the present Parliament the government of the country has been carried on in such a slipshod fashion that the introduction of such measures has been inevitable. </para>

            <para>- According to one military expert this afternoon that is so. But the farce was completed . when the Prime Minister declared that the men were not at liberty to send their suggestions direct to the Minister of Defence, but were required to transmit them through their commanding officers. In all seriousness I ask&#39; whether he thinks that a man would be so foolish as to declare himself adverse to the ideas of his commanding officer when he had to put his suggestions in writing and transmit them through half-a-dozen official channels? If I did not desire to be a marked man I should think as the officer thought to whom reference was made this afternoon, and say nothing. Of course we shall be afforded an opportunity to discuss the defence scheme of the Government at a later stage, but I am of opinion that it requires remodelling. At the same time I am a hearty supporter of it as it was explained by the Prime Minister prior to the adjournment of the House in December last. </para>

            <para>- The Minister of Defence was so much on the defensive that I do not know whether the Military Board - or the Council of Defence was consulted. No doubt the Ministry must take responsibility for the scheme. In my opinion, if the country is good enough to live in, it is good enough to defend. But, as we shall have another opportunity to deal with the scheme, I shall . riot refer to it at greater; length now. The Prime Minister last session told us that the Defence Force had passed through three stages, the G.O.C., the D.O.C., and this, I suppose, is the third stage. I am satisfied that he is on the right t)rack, and I hope that honorable members opposite, together with those on this side of the chamber, will assist the Government to make it effective. Coming to another matter I wish to read the following letter, which I have received from the manager of the <inline font-style="italic">Federal Service Gazette -</inline></para>

        <para>Brisbane, 5th March, 1508. </para>
        <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,</inline></para>
        <para>I am desired to draw your attention to an article entitled &#34; Boards of Inquiry,&#34; appearing on page  12  of the current issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Federal Service,</inline> a copy of which has been posted to you as usual, and to solicit your&#39; assistance with a view to drawing early attention to the injustice done to officers in country districts in consequence of the new Regulation  267A. </para>
        <para>There is every justification for considering the regulation <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> but it would be a- serious hardship for an officer to be forced to commence <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> civil action to obtain redress, and it appears to be a matter which calls for prompt action in Parliament. </para>
        <para>The principle at stake is that two provisions of the Public Service Act have been reversed in their interpretation by means of a regulation, and unless strong action is taken by way of protest there is no guarantee- that the Act will not be further tampered with while Parliament is in recess. </para>
        <para>It is understood that the Acting  Deputy  PostmasterGeneral, Brisbane, has taken strong exception to the publication of this article, on the grounds that the &#34;Federal Service&#34; is conducted by officers of the Department, and -also that certain representations have been made to the Commissioner on the matter with the object of preventing further attention being directed to it through the columns of tlie paper. It is not anticipated that any attempt will be made to suppress the free publication of officers&#39; views in their own journal, but it is desirable that your influence should be sought to draw public attention to  the matter, and with a view to obtaining concerted action on the part of theQueensland members, copies of this letter have been directed to each of them with a view to facilitating early action. </para>
        <para>It is very much regretted that this request is necessary at a time when the House is fully engaged with important business, but the urgency of the case,, and the fact that no other avenue of redress is open has made it necessary to seek the assistance asked for. </para>
        <para>What was complained of was a statement appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Federal Service Gazette</inline> under the heading -  &#34; Boards of Enquiry. Tampering with Justice. Extraordinary actions in Queensland. Divisional representatives debarred from attendance. Public Service Act flouted. Parliament ignored.&#34; </para>
        <para>The report which followed was this - - </para>
        <para>In consequence of certain information received, a representative of the <inline font-style="italic">Federal Service</inline> waited on the Clerical Division representative for Queensland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wm. Thomson),</inline> to make inquiries into the manner in which certain Boards of Inquiry have been conducted recently. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomson,</inline> in response to a question, admitted that four Boards of Inquiry had been appointed in Queensland during the last month, at which he, as Divisional &#34;Representative duly elected under the Public Service Act of 1902, will not be present, and will be prevented from being present by the action of the chief officers of the Departments concerned and the Public Service Inspector. This extraordinary state of affairs naturally prompted inquiries as to whether there were any special reasons for the action taken, and the information was given that although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomson</inline> had protested against this procedure, he had been informed that the Commissioner had decided that the action taken was quite legal, and, therefore, it was not necessary for the representative to be present to hear the cases. </para>
        <para> Sub-section 4 of section 46 of the Public Service Act of 1902 provides that - </para>
        <para>Every such Board shall, after fully hearing the case, report to the chief officer the proceedings and evidence taken, and their opinion thereon. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline>Smith was responsible for that provision, and when moving it in the Senate he said - <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> Vol. VII., page 9720 - </para>
        <para>I propose that the board should go thoroughly into every appeal, and submit the evidence taken by it, together with a recommendation to the Commissioner, who would either adopt the recommendation, or read the evidence carefully and come to a decision himself. By that means celerity would be obtained. Instead of the Commissioner receiving a letter, which, judging by past experience, he would throw into the waste-paper basket or merely file away, he would obtain a recommendation from a properly constituted Board, together with the evidence, taken by it, and he would thus be in a position to decide every case. I think that such a Board would be an improvement upon appeal direct to the Commissioner, because it would enable an aggrieved officer to have his case heard locally. </para>
        <para>The regulation objected to is 267a. I am always suspicious of anything numbered a or b, because I regard it as an afterthought, often containing something not obvious to the ordinary reader. It is as follows - </para>
        <para>When a charge against an officer has been referred to a Board of Inquiry, and the officer is stationed in a- locality far removed from the capital of the State, or would be subjected to considerable expense in travelling to appear before the Board of Inquiry, the Chief Officer, with the approval of a Public Service Inspector, may appoint a competent person or persons to take evidence on oath, at the place where the  offence is alleged to have been committed, concerning the inquiry, and such evidence shall be forwarded for the consideration of the Board of Inquiry, who, after considering such evidence, shall report to the Chief Officer the proceedings and evidence taken, and their opinion thereon. </para>
        <para>How can it be said that the Board has heard and taken evidence when that evidence has been taken by some one else at a place 200 or 300 milesaway? Recently at Bowen the Police Magistrate took evidence, and sent it down to the Board at Brisbane. As men of the world, we know that one can judge better whether a witness is telling the truth if he has an opportunity to question him and observe his demeanour, than if there is merely a statement of his evidence to read. The Act should be carried out in its entirety. If the Department chooses to throw away its privileges let it do so, but the representative elected by the Service should be present to hear the evidence taken. . </para>

        <para class="block">How, in the face of this,can the Commissioner provide that the evidence shall be taken by one man and forwarded to another? If public servants may be deprived of their rights by regulation the sooner the law is altered the better. In other States public servants have protested against such proceedings, and yet they are now being carried on in Queensland. I should like to know what the Government intend to do in regard to this matter. The expenditure of a few pounds would secure the presence of &#34;a representative. </para>

            <para>- Then the Government are to blame. I saw recently a copy of a letter sent to the Public Service Association in Brisbane, in which the Postmaster-General, who has been advising postal employes in Victoria to form unions so that they may make their voices heard, stated that he did not recognise a union any more than he did an individual. That being so, why does he tender to postal employes in this State the advice to which I have referred? If the Government are responsible for the regulation I have named, the sooner they amend it the better. </para>

          <para>.- Although the discussion has been somewhat protracted, the ventilation of grievances which has taken place will result in a saving of time when the Estimates in chief are reached. I do not think that it would be advisable to discuss the Government scheme of defence until the Bill relating to it is actually before the House. It may be a much better scheme than the preliminary sketch of it. that has been presented to us suggests, but I should like to express the hope that the Government will push on with the question of defence. I hope that it will not allow the Bill to find its way to the bottom of the notice-paper, to be rushed through at the end of the session-. I trust that the Government will give the House an early and adequate opportunity to deal with it in a comprehensive and liberal manner. Unless that be. done, the uncertainty and unrest which exist in the Naval and Military Forces will become accentuated and almost unbearable. The doubt which has hitherto been prevailing amongst the naval and military organizations of the Commonwealth has, to some extent, resulted in the unsatisfactory state of affairs described by the Prime Minister. I hope, therefore, that every effort will be made to push on with the Bill without delay. I recently saw in the press a statement that, pending the consideration of the new scheme by Parliament, an order had been issued by the Minister preventing further recruiting to the ranks of the militia. </para>

            <para>- I am glad to hear it. The statement appeared in several papers. It was announced with the utmost circumstantiality, and prevented a number of young men in my own electorate, who desired to join the militia, from doing so. If such a proposal were contemplated, it is a great mistake, and&#39; I hope that the Minister will&#39; not be a party to anything of the kind. Another complaint I have to make is that rifle club&#39;s have been refused registration and the granting of facilities pending the consideration of the new defence scheme. </para>

It would be disastrous if, pending its consideration, anything were done to prevent the formation, equipment, and encouragement of rifle clubs, or to prevent men from joining the militia. </para>

Defence Forces, both, naval and military, and of efforts to induce men to join the ranks. I take the opportunity of saying that I entirely concur with the observations made by the leader of the Opposition in reference to the underpaying and sweating of some of the hands in the Postal Department. I had made some notes on the subject before the right honorable member spoke, and will certainly join with him and the Postmaster-General in appealing to the Treasurer and the House to take action for the removal of those grievances. The leader of the Opposition brought under notice cases in which certain men had been underpaid. </para>

Letter-carriers in the next grade receive from ,&#163;114 to .&#163;126 per annum.

I know that this is a fact, because in. response to an appeal for the appointment of additional letter-carriers to relieve, the pressure of. the staff at Bendigo, the Department, after a long-continued agitation -on my part, decided to appoint an assistant letter-carrier at the magnificent salary of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;60</inline> per annum. </para>

        <para>In justice to the Postmaster-General, I may  say that these low salaries are fixed by the Public Service Commissioner under the powers conferred upon him by the Public Service Act. At the same time the GovernorGeneral in Council has ratified these regulations, and to that extent the Government are. responsible for them. In deciding the amount to be granted for the maintenance of a country post-office, I maintain that provision should be made for the lette,carrier receiving a living wage. If the person in charge of a country o&#39;ffice cannot afford to give more than 16s. per week to a letter-carrier, it is conclusive proof that the allowance received from the Government is not sufficiently substantial. I ask those who believe in the payment of a fair day&#39;s wage for a fair day&#39;s work to join with me in urging that these grievances shall be remedied. </para>

The honorable member for Coolgardie illustrated how the Department has lost money by erecting an expensive telephone wire from Melbourne to Sydney. That line is barely paying working expenses, altogether apart from interest. </para>

            <para>- I cannot say. It may be that it is largely used as a Government telephone - as a means of communication between Ministers in Melbourne and Ministers in Sydney. I doubt whether it is such a great public convenience as it was anticipated it would prove. Certainly its construction was not justified at the expense of poorly paid letter-carriers and at the sacrifice of postal facilities in rural areas. </para>

            <para>- I do not intend to discuss that matter at the present juncture. I hope that the Treasurer will agree to grant the Postmaster-General financial assistance for the extension of postal facilities wherever they may reasonably be required. I understand that the PostmasterGeneral is favorably impressed with the need for extending telephone communication into rural districts, and I most heartily approve of that policy. In America, the extension of the telephone into rural areas has done a great deal towards reconciling people to country life, and has tended to improve their condition. </para>

I do not know who is responsible, but in connexion with the last renewal of mail services hundreds of small services were discontinued which had been carried on by the States foryears. They may have appeared unimportant to the Secretary to the Department; but country people get very few of the advantages of government, and the least we can do is to extend their postal facilities. </para>

        <para class="block">Australian Parliament, whose letter I intend to read. There was formerly a mail twice a week, and on tenders being- called for the service an offer of ,&#163;70 was received. According to the Department the revenue is only .&#163;58 16s. 7d. per annum, showing a loss of .2, I- 3s. 5&#39;d., because of which the service was abandoned. The ^Postmaster-General goes through the country promising improved telephonic, telegraphic, and postal facilities ; but he ought to know that the departmental regulation requiring a guarantee of 10 per cent, on the cost of construction &#39;kills many a proposition at the start. I know of cases in which the departmental estimate of revenue was equivalent to 5 per cent, on the actual cost of the work, plus expenses of attendance. Yet a guarantee based on 10 per cent, of the cost of construction has been demanded. Such a demand is extortionate, the Commonwealth does not borrow money, but if it did it would not pay move than 5 per cent, for it. Even in districts where the life of a telegraph pole is only twelve or thirteen years, the Department, making a charge of 5 per cent., would get back its outlay in addition to the revenue from the line. I do not wonder that Federation is held in contempt in country districts when they see every facility being granted to a town, and centralization governing everything. No guarantee was asked for in connexion with the Melbourne-Sydney telephone ; but &#34;no country connexion will be considered without one. The letter which I received from the members of the South Australian Parliament is .as follows - </para>

            <para>- It has only, been done very recently, if at all. Every extension must necessarily contribute a certain amount of additional revenue to the existing system, and it is fair that that should be taken into consideration in relation to the extension of any telephonic service.  1  also have a complaint to make in connexion with the Electoral Department. If ever I felt ashamed of this Commonwealth and its administration, I did during the last few months, when I visited a town in my electorate called Petersburg. There is, in the main street of that town, a substantial town-hall ( and public institute - a very respectable building, erected by the people themselves. A few yards from it, in the same street, there is a post-office - quite a decent little stone structure. But the Electoral Department required some place which the Chief Electoral Officer of the District of Grey could use as an office. A doctor at Petersburg invited me to go and look at this building which the Commonwealth&#39; had put up. To my amazement I found that they had erected, between two substantial buildings, a plain little galvanized iron structure, 12 feet bv 14 feet. This they called a Commonwealth office. The window in it was about 2 feet square. In this little place our electoral officer is supposed to do the great amount of work that falls upon him in connexion with the district of Grey. </para>

            <para>- No. Petersburg is considerably north of Adelaide. This galvanized iron place is the laughing-stock of the town, and I felt positively ashamed of the Commonwealth having put up such a place in the main street between two decent buildings. I do not know who is responsible for it, but if I remain a member of this House that building will have to be removed. It is a disgrace to all concerned. </para>

            <para>- I do not know, but I should think that the Department could have added a little to the post-office, especially in view of the fact that the whole tendency is to make our postmasters act as electoral officers. The present post-office building is not big enough to afford any accommodation to another Department, because there is now a telephonic exchange in it, but arrangements could easily have been made for an addition to the building for the purposes of the Chief Electoral Officer. </para>

            <para>- I also desire to  mention  another matter. It relates to a mistake which, in my opinion, has been made in connexion with a new mail contract. I refer to the Spencer Gulf mail service accommodating Franklin Harbor. Hitherto, there has been a service from Wallaroo to Franklin Harbor, which insured to the people the advantage of a regular boat service. The Adelaide Steamship Company always complained of having to go to Franklin Harbor. For some unknown reason, the postal authorities called for alternative tenders - one for the delivery of mails at Arno Bay twice a week, to serve the Franklin Harbor district, and the other for delivery at Arno Bay, and once at Franklin Harbor, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Wallaroo. This suited the company, because they had a monopoly, and knew no one else would tender. Consequently only the tender for the Arno Bay service  was  put in. The service from FranklinHarbor to Wallaroo direct - a four hours&#39; run across the gulf - has been cut off. At least a thousand settlers around Franklin Harbor are put to great inconvenience,&#39; and the only party advantaged is the steamship com  pany.  1 did not hear of the arrangement until the tender had been accepted, but I made a protest against it. The Department called for fresh tenders from Wallaroo to Franklin Harbor, and I understand the company then put in a tender of &#163;500 fora weekly service. The Department considered the price too high. I suggested recently to the Deputy PostmasterGeneral of South  Australia  that the company should be asked to put in a lower tender for the work. The Department may argue that they must regard the matter only from the postal stand-point, but  they  should take into consideration another important aspect. The steamer was supposed to run to Franklin Harbor once a  week, but  it no longer carried  the  mails: there, and so it was liable to be taken off the trip at any time. In the week I was there it was taken off. People from Franklin Harbor have now noregular means of crossing; the gulf. I believe there is no doctor on their side, and it is necessary to go across to Wallaroo for medical attendance. When I was there five ladies drove in over 30 miles, expecting to cross as usual from Franklin Harbor by boat, as people had done for twenty years. They found that no boat was running, as there was no longer a mail contract. They had then to drive 36 miles over rough roads on a wet night to Arno Bay, and be taken off at the end of a jetty which the vessel cannot come within a quarter of a mile of. They had to go down an iron ladder with a high sea running, be rowed over to the ship, and get on board as best they could. I felt extremely sorry to see the conditions brought about by that change in the mail service. While it is no part of the duty of the Postal Department to provide the people of the district with boat facilities, it should take into consideration the results of its action. I believe the previous service was cheaper. Arno Bay is no place at which to land women, even in the best of health. The Minister should endeavour to re-establish the twenty-year-old service from Wallaroo, and induce the shipping company to reduce their price for the contract to a reasonable sum. The present &#39; state of things is a serious grievance to the district. &#39; If no option had been given in tendering, the company would have tendered for the Wallaroo and Arno Bay service combined. I do not know who is responsible for the Department&#39;s action, but I know that the steamship company had been trying to get out of the responsibility for the previous service for a long time. The Department has now played into their hands, and put the settlers to great inconvenience. </para>

          <para>- It is most extraordinary that after an election has taken place, and an honorable senator has been returned to the other branch of the Legislature by a majority of 7,000 votes, he and the people he represents should be kept out of their parliamentary rights under the extraordinary circumstance that two or three votes polled at some remote part of South Australia will take several weeks to come to hand. We are told that in consequence of the absence of those votes it is impossible to make a return to the writ issued for the South Aus tralian Senate election, to enable the people of the State to be represented in the Federal Parliament. This is a matter of serious consequence, because if our laws are in that state they are a disgrace to us. However, I find, from any reference that I have been able to make to them, that there is absolutely no reason for the delay that has taken place in connexion with the return of this writ. </para>

        <para>The divisional officers in this case have forwarded to the Commonwealth officer for the State copies of the writ indorsed with the number of votes, which show that of the two candidates one has been elected by a majority of 7,000 votes, and the Commonwealth officer for the State is aware that a copy of the writ indorsed with two votes is travelling across the Continent. In the circumstances, unless there is some legal obstacle to his returning the writ with a declaration of the return of the successful candidate, such an intolerable state of things as is involved in this delay should not be permitted to exist, because according to that view of the law if some one intercepted the person taking the writ indorsed with the two votes to the post for transmission and stole it out of his pocket there could be no return at all. I am happy to say that the law does not lend itself to any such ridiculous position. </para>

            <para>- I am very glad to hear it. That was a common-sense procedure on his part. The position of the Electoral Officer  for the State is set out in section 161 of the Act to which I have referred. It provides that when the copies of the writ are sent back by the divisional officers with the numbers of Votes polled for each candidate indorsed on them it is his duty to ascertainthe total number of votes polled by each candidate, and in the event of an equality of votes he is given a casting vote for the purpose of deciding the election. All that the Commonwealth Electoral Officer has to do is to ascertain which candidate has been returned by a majority of votes. No duty is cast upon him to wait until he can tot up all the returns sent in by the divisional officers. Honorable members will bear in mind that I am dealing only with this particular case. There might in other cases be an element of uncertainty which would render it grossly improper for the electoral officer not to hesitate as to the action he should take. I am dealing with a case where a majority of 7,000 votes has been recorded for one candidate, and two votes are in transit. </para>

            <para>- But he might ascertain the totalnumber by telegraph. The law does not say that he shall not do so in that way. If he has 7,000 votes returned with copies of. the writ, he can ascertain the other two by telegraph. It would be an astonishing effect of the law to suppose that when the Commonwealth electoral officer for a State gets returns of copies of the writ, showing 7,000 majority for one candidate, whilst two votes have not yet come in, although he knows they are on the road, he cannot declare that the man with a majority of 7,000 has been returned. The moment he is absolutely satisfied,, as in this case he must be, for if the two votes were counted in a particular way they would only make the majority 6,998 instead of 7,000, the law does not impose any obstacle to his returning the writ. We passed a special Act to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1902, which sets out the form of the writ. It does not call upon the electoral officer to return the number of . votes polled, but calls upon him to certify-omitting refer ences to the nomination and other preliminaries - </para>

If the electoral officer for the State did return the writ with the name who could complain?How could the two electors whose votes have not been returned have any standing to complain that their votes were not counted against the 7,000? There is always a remedy in the High Court if an improper return has -been made, but when a man has received a majority of 6,998 votes, how could two persons for any conceivable reason in the world, appeal against the return? The Court of Disputed Returns was expressly made a Court of good conscience, without regard to legal forms and technicalities. Who could appear before that Court with a. petition that the person whose name was inserted in the writ should&#39; be declared unlawfully elected because some two votes had not been totted&#39; up against 7,000? I await some explanation of the matter - because if the delay complained of is due to any action taken by the Government, that action was nodoubt considered - but I say most solemnly that in my view there has been too much of mistake in this matter all through. It is no reflection upon the learned AttorneyGeneral to say that he has made a serious mistake, because even more distinguished  lawyers have been found to make mistakes. But it is an unfortunate thing that the law officers of the Federal Government should have made a. mistake which has kept a man out of his seat for all this time. </para>

            <para>- I know that a very eminent counsel, who is not connected with the Government in any way, made the same mistake, and I say that it is most unfortunate that such a mistake .was made. This mistake having been made, and a man having been elected by a majority of 7,000 in a great State, it is a monstrous shame and disgrace to the Commonwealth that he is not in his place in the Senate. Unfortunately, in the present state of things, one vote in that Chamber would mean all the difference in the world in regard to certain decisions. Surely honorable members who attach vital importance to the will of the people being expressed in the Parliament cannot sit idly by while the voice of a great State is strangled on a miserable technicality which does not exist in the law at all ! There would be some excuse if the law were in such a monstrous condition that a miserable technicality could prevent the voice of the people of a State from being heard. The Attorney-General may be able. to point out some difficulties which &#91; have overlooked, - but I cannot find any. I can find no necessity for more than the indorsement of the writ with the name of the successful candidate. Any other information would be foreign to the writ and to the law which settled its terms, and left  only that blank, with the previous blanks in regard to nomination, and so on. I do not know how long this disfranchisement of these thousands of electors is to continue. Suppose that the two votes do not arrive for the next six weeks or two months. Is South Australia to continue to be unrepresented because the right&#39; man has not been returned? Is everything to depend upon the two wretched pieces of paper which are travelling &#34;somewhere over the great interior of Australia? Is there no power in the Federal Government to seek the man in possession of them? Is there any provision in the Act which prevents the electoral officer from doing what should be done? If the Government have not interfered, I have nothing to say. But if the electoral officer asked for advice, and especially if he was willing to do his duty, and was stopped by any official interference or advice,, the matter assumes a most serious aspect. If he has sat idle in his office, I think that he has grossly neglected his duty. If, however, he has been willing and ready to return the writ, and his action in returning it has been delayed by some authority- </para>

            <para>- If he was prepared .to return the writ, and was stopped by the Federal authorities, a gross wrong and an abuse of the law and the_ rights of the people has been effected by the Government. The law does. not say that the returning officer shall not do his duty and fill in the writ when the man whose name ought to be there has been honestly returned beyond the shadow of a doubt. The law does not paralyze the hands of the Government, and if they have paralyzed the hands of the electoral officer, they have assumed a very extraordinary responsibility. I shall be glad to know what provision there is in the law which prevents that officer from filling in the name because of the absence of two solitary figures when there is a majority of 7,000. I think that the Government will, admit, that there has not been any great attempt to embarrass or reproach them in any way in connexion with this matter, but it has gone to a stage at which it cannot be allowed to remain without a strenuous protest. . The voice of South Australia is being stifled day after day. Does the law stifle &#39; its voice ? Is it the Government who are stifling it, by preventing the returning officer from doing what he is desirous of doing- the right thing which the law does not prevent him from doing? What power is this that is above the law. that can enter the office of the Electoral Department and stop a man from taking his seat in the Senate at a time when vital issues are concerned? We see that night after night the determination of important questions has been dependent upon one vote. Why should that one vote of South Australia be strangled? Is it&#39; because it might go in a certain direction? If it were likely to go in the other way, would the man be kept out? Would these cobwebs be spun in order to prevent the force of public opinion from being registered in the Senate? I shall be very glad indeed if the Government can point to a word in the Electoral law which can, with any show of reason, or justice, or decency, prevent the filling in of the writ with the name of Joseph Vardon. </para>

            <para>- The right honorable gentleman was kind enough to give me notice of his intention, and I made inquiries of the Department To ascertain exactly what the facts were. There was no motive in the mind of the Government to keep any constituency out of its representation. The election took place, and the votes of two absent voters were outstanding at a certain polling place. The law provides that a person, no matter where he may be, is entitled to record his vote&#39;. If he is out of his electoral division he may record his vote at, say, Alice Springs. At this election two electors who belonged to the Adelaide division were out of their area, and recorded their vote in Grey division under the provisions for absent voters. Under the regulations, an absolute duty is cast upon the officer. </para>

            <para>- These were the regulations under which the election was conducted, and these two votes were given under them. They require that every absent voter &#39;s ballot-paper containing a vote shall be sent to the returning officer. A duty is cast upon the divisional returning officer to examine  every absent voter&#39;s ballot-paper received by him pursuant to the regulations. He has to take these votes and count them. By section  160  an absolute duty is cast upon him not to close his scrutiny until he . has received all the votes. The general provisions are contained in section  155.  Section  154  says that the result of the poll shall be ascertained by scrutiny. In order to get the result of the poll the returning officer has to count every vote. </para>

            <para>- The Divisional Returning Officer has to certify by indorsement the number of votes given for each candidate, and, before he can certify on his copy of the writ he has to take into consideration every single vote outstanding, including those of absent voters ; he cannot give the certificate by law until all these votes have been counted. Under section  161,  the Commonwealth Electoral Officer must, from copies of the writ forwarded to him by the Divisional Returning Officers, ascertain the number of the votes; and he cannot do so until he gets the copies of the writ from the Divisional Returning Officers. The Act requires each Divisional Returning Officer, first, to count all the votes before he can send any information to the Commonwealth Electoral Officer. This may be a legal technicality ; but it is a duty cast on the officer-; and every elector has the right to have his vote recorded. The vote of a man at Alice Springs is just as important as the vote of a man in the city ; and I am only now dealing with a pure question&#39; of law. In &#34;this instance, the Divisional Returning Officer asked whether he could, seeing that he had not received certain votes, give his certificate, and he was told that he could not do so until all the votes had been received. The next proposition by the honorable member for East Sydney is that we could take advantage of section  167. </para>

            <para>- At any rate, it is suggested that advantage should be taken of that section. But the right honorable member misconceives the object of the section. The Act provides for any delay which may arise, and &#34; delay &#34; must be interpreted to mean something arising from accident or unforeseen circumstances. But the circumstances in this case were of an ordinary character ; that is, the votes would, in the ordinary time of transmission, reach the officer on a certain date. I may say that in Queensland I have had to wait five weeks before I could Be declared elected, owing to a vote required from a distant place. </para>

            <para>- It may be that the votes took a long time in coming, but that is not &#34; delay &#34; under the Act. The proclamations issued in this connexion contemplate some unforeseen contingencies, which are the only grounds under which the GovernorGeneral in Council may suspend the Act.  It so happens, however, that only to-night we have received a telegram informing us that probably what amounts to legal delay has arisen, and that these votes may be kept back by reason of floods - in other words, &#34; the act of God.&#34; In anticipation, a rough draft of the necessary proclamation has been prepared, and will be put into operation declaring the election valid. </para>

          <para>.- I do not at all rely on the section referred .to by the Attorney-General. What I say is that the writ which is sent to the State Electoral Officer requires only the insertion of the name of the person who has been elected. The Attorney-General is perfectly right about the duties of the divisional or subordinate officer. On that officer the Act is mandatory, and he cannot send in his copy of the writ until he has counted all the votes. That,&#39; however, does not&#39; touch the question which relates to the position of the State Electoral Officer in reference to the return of the writ. The law does not put on this latter officer the duty of waiting until the. report of every Divisional Returning Officer is indorsed on the &#34;writ. Under section 161 the moment the State Electoral Officer has the figures before him&#34; returned on copies of writs, which show, say, a majority of  7,000,  while only 2,000 or  3,000  votes have yet to be received, he may be satisfied that there must be, at any rate, a majority of 4,000 or 5,000; and there is nothing to prevent him from at once filling in the name of the successful candidate, and returning him as duly elected. The officer need not be satisfied that a candidate has been elected by so many or so few. Now, however, that this incident is of the past, I may be allowed to project -my remarks into the future. I am glad that the flood has arrived, and that on its generous bosom Joseph Vardon will at last come to his rights. If the man who carried these papers had been swept down a river, according to the Attorney-General we should have had to wait an eternity for the return of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon.</inline> Putting aside this matter altogether, I beg of those who are responsible for the administration of the Department not to erect cobweb difficulties in the way of the return of a representative when the fact of his due return has been made certain. </para>

          <para>. - I agree with the right honorable member for East Sydney that there has been a great deal of bungling in connexion with the recent election to fill the vacancy in the representation of South Australia iri the Senate. I should have been glad had the right honorable member, in dealingwith the trouble which took place in the first instance, displayed the same warmth as he has exhibited to-night. When the matter first went before the Court on appeal, it was stated that a good many ballotpapers had been inadvertently burned. We have since learned that they were not. and I have ground for suspecting that if they were examined some remarkable disclosures would be made. </para>

            <para>- Exactly. While I am satisfied that the learned Judge who dealt with the case in the first instance did all that could be done in the circumstances, believing that some of the ballotpapers had been destroyed, I feel that a scrutiny should be made of the papers which have since come to light. I asked the Attorney-General privately whether they could not be examined by an official, and I think his reply was that nothing could be done in the absence of an order  by the Court. It seems remarkable that it should be possible for any kind of fraud in respect of an election to go unchecked. I am told that if these ballot-papers had been examined, it would have been found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosbie</inline> was elected by a substantial majority, and that the whole trouble would thus have been avoided. A strict investigation should be made, and in the. interests of future elections the missing papers which have come to light ought, if possible, to be examined. I certainly sympathize with those who have stated to-night that the postal facilities are not what they  ought to he. There can be no excuse for the present state of affairs, seeing that we have the necessary funds to provide all that is wanted. We have returned to the States over ;&#163;6, 000,000 that the Commonwealth could have expended had it desired to do so. We ought not to hand back to the States  moneys  that are required for Commonwealth purposes. The States authorities themselves are complaining of the inadequacy of the postal facilities&#93;, and yet we are returning to the States surplus revenue which might well be expended bv the Commonwealth. </para>

In many districts, telegraph messengers have been abolished, on the ground that the business done at the offices at which they are stationed would not warrant their retention.

        <para>The Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. D. C. McLachlan)</inline> has given his ruling as to the claims of unions to take action with reference to employes&#39; grievances. A deputation from the Telegraph and Telephone Construction Branch Union in one of - the States recently desired to be heard. As the secretary of the union, who has ceased to be connected with the Department, was to form one of the deputation, the permanent head raised an objection and consulted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLachlan.</inline> The Commissioner, in his reply, agreed with the permanent head, and said that any representations affecting Departmental administration should be_ made by the officers themselves without the intervention of any person not connected with the service. </para>
        <para>Does the Postmaster-General agree with that decision? Is the Commissioner to take up the position of an autocrat and say who shall and who shall not be the officers of the union connected with the service? Such a state of affairs ought not to be tolerated. It would be just as reasonable for the members of the service associations to say under what heads of departments they will work. They have the right to form their own unions and to select their own officers. I am familiar with the opinions held by the Postmaster- General regarding the formation of unions, and I bring this matter forward because it is not the first case of the kind that has occurred. We had a similar experience in connexion with the Adelaide Tramways Trust. The House should take care that Commonwealth employes are not deprived of the full rights of citizenship. If the PostmasterGeneral intends to support the action taken by a head of the Department in this case it will be necessary for some honorable member to move that in the opinion of the House the officers of the Commonwealth should be treated as ordinary citizens. It is a matter of accident ihat a man enters the public service instead of obtaining private employment, and he should have as much right to exercise the privileges of citizenship as he has when employed&#39; outside the service. </para>

            <para>- I have never known public servants to abuse the power which has been granted to them. Why should not a public servant air his grievances outside the service? Surely it is better that he should do so than that those grievances should rankle inside the service and make it seethe with discontent. I am sorry that the Commonwealth should seek to curtail the privileges of State servants in any way. It was the right honorable member for Adelaide who many years ago conferred this right upon the civil servants of South Australia, and experience has shown that it has never been abused. I shall not occupy the time of the Committee any further, because I shall be afforded an opportunity upon another occasion of dealing with the administration of the Customs Department. </para>

When he made that statement I was not aware that there was a gentleman within the precincts of the House who knows a great deal about this incident. As a matter of fact, a count of the ballot papers for the Division of Angas was made prior to their destruction, and they showed a majority of about three to two in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon.</inline></para>

          <para>. - I wish to urge upon the Government the necessity for taking action during the current session in regard to the final selection of the Federal Capital. I do not agree with the  suggestion thrown out by the right honorable member for East Sydney that the sense of the House should be again taken upon the selection of Dalgety, because, if we decided against that site, our action would preclude it from being again brought forward. That&#39;, I contend, would not be advisable, seeing that Dalgety might be the second choice of a number of honorable members. It would be my second choice, and therefore I do not wish it to be&#39; excluded, though at the same time I wish for a chance to exercise my first choice. I mention the matter now, for the question is a burning one, . and I intend to keep pegging away in connexion with it, because I do not wish to incur the opprobrium which has been cast upon New South Wales representatives for not having brought about its settlement. . The change in the <inline font-style="italic">personnel of</inline> the New South Wales representation has been largely due to the annoyance of the public because of that. </para>

          <para>.- I speak with considerable diffidence at this late hour, as I am practically a new member in new surroundings. What I have read about the. Federal Parliament does not make me inclined to presuppose that it would be anxious to grant two months&#39; Supplyto a Government which had not announced what it intended to do during that period. The Capital Site question has just been declared one of urgent public importance, demanding settlement at the earliest moment, but we have no expression of the Government policy in regard to it. I have risen to point out to the honorable member for Macquarie that perhaps a fitter way of safeguarding the rights of electors who strongly object to further delay in the settlement of the Federal Capital question would be,&#39; before voting two months&#39; Supply, to get from the Government a definite assurance as to when they propose to deal with the matter. </para>

But surely he should be satisfied with one investigation of the site?  1  appeal to him not to throw the slightest obstacle in the way of the early settlement of the Captial Site question. Instead of making insinuations against others, he should do what he can to give an opportunity for the matter to be dealt with before we get to the serious business of the session. Now is the time to deal with it. When the Tariff is returned from the Senate, there will be.no opportunity. Yet the honorable member proposes to while away some weeks in further investigations. </para>

            <para>- I should like the Government to say why we need wait for the honorable member for Gwydir? But, apparently, he has only to beckon with his little finger and the Treasurer follows him. The Government ought seriously to make up their minds as to the settlement of this question. The matter ought not to be delayed any longer. </para>

          <para>.- I have no objection at all to the suspension of so much of the Standing Orders as is necessary ; but I am rather alarmed about the wording of the motion. It would be much better to say &#34;so much of the Standing Orders as will enable,&#34; and so on. I do not like to be a party to the suspension of the Standing Orders as a whole, because it might lead to trouble. </para>
