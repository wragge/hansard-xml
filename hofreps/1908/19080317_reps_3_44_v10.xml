It is a serious thing for the whole of Queensland to be cut off from communication with the southern States for two days, and the Government ought certainly to take some steps to ascertain the state of affairs which exists in that portion of Australia. Will the Postmaster- General do his test to arrange for a reasonably cheap service to and from Queensland through New Zealand ? </para>

If so, will he invite the British Government to have special naval representation on the occasion of the visit, so that the ceremonies may partake of something in the nature of a British-American naval demonstration in Australian waters? </para>

I ask the honorable member not to press the question, because I cannot make any further disclosure at this stage. I may say that the Crown issued certain informations, and the defences to them were demurred to on grounds of law. Negotiations have been going on in regard to the pleadings, and certain settlements have been arrived at, details of which I have not yet received from the Crown Solicitor. The judgment in the case will have to go to a single Judge, and be entered up in Court. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to know whether the Minister of Defence noticed in the press of yesterday some serious statements made by Captain Rushall, commanding officer of the Melbourne Cavalry, in reference to his retirement from the Forces. The statement is in reference to the Mounted Cadets, and is as follows :  - </para>

                        <para>- I did see the statement referred to, and the case originated in this way. It is laid down by the regulations that an officer shall hold only one position in connexion with the Defence Forces. For instance, a man may not be an officer in the Artillery and in the Light Horse at the same time; and so he cannot be an officer of cadets, and also an officer of Light Horse. </para>

                            <para>- In view of the answer just given I desire to know whether the Minister of Defence will take into consideration the advisability of amending the regulation which provides that an officer, holding a commission is compelled to resign that commission so soon as he takes up an appointment in connexion with the cadets. For instance, a school teacher may be a valuable officer, but the moment he takes charge of the cadets, as he must do in connexion with the schools, he is compelled to resign his position in the volunteers or the militia. I trust the Minister will see the advisability of giving greater range, so that officers, under such circumstances as I have indicated, may be allowed to continue to give their services in both capacities? </para>

                            <para>- Under such circumstances as those described an officer is seconded for the time being - it is not a question of absolute severance. My personal opinion is, with regard to the cadets, that it would be wise to permit militia officers, who are prepared to give their time, to accept appointments. That is my personal opinion, but beyond that I do not think the honorable member will ask me to go at present. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has furnished me with a report from the Commonwealth Meteorologist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> A. Hunt, and as it is a somewhat lengthy paper, I propose to lay it on the table. For the immediate information of the honorable member, however, I may say that the report, amongst other particulars, states that out of a total of sixty-two forecasts, thirty-two were correct, eighteen were partially correct, and twelve were failures. The report adds that had the forecasts been issued from Adelaide, the probabilities are that they would have been still more unsatisfactory than has been the case, for in framing the forecasts in the Central Bureau, the Commonwealth Meteorologist has. the advice not only of the best South Australian expert, but also the combined opinions of the central staff of experienced meteorologists. </para>

                    <para>- All questions relating to the current session are necessarily ambiguous, on account of the uncertainty which, exists concerning its duration. If the session be a short one, I doubt whether it will be possible, during its continuance,. to introduce the Bill to which the honorable member has referred. If, however, it should be prolonged, the measure in question will most certainly be brought forward. </para>

In the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of Saturday last the statement appeared that the Parliamentary Medical Committee appointed to deal with the report had declared that the Government were holding back the circulation pf the document in question, and that it would be necessary to introduce a Bill to protect the Royal Commissioner, as the contents of the report are not covered by parliamentary privilege. I desire to know what is the attitude of the Government in regard to the report in question, and whether it is necessary that a protecting Bill should be introduced to cover the matter of privilege? </para>

It should not be possible for the public to think for a moment that this or any Government would be allowed by Parliament to do such a thing as that. Ever since the right honorable member for Adelaide ceased to administer the Customs Department, the comment has been common that justice is not being done to the revenue, as it was in his time, by the punishing of persons defrauding the Customs. </para>

                            <para>- It is a very serious charge; but I, and many others, have been led to think that there is ground for the common statement that the Customs Department does not appear to be entirely free from taint. Since the resignation by the right honorable member for Adelaide of the portfolio of Minister of Trade and Customs, case after case has been reported in the newspapers, but the names of those committing offences have been kept back. This leads to the suspicion that there is something of the backstairs method in the present settlement of disputes, which should not be tolerated. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely stating my suspicions. I have good grounds for believing that in this case an enormous sum is involved. The firm concerned is one of the wealthiest in the Commonwealth, and it must not be thought that this House will allow the treatment meted out to a strong firm to be different from that meted out to the smallest offender against the Customs Act. </para>

                            <para>- No; it can be known only by allowing the case to go into Court. I have very strong grounds for suspicion, and they will not be allayed unless the Court deals with the case. We took Robert Reid and Company to Court to prove what that firm had done, and this firm should be similarly treated. </para>

                            <para>- I am certain that he would have taken this case to Court. In certain circles it is commonly reported that the firm in question has been guilty of representing imported goods to be of less than their true value, as if, for instance, it had imported silverware, and entered it as electroplate. If that, or anything like it, has been done, a criminal offence has been committed. The sum involved is. I am sure, a very large one, and in a big case like this, there ought to be no private settlement. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It is complained that in Adelaide, at present, there is no audit staff, such as there is in all the other States. Only one audit officer is employed there. I believe that complications have prevented the staff being placed on the footing that prevails in other States, but I do not want honorable members to imagine that, although there is only one Commonwealth audit officer in Adelaide, the accounts of the Customs Department are not being audited. I cannot say how long these alleged fraud&#39;s have been going on. </para>

                            <para>- Or settled privately in the office of the Minister. I hope that no big case will be privately settled ; all should be treated alike. Under the old system, a reputable firm could be brought before the police court for a mere error of judgment, but nowadays the practice is for the Minister to deal privately with such matters. All cases should be dealt with in open court, so that the public may know the real facts. I should prefer to deal with a man who had never defrauded the Customs Department rather than to patronize a man who had been convicted of doing so. There is; however, a far more important principle involved. When it was alleged that Charles Tucker had defrauded the Department of Trade and Customs of about  &#163;30,000,  the people were astounded. Yet we find from the report of the Auditor-General that the administration is still as lax as ever. Many of the officers who were administering the Department when the Tucker frauds took place still retain their positions, and no change has been made in respect of the office of Collector. The Auditor-General shows that, instead of the Department having been defrauded of &#163;30,000, it has in that way lost at least &#163;60,000, to say nothing of what has happened during ten years in respect of which no record can be obtained. This firm ought to be brought before the Court in order that we may discover whether or not it has been doing what Tucker did. I sincerely hope that it has not, but I believe that either frauds or offences covering very large sums have been entered into by the firm. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister, if he chose to speak, could show that there is something more than mere rumour involved. This is one of the most serious matters that the Court could deal with, because it involves the reputation of one of the largest companies in Australia. I certainly have no desire to injure any firm, but, on the other hand, I do not wish the revenue, and, consequently, the taxpayers to be injured. There are some men who think that they have a perfect right to get at the Government if they can do so, and they are merely looked upon by many as smart business people who are doing that which is immoral but not illegal. Such practices, to my mind, should be both illegal and immoral. I am not prepared to remain silent whilst a case like this is being hushed up in a private office. To show the laxity of the administration at Port Adelaide, I would point out that when Messrs. Meucke and Company were acting as agents for Messrs. John Martin and Company the payments to the Department on behalf of the principal item were much larger than they were whilst Tucker acted as their agent. In an extract from the report of the Chief  Clerk  of the Audit Office, which appears in Appendix C to the report of the Auditor-General, it is shown that - </para>

                    <para class="block">It is remarkable that year after year this state of affairs prevailed at Port Adelaide, and that notwithstanding that the volume of merchandise handled on behalf of Messrs. John Martin and Company was the same as before, the Customs authorities did not notice the falling off in revenue from that source. The firm of John Martin and Company is one of the most &#39; reputable in Australia; but it was victimized t a,s the result of its effort to do a good turn to a relative of a member of the company. I trust that when the Government are called upon to determine what payment it shall make in respect of the amount short paid on its behalf bv Charles Tucker, .they will extend to it some consideration. There can be no doubt that the firm honestly handed over to Tucker, as its agent, every penny for which it was liable in respect of Customs duties, and that Tucker, to whom, as I have said, they tried to do a good turn, robbed the Department. When such things are possible, something must be wrong with the administration of the. Department in South Australia. We have a right to know whether in this case a mere error of judgment has been committed, or whether a criminal offence has been perpetrated. I believe I shall have the House with me when I say that our desire is that every individual, whether influential or not, shall have justice. I hope that no suspicion that corruption exists in the Department will be allowed to remain in the public mind ; but if important cases are settled in private, the public certainly will suspect that there- is something wrong.  Having regard to the lax state of affairs which has prevailed and the comparatively trifling attempts that have been made to remedy the defects in the administration, we certainly have cause for  dissatisfaction  . I trust  that  the Attorney-General will inform the House that this case will not be settled except in the most public manner. &#39; </para>

                                <para>- The facts relating to the question immediately before us may be briefly stated. An action against this firm was instituted in the High Court, and on the pleadings certain defences, involving questions of law, were raised by way of demurrer.. . The matter that was set down for. hearing by the High Court was the determination of the points of law so raised. Late last week certain negotiations transpired, which obviated the necessity for the  questions of law being dealt with by the Court. The firm in question were charged on seventeen sets of charges with having passed false entries with intent to defraud. The fullest investigation was made by the Crown Solicitor&#39;, by counsel in Adelaide acting on behalf of the Department, by the Department itself, and by a  solicitor in London, who, acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, had access to all papers there relating to the case. The books of the firm were placed at the disposal of the Department, and the fullest investigation was made. </para>

The officers made the fullest investigation, and they are satisfied that all the books relating to these &#34;matters were seen, and, further, that the firm did not receive one single penny -benefit by reason of the fraudulent acts. But certain individuals are to be charged with fraud. . In regard to the firm, the charge of intent to defraud will be withdrawn ; but, at the same time, the proceedings are to be continued against them. The firm will admit seventeen distinct charges of, through their servants, making false entries; and all those charges will come before the Court, which will have to assess the penalty in each.- </para>

                                <para>- That is so. I may mention that the amount of duty at stake in the particular charges is not very great, but the firm have agreed to pay &#163;950 duty which we claim. A Judge of the High Court will determine on the facts submitted in the case, and assess the penalty on each charge. It will be seen, therefore, that there has been no private settlement in the Minister&#39;s office. </para>

                                <para>- I can assure the honorable member that no single step in the action has been taken without the advice of counsel who have been in touch with the case from start to finish - without the advice of eminent counsel, as well as that of the Crown Solicitor. The latter gentleman has, perhaps, had more experience of Customs matters than most, and I think we can say that he has been eminently successful in bringing parties to justice. Every step in this matter has been the subject of most anxious investigation, and, as I say, we must admit on the reports, that the firm has not benefited from the frauds. On the whole, I &#39;think -that justice is being done in the settlement which is now being made. It is not a private settlement, nor is there any endeavour to keep facts from the public; indeed, the very nature of the settlement will necessitate the case going into Court for the assessment of penalties. </para>

                                <para>- At any rate, that is what I understood. I am glad to know, however that these charges are to come into Court. But while it is quite true that; in the face of the evidence in their possession, the Government are taking the only possible action, the inquiry of the honorable member for Grey, as to who has obtained the advantages of the frauds, is most pertinent. This is a matter the Customs Department ought to look into; and I am very glad the question has been raised. I have never known a fraud to be committed without somebody receiving benefit, and if the firm did not receive the benefit of these seventeen distinct frauds, the intermediaries must have done so. It is necessary that Parliament should know how these intermediaries benefited. </para>

                                <para>- What I said was that there were strong grounds for suspicion that the firm were implicated, and that a fairly large sum was involved. We cannot say whether the charges which will come before the Court represent the whole of the amount of which the Customs have been defrauded, because, I take it, that only those charges which can be sustained will be put forward. In another case, which has been mentioned, a number of sums were involved, but the Government could not proceed with every charge, and the offender was sentenced to eighteen months, while he ought to have been sentenced to eighteen years, and then he would have got off cheaply, scoundrel that he was. I am glad the Attorney-General has made a statement to the House, and if he had done so in reply to my question, it would not , have been necessary to move the adjournment. </para>

                        <para>In reply to the complaint of the <inline font-weight="bold">Hon. Mr. Sampson,</inline> M.P., with regard to the want of uniformity in the exposure of thermometers in various parts of Victoria, it should be understood that the Commonwealth only assumed control of the States&#39; Weather Services from the first of January last, and consequently was only in a position to initiate a system of uniformity from that date. A number of regulation screens have already been sent to the country to remedy the most urgent defective exposures. The less urgent cases are being dealt with as quickly as supplies, equipment, and circumstances will permit. </para>

As far as can be ascertained in Adelaide no search was made of the boat in Sydney, although there were two days in which to do it. By the time the vessel reached Melbourne all papers relating to the trouble had been delivered at the head office, but it is stated that no search was made of the vessel there. At that port the man implicated received information through the newspapers that the whole plot had been discovered, and when the vessel arrived at Port Adelaide he met the police officials with a smile &#34; ? </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to occupy much time in completing the remarks which I was addressing to the House when the debate was adjourned on Friday last. The principal matter to which I desire to direct attention is that, whilst I and a great many other honorable members are quite prepared to clothe the Government with the powers necessary to secure the conviction of trusts or combines operating in restraint of trade, and to the detriment of the consumer, we desire that that power shall, as far as possible, be removed from the sphere of political influence. In Committee, I hope that some such proposal will be adopted. I feel sure that the result I have indicated can be achieved without depriving the Government of the power with which we wish to invest them. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. I am not a very consistent reader of that publication. All I know is that upon this Bill the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> takes up precisely the attitude adopted by the leader of the Opposition.. I do not intend to discuss the details of this measure. I merely wish to say that we can hail it as the first of a series of amending Bills dealing with antitrust legislation. Last session we passed the principal Act, and, though it has not yet been brought into operation, an amending Bill is already required. I do not blame the Government for this. The problem with which we seek to deal is a most complex and difficult one, and I shall not be at all surprised if, before the close of this Parliament, we are called upon to consider yet another amending Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Conditions are constantly changing. There is no doubt that it is very difficult to secure a conviction in the case of trusts and combines. American experience has demonstrated that. Even after a conviction has been obtained, the public will be fleeced in some other way. As soon as the Court has&#39; decided that a certain method of fleecing the consumer is illegal, the trusts will adopt some other method. . They will attain their object by a different means, and, as a result, we shall be constantly called upon to pass amending legislation. It goes without saying that the object of the Government is not to break up trusts and combinations. </para>

One of the difficulties connected with all anti-trust legislation is that it necessarily assumes that what is perfectly lawful in the case of the individual is illegal in the case of combinations.

                <para class="block">TheLord Chancellor was therefore of opinion that, if the granting of rebates was unlawful, the greater portion of our commercial dealings, where rivalry exists in trade, was equally unlawful. As a matter of fact, nearly all the unlawful acts committed by trusts - acts which have led to wholesale reprisals and to general condemnation - are committed by individuals without exciting any public alarm. Whilst those acts may not be considered perfectly right, they are certainly perfectly legal. For instance, the act of securing  a  monopoly closely resembles the action of  a  shopkeeper who - having seen a customer entering his rival&#39;s establishment to purchase  some  goods - tells him upon the next occasion that he enters his store that he had tetter get all his goods where he purchased his sausages. There are two ways  in  which any anti-trust legislation which we may devise can be dodged by these combinations. One is by forming an amalgamation. The provisions of the measure would not apply where only one firm was concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Only if it did something in restraint of trade. To endeavour to prevent competition is a perfectly lawful act for any individual or any firm, and it seems to me that amalgamation would enable combinations to dodge the law. The British trusts are largely held together by what are termed &#34; gentlemen&#39;s agreements,&#34; of which there is no documentary evidence, nothing being put on paper ; and those who have gone carefully  into  the operations of trusts say that some  of  the most pernicious effects of combination are due to these arrangements, which the law cannot get at. Therefore, do what you will, you cannot surmount the difficulties which are entailed by these  attempts  to prevent combination. The members of the Labour Party take no responsibility in connexion with the matter. This is the al- tur native of private enterprise. The advocates of unrestricted private enterprise are now brought to this pass : that they have to introduce a Bill which is, in the highest degree, repressive of public liberty, in order that there may be some semblance of free competition. The Labour Party has its alternative. We say that this kind of legislation must, in the nature of things, fail, because the evolution of businesses is to get into fewer hands, combinations succeeding combinations until monopolies are created. Once a monopoly exists, no tinkering legislation can prevent the evils to which President Roosevelt refers in his somewhat frenzied appeal . to Congress, published in this morning&#39;s newspapers. The power to work evil will cause evil to be done, and where there is a monopoly, the State should step in and run the enterprise itself. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. The choice is between two alternatives ; monopolies managed by and for the benefit of a few private individuals in opposition to the interests of the community, and monopolies worked by the State in the public interest. I admit that legislation may prevent the grosser abuses which have accrued in the United States of America. The day is yet distant when trusts, however powerful, will be able to buy up Australian Legislatures and courts of justice, though that is among the possibilities of the future. The entire control of an industry, the power to fix the prices at which raw material shall be paid for and finished products sold, should not be exercised by private individuals ; it should be exercised only by the State for the benefit of the community. Honorable members may say that this is Socialism. It is common sense. I do not care anything for Socialism as such. I would not vote to make an industry socialistic merely for the sake of doing so. Unless a business is a good one, the State ought not to embark in it. I do not know whether I am or am not a Socialist. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to take over more than it may be necessary in the public interest to take over. Everything depends on the view held as to where the public interest begins and ends. If a man works up a business until it becomes a monopoly, for the control of which Parliament must continually legislate, the State should take over the enterprise, since it has become too large for one man to run in his own interest. But it would not be fair to the Government to enter upon a general discussion of Socialism, except so far as the subject is inseparable from the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing under the sun is entirely good or entirely bad. There is a great deal of good in combinations. They enable business to be better organized and conducted than under the old system, whereby every trader had a small shop of his own. There is no doubt that they are bringing about more rapidly than could any socialistic propaganda the evolution of society towards organized industry. </para>

                        <para>- No; I hold that such a state of affairs is inevitable. But after all, is it not idle to say that one prefers conditions that obtained some fifty or sixty years ago to those now ruling? We cannot get face to face with the exact circumstances of trade of half a century ago, but perhaps the conditions then prevailing were the most suitable for the time being. We have nowadays huge business organizations, and huge firms are being amalgamated at a very rapid rate. I have just read a most interesting book, <inline font-style="italic">The Trust Movement in British Industry,</inline> by H. W. Macrosty, which cannot be said to be antagonistic to or in support of trusts. It is really a short history of the formation of the principal trusts in Great Britain. In his survey and conclusions the writer says - </para>

                    <para>But the encroachment on the realm of free competition steadily progresses, though not at the feverish speed of six or seven years ago. We have to reckon with the probability, to use no stronger term, though one might, without exaggeration, say the certainty, that we are in the early stages of the evolution of the form which industry will take in the future. </para>

                        <para>- No. He shows the extent to which they have grown, and what is the best and most permanent form to secure certain results. He takes an unbiased view of the trust movement, but I should say that he is if anything rather favorable to it. The control of trade by combines is rapidly approaching completion. I do not object to that. On the contrary, I hold that it is a natural evolution. The alternative to a Bill such as that now before us is to nationalize any industry in danger of becoming a monopoly. The Government have chosen to attempt to regulate trusts, and I understand that the Opposition support them in that effort, but object to some of the details of their scheme. </para>

                        <para>- I could with the utmost consistency vote against it, but the honorable member could not. The only alternative open to him is to agree to the rationalization of monopolies. The regulation of trusts proposed in this Bill takes a form which is horrifying to the honorable member for Maranoa. </para>

As the leader of the Opposition has pointed out, legislation of this kind appears to involve the subversion of all the best-known maxims of British jurisprudence. The principle that no man shall be considered guilty until his offence has been proved goes by the board, and others are to be violated in order that private enterprise may be allowed to continue for a little longer to attempt to crush out all competition. </para>

They are now setting out on their career in Australia, but they know that they are being closely watched, and that there is a strong public feeling against them. That knowledge, to some extent, keeps them in check. They have not yet reached a stage at which they could exercise wide control. Combinations in England, in the first place, have taken the form of trade associations to regulate prices, and have passed on to various stages until they reach the point at which vast amalgamations have been thought necessary. We have an illustration of this in the Goates sewing thread combination, which practically governs the sewing-thread industry of the world. It began as a small combination of a few individual firms, but gradually absorbed or crushed all its rivals. If trusts are let alone, or encouraged by the law, they will rapidly develop as they have done in America. America is the great home- </para>

                        <para>- I said that it is inevitable ; I did not say whether it is good or bad. The terms &#34;good&#34; or &#34;bad&#34; in connexion with an inevitable evolution of industry such as trusts, is idle. To say that trusts are &#34; good &#34; because it is necessary under the present conditions that businesses should become larger and larger and get into fewer hands, seems a misuse of the word - trusts are good and necessary in some respects; but they are bad in other respects. In so far as trustification leads to the cheapening of products, it is certainly good. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is malting me repeat myself. I told him that nothing in the world is either all good or all bad - that no good trust is all good, or no bad trust all bad. The Standard Oil Trust has really done some useful work, as well as work which is certainly not for the benefit of the community. However, I regard this as a matter for the Government ; if they think that this kind of legislation is necessary in the endeavour to repress trusts, very well, we on this side will assist them, as I am sure the Opposition will - the Opposition dare not do anything else. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly ; when trusts become monopolies I desire them to be taken over by the State. When trusts reach the stage at which they control industries, they should not be in the hands of. individuals; when they reach the stage at which they can exercise their powers against the interests of the community, it is time the community owned them. It is quite right and proper, and I hail with some pleasure the attempt of the Government to restrain trusts by this legislation. By all means let the attempt be made. </para>

The honorable member knows in his inner consciousness, as we all know, that the best we can hope for is that this legislation will stave off for a time the inevitable result that certain businesses, when they become monopolies, must be controlled by the community. I do not like to accuse an honorable member of want of sincerity, but I think any one might be suspected of want of candour, if he said he expected by this legislation, for all time to control trusts. </para>

Even in the United States of America, where there is the greatest play in the world for competition the trusts have absolutely annihilated it. The natural evolution of unrestricted free competition is the formation of trusts which dominate entire industries, and ; put an end to competition. </para>

In a measure such as this, I leave the Government to decide for themselves what they think is necessary, confident that all such measures will be found totally inadequate to prevent the  formation of trusts, which will constantly call for more legislation, and ultimately lead to their absorption by the public for the benefit of the public. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened very carefully to the various expressions of opinion of honorable members in the Labour corner on the question of the repression or otherwise of trusts. The Labour leader began the other day by chiding us over here for the different attitude we take on this occasion from that we assumed in regard to the principal measure when it was before the Chamber. He said he. was glad to see we were taking a more favorable view of this legislation now than we did on the previous occasion. Immediately afterwards he was followed by his predecessor in office who told us plainly that, while he proposed to support the Government, he did not believe the measure would do any good - that it was only a stage in the failures that must take place before the final necessity was seen by the community of taking over these huge monopolies. That is a consistent attitude on his part - it is the attitude he has always assumed. I well remember that in his speech on the principal measure he frankly admitted that he had no faith whatever in this kind of regulative legislation as applied to trusts. Why, therefore, should we be chided by the present leader of the Labour Party with regard to any want of sympathy with the proposal ? I said then, and I say to-day, that honorable members who welcome this legislation, and assist the Government to pass it, are simply making hypocritical pretence. They are passing legislation which they say beforehand they are confident can be of no practical value. </para>

                        <para>- That is frank. Why does not the leader of the party say the same? However, we must go to the rank and file in order to ascertain the party&#39;s true attitude. We are told that the community must pass through a series of failures in order that the evolution of the trustification of industries may in time lead to the absolute necessity of the taking over of industries by the State. </para>

                        <para>- So the honorable member says; but, at the same time, he has the reservation in his mind-nay, he has expressed a belief - that all this legislation must end in failure; no one has made that clearer than has the honorable member for South Sydney. It is useless, in a debate of this kind, to make use of the general terms which are being constantly indulged in by members of the Labour Party. For instance, the leader of that party, in an attitude of complacency, and with all the force of axiomatic truth, said that what he wants is economic justice to every man. I do not know one who would controvert that proposition. We, on this side are just as eager to give economic justice to every individual as is the honorable member. Then the honorable member for Boothby told us to-day that what he desires is the minimum of collective control consistent with the public interest. That is a very definite statement indeed. But what on earth does it mean ? We could all say the same ; and I ask whether honorable members do not see that those idle generalities do not help in the discussion of this serious question ? If I require light, I must leave those honorable members and their generalities, and discuss the concrete proposals of the Government. The honorable member for Boothby., to embellish his speech, must needs quote from a writer who declares that there is a great number of trusts in Great Britain. When challenged by me to say what the opinion of the writer is regarding the character of the trusts - whether harmful or helpful to the community - the honorable member could not quote a single line. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but where then, is the relevancy of the quotations to a Bill of this kind. Everyone knows that there is a great deal of trustification going On all over the world ; and we admit, as the honorable member admits, that this is an evolution of our modern industrial life, and that the process seems to be proceeding apace. But what I venture to say is, that it is too early to be confident as to what the ultimate effect of this trustification is to be. Honorable members say, &#34; Here are trusts, therefore they are art evil, and will kill the community if we  do not kill them.&#34; That was the expression of the Prime Minister the other night ; and, I say it is a little too early to begin to talk so definitely as to the ultimate effects. </para>

The latter believe that something more, and very much more, is to come to them in the way of advantage. Honorable members opposite will not get the employes upon our railways to say that they are contented with their lot. </para>

                        <para>- I doubt if they are so satisfied as the honorable member would make it appear. I wish to make my position in regard to this matter very clear. With my honorable friends opposite, I recognise that trusts are growing apace throughout the whole industrial world. But in my judgment - and I endeavour to keep my mind open to all the facts of the case - we are now beginning to see what are their natural limitations. We are beginning to perceive that the difference between those trusts which are most harmful and those which are least harmful springs from the nature of the case itself. We are beginning to recognise that we cannot make the operation of trusts harmful in their character to the general community in connexion with products in which there is world-wide production and competition. We may set that down as an economic law. Trusts become an evil only where competition is stifled. </para>

                        <para>- What is happening in America? What is making the operations of trusts so harmful there ? The very thing that protectionists will never admit. It is the prohibitive Tariff of the United States which is making the operation of these trusts so great an evil. The Attorney-General talks about the Beef Trust. Let him reflect upon the duty that is imposed upon preserved beef in the United States, and he will then see why that trust has exercised so baneful an influence. In the first place, the Legislature has decreed that there shall be no external competition in the matter of beef. Having shut out the competition of the world, the Beef Trust set about working harmful results to the people inside the ring. </para>

                        <para>- It operates anywhere that it can get a chance. If a little healthy competition were turned upon these trusts we should soon see the result. I am not now arguing the question of free-trade <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> protection. I am merely debating whether it is right to impose prohibitive duties upon those products, the control of which may lead to the establishment of monopolies. Wherever we can preserve the element of competition by regulating our Tariff we shall have trusts whose operations are less harmful in their character than would otherwise be the case. In proof of this statement we have only to compare the trusts of Great Britain with those which exist ; in America. It is idle to. single out individual cases. The fact remains that it is impossible to institute a parallel between the trusts of Great Britain as a whole and the trusts of America, either from the stand-point of their harmful character or of the magnitude of their operations. </para>

                        <para>- Does that settle the matter?Let us take the figures relating to the capitalization of these trusts, and compare them. We shall then be able to draw our own inferences, apart altogether from what newspapers may say. I am not here to defend the trusts of Great Britain any more than I am those of America, where they are exceeding their proper function, which is to supply the people with goods at a fair price, whilst paying those engaged in their manufacture fair wages. So long as trusts work no harm to the community, what cause of complaint have we against them? Economic production ought to be encouraged all over the world. So long as trusts do not attempt to unfairly manipulate prices or to drag down the wages of their employ&#233;s, nothing can be urged against them. </para>

                        <para>- What has that question to do with what I have been saying? I have just declared that I am opposed to harmful trusts and now the honorable member asks me - I do not use the term in an offensive sense - the foolish question of whether I would allow a harmful trust to operate. He assumes - and this is at the bottom of all he says - that all these trusts are necessarily harmful in their operation, and must continue to be harmful until the community in self protection says, &#34; Takeover this industry and relieve us from the incubus from which we are at present suffering.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- Unquestionably. That has been our attitude all through. This brings me to an interrogation which I should like to put to the Minister in charge of the Bill. What is the case for the Bill? We have not had it stated. We have been told that the Solicit tor-General says that the Bill is necessary. Why? The Act has been on the statute-book for nearly two years. The Government declared that there were in existence in Australia and elsewhere trusts, malign in character and operation, to destroy which legislation was needed. But, after two years, nothing has been done, and we are told that further power is wanted. The Government, so far as we know, has not taken a trust before the Court. </para>

                        <para>- In dealing with world-wide problems, one must proceed on world-wide data. To cite the case of America is therefore to bring forward an irrelevant illustration, which does not help the elucidation of this matter. The countries to which we should pay regard are those where there is healthy and legitimate competition, and where, consequently, trusts are not nearly so harmful as they are in America. If there were a little more competition in America, the trusts there would be infinitely less harmful. </para>

                        <para>- No ; and I do not wish to do so. There is a difference between dragging in free-trade and so regulating the Tariff as to preserve the element of competition between one country and another. The honorable member himself does not wish to surround Australia with a Tariff wall as high as that of America. During the Tariff debates, he told us that he did not desire prohibition for Australia. </para>

                        <para>- In an examination under the Customs Act, what is desired is to find out whether persons are committing fraud, and whether duty is obtainable upon certain goods, a very small matter compared with the hauling of men to Court, to be imprisoned or heavily fined, perhaps, for the commission of some act detrimental to the community. So far as I know, there is no harm in making a man answer all questions relating to goods unlawfully in his possession by reason of the fact that duty has not been paid on them. The indictable offence created by the principal Act is a different matter. Therefore, the greatest care should be exercised in making provisions taken from the Customs Act apply to the control of trusts. I should also like to know what person is likely to be appointed to act for the Comptroller-General ? Is an ordinary Customs official to be sent to a firm engaged in a large way of business to say, &#34; Show me your books, and let me take extracts from them, with a view to using them against you later on&#34;? Such a power should be jealously guarded and surrounded with every possible safeguard. The person charged is to tell the Customs official everything about his business and its ramifications, and to answer every question which the Comptroller-General or the person named by him may ask, and the averment in the information against him is to be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. Throughout the principal Act, &#34; intent &#34; is dealt with, the </para>

But intent is specially exempted under the Bill. It is provided that the Bill shall not apply to what is the substance and essence of the principal Act. To what then does it apply? What is meant by the statement in the proposed new section  15A  that the averments of the prosecutor contained in the information in any prosecution for an offence against sections 4, 5, 7, 8, or 9 of the Act shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary? </para>

But intent being the sum and substance of the principal Act, and being excluded under the Bill, what is meant by the statement that the averments of the prosecutor shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary ? The utmost that we should agree to is that, if a person who is charged does not furnish -proof to the contrary, the statement of the prosecutor shall be deemed to be evidence in the case. Why does the Government fear to let the Court decide upon the evidence? </para>

                        <para>- Then does this provision mean anything at all. In a prosecution for an indictable offence the guilt of the defendant must be established  by evidence, I presume on the part of the prosecutor. If so, what is there left as to which this precious clause can apply ? There is the further provision, relating to the production of the books of trusts, the taking of copies, and the investigation of their affairs generally in a compulsory way.. And for what purpose? For the purpose, as the leader of the Opposition so clearly pointed out, of building up a case against them. In British communities that is an unusual, procedure in connexion with such trials. I do not say at present it is un- &#39; necessary. I do not take that attitude; but we have a right to ask the Minister why this new departure is proposed? He ought to give us the facts on which is based the demand of the Government for this extraordinary power. Before any such power is exercised by a mere officer there ought to be the direction of a Judge that it shall be exercised. If it is necessary to make the proposed preliminary investigation let it be done on the order of a Judge. Let us surround the whole processes of interrogation and inquiry by a judicial atmosphere rather than let loose a Customs officer to conduct what, after all, is a judicial inquiry to secure evidence upon which to build up a case. </para>

That step ought at least to be taken in proceedings that are of vital concern to the people interested, and are so closely connected with the industrial life of the community. </para>

                        <para>- I did not hear the honorable member for Hindmarsh. My point is that if it i? necessary to take these extra powers - and I use the word &#34; extra &#34; in relation to these matters as distinct from the ordinary processes of investigation in connexion with criminal offences - the officer who exercises them should have the authorization of an order of the Court. I shall be glad to hear the Attorney-General upon  these matters. He should tell us plainly what are the defects of the principal Act and why it has been found impossible to proceed under it against huge trusts, which the Government allege are harmful, the operations of five or six of which they say have already been investigated, and as to which they wish to take action, but are&#39; unable to do so by reason of the inadequacy of the principal .measure. The Minister says that he wants further power; let him make out his case for it. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill is administered by the Department, and if there is one thing more than another which is. likely to embarrass the State, it is the continuance of the present system of dealing with matters in dispute between the Department of Trade and Customs and the public. I do not desire that procedure to be continued under this anti-trust legislation. In making preliminary investigations of the character outlined in the Bill, the officers of the Department should have behind them the authority of the law. We ought not to allow an individual officer in the Department to ask for information which in ordinary circumstances - -and I quite agree with the honorable member for Parramatta that we are endeavouring now to deal with extraordinary conditions - no one would ever think of giving; but, as the honorable member for Boothby has said, we are dealing with an evolution in trade, and must be prepared to go further than we have in the past. The honorable member for Parramatta has not shown that he is one of those who are bound to the systems of the historic past. He is prepared to take a step forward, and to sanction acts which in days gone, by might have been considered unreasonable - he is prepared to agree to such action being taken in order to deal with what  Ave  regard as an extraordinary state of affairs. I agree with him, however, that the power of preliminary investigation, for which provision is made in the Bill, is altogether too great to be placed in the hands of . an official. The Comptroller-General for the time being might be a very able man, fully competent to deal with matters in dispute in a way that all would heartily commend ; but we must not forget that he has&#39; power to delegate his authority. We might in certain circumstances have an officer without tact or judgment taking proceedings calculated to plunge the State into a very serious action. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. I know of one or two that are at present in operation, and are loyally observed by the parties to them, although no agreement has actually been committed to paper. In these circumstances, it is impossible to secure a conviction, and if Ave are to deal with trusts further power is necessary. I frankly admit that&#39; at present trusts in Australia have not assumed such proportions as to cause the community to feel that they are burdensome ; but history teaches us that it will be only a matter of time before they extend their powers and show us what they are capable of doing. We are now endeavouring to control, not to obliterate, them. Our sole desire is to secure that the community will not be injured by their operations. We can do that only by dealing with them in their infancy. If a\&#39;e refrained from taking action until they had assumed the proportions of some of the trusts in the United States of America, we should find ourselves almost as powerless as are the authorities there. For these rea- sons I feel sure that honorable members on all sides of the House, no matter what their views may be as to what should be the ultimate aim of legislation of this character, will unite in placing on the statute-book an effective measure. We must . admit that the principal Act is not effective. The Minister has told us that it is not. As one who has had a little experience in Victoria, -I &#39; can assure honorable members that a Minister of the down could occupy no more humiliating position than that in which he finds himself called upon to administer a law which really confers no power upon- him. What could be more humiliating&#34;&#34; to a Minister than that he should be compelled to compound felonies, as was done in Victoria - and is still done, in my opinion, by the Department of Trade and Customs of the Commonwealth - simply because of the ineffectiveness of the law at his command ? There is no more humiliating position for a Minister or for a people who find themselves unable to check an abuse, or to control the growth of -trusts and combines, and direct into proper channels the development of industry. I hope that the House will speedily agree to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, and that, when we go into Committee, the Attorney-General will either give, us a sufficient reason for his request that enormous powers should be placed in the hands of an individual, or that he will- amend the Bill in the direction indicated by the deputy-leader of the Opposition. </para>

                    <para>.- If it is expedient to pass a measure of this kind, it is certainly desirable that it should be made effective in its application. The Attorney-General has told us that under the principal Act it has been found impossible to obtain the information necessary to enable action to be taken against trusts. Whilst concurring in the . necessity of giving the Government the requisite powers, I feel that the Attorney-General has not taken the House into his confidence, and with sufficient frankness informed it of the special difficulties that have been met with, and which have rendered it necessary to introduce this amending Bill. I hope that at a later stage he will explain why these larger powers are sought, and that the House will agree with the general principle that the original measure shall be made effective. Whilst I am sura that the Government will, experience no difficul tv in securing the second reading of the Bill, I feel that a more un-British proposition! than is contained in one or two of its clauses has never been embodied in any measure. As has been so well and ably presented by previous speakers, this Bill proposes to ask persons, who may be absolutely guiltless, to proffer information, which may incriminate them ; and even if those who are suspected be guilty, I hold that such a procedure is contrary to British law. In Committee, however, it may be possible, by amendment, to give the Minister the powers which he deems to be necessary to enable him to obtain the necessary information ; and to that end I shall assist, provided the proposals are on fair and legitimate lines. I entirely concur with the view, that we are placing too great a power in the hands of the Comptroller-General. At the present time the Commonwealth is fortunate in the Comptroller-General, whose honour and integrity are above suspicion ; but it is possible that, in the future, we may not always be successful in securing the services of so discreet and discriminating an officer. I agree in the view that evidence should, from the commencement of the proceedings, be secured under the authority of a Judge, whose position guarantees his absolute impartiality. The two points I have mentioned constitute, in my opinion, the chief objections to the measure A Comptroller-General, however capable he may be in the discharge of his important duties, must necessarily have a bias in favour of the Department in any action which he has to initiate on what he believes to be justifiable .information. I am not prepared to vote against the second reading, but I hope that in Committee, while securing the fullest powers to obtain information, the Government will see the desir-ability of modifying their views, so as fo, make the measure more equitable and just;: and to that end I hope amendments will be submitted, which will commend themselves,, not only to this House, but to the public generally. There is not a single honorable member, I am sure, who approves of combinations and trusts which operate against the public interest, or to the detriment of trade and commerce, or who believes that they should be allowed to carry on illegitimate operations without intervention. </para>

                        <para>- Then the law officers have supplied the House with only incomplete information, though when we come to deal with details in Committee, they may be able to justify their position j and if they show by specific cases that&#34; those clauses are necessary, my feeling will be to support the Government. At present, however, I hold that those extraordinary powers are not necessary, and that all the information should be obtained judicially in the proper way. I regard this as not a party question, but a national question ; and honorable members on all sides of the House should join in an effort to produce an equitable measure so as to prevent in Australia the conditions which have arisen in the United States, and which have recently been brought so prominently under the world&#39;s notice. If trusts have to be dealt with, it is better that it should be .in their early stages, before they grow so powerful as to make the task impossible or difficult. I have ventured to say these few words as an indication of my position in regard to the Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to detain the House more than a. few minutes, in view of the fact that I spoke very fully when the original proposal was before us, and gave my views on trusts and the means necessary to restrain them. On that occasion I took exception to some of the measures proposed, on the score of their ineffectiveness and unfairness. I agree with the honorable member for Parramatta that the Government, having adopted a policy which gives the opportunity to create trusts, are now engaged in trying to scotch or kill that which they have created. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that there are trusts not created bv the Tariff, but the honorable member will admit that when there is a strong protective fence, trusts can be created much more readily. There are trusts which can be formed under the freest conditions of trade, especially in industries- where large capital, and extensive means of transit, such as steamers and railways, are required. Indeed, such trusts as these can be created under free-trade or protection ; but there are other trusts which can exist only with protection from outside competition. </para>

                        <para>- There is greater difficulty in breaking one kind of trust than there is in breaking the other kind, as I think I shall show when I come to deal with some of the proposals in the Bill. When the original measure was before us, I expressed, as I do now, a strong desire that malignant, hurtful trusts should be dealt with effectively. This afternoon, the honorable member for Werriwa asked whether there are any harmless trusts. To that, I answer that there are ; and. while I need not detain honorable members by giving many instances, I venture to say that the Coal Vend at Newcastle, properly conducted, is a harmless trust. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with that question, but with the argument supplied by the particular case. So long as a combination does not develop into a tax-imposing power over the community - so long as it does not take the place of the Government, and draw from the people, not -merely ordinary profits, but really taxes - and&#39; so long as it operates to the advantage of those in the industry, and of the public, then I say such a combination may be, and is, beneficent. I quite admit, of course, that such a trust may cease to be &#39;beneficent and become ma.lignant, if, not satisfied with the original object of raising the wages of those employed in the industry, and of saving it from cut-throat competition, while, at the same time, supplying the public at a fair price, they proceed to constitute themselves tax-gatherers and reap a return out of all proportion to the services rendered. To the extent that the original measure and this amending Bill can prevent such a state of affairs arising, I am heartily with such legislation. When the original measure was before us, I not only tried to modify what I considered to be some of its unfair provisions, but I pointed out that it would be ineffective for its purpose. The then Attorney-General did not agree with me on the latter point, considering as he did that the measure would prove sufficiently operative, but, now, the present Government, by asking for an extension of powers, prove that my criticism was justified. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; and I desire to point out how little can be accomplished even under the amending Bill. This is not wholly due to the legislation, though in part it is. The ineffectiveness of the measure is in some degree due to the Constitution, which makes it possible for trusts to evade both the original Act and the Bill. The Commonwealth cannot proceed against a trust operating in one State only, unless it is a corporation, and, even in the latter case, I am doubtful whether the Commonwealth could succeed. </para>

                        <para>- I may be wrong, but I think so. A trust has only to split itself into firms or individuals operating in the States separately, and apparently quite distinct from one another, in order to avoid the provisions of both the original measure and this Bill. I admit that that is not. the fault of the Government, but is due to the circumstances of the Constitution ; and unless the States choose to co-operate with the Commonwealth I venture to say we shall secure very little effective result. It must not be thought that those powerful organizations, who have proved themselves elsewhere to be able to evade what appeared to be the most drastic legislation, from which even lawyers considered there was no escape, will allow themselves to be overcome when there is such a simple means of effecting their purpose. Therefore, however drastic we may make this Bill, so long as our powers under the Constitution are limited, I doubt if we shall achieve much in the way of the effective suppression of trusts. In some of the provisions of this Bill - if they do not go further than they ought - the wrong means of reaching the end in view has been adopted. If the Attorney -General had stated more fully the reasons why the Government require to be vested with these powers, possibly we might have formed a somewhat different opinion. But I do not think that he has put into operation even the powers that he can exercise under the principal Act. Perhaps he will be good enough to say whether he has not received complaints that rebates have been granted by a certain trust. </para>

                <para class="block">That section seems to be much clearer than are some other portions of the Act. Yet the Attorney-General says that he had not the power necessary to obtain a conviction. If he could not succeed under that provision, how can he expect to succeed under the much more vague provisions of the Statute? The principal Act seeks to accomplish too much and yet does not sufficiently deal with the worst evils associated with trusts. For instance, it deals with the offence of prices being unduly raised to the detriment of the public, and then reverses the process and creates an offence of goods being sold too low or at a loss, presumably because the effect of such action might be to interfere with some Australian industry. How are we going  to steer between these two opposites? A penalty is imposed for the offence of unduly raising prices and also for that of selling goods at less than their cost price. </para>

                        <para>- I contend that it has been complicated by the introduction of the fiscal element. The principal Act should have dealt with the operation of trusts in the Commonwealth, whether they were operated by external or internal organizations. The fiscal element to which I have alluded, which seeks to restrain what might be legitimate competition should have been eliminated. Its introduction has rendered the measure more difficult to operate. Clause  4  of this Bill declares that in any prosecution for an offence against the Act, the declaration of the prosecutor shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. To my mind, the less we use such a provision, the better. If sufficient evidence is not forthcoming to show that a trust is operating injuriously to the interests of the public, I do not know that it is wise for the. Government to interfere, and I do not believe that they will be able to successfully interfere, under the provisions of the principal Act, with the amendments now proposed. A somewhat similar provision was inserted in the principal Act. This Bill extends that power, and unless its exercise can be safeguarded by some means which will entirely remove it from political influence, I shall be very loth to support it. If such a power is to be exercised, it should be strictly guarded. We should not allow political influence a chance to operate. </para>

                        <para>- But the provision in this Bill goes much further than does that in the Customs Act. It covers the whole area of commerce in other relations than that of the payment of Customs duties. Under the Customs Act, the one thing which the Comptroller-General is required to do, is to ascertain that he receives the proper amount of duty. But under this Bill, he may be moved to action by a rival of the party charged with an offence, or by one of thelatter&#39;s discharged  employ&#233;s.  Thereupon the alleged offender would be haled before him, subjected &#39;to a searching cross-examination, and when he had extracted from him all the information that he desired, he would use that information against him in evidence. </para>

                        <para>- But the intention is that a person may be brought before the Comptroller-General. It would be the. same thing in the case of the representative of a trust, except that the proceedings might then, be brought either against him or against the trust. The provision is open to most improper use. I agree that we might obtain the services of an autocrat who could exercise the multifarious powers of the Comptroller-General. - which are getting more arbitrary every day - better than a Parliament or a Court ; but the objection to autocracy is that, while, at one time, . you may have a suitable man at the head of affairs, at another time you may have there an entirely different and unsuitable man. There is too much tendency in our legislation to recognise that we have at the head of the Customs Department a very honest and able man - which I admit - and to act as if he, or some one exactly like him, would always fill that office. As a matter of fact, we know that there will be a succession of Ministers and of Comptrollers-General, some of whom will be scrupulous and some less so ; some biased by political opinions, and others not biased. We must provide for this, and not frame our legislation on certain lines simply because we now have at the head of the Customs Department an excellent official in whom we have the utmost personal confidence. The authority whom we should set up should be one more important and more judicial than most Customs officials are likely to be. That authority, should have the power to say whether certain persons should; be questioned, and, if questioned, what questions should be put to them. There were one or two . other matters to which I intended to allude; but I shall defer my remarks in regard to them until the Committee stage is reached. I take objection now, as I have done before, to the readiness with which it is proposed to delegate to others powers which should be exercised only on the responsibility of the Minister, and especially the tendency to make an autocrat of the Comptroller-General. Administrative work is being unnecessarily piled on the Customs Department by the passing of Act after Act, so that its head, even if he possessed the ability to deal judicially with the cases coming before him, must have so short a time to devote to the consideration of fine points of distinction, and to questions of right and wrong, that, in my opinion, powers such as are given in this Bill to the Comptroller-General should be given to some other authority&#39;, and other powers should be exercised only by the Minister responsible to Parliament. </para>

                    <para>.- Those who were members of the House when the principal Act was introduced will remember the attitude of the members of the Labour Party in regard to it, and their criticism upon it. They said that it, or any measure like it, could not, from its nature, succeed in eradicating the evils associated with trusts. Now, after a lapse of two years, we. find that not one case has been brought under the Act, and the Ministry is asking for additional powers. The attitude of the Labour Party towards the principal Act is its attitude towards the . Bill. It supported the principal Act, not because it thought that it would be effective, but to show those who insisted upon trying to maintain competition when competition was growing impossible, and upon upholding private enterprise when public ownership should take its place, that their efforts to meet the situation were futile. Its members said in effect, as they say now, &#34; We are prepared to vote for the measure, and to go as far as the Ministry asks us, in granting powers for the regulation of combines and trusts, not because we think that they can be effectively used, but to show that they are bound to fail.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- On that point we differ. Honorable members shut their eyes to the state of affairs now existing in England and in America. While the Oil Trust robs the world, they&#39; say that competition will maintain itself. They see the rise here of the Brick Combine, the Coal Combine, the Coastal  Shipping Combine, and yet they tell us that competition will maintain itself. </para>

                        <para>- I do not condemn combinations <inline font-style="italic">per se,</inline> though it is strange, since the honorable member told us two minutes ago that competition would continue in spite of all efforts to prevent it, that he now says that the miners are forcing the mine-owners to combine. We have been told by the Opposition that the measure introduces methods unknown to . British law. The honorable member for North&#39; Sydney said - I think correctly - that it will establish a tribunal like the Star Chamber, making the Comptroller-General of Customs an autocrat. The leader of the. Opposition and the honorable member for Parramatta contend that the measure introduces a new principle, by shifting the burden of proof from the accuser to the accused, making a man appear guilty until he has proved that he is innocent. Its provisions are undoubtedly stringent, and such as the extraordinary nature of the conditions which continually arise through the operations of trusts can alone justify. Believing that the evils associated with trusts cannot be overestimated, I am prepared to go as far as the Ministry asks us to go in providing for their control. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that it is not so controlled is no evidence that it will not be. In that respect the honorable member for Parramatta and the Labour Party are at one ; we have no desire to nationalize the wheat production of Australia. Our proposal is to nationalize only monopolies, that arise. If the honorable member did&#39; not contend - and I accept his assurance that he did not - that we could not get a: trust to stifle competition in necessaries-- </para>

                        <para>- Then I venture to join issue with the honorable member, and to say that where there is a possibility of world-wide competition harmful combinations have arisen. Take, for example, the combination in respect of sewing cotton. The Coates&#39; Trust is a world-wide one, controlling the whole of the sewing cotton trade of the world, with the result that cotton is dearer to-day than it was fifteen years ago, when competition prevailed. Then we have the Beef Trust of America, already established in England. </para>

                        <para>- That may be, but the number ought to be sufficient, if the honorable member&#39;s contention is correct, to prevent a harmful trust arising in connexion with cotton production. If the honorable member says that only those things which grow in&#39; every continent are free from the operations of trusts, he cuts down the possibility of our maintaining competition in connexion with the great bulk of articles that are in common use. I dare say that the great majority of the articles in every-day use are not produced in all parts of the world. If that be so, the honorable member does not go very far ; it is no satisfaction to us to know that only those articles which are produced all over the world can be controlled by trusts. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see much purpose in merely inquiring into their surroundings. The question which this House and the country have to decide is what is to be done after the inquiries have been made. We have ample evidence of the evil that trusts can do, and we now await from honorable members who are opposed to the nationalization of monopolies a solution of the difficulty before us.I venture to say that it will not be found in this Bill. The honorable member for Parramatta  seems to think that many trusts are harmless - that the number of harmful trusts are few. When I asked him to name a few of the harmless trusts, he assured us that only about twenty-three out of some hundreds of trusts in America were returning dividends. Is that an answer to the question? Does the honorable member contend that trusts which do not return dividends are necessarily harmless in their operations? </para>

                        <para>- Most men when floating their business enterprises into trusts endeavour to get as much as possible for them; and if people are foolish enough to purchase scrip at a very high price, it is quite possible that they will not get any return on that outlay. But let the trusts retain their monopoly long enough, and we shall not have &#163;500,000,000 invested in them at a loss. </para>

                        <para>- I do not suggest that, but I know many firms - and the honorable member knows of many - that have found that it paid them to make losses for a year or two - until they had crushed out competition - and that they were soon able then to make good their losses. One of the features of the successful establishment of trusts is that they have to submit to losses for a few years, with the full knowledge that in time they will reap if they faint not. We have received from the Opposition the assurance that trusts cannot exist here as they prevail in America - that there is no danger of their having in Australia the harmful effects that they have had in America. I do not know on what ground that contention is based. When I consider the age of this country, the extent to which rings and combines already operate here, and the evil effects manifested in connexion with their operations, I cannot understand why they should stop short of what trusts in other countries are doing. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that they are. Having regard to the cry that we hear almost incessantly as to the evils already existing in connexion with trusts, I do not know what ground there is for the hope that no bad effects will arise from them. The honorable member for Moreton towards the end of last year entertained the House at considerable length with a recital of the evils of the Shipping Combine. How can it be said that there is no danger of great  evils arising from trusts in Australia when the very men who come here to uphold private enterprise and to oppose the extension of the functions of the State give evidence as to the evil tendencies of the Shipping Combine in Australia? In such circumstances, how can we hope that there will be no ill effects from the establishment of trusts ? </para>

                        <para>- I wish to put before the House as clearly as I can the view that the method of dealing with trusts embodied in this Bill is not calculated to be successful. I do not understand how honorable members can console themselves with the idea that we shall have in Australia only harmless trusts. The honorable member for North Sydney said that he would reply to the question that I put to the honorable member for Parramatta as to the names of some of the harmless trusts of which he spoke, and proceeded to say that the Coal </para>

                <para class="block">Combine properly managed might be a harmless one. I do not hope to see in this country any harmless trusts. I do not believe that men combine for a public good, but rather for their own good. We have been told that, so long as competition continues, no great harm can be done by trusts : but I think that the object of trusts is rather to wipe out competition. We may safely say that if men be given power, they will use that power whenever it suits them to do so. If we allow trusts to arise in which a few men can combine, they will rob the public if the opportunity presents itself. It might be possible to have harmless trusts if all merchants and manufacturers were philanthropists, and went into the business for the good of the country. </para>

                        <para>- That, of course, depends on what standard of wisdom is set up. I have always understood that those commercial men who are regarded as the wisest, are those who make as much money out of their business as they can ; and that is the object of trusts. I do not complain on that score, because, as we have been told to-day, it is only human nature. We are warned that before we can materially alter present conditions, we must alter poor human nature. I do not know that human nature is either all good or all bad, as some honorable members seek to make out; but I do know that in the name of human nature many good and many bad, and many brave and many cowardly, things are done. What I say is that, if people are put into a position of power without responsibility, in the way that directors of trusts are, they will use the position for. the benefit of their own pockets; and so long as that continues, so long will legislation of this class be ineffective. We suggest that when this legislation has been found to fail, and is discarded - when honorable members, who are prepared to introduce the Star Chamber, and upset the principles of law which have prevailed for centuries, recognise the failure - we shall turn to the only true remedy, and nationalize monopolies as they arise. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt that the same human nature controls both systems, but the difference is obvious. The users of the trams, and the employes on the trams, all reap the benefit under public ownership and Government control, whereas if the trams be in private hands, the users are robbed every time they make a journey, those in Melbourne paying more than their trip is worth when comparison is made with the fares charged in Sydney. The reason is, of course, that those who control the private enterprise are responsible to none but the shareholders, and the more they can rob the public, and the less wages they can pay the better, because it tends to benefit their own pockets. In the case of public enterprise, however, the very opposite effects are seen, because the advantages are shared by the public, and the employes are better treated. I shall vote for the proposal of the Ministry, willing to let them have another try to control private enterprise, and continue competition. But, as every one knows who has marked the trend of industry during the last two or three decades, we shall find after all our efforts that it is impossible to maintain competition in an age like ours. </para>

                    <para>. - After the full discussion of this Bill, I do not propose to occupy the attention of honorable members for more than a few minutes. I shall not allow myself to be drawn into a discussion of general subjects as the honorable member for Werriwa did, but I propose rather to deal with the merits of the Bill. I should like, however, to say that for some of the reasons to which the honorable member himself alluded, I am one of those who are in favour of an effective system of anti-trust legislation being enforced. I believe that those who are opposed to the introduction or the realization of socialistic ideals will find themselves compelled ultimately to grapple with the undoubted evil and danger which, under our modern conditions, results in the aggregation of very large amounts of capital, massed together for certain purposes. Therefore it is essential that those who look into the future and the future developments of social and political life, not merely in countries like America, but in young countries like Australia, should pay attention to the dangers when they are in a nascent condition, and not wait until they have developed in the way they have in older countries. I am quite in sympathy with those who desire to have effective legislation - not too drastic, but as effective as necessary - for the purpose of preventing the growth of associated capital in such form as is likely to be ultimately dangerous to the social and political freedom of the community. But, of course, in this, as in everything else, we must prescribe the medicine with some degree of proportion to the disease. And the only question, I take it, with which the House is now concerned is whether this particular measure is or is not unnecessarily drastic, having regard to the present conditions of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- In most of the cases when legislation emanates from the Government which derives its life&#39;s spirit from the party which the honorable member lately led, we have usually to reiterate the complaint that it is too drastic. I should like to say that the Attorney-General - whom I should be the. last to accuse of doing anything intentionally to mislead the House - pressed on our attention an analogy which is no analogy, in referring to some recent American legislation. Let me for one moment ask the attention of honorable members while I refer shortly to the history of American legislation on this subject. Honorable members know that in 1890 or 1892, I forget which year, the United States. Congress passed what, is known as the Sherman Act, which is the -origin of the Australian Industries Preservation Act. The Sherman Act was very wide in its scope, just as is the Australian Act of 1906. The first section of the Sherman Act indicates the general lines on which it proceeds - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <quote>
                    <para>Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Then the section goes on to say - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Every person who shall make any such contract, or engage in any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanour. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That Act was not limited to any one particular trade, but was intended to meet cases of conspiracy in restraint, or - as was ultimately held - in injurious restraint of trade- It did not necessarily mean all restraint, but restraint injurious to the public j and it made such combination illegal in any kind of trade or business. That, of course, is very wide ; and the Act was brought into existence at a time when all kinds of combination in America had reached the point which many thoughtful men considered was becoming dangerous to the freedom of individual citizens engaged in ordinary industries. That Act was followed in the Australian legislation, the more drastic provisions being, to some extent, curtailed. The Australian Act of 1906 was not limited in its application - just as the Sherman Act was not - but it regarded as an essential in its operations that some combination or conspiracy should be shown, the effect of which was necessarily detrimental to the interests of the public. I think the Attorney-General will agree with ma that the words &#34; to the detriment of the public &#34; are really the controlling words of the Act which we are now amending. That is one line of legislation universal in its application, so far as all industries are concerned, but it is rigidly limited, because the fact can be ascertained only after full proof has been brought be- fore the Courts called on to deal with the matter - namely, that the combination is to the detriment of the public. The Attorney-General referred to some recent American legislation, giving, as he said,, equally drastic powers} of inquisition, the terms of which have been followed in the Bill. Let me remind honorable members that the class of American legislation to which the Attorney-General referred ran along totally different lines, and was for totally different purposes. In  1887, before the Sherman Act, there was passed in America an Act to. regulate trade and commerce between the States, and the conduct of particular classes of persons or corporations, who were conducting the great carrying operations between the States - in other words, the great railway corporations and monopolies throughout the whole of the States. It was then becoming apparent - as it has become more and more apparent since- that these great and powerful corporations had risen to such a point that their operations threatened, not only the liberty of individuals, but the liberty, and even the integrity, of some of the constitutional institutions upon which they had to depend. That was the great danger. That was the danger created by  these powerful corporations which had been invested with enormous monopolies by the States - either by the individual States or bv the United States through their legislative channels. These monopolies were often used for the purpose of carrying on an internecine war between great capitalistic organizations in which the interests of - the individual citizen were absolutely ignored, leading, as we all know, to disaster in the liquidation of stocks and shares in which the leaders of these organizations sometimes engaged. That was the great evil which had to be coped with - an evil which had reached dimensions far beyond those attained by ordinary trade and business corporations, and to cope with which Parliament thought it necessary to provide some special machinery. What took place? In 1887 Congress passed an Act to regulate commerce. That Act, I think, deals entirely with the operations of carriers. T have not had the opportunity of reading through every portion of it, but the Attorney-General will correct me if I am wrong. It opens with the words - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Be it enacted, That the provisions of this Act shall apply to any corporation or any person or persons engaged in the transportation of oil or other commodity, except water. </para>

                <para>Mr.W. H. IRVINE. - That is so. Subsequently it was enlarged specially to meet the case of the Standard Oil Trust and other bodies similarly situated. But the whole object of this legislation was to deal with these great paramount corporations, which had been invested with vast power owing to the growth of population in the United States of America. It was confined to them. We must always recollect that. Any legislation introduced to meet such special and vast dangers as were then apprehended - dangers which have not yet been met - can scarcely be safely accepted as a precedent which should guide us in framing a general law relating to such trusts when they do not exist. </para>

                        <para>- In one sense there may be - in the sense that the aggregation of capital always tends to create a certain kind of monopoly. But the establishment of the class of monopolies dealt with by this legislation in America was due to the fact that a comparatively limited number of powerful corporations controlled - necessarily so from the powers granted to them by Parliament - the whole of the carrying trade. By means of their vast capital, and by direct and indirect means employed upon legislators and private individuals, they were able to obtain a control which almost amounted to a universal tyranny. </para>

I have said before that we ought to have some legislation to control, such monopolies. But to adopt the forms of legislation which were introduced in America, to administer the powerful medicine that was at the last stage administered by the United States to cope with the terrible disease which had developed, and which still remains uncured, can hardly be accepted as a safe guide by this Parliament- in dealing with the comparatively immature disease with which we have to cope. </para>

                        <para>-I have said that the power of the railway corporations in America was so immense that even this legislation was not strong enough to effect its purpose, and that it had to be reinforced by the legislation to which I have referred. In 1906, it was so reinforced. We ought not to accept such legislation as a guide to us in the legislation which we are now asked to enact. But let us see what was the character of the legislation passed by the United States Congress. Did it give to an official under political control the power to enter into any man&#39;s house, to inspect any man&#39;s, business, to take possession of any man&#39;s books, and to apply an inquisitorial scrutiny into a man&#39;s private affairs without any kind of judicial inquiry? Nothing of the kind. In the first place, Congress created an InterState Commerce Commission. Instead of a Comptroller-General of Customs - an irresponsible official, or, rather, an officer who is responsible only to his political chief - being vested with this enormous power, a strong judicial tribunal was created, which, by the very terms of its constitution, was absolutely freed from all political influence. That is the first point that has to be noted. </para>

                        <para>- But the Attorney-General did not tell us how it was constituted, how vastly it differed in its character from the proposal under this: Bill to invest a single officer with power to discharge similar functions. That, judicial tribunal was composed of men who were appointed for a period of six years, who were to be absolutely removed from political influence, and who were placed in such a position that they could discharge their judicial functions as a Court should&#39; do, without fear or favour, and without political bias of any kind. That is the- first distinction which I draw between the American legislation and that which we are now asked to enact . </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Attorney-General did. But I wish to refer to the particular part of the Act of  1906  which the honorable and learned gentleman cited as a precedent, with a view to show that the powers granted by Congress at that time were vested in a Commission which was purely a judicial body. When I come to analyze those powers, I find that they were not anything like so wide - although they were granted under circumstances of extreme emergency to a judicial tribunal specially created for the purpose -as are the powers which we are asked to grant under this Bill. </para>

I have already pointed out that our circumstances are totally different from those which obtained in the United States. The law to which I have referred relates to a particular class of persons whose vast monopoly rendered it necessary to subject them to control. Now let us look at the powers themselves.

                        <para>- I think that it is. In a few matters of that sort the Act does go a little further than does our own Companies Act. But can it be urged that that is any precedent for the kind of legislation that we are now asked to enact? Under this Bill we are invited to allow the Comptroller-General of Customs, who is directly under political control, to ask any question of any individual that he chooses. He is limited only by his own discretion as to the questions which he shall put to any person whether he be one of the principals of a firm, a manager, a clerk, or an office boy, or whether he be an entire stranger to the particular business that is being carried on. He is at liberty to ask anything that he may think in any way relevant to a crime of which he has not yet even sufficient <inline font-style="italic">prim&#226; facie</inline> evidence to put before a judicial tribunal. That is the kind of legislation before us. Whatever may be urged in favour of it, the circumstances under which the American Acts were passed make them no precedent for us. Let me shortly examine a few of the provisions of the Bill. The Attorney-General told us that it is a machinery Bill. Torquemada, when putting before the Spanish Inquisition a newly-invented thumb-screw or improved boot, might have commended it as the introduction of more effective machinery, and in that sense only can this be termed a machinery Bill. The means adopted might be justified in some great national emergency which made if necessary to go beyond the ordinary British methods of getting information, and to adopt more drastic steps. I do not attach as much weight as some honorable members have done to the provision regarding the onus of proof, though it introduces a principle repugnant to British instincts of fair play, and adopted only in certain classes of legislation, such as the acts relating to insolvency and Customs administration. I do not complain of its introduction here, because of the saving clause that an averment of intent in an information shall not be deemed to prove such intent, and if we refer to the Act we find that intent is the substantial thing to be proved. The effect of the provision is to avoid some formal proofs which might otherwise be necessary. </para>

The suggestion of the acting leader of the Opposition, if adopted, would provide a rational safeguard to this provision, while leaving it effective. I understand it to be this : The Comptroller-General, or other officer, intrusted with the carrying out of the law, shall, if he has ground for believing that there is a case for investigation, bring it on affidavit before a County Court Judge, a Police Magistrate, or some other judicial person, and if the Court is convinced that there is a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case to warrant an inquiry, it shall authorize such interrogatories as may seem reasonably necessary to elucidate the truth. That is a power now possessed in civil cases. Surely, if the law does not think it fit that without safeguards one man shall dive into the recesses of another man&#39;s mind, or have access to his papers or business secrets, for the enforcement of a civil right, it will be at least as careful in regard to a criminal obligation ? </para>

                        <para>- I would allow him to be interrogated if the Comptroller-General had satisfied a judicial authority that there were grounds for believing that an offence had been committed ; but the interrogatories to be delivered should be such as the Judge might determine as reasonable. As a matter of practice, interrogatories are not submitted to a Judge unless the other side objects to answer them ; but where they are directed to the ascertainment of facts which may render a man liable to the criminal law, the person charged should have an opportunity to argue before the Judge that the questions sought to be put to him were not fair. If a man is allowed to be interrogated under the civil law, he has the opportunity to show that the right to interrogate is being pressed beyond fair limits, and it should be so in this case. </para>

                        <para>- As a number of honorable members have pointed out, that is a totally different measure. In this case, it is proposed that an official who may choose to say on any evidence which to his mind may seem sufficient, &#34; I believe that the accused is a party to a conspiracy, and guilty of an offence,&#34; may search into the man&#39;s conscience, go through his business, investigate his books and private records, to make out a case against him. That is a totally different power from that given under the Customs Act, and, if given at all, should be fettered with safeguards at least as great as those attaching to the ordinary interrogations of civil procedure. I hope that the House will not, by pressing this kind of machinery to absurd extremes, deprive the whole legislation of practical effect. </para>

                    <para>. - During the debate honorable members have raised objections, find asked questions in regard to the principles of the measure, which I wish to answer before going into Committee. The honorable member for Flinders said that legislation should always be appropriate to the evil that exists, and should provide a sufficient remedy to cope with it. It is for that reason that the Bill has been introduced. He stated that my analogy is not complete ; that, in the United States, combinations of railway companies and carrying companies monopolized the highways of commerce, on which the trade and foodstuffs of the country had to be carried. He therefore justified the stringency of the powers conferred by the Inter- State Commerce Act. But the evils aimed at&#39; were not solely connected with great carrying corporations; it was found necessary in America to pass laws dealing with corporations of all kinds. </para>

                        <para>- That is the point to which I am coming. In  1894,  what is known as the Wilson Act, was passed. That Act contains anti-trust provisions forbidding unlawful restraints and monopolies by and between importers, or persons, or corporations engaged in importing any articles from any foreign country into the United States, when designed to operate in restraint of lawful trade or free competition in lawful trade or commerce, or to increase the market price in any part of the United States, of imported articles, or of any manufacture into which such imported article enters or is intended to enter. Up to that time, proceedings taken against various corporations had not been altogether successful. The problem then before Congress and the people was in what way the necessary evidence could be obtained to secure a successful prosecution in&#39; respect of not only railway corporations, but other great combines. In  1903  a Bureau of Corporations was established as a sub-department of the Department of Commerce. It was decided that there should be at its head a Commissioner to be appointed by the  President,  and to receive a salary of  5,000  dollars per annum. A Deputy Commissioner and certain other officers were also to be appointed, and the Commissioner was to have power and authority to secure information in regard to the organization, conduct, and management of the business of any corporation, joint-stock company, or corporate combination, excepting common carriers subject to the Commerce Act engaged in Inter-State or foreign commerce. It was also provided that, in order to accomplish the purposes mentioned, the Commissioner should have and exercise the same power and authority in respect of corporations, joint-stock companies, and combinations, subject to the provisions of the Act, as were conferred on the Inter-State Commerce Commission. </para>

The honorable member&#39;s point was that when the United States of America was called upon to deal with powers of this inquisitorial nature, it determined to constitute a Commission.

                        <para>- There may be attempts to evade the law. It is true that legislation has not rooted out trusts in America, but my reading goes to show that it is acting as a preventive. If we cannot root out an evil that is no reason why we should not attempt to deal with it as far as we can. The honorable member for Laanecoorie and others have asked whether the wider powers for which we ask are really necessary. My answer is that they are. The Crown Solicitor was instructed to investigate the operations of various trusts in Australia. </para>

The Crown Solicitor went fully into the matter, and there are in the possession of the Department complete confidential reports, which I could not be expected to disclose. The position is this : Combine A is alleged to be in restraint of trade. We know from the documents that have been filed that there is an agreement in existence. We approach those whom we know to be members of the combine, but they decline to show us a copy of the agreement. We know that from the effects of the combine on industry it is acting in restraint of trade, and that persons are being injured. </para>

                        <para>- Not in a case for penalties. Under the existing Act. it is open to persons who enter into a lawful combine to file with the Attorney-General a copy of their agreement, and, by doing so. they are protected subject to the provisions of the Act. But let us take the case that I was citing when interrupted. There is an agreement within the knowledge of the individuals concerned, and we know by its operation what is its effect upon trade and the public generally. But as soon as we attempt to prosecute that combine in a Court, we are faced with the fact that we cannot prove the existence of an agreement. Where the agreement is lawful, what harm will be involved in an officer of the Department being allowed to inspect it, seeing that he must treat it as confidential ? </para>

                        <para>- In one or two instances, such as an attempt to &#39;monopolize. It is provided that any person who, as principal or agent, enters into any contract or becomes a member of any combination with intent to restrain and so forth, may be proceeded against ; so that the case depends entirely on the fact of a combination being in existence. I do not think that the provision in regard to the onus of proof is very drastic. We cannot go into Court, and, on a simple production of a declaration, call upon a man to defend himself: we have to prove intent on positive evidence. We do not desire to go into Court, and have the decision given against us because there is no proof of an agreement on which the charge is based. </para>

In such case, under the proposed provision, it will not be necessary to prove that he entered into a contract, or that the contract was in relation to trade and commerce with other countries or amongst the States, because the averment will be sufficient proof . But we shall have to go further, and establish by positive evidence that the agreement alleged is made with intent to restrain trade. </para>

                        <para>- But I do not hold that two wrongs necessarily make a right, and  1  do not think that we ought to hold tenaciously to the wording of any particular Act. If it is necessary to define what &#34; answer questions &#34; means, I really think that we ought to make it quite clear that in the proposed section  15B  the questions to bo put by the Comptroller-General to any person must have relation to the offence alleged to have been committed. An Act which requires so many legal minds to determine its meaning can scarcely be regarded as perfection. As a layman I should prefer to incorporate in this provision language which will clearly show what we mean. </para>

                    <para>- The Bill creates three new offences. Under proposed new section  15B  it is an offence to refuse or fail to answer questions ;. under proposed new section 15c, it is an offence to fail to produce or hand over books; and under proposed new section  15E  it is an offence to disclose information gained in the exercise of powers conferred- by the measure. Section 13 provides that no offence against this part of the Act which is an indictable offence shall be tried before a Justice of the High Court, indictable offences going into the State Courts, where there is the machinery for trying them. The three offences which I have named being minor offences are to be prosecuted in any State Court, so that the time , of the High Court may not be taken up in dealing with minor matters. </para>

                <para>SirJOHN QUICK (Bendigo) &#91;9.51&#93;.- I invite the attention of the Attorney-General to an omission from proposed new section  15B  (I) of the preliminary requirement of a complaint on oath made in writing; provided for in proposed. new section 15c (I). I submit that there is no reason for this omission. The Comptroller-General &#39; of Customs, as a public officer, ought not to be required to move on his own motion against any private individual. As a preliminary to requiring any person to answer questions relating to a supposed offence, his informant should be called upon to swear an information . on oath. The Comptroller-General cannot go to a firm or individual and say, &#34; I demand to see your books,&#34; unless some one has taken the responsibility of making a complaint on oath in writing. The power to call upon persons to answer questions in writing is more extraordinary than the power to order the production of documents, and should be surrounded with safeguards to protect individuals or firms from harassing, unnecessary, and unjustifiable investigations. A public Department should not be called upon to make fishing inquiries until some person has accepted the responsibility of setting the law in motion. If a private individual says &#34; I believe that there is a conspiracy in restraint of trade, and I wish you to move in the matter,&#39;&#39; the Comptroller-General of&#39; Customs may fairly reply, &#34; I shall do so if you will take the responsibility of swearing an information.&#34; Why should the Comptroller-General be called upon to compel persons to answer questions before some person has stated upon oath that he has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed ? It must be presumed that some one has supplied him with information, because he could not move unless he believed that an offence had been committed. How could he believe that an offence had been committed unless he had received some private information? If he had, he should call upon the informant to record oh oath his belief. That would be a justification for departmental action. It seems to me that top big an onus and responsibility is thrown upon a public officer by requiring him to launch what is, so to speak, a criminal proceeding - calling upon persons to appear before him to answer questions - unless he has some protection in the shape of an information on oath. I think, therefore, that the Attorney- Genera&#93; ought to agree to insert in proposed section  1.5B  the words - </para>

                    <para>Whenever a complaint on oath has been made in writing to the Comptroller-General that any person or any foreign corporation, or any trading or financial corporation formed within the Commonwealth, has been guilty of any offence against this part of this Act, the Comptroller-General, if he believes the complaint to be well founded, may by writing under his own hand require any person whom he believes to be capable of giving information in relation to the alleged offence to answer questions. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That would make the foundation of jurisdiction in both cases similar, and prevent the exercise of these two powers being anomalous, by, in the one case, casting the onus upon the Comptroller-General, and in the other requiring him to equip himself with sworn information. I do not think that the amendment I suggest would in anyway impair the operation of this power. I desire to support the power, and to make it thoroughly effective, but I do not see why the Comptroller-General should require sworn information iri one case, and not in the other. I hope the Attorney-General will make this law appear just and well founded by associating* the exercise of the first power with the same conditions precedent as are associated with <inline font-style="italic">th?.</inline> exercise of the second power. </para>

If he did not, he would be convicted on the averments contained in the information.

                    <para>The Act under which this seizure was made declares that &#34; in actions, suits, or informations to be brought, where any seizure shall be made pursuant to this Act, if the property be claimed by any person, in every such case the <inline font-style="italic">onus frobandi</inline> shall be upon such claimant. SeeI Story, Laws, c. 128, 71, p. 633 (I Stat. 678, c. 22). In this case, then, the U.S. are not required to establish guilt, but the claimants must prove innocence. It is not the duty of the Judge to justify the Legislature, but surely, if, in any case, such a legislative provision be proper, it is in this. The fact is generally premeditated, and is perpetrated under all the precautions and in all the secrecy which ingenuity can suggest, and the means of proving innocence, at least, to a reasonable extent, which is all that can be required, are in possession of the accused&#39;. In such a case, he may, without a violation of principle, be required to prove his innocence. In such a case, the absence of testimony, clearly in the power of the claimants, if not supplied by other equivalent testimony, must be ratal. </para>

There is a similar provision in the Customs Act and the Excise Act, as well as in the English Consolidated Customs Act of  1870,  which provides that in any information, certain matters shall be deemed to be sufficiently proved on averment, unless the defendant in such case can bring proof to the contrary. </para>

                        <para>- But there are similar cases, for instance in connexion with the diseases of animals. In such cases, the defendant is presumed to have known of the disease until he shows to the satisfaction of the Court that he has not- that is, he is presumed to be guilty unless he proves the contrary. In that, as in the cases immediately under discussion, the contrary is easy of proof. This is not an unusual provision, as is shown by the following extract from a decision by Mr. Justice Owen in the New South Wales Court - </para>

                    <para>The view I take of s. 144 is simply this, that it. relieves the Crown from the necessity of proving their case in the first instance by oral evidence, and allows the averment of the prosecution contained in the information, declaration, or claim, to beprima <inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> proof of the charge preferred against the accused. But when the information has been put in, and all the. evidence produced is before the tribunal, then it appears to me that the tribunal has to determine upon the whole of the evidence before it, whether the Crown has established the guilt of the accused or not. </para>

As to the procedure upon this  clause, I suggest that the proposed new sections contained in it should be submitted to the Committee separately, although you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> have ruled that the clause must be taken as a whole. It must be admitted that the circumstances are somewhat unusual, seeing that we have three proposed new sections all contained within the one clause. If we decide, in regard to the amendment of the honorable member for Illawarra, that the words are to stand, those, of us who desire to have proposed new section 15A omitted, will be deprived of an opportunity of voting to that end. </para>

                        <para>- To my mind the proposed new section15a is neither more nor less than a lazy man&#39;s way of proving a case. Ever since the Magna Charta it has been assumed that a man is innocent until he is proved to be guilty. But the Attorney-General now desires us to take a contrary view. This is to establish a very bad precedent. In the case of the unfortunate woman who was murdered at Ballarat, the departure proposed in this Bill would, if extended, mean that any person seen in her company before her death might be pre- sumed to be guilty, and find it impossible to prove his innocence. The proposed interrogation is following the system of the French, although there is not the slightest objection to the suggestion of the honorable member for Flinders to have interrogatories on the order of a Judge, as in a civil proceeding. But to say that a person must be assumed to be guilty on the averment of the Crown is un-English and unprecedented. In the case of mining accidents the averment or complaint isprima <inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> evidence, but that is a civil and not a criminal proceeding. Under the Bill, however, any person who cannot prove his innocence may be fined or imprisoned. </para>
