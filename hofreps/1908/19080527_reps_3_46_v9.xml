Tariff Reform, Federal Capital, Defence, Old-Age Pensions - none of these things were likely to provoke dissensions sufficient to bring about a crisis; but the plucky and statesmanlike actions of the Postmaster-General had roused all the fury of evil that was using the Post Office for unlawful purposes. </para>

                        <para>- The range of political criticism in the press is so wide, and the theories advanced for parliamentary action and inaction are so extraordinary, that the extract - which I have not noted - could, I am afraid, be paralleled with others containing statements equally impossible of proof, or of belief on the part of those associated with Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- There is no delay occasioned by any action or inaction on the part of the Government with respect to this appointment, but correspondence is still proceeding. I am expecting reports, which are not yet to hand, in connexion with the recent dismissal and its consequences. When that correspondence discloses fully the course of conduct which has been pursued by all concerned, and the cross charges have been disposed of, the Government will be prepared to make an appointment ; and if they think it necessary to call for applications they will do so. Last night I did not answer, as intended, the question of the honorable member for North Sydney. I find that the letter signed by myself, from the Department, with reference to land transactions, did not reach Papua until after the second case had been dealt with. </para>

                            <para>- I endeavoured to explain last night that, although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline> Smith himself, says that he feels now he made a mistake, it is perfectly clear that the mistake is one which implies no reflection on him, having regard to the special circumstances lately obtaining in Papua. The abundance of land, the absence . of applicants, and the desire of the Government that areas should be taken up, are circumstances which, I think, relieve Mr. Staniforth Smith from responsibility. But the honorable member made a reference to the Acting Administrator&#39;s restrictions on officers ; and that reference is slightly erroneous. Speaking from memory yesterday, I erred in one or  two respects in answering questions put to me. In the published papers, now, as then, before us, it is shown that the statement made by the Acting Administrator at the Executive Council was not a mere <inline font-style="italic">obiter dictum</inline> of his own, but, on the contrary, it declared what was already, so to speak, the law in Papua. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drummond&#39;s</inline> own statement is as follows - </para>

They gave him the benefit of the doubt, although two members of the Council considered the case proved. It was not, therefore, the attempt to secure priority which decided the majority against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drummond. Mr. Campbell,</inline> who cast the deciding vote in both cases, points out in his summing up that the interests in the second application were precisely the same as those in the first; that the land applied for in the second was precisely that sought in the first, and that, in the circumstances, he was compelled to say that in making a second application, after being informed that the first was illegal, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drummond</inline> was guilty of an attempt to evade the restrictions imposed by the regulations. </para>

                        <para>The information supplied shows it was recognised as impossible to provide the necessary funds from the annual revenue, and that it was made very clear to the Department that unless money could be borrowed these necessary works could not be undertaken, as it could not then be made available out of revenue. The telegraph and telephone systems are, with certain exceptions, little better, so far as construction is concerned, than when they were taken over. </para>

I see no possibility of their being able to pay the fine, and I am led to put this question because I know that if any person who has paid his fare by sea to Hong Kong on arrival there becomes a charge upon the rates he is returned to his native country at the expense of the owners of the vessel by which he arrived. </para>

Further,I wish to know whether the Committee has given due consideration to the fact that Port Melbourne, which has a pier capable of accommodating any of the visiting vessels, is a preferable landing place? </para>

                    <para>. - Last night the question raised in connexion with this item was whether the words which the Senate desired to be eliminated ought to be excised or not. It seems to me that the question involved is whether  5  ounces per square yard is a fair weight to prescribe in the case of the materials specified. During the debate it was suggested that the weight should be increased from5 ounces to 8 ounces per square yard&#34;. That would be a very unwise course to adopt. It was also suggested by the honorable member for Bendigo that the whole item should be struck out. I desired that course to be adopted, but seeing that this matter was brought forward in the first instance by the honorable member for Melbourne, who was absent from the House last night on account of illness, I moved that progress should be reported, with a view to affording him an opportunity of being present to-day. I desired that he should be in a position to make any statement to the Committee that he chose in regard to this matter. </para>

If the weight had been increased it would have been a serious matter for the Australian worsted and tweed manufacturers, as it would have allowed the tropical tweeds to have come in at a very low duty.  </para>

                    <para>Referring to my letter of the 14th inst. <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> the alteration made in the Senate omitting Women&#39;s and Children&#39;s Dress Goods in item 123B, I desire to say that I was only referring to tweeds when I said that the omission of the words would not act prejudicially against the woollen manufacturers, the weight not having been increased. If, of course, there is any fear of light weight flannels being classed under the item referred to, there is distinct objection on the part of the woollen manufacturers to omitting the words &#34; Women&#39;s and Children&#39;s Dress Goods,&#34; because flannels are manufactured in Australia much lighter than  5  ozs. per square yard. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I have here, and offer for the inspection of honorable members, samples of Australian flannel, which are very good indeed. The request of the Senate was carried by only one vote, and I have since spoken to two senators who voted for it because they thought that no distinction should be made between men&#39;s and women&#39;s apparel. However, they now see the reason for the distinction, and if the matter comes before the Senate again, will vote on the other side. Most of these materials are made in Germany, Belgium, or France, and, although the United States of America have the most scientific Tariff in the world, with duties on these light fabrics running from 60 per cent, upwards, their manufacturers cannot compete with the countries I have named. Women folk will follow fashion. It is not a question of hundreds, but of thousands of designs when Dame Fashion nods her head. . On a former occasion, I tried to obtain a good definition of &#34; flan-&#34; nel,&#34; and found that, according to a variety of authorities, from the <inline font-style="italic">British Encyclopaedia</inline> down to the latest standard . dictionary, the term comprises any woollen material loosely woven, and will include baize, blankets, and tweeds. That, however, is not the ordinary use of the word, and any person wishing to buy a yard of flannel would not expect to be given any of the brightly -coloured materials which I have in my left hand. They would expect to get material such as I hold in my right hand. Of course, either material could be used for underwear, though the patterns which I showed first are rather . startling, even for pyjamas; those which any one would recognise as flannels are much more suitable, and certainly cheaper, the prices running from 63/4d. to 81/2d. It is sometimes said that only the well-to-do buy fine materials ; but a promenade on the banks of the Yarra any Sunday afternoon will show that the daughters of the workers wear good materials, similar to the samples I have here. I know every capital in the world, except St. Petersburg and Constantinople, and have observed that the work women of Australia are as well dressed as is the female population of any other country. In Bond-street, Oxford-street, and, perhaps, the Strand, London, one may see better-dressed women ; but in no other street of the world&#39;s metropolis will you find the women generally as well dressed as those to be seen in George and Pitt streets, Sydney, or in Collins-street, Melbourne. It is absolutely necessary to retain the words &#34; women&#39;s and children&#39;s &#34;dress goods.&#34; Australian manufacturers make very fine tweeds, of which these I produce are splendid samples. They belong to the honorable member for Bendigo ; but I have his permission to use them. The lighter tweeds are for wear in the northern parts of the Commonwealth, where the sun is stronger than here. There is no reason why ladies should not wear any kind of tweed worn by men if they dress in tailor-made costumes. It may be said that these tweeds could be used for underwear. But no one who was not silly would so use them, seeing that splendid flannel, which serves much better, can be obtained for one-third the cost.I am sure that, if the Committee refuses to make the requested amendment, the Senate will admit that we are right, and will not press its request. </para>

                <para>As the honorable member for Melbourne is present to-day, it cannot be said, as it was said last night, that we are taking an unfair advantage of him. The provision inserted on his motion is quite unworkable. How can the Customs officers follow goods, once they have been passed through the Customs House, to see to what use they are put? If the words are left in, material will be imported as for the use of women and children, and used for other purposes. Goods cannot be defined for Customs purposes as for children&#39;s, women&#39;s, or men&#39;s wear. </para>

                        <para>-  Is the motion of the honorable member for Bass in order? We are now considering requests for amendments. There is no trace of any amendment, when an item is entirely obliterated, as the honorable member proposes. According to your ruling, sir, there may be a variation or omission of the words, or an omission or variation of the duties ; but to sweep away the whole item is, I submit, beyond our power. </para>

                        <para>-  In addition to the argument used by the honorable member for Parramatta, I would point out that this duty has been carried by both Houses, and the proposal, if adopted, would prevent a validation of the collection of the duties. This, in my opinion; clearly points to the proposal of the honorable member for Bass as out of order. </para>

                    <para>- I suggest to the honorable member for Bass that he, in the first place, should confine his proposal to the end of the wording of the item. I have no special rule to guide me in this procedure. I may point out, however, that we first sent the Tariff to the Senate, from which it was returned with requested amendments. To some of those amendments this Committee could not agree, while if made certain other amendments. The Senate have again returned the Tariff with further requested amendments ; and, under the circumstances, as the Houses apparently disagree, I think that the honorable member for Bass would be quite in order in moving that the whole item be omitted. </para>

                    <para>.- The proposal of the honorable member for Bass, is, I think, entitled to very serious consideration. If it were necessary to validate the collection of the duties at the reduced rate, that could be done by adding the words &#34;up to and including the  27th  May.&#34; Had the  Chairman  ruled that the proposal of the honorable member for Bass was out of order, I should have been prepared to move an amendment validating the collection of the duties up to date, and, providing that subsequently all these goods should be subject to one common duty. </para>

                        <para>- I think that, on calm reflection, the Committee ought to reverse their previous decision. With the best of intentions, the honorable member for Melbourne submitted this item in its amended form.  His  idea is to benefit the poorer classes ; but I believe that, in actual practice, the honorable member&#39;s generous desires will not be realized. These lighter tweeds are really superior tweeds, and I fancy they will be admitted at the reduced duty&#39;, mainly to the benefit of persons of means. </para>

                        <para>- Preferably, they would like the item struck out ; but, of course, they do not desire to assume an attitude which might endanger the duties of 30 and 25 per cent. If the item were struck out, that course would be of great advantage and benefit, but as it stands, it will, as I say, mar the general scheme . of duties, and open the door to the admission of large quantities of goods, which, I am sure, the honorable member for Melbourne does not desire to see admitted at the lower rates. I have been assured by manufacturers that it will be impossible to limit the operation of the item as amended to women&#39;s and children&#39;s piece goods of the weight prescribed. I have here a number of samples of 5-oz. tweeds. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether they come from the United Kingdom or from France, but they are all suitable for men&#39;s clothes as well as for women&#39;s and children&#39;s clothes. If an importer desired to pass an entry for such goods, as for the use of women and children, the Customs officer would be obliged to admit them, though there is no doubt they could just as easily be used in making men&#39;s clothes. In &#39;this way the revenue might suffer, and Australian manufacturers would be discouraged from entering on the manufacture of these light woollen goods, which may in course of time be produced here. Under the circumstances I think we ought to reconsider the matter, and place all woollen goods under one common rate of duty. There could then be no disputes at the Customs House, the revenue could not be defrauded, and Australian manufacturers would have a fair field in the production of all classes of woollen goods. </para>

                        <para>- But the object of the Tariff is to introduce a developmental policy. We do not impose high duties merely for the purpose of assisting in the production of low-grade tweeds, but also with the object of encouraging the manufacture of superior tweeds. How can &#39; we expect manufacturers to launch out in such a direction if these superior tweeds are admitted at a lower rate of duty ? The item as it stands at present is a blot on the Tariff, and before long we may have another agitation for a revision. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to see this Tariff last for ten or twenty years to come, and the less satisfactory our work now the greater the possibility of agitation. Probably I feel more interested in, and anxious about, the development of the woollen industry than of any other industry within -the four corners of the Tariff. It is essentially an Australian industry, and ought to be established on a secure and enduring foundation, such as we cannot expect if the item be left as at present. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Bendigo was not present when I read communication&#39;s, including one from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grainger,</inline> the manager of one of the woollen mills in Ballarat. That gentleman distinctly said that he did not desire the Senate&#39;s amendment - that he desired the words &#34;women&#39;s and children&#39;s &#34; inserted, or the item struck out. When the Senate removed the words &#34;women&#39;s and children&#39;s dress goods&#34; I took the precaution to write to the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures to ascertain what difference the amendment would make. In reply, I received the two letters which I have already read. I know of no one who is better able than is the honorable member for Bendigo to frame a further modification, to overcome the difficulty. If he would propose the insertion of such words as . &#34; not being tweeds,&#34; I think that the position would be met. The samples of tweed exhibited by the honorable member for Bendigo are very fine, and I thought that they were of Australian manufacture. No one will deny that they are suitable for a. woman&#39;s garb just as serge is used for tailor-made gowns. They are altogether different from the samples that I have produced. These light goods are used as dress materials by many women workers. If the honorable member for Maranoa has any misgivings on that point I am prepared to take him to the Yarra Bank on any Sunday afternoon he pleases, and to show him there scores of working women so attired. </para>

                    <para>.- Apparently the honorable member for Bass desires to strike out the item as it stands, and at the same time to validate the collections of duty already made under it. If the item were struck out these goods would be dutiable at the higher rates of  30  per cent, and  25  per cent. The honorable member may desire them . to be dutiable at those rates, but in the matter of apparel and food supplies, I have throughout been voting for the lowest possible duties, believing that if there is to be any discrimination we should move in. that direction. Apparently the honorable member for Melbourne desires that these goods which must be imported,, and cannot be manufactured here, shall be dutiable at the lowest possible rates; </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member desires that goods which cannot be manufactured here shall be dutiable at very low rates, but I think that he had still another object in view in proposing the insertion of the words, . &#34; not weighing over  5  ounces per square yard.&#34;  His  original desire in moving that amendment was that the poorer classes should . have an opportunity to obtain at low prices fancy dress materials of this description. I have reason to believe, however, that his desire t&#39;o specially benefit the poorer section of the community will not be effected by his proposal. In the winter the dress materials worn by rich and poor alike all weigh more than  5  ounces to the square yard, so that whether he desires it or not, the poor as well as the rich will have to pay upon such goods duties of  30  per cent, and  25  per cent., since they come under the item &#39;&#34; piece goods n.e.i.&#34; Under that item rich and poor alike will be penalized. In the summer, however, these goods of light texture, which are made principally in France, are used by women in all classes of society, and therefore the proposal &#39; to impose lower duties only in respect of materials of a certain weight will not specially benefit working women. </para>

                        <para>- As the honorable and learned member for Bendigo has pointed out, when different rates of duty are imposed on goods of the same &#39;class, trouble constantly arises between the importers and the Customs officials, and the revenue will probably be defeated. It is the consumer, and not the importer, who has to pay the duty. Under the honorable member&#39;s proposal, the Customs&#39; House officials would be compelled to open- every bale or case of goods imported to determine whether or not they contained only materials coming within this item. I should like all piece goods to be dutiable at 15 per cent, and 10 per cent., instead of at the higher rates provided. Such an amendment would be consistent with our treatment of other industries. It is strange that the woollen industry should have been singled out for special treatment. I do not desire to eliminate this item so as to bring the goods to which it relates under a higher scale of duties, and if I cannot obtain anything better I shall vote, in the interests of the public, for the proposal that women&#39;s and children&#39;s dress goods, not weighing over 5 ounces per square yard, shall be dutiable at 15 per cent, and 10 per cent. That would be- preferable to the omission of the whole item, which would cause these goods to become dutiable at higher rates under another item. I should prefer to run the risk of importers being inconvenienced and the revenue being defeated rather than penalize&#34; the general public. The materials covered by this item are worn all over me Commonwealth. In the more tropical parts of the continent these goods, which are described as summer wear, are practically worn all the year round. Failing any better solution of the difficulty, I shall vote for the item as it stands, and oppose its omission. I was hopeful, however, that the ingenuity, of those experienced in these matters would have devised a modification that would enable us to make certain piece goods dutiable at a very low rate. </para>

                    <para>.- When the item of piece goods was originally before us, duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, were imposed, and had- it not been for the action of the honorable member for Melbourne dress materials coming under the item which we are now considering would have been dutiable at those rates. The honorable member represented, however, that they could not be made here, and that a reduction of duty in their case would be in the interests of the poorer classes of the community. The alteration was accordingly made. I thought at the time that it was a mistake, and that belief was subsequently confirmed . when I visited one of the large softgoods houses in Melbourne, and heard men there scoffing at the suggestion that this item would be in the interests of the poorer classes. They pointed out, as the honorable and learned member for Bendigo has pointed out to-day, that it permits the more expensive goods to come in at a low rate of duty. Another consideration is that this item will not be beneficial even to British manufacturers. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">It will be an advantage to the Continental manufacturer, and, as it stands, is utterly indefensible. It was made a good deal worse by the last amendment including in it dress flannels. I see no reason why this class of woollen goods should not be dutiable at the same rates as other woollens; and I shall strongly support either the striking out of the item altogether or the modification proposed by the honorable member for Bass. </para>

If any one will be benefited under this item, it is the residents of those parts of the Commonwealth. Every other woman whom one meets in any town in Northern Queensland is certainly not wearing a dress made of material costing 3s. 6d. per yard&#39;. </para>

Like the honorable member for Dalley, I have had to put up an umbrella to keep out of the wet. I am sure that the honorable member for Melbourne&#39;s proposal will not have the effect that he desires. The honorable member for Bendigo has very properly pointed out that the materials exhibited by the honorable member for Melbourne, would - under the latter&#39;s proposal - be introduced as women&#39;s and children&#39;s goods. The same remark is equally applicable to the serge which I am wearing. I am sure that neither the Committee nor the honorable member for Melbourne desire that these materials shall be imported at a low rate of duty under the guise of women&#39;s and children&#39;s goods, and thus, come into competition with our woollen goods. I trust that the item will be struck out. </para>

                    <para>.- In reply to the remarks of the honorable member for Maranoa and the honorable member for Gippsland, I wish to say that if I were asked to give a definition of a protectionist I would say &#34; He is a man who believes&#39; in absolute free-trade for what cannot be manufactured in Australia, and in absolute protection for what can be made in Australia.&#34; No honorable member has yet contended that the goods which I have exhibited in this chamber can be made within the Commonwealth.  As a matter of fact, they cannot be manufactured in America, which has the most scientific Tariff in the world. I am indebted to the honorable member for Bendigo for a publication which shows that they cannot be manufactured in Canada. The <inline font-style="italic">Textile Manufacturers&#39; Journal</inline> of the nth April last contains the following reference in this connexion - </para>

                <para class="block">Canada and the Tariff. </para>
                <para>According to a recognised Canadian manufacturing authority, 95 per cent, of these woollens - men&#39;s wear and dress goods - comes from abroad, principally from England; 110 woollen mills have failed or liquidated under the present policy, unable to meet the competition of imported merchandise, and that to-day there are only five mills in the entire country, of a size to  command  consideration, which are eking out a precarious existence, whose proprietors by the most rigid economy are able to operate on short time by taking advantage of the most up-to-date methods and by ability to make the most of any demand for new fabrics which may arise. . . . Many Canadian mills have been driven to the wall during the last five years. One is led to (lie inevitable conclusion that it is because of the preferential of from 25 to 30 per cent, which applies to all goods imported from Great Britain, and which puts the Canadian manufacturer into direct competition with the pauper labour of the English textile centres) while Canada is made the dumping ground of the cheap trash in which British manufacturers have such an advantage through their ability to manipulate successfully with cheap raw material and cheap labour. </para>
                <para class="block">The materials to which I have directed the attention of honorable members cannot be manufactured in Australia unless it be by a Commonwealth workshop. I ask the honorable member for Maranoa to say which of those materials cost 3s. 6d. per yard ? </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact their prices range from is. 3d. to 2s. 6d. per yard. &#39; Would the honorable member debar the wife of a working man from purchasing material worth&#39; 7s. 6d. per yard if she desired to do so ? As a matter of fact, many of the wives of the workers wear silk fabrics. Why should they not do so ? No honorable member can declare that a particular fabric will be made into a garment which will be worn by a lady and not by a workwoman. Some of the highest ladies in the land dress in the simplest of garments. It is related that the late Queen Victoria once wore a dress which cost less than 7s. 6d. How can any honorable member urge that these materials will be used exclusively by one class? If I agreed-  10  increase the weight of the fabrics specified in this item, they would come into competition with our tweeds. I hope that the Committee will not agree to strike out the item. </para>

                    <para>. - In reply to the remarks of the honorable member for Melbourne I wish to say that I know some goods which can be manufactured in Australia, but which have been placed upon the free list. Does the honorable member think for a moment that the working women of the Commonwealth desire to wear goods made by sweated labour abroad? That is what his argument amounts to. </para>

                        <para>- If we impose a duty upon  them, they will not be imported. It is a fact that goods of this description - but of better quality - are already being made in the Commonwealth. Certainly they would be made here under a policy of new protection. The honorable member, however, desires that inferior goods - -rag. - shall be admitted free. Even- the  deputy  leader of the Opposition will not indorse that proposition. He is. not in favour of sweating. &#39; Yet the honorable member for Melbourne has declared that if we impose a duty upon these fabrics it will amount to a tax upon the working women of Australia, who will wear dresses made from them. I say : &#34; Let them wear garments composed of materials made in Australia.&#34; It is true that some of the shoddy exhibited by the honorable member cannot be made locally, and I hope that the time will never come when it will be made here. </para>

When the matter was first brought forward bv the honorable member for Melbourne my impression was that materials similar to those exhibited by him were not likely to Le manufactured in the Commonwealth, but I now understand that they are made at Parramatta, at Sydney, and, I think, in Tasmania. </para>

                    <para>.- The only suggestion I can make is to insert the words &#34; not including tweeds or sergerettes,&#34; though I think it would be better to let the further consideration of the item stand over until the officers of the Customs Department have had an opportunity to draft a suitable provision. It is difficult for laymen to deal with a question like this; but there must be some way of differentiating between dress materials and tweeds and sergerettes. </para>

In my opinion, the honorable member for Melbourne might let well alone. The Senate may not agree to the retention of the words &#34; women&#39;s and children&#39;s dress goods,&#34; and, therefore, may oppose a proposal equivalent to the striking out of the item, so that the best way to meet it might be to insist on our original proposition. But rather than risk the chance &#39; of something being done which we do not desire, I shall vote for the former alternative. </para>

                    <para>.- Is the Treasurer in a position to afford any information as to the scope of the proposed by-law? I can foresee a condition of affairs in which the Customs Department might prohibit certain engines which would ultimately, if not directly, be used for driving electric plants or pumps. . It is not sufficient for the Treasurer to say that he desires to have the power to make by-laws, without giving us some indication of the &#39; scope of the by-laws he contemplates. When we deliberately stipulated that these must be steam engines, we took a reasonable precaution, but if by-laws are contemplated we ought to have some further explanation. </para>

                    <para>. - I may here explain that items 160 and 162 are to a certain extent associated, and some information I intended to give when the latter was under consideration, I may as well give now. The high-speed reciprocating engine is known commercially as a steam engine. After the Senate had made the amendment, it was found that attempts might be made bv importers of gas and oil engines to -import, as high-speed reciprocating engines, &#39; certain gas and oil engines, which- are made for direct coupling with generators, and which, at a slower speed, fill the place of high-speed steam engines. There is no difference between the manufacture of high-speed gas or oil engines, and medium or low-speed gas or oil engines, while there is a vast difference between the manufacture of a high-speed steam engine, and any other kind of steam engine. High-speed oil engines are not made&#39; here, except in very small sizes, and the duty on them is 20 per cent. ; but there is no reason whv any size should not be made when the demand increases. At the present moment what are termed high-speed engines are made by only three or four firms in the world. This information is given to me by the Comptroller of Customs. It is not desired that steam engines should be imported in a way not intended by Parliament, and, therefore, the provision for. departmental by-laws is made. </para>

                    <para>.- We have made two or three mistakes in respect of this item. In the first place, we erred in specifying the purposes for which high-speed reciprocating engines imported under it may be used. It should be left to the importers to determine to what use such engines shall be put. Whv should a man who requires an engine for pumping purposes be able to obtain it at a lower rate of duty than is imposed on an engine required for supplying motive power to a sawmill or a blower? </para>

                        <para>- I did not. The honorable member on referring to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will find that I have all through taken up the ground that I how occupy. I hold that it is not right to differentiate between one industry and another. The introduction of the word &#39; &#39; steam &#39; &#39; limiting this paragraph to high-speed reciprocating engines driven bv steam, has led to endless trouble. I do not know whether or not the Ministry are aware of it, but suction gas engines are being imported, and are working at a very high speed in connexion not only with mining, but with other industries. A very large high-speed suction gas engine plant has been put in position on the St. George mine at Mount Magnet, and . honorable, members have only to go as far as the Murray Bridge to see a high-speed gas producer running a flour mill. Another engine of the same- description may be seen at work in Bourke-street, near Spencer-street. </para>

                        <para>- I appeal to honorable members to say why we should limit paragraph a to high-speed reciprocating &#34;steam&#34; engines. By doing so, we are treating unjustly those who require high-speed reciprocating engines that are driven by gas or oil. Suction gas engines are being used on the Murchison, Western Australia, where fuel supplies have practically been cut out. They are being applied there to the running of State and privately-owned batteries, and mine-owners are also introducing- them for use in connexion with mining plants. I am agreeable to the retention of the words &#34; subject to departmental by-laws,&#34; but I propose as a modification - </para>

                    <para>.- I think that we made a mistake in limiting paragraph a to high-speed reciprocating engines driven by steam. We are gradually obtaining more information on these complicated questions, and I have learned that we certainly made an error in imposing the limitation referred to inasmuch as high-speed oil and gas engines are also largely used. Owing to the reduced rates ruling for metals, mining companies all over Australia must effect economies if they are to carry , on or make any profits. They are confronted with a low range of prices for metals, and high expenses. The cost of labour was never higher than it is to-day, and liquid fuel is now being largely used in place of wood. Although on the last occasion that this item was before us we inserted the word &#34; steam,&#34; I think that we shall be justified in re-considering our decision, and doing away with that limitation. </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen any made here, although I have had a good deal to&#39; do with engines and machinery of this kind. If it is desirable to allow high-speed reciprocating steam-engines to come in at &#39;this rate, it is equally desirable to admit high-speed gas and oil engines under the same provision. Unlike the honorable member for Fremantle, I object to the words &#34; subject to departmental by-laws &#34; appearing in this request. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is now changing his ground. He apparently wishes to prevent gas engines and oil engines from being manufactured locally. I am surprised at the shortness of memory exhibited by some honorable members, who ask for special concessions, and, after obtaining them, evidence that they have no sense of gratitude. I appeal to the Committee not to agree to the proposal of the honorable member for Fremantle, and thus inflict a blow upon the engineering industry by subjecting our manufacturers to a competition to which they ought not to be subjected. Upon a simple request for the insertion of a few words in an item we are asked to make a sweeping change in the Tariff - a change in the fiscal policy of the Commonwealth which this Committee has repeatedly affirmed. </para>

                    <para>.- Whatever real strength existed in the agitation for a revision of the first Commonwealth Tariff arose from the way in which the engineering industry had been treated under that Tariff. It seems to me that the conditions that we are imposing upon the industry under this Tariff are equally harsh. If there is an industry in the Commonwealth which is worth building up, it is this one. Yet a constant desire is exhibited to whittle down the protection accorded to it. It is urged as a reason why we should not extend to it increased protection, that at present we do not make certain machinery here. But surely our desire is to establish a bigger industry than that which we now possess. </para>

                        <para>- That argument is typical of honorable members representing Western Australia. In the first place, they propose that high-speed reciprocating engines shall be admitted free, and, having obtained that concession, they immediately exclaim, &#34; Why should we stop at steam-engines? Why should not gas and oil engines be included in the same category ?&#34; The fact is that the Committee ought not to have given way to them in respect of steam-engines. If we do not intend to bring about another revision of the Tariff at an early date, we must treat the engineering trade fairly, lt cannot be contended that there is any difficulty in making gas and oil engines within the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Is the timber industry an engineering trade? No Tariff can be framed so scientifically as to afford protection to everything which may possibly be produced in the country. We have to gauge probabilities, and to look at the relative importance of the industries to be built up. From that stand-point the engineering industry is a most important one. I hope that those who believe in the principle of protection will, adhere to this item, and not throw open the whole of the engineering industry to the competition of the world. </para>

                <para class="block">Kingdom respectively, other engines which are worked by gas and oil . ought to be admitted on the same terms. In some parts of Australia wood is very scarce, and becoming scarcer, and in such places gas and oil engines are most valuable. Therefore some good reason should be advanced for this proposal to treat them differently from steam-engines. It may be said that high-speed reciprocating steam-engines are not made in the Commonwealth, and therefore should not be dutiable at any but a very low rate. </para>

                        <para>- Are high-speed gas or oil reciprocating engines made in Australia? If so, and their manufacturers can be protected without taxing too highly the industries which use them, some protection might reasonably be given ; but if not, why should these engines be treated differently from steam-engines? I agree with the honorable member for Fremantle that the use to which engines may be put is not a matter with which we should concern ourselves. It is unreasonable to impose the condition that, to come in at a low rate, engines must be directly coupled to electric generators or to pumps. Those who import engines should be allowed to use them as they may think best. I appeal to the Committee not to penalize the great mining industry merely to encourage persons to enter into a business in which they have not yet seen fit to engage. I hope that the word &#34; steam &#34; will be struck out. </para>

                        <para>-  I am sorry to have to raise a point of order, especially -in view of the fact that I quite agree wilh the proposal made by the Treasurer. But  1  am afraid we are in some danger of neglecting our Standing Orders, and thereby neglecting to maintain our rights ; and I think the occasion sufficiently important to raise the question. If we do not respect our own Standing Orders, and maintain the principles which are therein laid down, we may be sure that another place, while maintaining its privileges and rights, will be utterly regardless of ours. : </para>

                        <para>-  On a previous item, I raised a similar point of order, and the  Chairman,  while he could not agree with its validity, said that there were cases - in which my point of order would be perfectly justified ; and this, I think, is one of the cases. . As I have said, I agree with the proposal of the Minister; but I  raise this question on higher grounds. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives have agreed to this item&#34;; the only modification made by this Committee was the formal one fixing the date, and that was accepted by the Senate. Now,&#39; however,&#39; the Senate proposes to add the words &#34; including accessories for same,&#34; which, in my opinion, is a new proposal altogether. </para>

                <para>In 1678, it was stated by the Commons at a Conference, &#34; That it is contrary to the constant method and proceedings in Parliament, to strike out anything in a Bill which hath been fully agreed and passed by both Houses &#34; ; and in allowing consequential amendments, either in the body of the Bill, or in the amendments, the spirit of this rule is still maintained. So binding, indeed, has it been held, that in 1850, a serious oversight, as to the commencement of the Act, having been discovered in the Pirates&#39; Head Money Bill, before the Lords&#39; amendments had been agreed to, no attempt was made to correct it by way of amendment, but a separate Act was passed for <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> purpose. </para>

                        <para>-  I support the point of order raised by the honorable member for North Sydney. The Senate inserted the new paragraph  aa,  and to that we agreed. We agreed to the request subject to the modification &#34; To take effect on and after 13th December, 1907.&#34; In other words, we named the date on and after which these saws And wheels should be free. The Senate now proposes, not a modification of that made by us, but something entirely new. It is attempting to go behind what has been agreed to by both Houses. &#39; I submit that the stage at which it could suggest the insertion of an entirely new provision has passed. No honorable member of this House would be allowed to move such an addition as that which the Senate  has requested. We. are two stages beyond the point at which it could be done. This request comes within the same category as the amendment proposed by me in regard . to salt arid gypsum bags, which you, sir, ruled out of order. The actual amendment desired to be made is not in itself of great importance, but there is a principle involved, and the honorable member for North Sydney has put forward a contention that is perfectly sound. </para>

                        <para>-  It is unnecessary for me to say that an honorable member is entitled to raise a point of order at any time he pleases to do so, but in this connexion I would remind the Committee of what took place in the House yesterday when the honorable member for Flinders asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to give his ruling on an important question. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> while intimating that he was always willing to determine any point of order submitted to him, suggested that the honorable member should not at that stage press for a ruling. Acting on that suggestion, the honorable member withdrew his request for a ruling, because it was thought that the point raised might lead to a conflict between the two Houses, which was undesirable at the present time. It&#39; was pointed out, however, by the Prime Minister and others, that there must come a time when the respective powers of each House will have to be determined, but it was thought unwise that a ruling should be given which might possibly hang up for an indefinite time the settlement of a momentous question. </para>

When we are called upon to deal with any question involving the rights of this House I shall not be found shirking my responsibility ; but the consideration that I wish to suggest to the Committee is whether it is beyond the power of the Senate to suggest or of this House to insert, say, a definition to clear up a point that may require elucidation. </para>

                        <para>-  I do not think that there is any chance of serious complication arising in connexion with a matter so insignificant as this. To suggest that the two Houses could get into difficulties over a question of this sort, is, to my mind, extremely ridiculous. It is equally ridiculous for an honorable member to appeal to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> to consider questions of diplomacy or strategy in connexion with a point of order arising under the </para>

                <para class="block">Standing Orders. It is impossible for you,  6ir,  to oblige the Treasurer, or any other honorable member, by doing so. The&#39; point is a simple one,&#39; and it is a mistake to describe it as a matter affecting the privileges of this House, or those of another place, because it relates really to a mutual privilege. When the two Houses have agreed on any one point arising during, the consideration of a Bill, that point is settled, so far as that Bill is concerned, and cannot be re-opened on that Bill by either House. The honorable member for North Sydney may be said to be standing up for the rights of another place, as well as for those of this House, because on some other occasion we might seek to abuse the privileges of another place by endeavouring to do that which the Senate is now doing. The Bill, as it left this House, provided for log band saws being . dutiable at a certain rate.. A suggestion,, not an amendment, was made by the Senate, that they should be free. </para>

                        <para>-  I call it a suggestion. We adopted that suggestion: Inasmuch as the duty on these saws continued under the resolution of this Committee, and was not suspended by the suggestion of the Senate, we really did not modify the Senate&#39;s suggestion by adding words naming the date on and after which they should be free. The effect of that addition was really to carry out the suggestion, since this House could alone fix the date on and after which the articles should be free. The duty was not affected by the Senate making a suggestion; it was only when we fixed the date on and after which the item  should be free, that it was affected. I repeat that that . was not a modification ; it was the only way in which the Senate&#39;s suggestion could be carried out. Unless the date had been added by us, the duty would have continued indefinitely. The addition of the words relating to the date was the one thing necessary to give effect to the Senate&#39;s suggestion. It was our undoubted right to fix the date, and that - being so, we practically sent back the Bill to the Senate, with the message &#34; suggestion agreed to.&#34; The Senate now says to us, iri effect, &#34; We are obliged to you for agreeing to our suggestion, but we will accept the date - the addition of words which really give effect to our request - only on condition that you insert words bringing other articles under this item.&#34; </para>

                        <para>-  I hope, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that the honorable member for North Sydney will not withdraw his request for your ruling. The Treasurer has referred to my action yesterday in another matter, as a precedent for asking the honorable member to withdraw the point of order he has raised. I would remind the Committee that the circumstances are entirely different. The point that I raised yesterday involved a very grave constitutional question, that might have led, and may in the future lead, to possibilities of greatest difficulty between the two Houses. It was obvious that it was the desire of the House that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Speaker</inline> should have a further opportunity to consider that very momentous point. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> himself desired it, and the ruling was not given. But the point now before us is in a different category. I should have thought, after hearing the honorable member for North Sydney, that it was too clear for argument. The Constitution confers on the House of Representatives alone the power to make a modification. It does not give any power to the Senate to make a modification, or to make a modification of a&#39; modification made by this House. Its sole power is to accept or reject. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Otherwise, when, we send back this&#39; schedule &#39;to the Senate, it may request further modifications in the various items. Consequently, it is absolutely necessary that at some time or other we should assert ourselves in regard to our privileges. The honorable member, for North Sydney is merely attempting to preserve those privileges in raising this .question. </para>

But I wish to know . whether these honorable members intend to vote in the direction which their utterances indicate? </para>

                        <para>- I think that the point raised by the honorable member for North Sydney is a good one, which ought to be sustained. . It is founded upon the Standing Orders, which clearly lay down that when a proposition has- been agreed to by both Houses, it cannot afterwards be qualified, or altered in any shape or form. ;The point raised ought, therefore, to be decided in favour of the honorable member&#39;s contention upon the Standing Orders alone, altogether apart from the  constitutional  question of whether the Senate can renew or press a request. &#39; That point has been reserved for&#39; decision,&#39; and upon it I should not like to express a final opinion  now. T&#39;n the present instance, however, this Committee has agreed to the request preferred by the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Yet we are now asked to make&#39; a substantial addition to that request. . By the  insertion of the word . &#34; accessories &#34; we may include shafting and belting and extend the area of the original request. I contend that, having adopted the request of the Senate, that branch of the Legislature has no right to qualify it or to alter it in any way. That is a proposition, which we can well lay down, and upon which we can insist. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that our position under the Constitution is perfectly clear. A request was preferred by another place which we accepted. We returned that request to the Senate, which has made an addendum to it. Obviously, our reply should be that under the Standing Orders it . is not competent for us to entertain that addendum. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad that the honorable member for North Sydney has brought this matter forward, and I indorse every word that he has uttered in respect of it. I believe, sir, that you have already made up your mind as to the way in .which you will rule. . Indeed, a  Chairman  of Committees like yourself, and a  Speaker  like our own, anticipate these  questions and frame their rulings upon them before they are sought. My only regret is that a ruling upon this matter was not given earlier, as I believe that you will support the contention of the honorable member for North Sydney. </para>

                    <para>- Ever since the initiation of the Tariff discussion in Committee, and especially since we have been considering requests from the Senate, I have ruled against any course by honorable members&#39; which would have the effect of practically re-opening the Tariff. I have endeavoured to confine them to the particular item under consideration, and thus to prevent the unlimited discussion which might otherwise follow. One instance in this connexion has already been mentioned by the honorable member for Boothby - I refer to the. occasion when the duty upon salt  bags  was under consideration. The modification which we inserted in this instance was merely for departmental purposes, and not with a view to interfering&#39; with the item at all. Under the circumstances, it certainly appears to me that the Committee have already decided this particular item. If I were to accept the further modification of the item by the Senate I could not refuse to entertain any amendment which an honorable member might desire to submit in. respect of other items. Thus finality would become impossible. Under the circumstances I rule that the requested modification is not in order. </para>

That would be an unfortunate mistake to make. My suggestion is that we return the Bill to&#39; the Senate with this particular date added, and with an explanation inserted in the accompanying message, to the effect that under the Standing Orders we were not able to consider the further modification requested bv it. </para>

                    <para>.- There is not much in dispute in connexion with this particular item. It is merely a question of whether we shall maintain the preference which we extended to the Mother Country. I believe that we. made a mistake in making aluminium articles for household use free, because since we arrived at that decision, I have ascertained that complete plants for the manufacture of these aluminium goods are already in Australia, and that preparations are being made to embark upon the industry. Exactly the same plant is required for manufacturing these articles that is required for enamelling household ware. </para>

                        <para>-  We know nothing of conditions. The Senate&#39;s proposal is tantamount to a new request. It asked that gas meters be made dutiable at 25 and 20 per cent., and that request not having been complied with, it now says, &#34;We shall not press the request if you will agree to a totally different, suggestion.&#34; </para>

                        <para>-  The fact that parts of gas meters go to make up whole gas meters does not affect the consideration whether the Senate&#39;s proposal does not involve a complete departure. At any rate, a new amendment . is requested. I admit that my first impression, that the case was covered by your ruling, was not correct ; nor is the point the same as that debated at length before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> yesterdav, as to the right of the Senate to press its requests. In my view, this is not a request previously made, but a modification. . </para>

                        <para>-  I think that the ruling of the  Chairman  does not apply in this instance, the case being different. The Senate has a constitutional right to request amendments several times in succession in regard to&#39; any particular item,, and- has, therefore, the right to modify, and again modify, requested amendments, with a view to arriving at a harmonious understanding with the House of Representatives. </para>

                        <para>-  In the first instance, the Senate asked that the duty on gas meters be&#39; made 25 and 20 per cent. They now ask, as a modification of that proposal, that the original rates be applied to gas-meter parts not fitted together or joined in any way. That is not a new proposal, but a modification ; and, therefore, it seems to me, within the right of the Senate to make, whatever view may be taken as to the advisableness of agreeing &#34;to it. </para>

                        <para>-  I venture to think that the  Chairman  is responsible.&#39; More than once during the discussion of the Tariff, the  Chairman  has said that he has no perfectly framed Standing Orders to meet the circumstances, and, in consequence, there have been strange rulings  from time to time. A little while ago the  Chairman  gave a ruling, the basis of which was that our desire, in considering the suggestions of the Senate, was to circumscribe the area of debate as much as possible ; in other words, that our whole purpose, in considering these suggestions, is to narrow the circle of matters in issue &#39; as between the two Houses. I desire to point out that the ruling just given does not narrow, but widens the circle, inasmuch as it may open to debate every item in the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, there was no inducement to increase the hands under the duty referred to, seeing that 12&#189; per cent, was imposed on meters and parts alike. . Any increase in the number of hands must have been due simply to the larger number of meters required ; and, of course, that, in turn, was due to the growth of population, in New South Wales particularly. I object to the proposal of the Senate, because it&#39; simply offers a premium to the patentees and agents of meters, who have branches here, to in- crease the price to the amount of the duty. In Sydney, where the wet meter is mostly used, . the patentees have a branch, as they had when there was no duty at all, and also under the duty of12&#189; per cent. The work  is  carried on here because it saves freight and avoids risk of damage in transit. </para>

                        <para>- In Melbourne, but not in Sydney. In both Melbourne, where the dry meter is used, and in Sydney, where the wet meter is used, the parts are imported and put together here just as was the case under free-trade, or when there was&#39; a duty of 12&#189; per cent, tin parts and meters alike. It will be seen that no advantage is given by this duty, even from a protectionist stand-point; the only result is to give an opportunity to increase the price in. the way I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>- How long would a firm have the opportunity of increasing the price, under a duty, without taking advantage of it? On a previous occasion I pointed out that electric meters are admitted at 5 per cent, and free, whether made up or in parts; and I do not see why there should be a differentiation when both kinds of meters are used by the&#39; same classes of , people - that is, by large and small companies, and by municipalities. The only distinction is that gas meters are the more extensively used. I hope the Committee will not assent to the suggestion of the Senate, when really there  is  no necessity for such a duty. </para>

                    <para>. - It is only fair that we should, as far as possible, place electric lighting companies and gas companies on an equal footing. The honorable member for North Sydney seems to think that by imposing these increased duties we should give the gas companies an opportunity to raise the price of gas to consumers. My opinion is that the price of all illuminants is regulated by competition. That, at all events-, is the position in large centres of population where there are rival gas and electric lighting companies. &#34; We have agreed to allow electric meters to come in free, and they are certainly far more complicated than are gas meters. </para>

                        <para>- If we reduce the duty on parts by 12&#189; per cent, they will enjoy that advantage in putting them together, and will be placed in the same position as electric light companies are. For that reason, I think that we should accept the Senate&#39;s request. The bulk of the gas meters used in Australia are put together here. </para>

                    <para>.- This motion requires some . explanation, more especially as the Treasurer, when the request was before us on a previous occasion, if I remember rightly, did not advocate its acceptance. He suggested verbal amendments of the item which were agreed to by the Committee, and have been accepted by the Senate, and it would be interesting to learn why he now proposes to agree to this request. </para>

                    <para>.- I thought that the facts were so fresh in the minds of honorable members that it was &#39; unnecessary to remind them of what occurred when the request was previously before us. We then declined to impose duties of 17&#189; and. 12&#189; per cent, as requested by the Senate; but I would point out that under another item fencing droppers are dutiable at 17&#189; per cent, and12&#189; per cent&#39;. It is for that reason that &#34; the Senate requests that similar duties should be. imposed im respect of this item. Standards and pillars are practically identical with droppers. </para>

                        <para>- It will be seen, therefore, that the two items are closely allied, and it would be anomalous to have one dutiable and the other free. This is also purely a protective duty, the articles in question being manufactured in large quantities in the Commonwealth. It may further be stated that many of these standards, pillars, and droppers are Australian ideas, of which local manufacturers hold the patents. </para>

                    <para>. - In declaring that this item has reference to droppers, the Treasurer fell into an error. It relates only to wedgers for droppers. The request which has now been made by the Senate for the second time is one &#39;which evidences no regard for the decision deliberately arrived at by this Committee upon two previous occasions. I do not know where this House will ultimately find itself if the Senate persists in requesting that duties shall be imposed three times as great as those which this Committee has declared to be sufficient. </para>

Upon two occasions we have declared that the- articles enumerated in this item shall be dutiable at 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, and shall be admitted free under the Tariff for the United Kingdom ; and it is not reasonable therefore that the Senate should insist upon pressing its request for duties of 17J and 12 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent, respectively. But, unfortunately, we have a Government in power which is prepared to support all requests for higher duties whether the rights of this House are invaded or not. The Treasurer does not endeavour to meet the views expressed by this Committee- </para>

                    <para>.- In the northern portion of the State which I represent, droppers and standards are used very extensively for fencing purposes. In certain localities they are used because of the scarcity of timber, and they are also used in country where the timber is attacked by white ants. Yet we are asked to impose a duty of 17 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> per cent, upon these articles, which have merely to be cut into lengths. As a matter of fact, tons of them can be turned out daily by one man or boy with the aid of a machine. It is essential that in portions of the Commonwealth such as I have indicated the settlers should be able to obtain these materials at the lowest possible cost. I know thousands of miles of country&#34; which will not maintain more than 30 or 40 sheep per mile, and upon these large areas the cost of fencing is a considerable item. In addition, the lessees have to wire-net their holdings to protect them from vermin. Under all the circumstances I think that the least the Treasurer can do is to support the decision at which the Committee has twice previously arrived. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not think that the Treasurer should accuse honorable members of wishing to bring about a collision between this House and another -place. Such references are most  undignified. I think that the honorable gentleman will agree with me that it belittles the dignity of the House to have remarks of that character thrown across the chamber. This incessant reference to possible conflicts with another place is in the worst possible taste, especially in connexion with insignificant items, and in view of the fact that the differences between the two Houses in respect of practically all the large items have already been adjusted. I do not anticipate  any  difficulty in securing a settlement of this Tariff, seeing that most of the big questions have been amicably disposed of. When the Treasurer talks about standing up for the rights of this  House at the proper time, he_ means that he will &#39;do so when it suits him. May I remind him of the fact that the  Government of which he was a member - with our lamented, friend the late right honorable member for Adelaide, who was Minister of Trade and Customs at the time, and who was as staunch a protectionist as ever lived in Australia. - proposed that these articles should be free. The Treasurer and his colleagues, in the interests of the Australian people, actually proposed that they should be admitted free. . They have been admitted free ever since 1902. In the present Tariff the Government, with a view to extending a preference to the Mother  Country,  proposed that they should be dutiable at 5 per cent, under . the general Tariff and free under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission also recommended that  they  should be admitted free. This Committee has declared upon two previous occasions that  they  shall be dutiable at 5 per cent, under the .general . Tariff/ and free under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. Yet we are&#39; now asked by the Senate to increase that duty more than threefold - to impose a duty of 17&#189; per cent, under the general Tariff, which is an increase of more than 300 per cent. Surely all talk about the Senate trenching upon our rights and privileges in connexion with the Tariff can have no weight whatever, when it proceeds from men who are prepared to agree to requests by that Chamber for duties which represent increases of 300 per cent, upon their own proposals. The request under consideration is a monstrous one if this Committee is to have any voice at all in determining the duties to be levied under this schedule. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The original request of the Senate was to make linseed free, provided that, in the opinion of the Minister, sufficient linseed oil for manufacturing purposes was not being produced in Australia. No one could object to such a provision as that; but, surely we are not going to handicap our paint manufacturers by causing them to pay duty on oil which they must import. The honorable member for Mernda . says&#39; that linseed oil is made in the Commonwealth; but only very little of it is. made. If I were certain that in the near future sufficient for manufacturing paint could be obtained locally, I should not object to a duty ; but we should not put our manufacturers of paint at a disadvantage with those of other countries, whose paints are adulterated with barytes to an extraordinary degree. </para>

                    <para>- Quite so; and for the reason that the duty of 6d. per gallon is too small. Owing to the fact that we have so many products which may be used for cattle feeding, there is no market here for oil cake, which in Europe has become practically the primary product, &#39; instead of the oil. We are now trying to . improve conditions by giving a bonus on the seed ; but here we have a proposal which, if carried, will mean doing away with the only use to which the oil can be put. </para>

                    <para>. - The argument of the honorable member for Mernda is quite unanswerable. I should also like to point out that the scheme of duties on paints and colours . is based on the assumption that&#39; there is to be a duty of 6d. per gallon on linseed oil ; and if linseed oil be made free, then&#34; we shall have to revise the whole of the other duties. However, I do not altogether rely on that argument. The honorable member for Mernda has shown us that the production of linseed oil is one of the primary industries of the country - an industry which Parliament has decided to encourage by means of a bonus - and, therefore, the protective duty must remain unimpaired ; otherwise, the bonus would be reduced to a minimum or become inoperative. The Tariff Commission considered this matter very carefully, and did not see their way to admit the raw material free. </para>

                    <para>. - If there had been any likelihood of obtaining linseed oil locally in any quantity in the near future, I should have voted for a duty. As a matter of fact, however, there is so little possibility of linseed being grown to any extent, that we have decided to grant&#39; a bonus; and we have no information up to the present that there has been any real attempt to produce it in any quantity. </para>

                        <para>- There is one firm in Adelaide alone which has recently spent . &#163;15,000 on this industry of &#34; only mixing paint &#34; ; and it is one of the oldest and best firms in Australia. The honorable member for Bendigo endeavoured to make me appear to be departing from my protectionist principles ; but I again point out that, in spite of the bonus, linseed- is not being produced in any quantity. My own opinion is that we shall be revising this Tariff again before linseed, oil is produced to any satisfactory extent within the Commonwealth; and I do not see why.  we should handicap a large industry on the off chance of the bonus being effective. The honorable member for Mernda talked about denaturating the oil ; and I took the trouble to ask the Treasurer to find out whether there was any likelihood of the oil being denaturated, if it could be easily clarified. I am informed that there is no difficulty about the denaturating, while the latter process is too costly ; and, therefore, I think it would only be fair to accept the suggestion of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for North Sydney, who has followed the Tariff with great attention, informs me that the protection on paints was increased from 6d. to9d. because of the particular duty under discussion. If we have given the manufacturers of paints increased protection on that account, . and if, as the honorable member for North Sydney informs me, this is a revenue duty, seeing that the article is not produced here, we are, in my opinion, entitled to the revenue duty to the extent to which we have increased the duty on the finished article. If I am right in that, I am right altogether; if I am wrong in that, I am wrong altogether. I am told that the duty on paints was increased because the manufacturers have to pay duty on the raw material. If the duty of 6d. or od. were taken off paints, I should vote for the proposal before us ; but I am not going to present these manufacturers with any further advantage in the shape of protection. Then, again, we have offered a bonus for the production of linseed, and, since we have provided for the manufacturer, surely we can leave the benefit of that bonus to the grower? Under the circumstances, I feel that we should be simply depriving the Treasurer of revenue, if we supported the proposal which has been submitted. </para>

But it would be absurd to give a bonus with one hand, and take away the duty with the other; because such a step would simply result in . the loss of revenue. I am astonished that the honorable member for Corangamite, who is such an upholder of the primary producer, should advocate free-trade in linseed. </para>

                    <para>. - The leader of the Opposition made a statement which leads me to think that he is &#34; slipping &#34; on oil. The right honorable member supports the retention of a duty of 6d. on linseed for the reason - , although he did not say this definitely - that he was afraid the manufacturers would get the benefit if- the duty were removed. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member says so, but the duty on paints is : only 4s., and, as a matter of fact, there is a duty on both linseed oil and. burnt sienna. The manufacturers now say that they are not in a good position to compete with . the imported paints. I believe myself that we ought to encourage&#39; the manufacture of linseed oil. . The Senate suggested that the linseed oil, when denaturated, as prescribed by departmental by-laws, should be free; but that would mean that no linseed oil would pay any duty whatever, seeing that all linseed oil is used in the manufacture of something or other. </para>

He also states that nearly 100 hands are employed ; that there is every prospect of that number being increased, and that analyses  of the oil produced by him show it to be equal to that produced by Blundell and Spence, which is recognised all over the world as a standard oil. </para>

                        <para>- Linseed for oil-making purposes is admitted free, but the bounty on oil locally produced can be claimed only in respect of oil obtained from linseed grown in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hopkinson</inline> goes on to state that he has been compelled, to sell his output at a very low price owing to the belief on the part of many people that the Australian oil is not as good as the imported, and that the cost of the raw material here is greater and the wages paid higher than abroad. He states that the adoption of this request would mean the closing of the industry. I had some diffidence in quoting that statement in the absence of any further authority. But I would point out that we have empowered the Ministry to expend during a period of five years up to &#163;5,000 by way of a bounty, equal to 10 per cent, on the value of oil made here from linseed. That being so, I fail to see how we could reasonably agree to this request. I recognise that linseed oil is the raw material of a number of industries, and that it is largely used in the mixing of paint, which gives employment to a number of people. White lead is used in the manufacture of paints, although the highest authorities in France say that the oxide of zinc preparation is better and healthier. I am now informed by the honorable member for Hindmarsh that there is a duty of 2s. per cental on linseed. </para>

                        <para>- There has been no good reason advanced against this oil being allowed when denaturated to come in free until our production of linseed expands. The local output of linseed oil is not sufficient to supply the needs of the paint industry of Australia, and . I hope that, if this request be rejected, the Senate will again insist upon its acceptance. </para>

                    <para>.- Since honorable members have referred to the protection allowed to paint manufacturers in Australia, it is only . fair to consider what is the assistance now given to the producers of linseed oil. At page  185  of the Tariff Commission&#39;s report, it is shown that the average cost of linseed oil landed without duty in Australia, for a period prior to the taking of evidence by the Commission, was  2s.1d.  per gallon. A duty of  6d.  per gallon would bring up that price to  2s. 7d.,  without making allowance for all the charges, which must be very great, incidental to landing and distribution. </para>

It must be admitted that there is a much larger number of people dependent on the making and using of paint than there is upon the growing of linseed ; and I hope that, in the interests of the paints of Australia, the Senate&#39;s request will be agreed to. I would point out to the honorable member for Mernda- </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has always urged, when asking for high protection for certain articles, that the higher the protection granted, the greater will be the local competition, and . the cheaper the price to the general consumer. I have heard that argument advanced by him when phenomenally high duties have been sought on certain articles. &#39; I ask him why should not the position be the same in regard to paints ? Paint is used by thousands in Australia, and yet the keenest opposition to this request comes from one of the strongest protectionists in the House. Surely the honorable member will see that what applies to one industry must apply to all. </para>

                        <para>- Then I will put the position in another way. Should the expectation which induced this House to grant a bounty upon .the production of linseed be realized, we shall have .a large quantity of linseed with no market for it unless mills are erected to convert it into oil. The bounty . is intended to encourage men to grow the seed, and the duty of 6d. per -gallon is intended to induce mills to utilize that seed&#39;. In the meantime, we admit linseed free with the object of encouraging mills to start operations, but we admit it free only until such time as they can be supplied by local growers. The . duty upon paints under this Tariff was increased because an impost of 6d. per gallon had been levied upon oil. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. If would be folly to authorize the payment of a bounty to encourage the production of that article, whilst destroying the only means by which it could .be utilized. I do not underrate the paint-mixing industry, but, after all, the great bulk of its raw material is imported. I recognise that those engaged in that industry are entitled to protection, md I voted to extend it to them. But, having conceded that protection, it would be extraordinary if we refused to protect the Original producer of the seed, and those who utilize it. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the reason. The honorable member for Mernda has probably seen the works in Driffield, Yorksh:re, which manufacture linseed cake. There the oil is a by-product, and the linseed cake is the product. The honorable member for Mernda desires to reverse that position. He wishes to make the oil the product, and the linseed cake the byproduct, because, upon his own admission, we use very little linseed cake in Australia. It is a valuable product, but it is an unfortunate fact that it has not been manufactured here at a price sufficiently low to permit of it being used economically. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is exhibiting his strength upon this question  by telling me that it is just as easy to grow linseed as it is to grow wheat. May I inform him that there is the greatest difference in the world between the two things? I can grow wheat profitably, but when I started to grow linseed I made a heavy loss, and a lot of other persons in my own district had a similar experience. I really think it is strange that on the present OCt:1-  sion I should agree with the honorable member for Hindmarsh. But I do. I think that his contention is quite right. I hope that the Committee will vote to assist the industry in South Australia to which I have referred. </para>

                    <para>. - It is a remarkable circumstance that the honorable member for Mernda did not adduce the arguments which he has advanced this evening when the proposal to admit linseed free for manufacturing purposes was under consideration. If it be true that we ought not to admit the oil free because  we manufacture it, surely we ought not to admit the linseed free because we are growing it. When linseed oil is being produced in the Commonwealth in any quantity I am willing that &#39; it shall be made dutiable. But surely this Committee cannot go behind the decision at which it has previously arrived. All that I ask is that oil shall be admitted free for manufacturing purposes until such, time as it can be produced in Australia. </para>

I find that that bounty upon which the honorable member for Mernda laid such stress must not exceed  &#163;5,000  in any one year.

                    <para>.- I think that the Committee might agree to the proposal of the Senate, except as regards &#34; plumbago. crucibles.&#34; Unless the word &#34; plumbago&#34; is struck out, great injury will be done to the mining industry of Australia, which employs from  120,000  to  150,000  men, on whom nearly every item in the Tariff imposes a burden, although the industry is helping the country, and has helped it ever since it has been worth living in. I have been informed to-night, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> H. Schlapp, one of the. great authorities on the subject in the Commonwealth, that where complicated ores have to be dealt with, in places like Broken Hill, Mount Morgan, and Kalgoorlie, the ordinary rough crucible, such as might be made by a brickmaker, or a drain-pipe maker, is quite unsuitable, as only reliable crucibles can be used. </para>

                        <para>- The ordinary potter&#39;s crucibles, produced in Australia, are not sufficiently reliable for fine work, and, therefore, whatever the duty, the mining companies must import those that they use. We should not hamper mining by increasing the cost- of crucibles. The. plumbago crucible is used only for fine gold smelting, and brass melting, that generally used in connexion with mining being made of clay. Not only have I the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Schlapp</inline> ; but the views which I am expressing are those of all who have knowledge of mining, and are supported by the Kalgoorlie Chamber of Mines; It must not be forgotten that Kalgoorlie produces more gold than all the other fields in Australia put together, including Bendigo, Ballarat, and Mount Morgan. Are we to set aside the interests of an industry giving employment to thousands, in order to assist a potter who may employ two or three persons? The word &#34;plumbago&#34;  should be struck out, and crucibles made free. I, therefore, move - </para>

                    <para>-- As I had not an opportunity to speak on this subject when it was last before the Committee, I wish to make a few remarks now. I think that had honorable members understood the questions involved, clay crucibles would not have been made free. Originally, all crucibles were dutiable under the Tariff, as introduced, at 25 per cent., which was the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, but the Committee, by a majority of four, placed them on the free list. The Senate requested that they be made dutiable at the rates charged on earthenware, but the requested amendment was not made. Now the Senate submits a modified proposal which, if agreed to, will make plumbago crucibles and  skittlepots,  which are said not to be made in Australia, free, leaving clay crucibles dutiable at 25 and 20 per cent. I hope, that the Committee will agree to that. Clay crucibles can be made in any quantity, and of the best quality, in at least two of the States. When the Tariff Commission was sitting in Adelaide, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Provis, mining engineer and chemist, and, general manager of the Kangaroo Island China-stone and Clay Company, gave this evidence - vol. 5, page 118, question 56293 - </para>

                    <para>Gas retorts are made of fireclays. In r.ddition. to that, we can make crucibles and muffles, and  assayer&#39;s  furnaces. A very large quantity of these are also imported. I have one or two samples here of the fire-brick made by myself, and I want you to understand that they were not made by a practical potter or a practical  brickmaker.  I made them in my own &#34;tinpot way. They have been exposed to a temper of white heat for ten hours, and- there is no sign of vitrification. Here is also an  assayer&#39;s  crucible which I made, and that has stood the fire at white heat for about nine hours. </para>

                        <para>- He has prepared them for sale, but they are imported so extensively that he has not had a chance of cutting into the market. The following is an extract from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Provis&#39;</inline> evidence - 56323. Read the next exemption (c) ? - &#34; Crucibles, scorifiers, roasting dishes, muffles, assay furnaces and cupels.&#34; That is more in my line. 56324. What do you say about them? - We can make these - every one of them given here. From experiments we have made, and experiments that others have made, we know we can make equal to the best imported article. These materials are brought into the country very cheaply. 56325. Before I pass from fire-bricks,  I want to know what duty von want on them ? - We ought to have 15 per cent, on fire-bricks. 56326. Go on to (c) now? - &#34;Crucibles,  scorifiers,  roasting dishes, muffles, assay furnaces, and cupels.&#34; These can be made here and of quite as good a quality as what we have from Home - in some instances better. The crucibles are introduced into this  country  very cheaply. At the present tim e it does not give a man half a chance to make a crust of bread, if he only makes crucibles and scorifiers and roasting dishes. In England they are made bv child labour almost, and brought out into this country free of duty. The freight is very little, and 15 to 20 per cent, would not be at all too much, and it would give us an opportunity of making these things, which are so extensively used in Australia. 56327. You produce a sample of them marked &#34; N &#34; ?- Yes. 56328. Is that a good sample? - That is a sample made on the mine, not bv a potter. If a potter were to make a sample like that he would make a far better one. With regard to the shape, that has nothing to do with the quality. I assure you I burnt that crucible at white heat for nine hours, and there is not a sign of vitrification. </para>

I do not suppose that the furnaces or mines of Western Australia are beyond the white heat test, which, I understand, is the proper one.. The following is another extract from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Provis&#39;</inline> evidence - 56332. What suggestion have you to make with reference to these articles? - I think it is almost absolutely necessary for these things to be made in the States to put a duty of from 15 to 20 per cent, on them. If we were to do that I think we could make the whole of the scorifiers, the whole of the crucibles, and the whole of the muffles that are required in Australia. We have the material, and the material appears to me and to others that have tried it to be equal to the best imported article. </para>

                        <para>- The prices are not mentioned ; and I suppose there cannot&#39; be any great difference, or these practical men would have mentioned the fact. The last testimonial sent to this firm was from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Ebbott, manager of the Forest Creek Gold Reefs Company, Chewton, Victoria, who, under, date  24th  November,  1904.  said that the last lot. of crucibles which had been sent were &#34; turning out splendidly.&#34; If these crucibles are good enough for the&#39; mines of Victoria they ought to be good enough for the mines of Western Australia. I am afraid that a great deal of the opposition to the local articles is founded on bigoted prejudice. There is such an indisposition to give them a trial that the Bendigo and South Australian crucibles have never yet been tested by the Western Australian mining companies. These&#39; crucibles are used exclusively in the cyanide works at Bendigo. </para>

                    <para>.- We are indebted to the honorable member for Bendigo for the information he has given us, and for the pains he has taken over . the&#39; Tariff generally. When the honorable gentleman, speaks we are usually told something which rests on a firm basis ; and I am. proud to think that he has proved that on Kangaroo Island . there is some of the . best of clay for making all kinds of china and earthenware. There are large manufacturers on Kangaroo Island, where, I may add, , can be found the finest climate in. the world. We cannot expect a company to start without some inducement, and there is no doubt that this industry, with encouragement, would go ahead. I should be the. last to try to injure the mining industry, especially that of Western Australia, to which State the other States, are so much indebted. We are all looking for gold ; and if the admission of crucibles free would lead to the. production of more gold, I should be glad to support a proposal to that end. </para>

                    <para>.-I hope the Committee will not accept the advice of the honorable member for Bendigo. The honorable member has on several occasions,&#39; no doubt in all sincerity, endeavoured to convince us that when he expresses an opinion, backed up by the report of the Tariff Commission, which he wrote himself, the question before us is settled beyond any shadow of a doubt. I do not deny that the honorable member has taken great trouble in obtaining information on the Tariff, nor would I deprive him of any honour that is due to him. But&#39;, at the same time, it is the duty of this Committee to investigate the information which is laid before us, and see whether there is any reason in the suggestions made. The honorable member for Barker has spoken of a great industry in South Australia, which,  1  am informed, employs three men. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member talks at random about the millions produced in Western Australia, The attitude of some honorable members when dealing with, any item affecting a commodity in which that State is interested is not at all satisfactory to its representatives. The Government propose to allow crucibles other than those made of plumbago to fall automatically as earthenware, under duties of 25 and 20 per cent I should like to ask the Honorary Minister what percentage of the crucibles now&#39; imported will be admitted free if we accept the Senate&#39;s request ? </para>

                        <para>- My knowledge of the facts convinces me that if the Senate&#39;s request is agreed to, about 1 per cent, of the crucibles which are imported will be admitted free. It is proposed by a side wind to make- all other crucibles other than those made of plumbago dutiable at the rates I have mentioned, notwithstanding that this Committee has on two occasions determined that they shall be free. This is to be done in the interests of an industry at present giving employment to three individuals. </para>

                        <para>- That is exactly the position I am now taking up. The only clay that is suitable - standing alone - for the production of crucibles capable of standing the most severe tests is that obtained at Battersea. Those who urge the acceptance of this request are advocating a verv small modicum of free-trade in respect of . 1 German production, which is not really a plumbago crucible, although it consists partly of plumbago; -whilst Battersea clay crucibles will be dutiable. This is a proposal submitted by a protectionist Government who profess to believe in preference for imports from the clear old Motherland. I wish to say that if by this subterfuge the Committee is led to reverse the decision given on two previous occasions in connexion with these articles they will impose an unduly  heavy tax upon research in this country without benefiting any individual in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I was referring to skittle pots, and the amendment meets the objection I raised at the time. We have manufacturers in South Australia who do not wish to send to the Old Country for these unwieldy articles, and they offered to pay double what it would cost to get them from the Old Country. The firm to which I refer would not guarantee that they could make them equal to the imported article, but were prepared to try to do so. They would not take an order for a dozen, but they accepted an order for four to make a trial, as up to the present they have not been able to make skittle pots satisfactorily. In connexion with the manufacture of the ordinary clay crucibles I have proved to demonstration that we can manufacture articles equal to those imported from any other part of the world. Now, as to the reason given by this firm for the exclusion of the plumbago crucibles, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Meakin</inline> gave the following evidence on the subject - </para>

                    <para>What do you think is the reason why plumbago crucibles are preferred in a great many of the works engaged in the production of ores? - Because they are better than the fireclav. </para>

                <para class="block">The firm is quite prepared to admit that plumbago crucibles are able- to stand tests which the ordinary clay crucibles will not stand. I need not further occupy the time of the Committee. I have shown that the ordinary crucible can be manufactured of a quality good enough for all purposes, not only in South Australia or in the district represented by the honorable member for Bendigo, but in other parts of the Commonwealth. For the reasons I have given I hope that the Committee will agree to the verv reasonable amendment proposed. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has mentioned that a crucible made at Bendigo was kept at a white heat for nine hours, and the maker was so surprised that he has advertised the fact ever since. When we were dealing with the item covering fuses the honorable member said that if the Committee agreed to impose the duty he proposed the local makers would- lower their price, but as a matter of fact they have raised their price by 20 per cent. If the Bendigo potters want work, why&#39; did they not offer to supply the insulators for which the Postmaster-General invited tenders the other day? </para>

                        <para>- I object to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duntan</inline> setting himself up as a judge of what is most suitable for use in the mining districts of Western Australia, which produce more gold in a single month than Bendigo does in one year. We have been told that the man who constructed this crucible affirms that it is as good as the Morgan crucible. But I would remind the Committee that the Morgan crucible is only one of second quality, and that for fine work the German crucible is the best. The honorable member for Bendigo declared that what is good enough for Bendigo is good enough for Western Australia. That is not the case. In Western Australia we have to deal with a different class of ores from those which are being treated at Bendigo. I might also inform the honorable member for Bendigo that the filter press was invented and worked in Western Australia, and that&#39; it was afterwards used in Bendigo. So that what was good enough for Western Australia in that instance was good enough for Bendigo. The honorable member for Barker has declared that Kangaroo Island possesses large deposits of clay suitable for the manufacture of these crucibles, and that it has a very fine climate. I have heard of a place which consists of 98 per cent, of climate and 2 per cent. . of business. That description, I think, is applicable to Kangaroo Island. I wish now to refer to the &#34;expert&#34; who has discovered these deposits of clay there. I lived in South Australia for a time, when a man named Provis used to discover all sorts of things. He was known as &#34; the Poet.&#34; He afterwards went to Queensland, and discovered a tin mine. If he knows&#39; as  much about clay as he does about poetry, he is a very poor potter indeed. I ask the Committee to accept his evidence in regard to crucibles for what . it is worth. I suggest that in future he should stick to poetry, and leave crucibles severely alone. </para>

                        <para>-  Before we make the amendment, I should like a ruling from you, . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> on the question whether it is within the power of the Senate to suggest, or for us to consider, a proposal to insert the new paragraph c. I ask the ruling now, because paragraph  a  is dependent on paragraph c, and I have an idea that we might do what is desired under paragraph  a,  thus doing away with, the necessity for paragraph  b.  Paragraph  c  really introduces new rnatter, although it is connected with paragraph  a,  but, so far as your personal knowledge is concerned, sir? you cannot know whether Pyrethrum flowers are used for any other purposes beyond making insecticides. I think this case comes within the ruling which vou gave on item 162, to the effect that it was not competent for us to deal with a suggestion of the sort. If that be so, then I should like to suggest that the desired end be gained by some amendment in para-, graphs  a  and  b. </para>

                    <para>. - I regard the proposed paragraph c as altogether unnecessary. This item has mostly to do with the preparation of insecticide, mortein, and insectibane, . which are prepared from Pyrethrum flowers grown on the Continent of Europe, and imported either whole or in powdered form. These flowers, when . prepared, are packed in tins of two, four, eight, and sixteen ounces, and thus sold, packages of . over one pound being almost unknown in the retail trade. Sheep washes and cattle and horse washes are- used for other purposes; and, according to the item as it stands, they will be free. But powdered sheep dip, such as Cooper&#39;s, might easily be read into the word &#34;insecticide,&#34; though it is used- solely for dipping sheep and other- animals in order to get rid of lice and ticks. Disinfectants are imported here in large quantities, and one of these, </para>

                <para class="block">Little&#39;s Phenyle, is used as a sheep-wash. In this connexion I desire to show that the contention that protection is necessary cannot be maintained. The price . list of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> D. Howie, of 299 Smith-street, Fitzroy, shows that he sells Little&#39;s Phenyle at 5s. a half -gallon, 9s. 6d. the gallon, and 6&#189;d. the bottle, whereas Hogan&#39;s Phenyle is sold at 2&#189;d. the bottle, and 6d. a quart. Little&#39;s Phenyle is imported in bulk, and bottled here, while Hogan&#39;s Phenyle is manufactured within the&#39; Commonwealth. Then Messrs. Moran and Cato&#39;s list shows that Little&#39;s Phenyle is sold by the bottle at 6d., as compared with the Brunswick Company&#39;s Phenyle sold at2&#189;d. In view of the disparity of prices shown, who&#39; can contend that there is any necessity for protection ? There is another phenyle made in Australia by Messrs. &#39; Coghlan and Company, of Little Lonsdale-street-, Melbourne, and they sell their A quality at 4s. a gallon, their M quality at 3s. 6d. ner gallon, and their B quality at 3s. per gallon, as against the 9s. 6d. charged for Little&#39;s &#39;Phenyle.

                    <para>. - The modification proposed by the honorable member for Corangamite cannot be accepted by the Government.  His  proposition is, in effect, to make dutiable small packages either of insecticides or of disinfectants, and to permit to come into Australia, free of duty, the same article, when imported in larger bulk. The honorable member&#39;s argument is that inasmuch as nearly the whole of the work is done in Australia, it is not necessary to impose a duty on imports in bulk. Our argument, in answer, Is that if the manufacturers can do the bottling, packing, and casing, in Australia, they can also do the actual manufacturing here. There is no reason on earth why they should not make their disinfectants locally, nor is there any reason why the locally-made goods should not be of the same quality as the best Imported disinfectants. Under the circumstances, and speaking on behalf of the Government, I cannot accept the proposal of the honorable member. We want to have all the work done in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That remark is beside the question, nor had the comparison, made by the honorable member for Corangamite any bearing on the point at issue. He compared the poorer class of locally-made disinfectants with the best class of imported goods. I do not deny the correctness of the. prices quoted by him, but it was not a fair comparison to place the lowest quality in one case against the highest in the other. </para>

                        <para>- I say in answer, that the very people who claim to make such an excellent article, can make it just as well in Australia, as abroad. As to insecticides, the reason why we propose to put pyrethrum flowers on the free list is, that there is only one place in the world where they are grown. They are the raw material which forms the absolute basis for the manufacture of insecticides. Having admitted the flowers duty free, we enable the packing, the printing, the labelling, and all the other work to be done in Australia. We recognise the inevitable in acknowledging that the flowers cannot be grown in this country, but we do the next best tiling in regarding them as the raw material of an Australian industry. The Senate&#39;s proposal is one which, we think, ought to be accepted, and I ask the Committee to make the requested amendment. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, the proposal of the honorable member retains the major part of the work in Australia. It is most important that our orchardists and sheep breeders should have a good reliable dip. They have had that in the past, and know what it is. They are not absolutely certain yet of the locally-made dips. If the bottling, labelling, and tinning&#39; are done here we shall preserve to Australia the important part of the industry. These insecticides are largely used by orchardists, who are compelled by law to use them. On that account we ought to see that they get as good an article as possible. The amendment suggested by the honorable member for Corangamite meets the case exactly. The material will come out in bulk, all the rest of the work will be done here, and our people will get really good and reliable stuff.&#39; There is no possibility of distinguishing between insecticides and disinfectants, and cattle, sheep, and horse dips. </para>

I called the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to it, and he ordered that they should all be admitted free. The division now- proposed will cause the same difficulty to arise again.

                        <para>- I am afraid they will not. These articles are largely- used by fruit-growers as well as by sheep and cattle men, and we ought to be very careful not to penalize those people. II . is not absolutely certain yet that the local dips are infallible, and a very small deterioration in the wool clip of Australia means a big loss. We ought to be careful before we depart from the present practice. By charging the duty  only  on the smaller packages, as the honorable member for Corangamite suggests, we  shall  be securing the work as far as possible for our own people. </para>

                    <para>.- I see no reason why the pastoralist should get his washes free, while the orchardist, who is&#39; in  a  much smaller way of business, and  has  far more difficulty in making ends meet, is compelled to pav heavy duties  upon  the insecticides and disinfectants that he is  compelled  bv law to  use.  Orchardists have nil they can do now to  fight the  pests that attack  their  fruits. </para>

                        <para>- It is  not  a question of a cheaper article. In. a  case  of  this  kind, it has to be  the  best article. If  the  local make  is  as  good  as the imported, and cheaper, the fruit-growers are business men enough to take it, but they must get what is absolutely the best article for their purpose. The States Parliaments make it essential for them- to use insecticides and disinfectants. One State will not admit the product of another unless it has been properly fumigated and certified to. New Zealand is threatening to close her markets against the citrous fruits of Queensland and New South Wales. These things are a serious menace to the fruit-growing industries of those two great States. This Chamber ought to do all it can to help them. While we should help the pastoralist, we should not leave the fruit-growers to shift for themselves, because they cannot bring the same influence to bear, and because their industry does not attain such great financial proportions as do the sheep and cattle industries. I will support the amendment of the honorable member for Corangamite in the absence of any lower proposal, but I should have liked to see the Committee adhere to its previous decision tq put insecticides and disinfectants, with sheep, cattle, and horse washes, on the free list. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member&#39;s arguments- would have come with a great deal more force if it had not been that the Tariff Commission, &#39; after full investigation, recommended that these articles should be free, and that the Government, in introducing the Tariff, adopted that recommendation. Now, at this late stage, we having already rejected the Senate&#39;s previous request to impose a duty, the proposal is made that insecticides and disinfectants should be subject to a 25 per cent, duty, even at a great cost to orchardists throughout the community. </para>

                        <para>- Why did not the Government bring in this proposal originally? It is a perfect farce that the Government should ask the Committee . not only to go back upon its previous decision but to re-cast&#39; the work of the Tariff Commission and oppose something which they themselves accepted. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Flinders is no doubt an excellent judge of the farcical, but I am sure that the Government have done what all protectionists desire. When we cannot obtain all that we want, Surely we are justified in taking as much as we can get? In reply . to the honorable member for Corangamite, I would point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. R.</inline> J.

                        <para>- They are affected by it, and urge that it should be adopted. It was due to a mistake -that the request was not agreed to when it was previously before the House. I think that I have said enough to satisfy the- honorable member for Flinders that his criticism was unjustified, and I hope that the Government will support the imposition of as high a duty as we can secure. As to the request with regard to pyrethrum flowers, it cannot be denied that they are a raw material of all insecticides, and as such should be admitted free. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish only to point out that, in addition to the firms mentioned by the honorable member there are many other manufacturers of disinfectants in the Commonwealth. In Adelaide we have a firm making and supplying disinfectants to the corporation of Newcastle and many other municipalities in New South Wales&#39;, as well as in South Australia. If its disinfectants were not equal to the imported article, I do not think that they would be purchased by those corporations. Although the modification does not go so far as I. should like it to go, it is a reasonable proposition, arid I shall accept it if we cannot obtain anything better. Throughout the Commonwealth, disinfectants equal to any that are imported are being made. The modification moved bv the honorable member for Corangamite might well be accepted by the Minister. It is certainly a compromise, but it will serve the purpose which our manufacturers have in view. </para>

                <para class="block">Objection has been raised to the wording of the item, because it specifies red beech. Inquiries show that it has been imported during the past four years. It was first used for making picture and room mouldings ; but latterly it has been imported for the manufacture of furniture, including bent wood chairs. There appears to be some doubt as to the proper name of this timber. It has been ordered as red beech, and invoiced as red beech, silver beech, and red birch. That fact was pointed out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> who moved the request, and it was suggested to him that the words beech or birch should be substituted, but he did not wish the paragraph to apply to anything but red beech. If the request is accepted it will be necessary for the importers to satisfy the Collectors of Customs that their timber, is actually red beech, in order to obtain the benefit&#39; of this duty. When the item was last before the Committee, I did not recognise the timber referred to, and that is why I took the action I did in regard to it. The explanation given to me since appears to be satisfactory, and for that reason I . propose to make the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has directed his attention to what, in my opinion, would be a very minor alteration of the item. He has not alluded to his acceptance of duties, which I think I can show represent from two to two and a half times . as much as the original increases of duty requested by the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- That is so ; but I can show the Committee that even higher duties are suggested by the proposed insertion of the word &#34;white&#34; before the words &#34; New Zealand pine.&#34; If this amendment be made, it will throw the timber duties as agreed to by this Committee absolutely out of line. We are here being asked to . impose tremendous duties, which will fall with great weight, not only upon Australian industries, but on every one who requires certain timber for the erection  of a dwelling. I wonder the Minister had nothing to say with respect to that proposed amendment. We sent . this item to the Senate in this form - </para>

                        <para>- That was the decision of this Committee, at all events, and I may add that it was a compromise, without which, this timber would have been admitted free of duty. What was the Senate&#39;s first request on the item as passed by this Committee? They requested the imposition of a duty of1s. per 100 super, feet on both lines of timber below 12 x 6. &#39; The effect of inserting the word &#34;white&#34; before the words &#34;New Zealand pine&#34; will be to leave white pine dutiable at 6d. per100 super, feet, which the honorable member for Wide Bay satirically describes as a high duty; whilst other New Zealand pines, kauri pine included, over 7 x 2&#189; and under 12 x 6 would be dutiable at twice the increased duty originally requested by the Senate, and in sizes under 7 x 2&#189;, at two and a half times that duty. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister&#39;s interjections are stereotyped. If they were novel, we might be able to appreciate them ; but when the honorable gentleman merely repeats the same interjections whatever be the subject under discussion, we need pay no attention to them. The fact is that to import this timber in sizes 12x6, and have it cut up here, would be to lose the advantage of cheapness. It is because the smaller sizes are the offcuts that it is possible to import this timber at the cheaper rate. If it is imported in the log it must pay extra freight and charges, and must bear  freight and charges on waste. That is an altogether extravagant way of importing it. By the proposal now made, people will be forced to import timber in that extravagant way, or in sizes 12 x 6, for which they must pay a much higher, price - a price which they cannot afford to pay if it is necessary afterwards to have it cut up. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister knows nothing about it. I intend to say all that I have to say, no matter how . many interjections there may be. I hope the honorable gentleman will not return, to his natural condition of Tudeness, but will try. to maintain the dignity of Parliament a little. The proposal now made is to so increase the increased . duties at first suggested by the Senate that . on1-in. timber, undressed, the duty would be 2s. 5d. per 100 super, feet, instead of 1s., as at first suggested by the Senate; on 7/8in. timber, the duty would be 2s.11d. ;. on¾in. timber, 3s. 5d. ; on5/8in. timber, 4s.1d. ; on&#189;in. timber, 5s. per 100 super, feet ; and as much as 5s. 8d. &#39; on&#189;-in. weatherboards. </para>

                        <para>- I am willing to put that explanation before the officers of the Department, and they will not deny that I have accurately stated the effect of the proposed amendment coupled with the measurement definition. Under the proposed amendment of the measurement definition, to be dealt with later on, we should have the extraordinary result that in the case of timber below&#189; inch in thickness, -and, for instance,3/8in. timber, the duty would suddenly drop from 5s. . to11d. per 100 super, feet. That is the effect of the definition. A size on which there is more cutting is admitted at one-fifth of the duty on the next larger size - half -inch. What volume . of imports will be affected by the duties which the Treasurer &#39;desires us to accept? In 1906 our imports of New Zealand- pine aggregated 65,000,000 superficial feet, or more than-&#39; 30 per cent&#34;, of our total imports of undressed timber. The effect of the duty which was operative under the old Tariff was that out of this quantity only 5,125 feet of dressed timber were introduced. Of that import 30,000,000 superficial feet of pine - principally kauri - will be affected by these duties. </para>

                        <para>- I am making even a lower estimate than is the honorable member. For what is this timber used? For agricultural machinery, for furniture making, dairying utensils, wine vats and fruit cases. It is also used for floorings and for lining houses. Of that 30,000,000 superficial feet, 24,000,000 feet, or 80 per cent., are imported in sizes under 12 inches x 6 inches. So that at a lower estimate than that of the honorable member for Moreton we are being asked to increase the taxation of these industries by over . &#163;30,000 per annum. Now, Queensland annually produces only about 83,000,000 feet of timber, including both hardwoods and softwoods, whereas, the requirements of the Commonwealth amount  to 690,000,000 feet. In other&#34; words, Queensland cuts less than one-eighth of our total requirements. That State has this vast market open to her timbers. . It is a payable market, being as regards pine 50 per cent, higher than was the market which was available when the first Tariff was under consideration, and when Queensland members only asked for is. duty. I have already stated that the proposal of the Treasurer would force all the dressing of this timber to be undertaken outside the Common weath. Why? Because he proposes to increase the duty upon undressed timber of a size  7  inches x 2^ - the dressing sizes - inches to 2s. 6d. per 100 superficial feet. This Committee decided that it should be dutiable at only 6d. per100 superficial feet, and the Senate &#39; originally requested that the duty should be increased to 1s. per 100 superficial feet. The Senate now requests a duty of 2s. 6d. per 100 superficial feet. Now dressed timber is dutiable at  35.  . per 100 superficial feet, a difference of 6d. only over the undressed. But timber cannot be dressed for 6d. per 100 superficial feet. The dressing costs three times that amount. . Consequently the Treasurer is really offering a premium for this timber to be dressed outside of Australia. I do not wish to detain the Committee at any greater length. I shall have something to say at a later stage upon the definition of &#34;superficial feet.&#34; The Government do not know what they are doing in that connexion. They are really getting into a quagmire. If we depart from accepted canons in regard to weights and measures we can scarcely foresee the consequences of our action. I do hope that when we come to deal with the definition we shall adopt the interpretation of &#34; superficial feet &#39; &#39;&#39; which is known and recognised not only by the trading community but by our Courts. If we are to have increased duties, &#39; they should not be imposed under definition, but should be specified in the schedule honestly and straightforwardly, and on the basis &#39;of the accepted interpretation&#39;of &#34; superficial feet.&#34; I trust that the Committee will not agree&#39; to the Treasurer&#39;s&#39; proposal. Wherever duties are in dispute between the two Houses, are they not supposed to endeavour to meet each other&#39;s views? Yet we are being asked to go wider apart. The Senate wishes to double the higher duty it first asked in some cases, and to make it two and a half times as much in others. To make such a proposal is not the right way to arrive at a settlement, and I hope, therefore, that it will not be agreed to. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for North Sydney, who always carefully prepares his speeches, was more extravagant than usual to-night. He asked that this matter be dealt with honestly and straightforwardly, as if an attempt were being made to deal otherwise with it. He spoke, too, of definitions known to Courts; but the only definitions to guide the Judges are those contained in the Acts which they have sworn to interpret. The laws of some of the States differ from those of that from which the honorable, member comes, and. yet they are quite as properly and honestly administered. Therefore, part of his argument was so much clap-trap. </para>

No one wishes to restrict it. But he put forward a piece of special pleading, when he tried to show that if the word &#34; white &#34; is inserted, and kauri pine made dutiable at other rates, the duties would be increased by so much. </para>

                        <para>- There are always defects in a Tariff, . with which to buttress arguments not otherwise sound, and the honorable member has chosen one in this instance, and pointed to another regarding the size of timber under \ inch. The insertion of the word &#34; white &#34; is important from the point of. view discussed by him, though I do not think that that part of the proposal is as serious &#39;as the other. The Committee will do justice to all the States if it insists upon higher duties. It is not enough to say that enough timber is not produced in Australia to meet the demand. </para>

                        <para>- Probably there are not five protected industries in Australia, capable of supplying the demand for their productions. That is not a reason for refusing adequate protection. The soft woods, are practically unimportant compared with the hard woods. The millions of wealth that are. going to waste in connexion with the hardwood timber is a public scandal : and even if there were a very much higher duty, it would prove of good service to the country. I hope the Committee will accept the &#39; new definition . requested by the Senate; because it is a fair and reasonable one, and undoubtedly based on a true protective principle. </para>

I propose to agree to the alteration proposed by&#39; the Senate for the same reason. When the matter was last under consideration, the definition, applied to timber i inch or less in thickness. As requested to be amended, it will apply to timber &#39;not more than1 inch nor less than &#189; inch in thickness.

                    <para>. - The custom of the trade has been to sell timber on the ordinary definition of &#34;superficial foot.&#34; Throughout the British Dominions there has been one custom. The honorable member for Wide Bay has told us that there is an exception) in Queensland. I can only say that when Queensland buys timber she buys on the ordinary definition of &#34; superficial foot &#34; and when she sells timber outside Queensland - I do not know what is the case inside the State - she sells under the same definition. It is rather a serious matter to alter the customary method of measuring timber for the purpose of affecting Customs duties. It is wrong to tamper with our weights and measures. If we have to impose duties, let them be imposed straightforwardly under the Tariff: Do not let us adopt a definition which entirely revolutionizes the ordinary methods of measurement. If we do this sort of thing we really do not know what the effect will be in many cases. In my belief the definition proposed will have effects that the Treasurer does not anticipate. One effect may be that thick timbers may be&#39; free of duty altogether. Let honorable members observe the wording of the definition. It is proposed that a superficial foot shall mean an area of 1 square foot on one surface, and being not more than i inch nor less than&#189; inch in thickness. The duties that are fixed on the basis of &#34; super, foot,&#34; as really all but one of them are, will be regulated by that definition ; and timber which is not less than1 inch in thickness will, in my opinion, come in free. I am pointing out what may be an awkward result from a departmental point of view. When the term &#34; super, foot &#34; is used, it means an area1 foot square and1 inch in thickness. The custom is established and recognised in trade and law, and in the Department, that that inch is carried right through the wood, so that wood which is  6  inches&#39; thick and  12  inches x  12  inches on the. surface is reckoned as  6  super, feet. But under the new definition now proposed, there is no custom to work upon, and  1  hold that, the effect of the words will be to levy the duty on timber which is less than an inch thick, but not on thicker timbers. In my opinion, the thicker timber will come in free, because the Tariff applies duties per super, foot, and in the definition that term is defined as less than r. inch in thickness. But if the duty should apply to thicker timber, . what is the Department going to do with timber over  1  inch in thickness? For instance, is the Department going to attach the definition and apply extra duties to timber that is between1&#189; inch and  2  inches? Is the definition going to apply to timber between1&#189; inch and  2  inches, and between2&#189; and  3  inches, and between  3&#189;  and  4  inches in thickness? How will the Department apply the definition? </para>

The effect will be, to double the duty on&#189;-inch timber and increase it largely on other sizes between&#189;-inch and1-inch. We ought not to impose duties by altering a standard of measurement that has been recognised by the Customs Department ever since we have had a Federal Tariff. </para>

                    <para>. - There is no doubt that the Committee is pretty well divided, over this matter. I recollect a celebrated occasion during the consideration of the timber duties in the last Tariff, when an ardent and courageous Victorian protectionist happened to vote accidentally on the side which suited his own particular interest at that time, and to reduce the duty. The situation seems to me pretty much like that to-night. The honorable member for North Sydney enlarged upon the great increase of price that this alteration would cause. How much does it mean? On7/8-inch timber the duty under the present system would be1s.  3¾d.,  while under the proposed system it would be is.  6d.  The difference on that size would, therefore, be  2&#188;d.  On f-inch timber the duty at present would be1s.1&#189;d., and under our proposal1s. 6d. These are actual facts, verified by the Customs officers, as against scandalously, erroneous statements published by manufacturers here regarding the increase of duty. On 5/8-inch timber the present duty would be11¾d., and the new would be1s. 6d., while on&#189;-inch timber the difference would be 9d. as against1s. 6d. . Where are the three or four-fold increases that some honorable members have said that this proposal meant? Some honorable members have been stuffed with that information. </para>

                        <para>- I am . speaking from actual personal conversations with members. One of the oldest members in this State - and a very honorable member - who made the mistake in 1902, told me that this proposal would increase the duty three or four-fold. That is the kind of misstatement that one has to meet in a matter of this kind- started bv gross selfish prejudice, and nothing more nor. less than attempts to influence votes by false reasoning and false information. </para>

                        <para>- The duties . proposed are lower on the average than the old duties. Nearly every large sized timber is practically free. We hear a great deal about butter-boxes and fruit-cases. This definition in no way affects them. The timber between 1 inch and&#189; inch comes mostly from the Baltic, Korea, and&#39; Siberia. How can protectionist members object to an increase of duty on timber 6 inches by 7/8- inch, of 2&#188;d. per 100 super, feet? Is that a large increase, having regard to the additional cut in that wood? </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing with the main argument advanced by the opponents of the proposal. I am astonished at some of the votes given by men who pretend to be protectionists. I will take the ground of the honorable member for Parkes, who stands out as an absolute revenue tariffist. He said that 15 per cent, was a fair revenue duty; but this is not a 15 per cent, duty. It is not a revenue duty. The&#39; reason why a protective duty is not given to the timber industry of Australia seems to be that a few men, who are more interested in the importation of timber than in using a product of our own country, have been able to influence this Parliament more than have those who are interested in native production. I do not think that any amount of argument will influence honorable members, but this question is far. more important, if members are prepared to deal fairly with the timber-getters and saw-millers and sawmill employes of Australia, than the vote which has just been taken. I appeal to honorable members, to give some consideration to the timber industry. </para>

                    <para>. - My objection to the proposal of the Senate is that it is an attempt to get in by a side wind what the Committee refused to do before. We have already fixed the duties on timber. It is just as unreasonable to try to increase them now by altering the standard. of measurement as it would be to increase the duty on spirits by proposing that a quart should be called a gallon. That is what honorable members are trying to dp. After the&#39; duties have been fixed, . they are endeavouring, by a side-wind, to secure an increase. That is a very undesirable way of treating this question.&#34; </para>

                <para class="block">The item has&#39; been divided in accordance with what would appear to be the wish of this Committee, as well as of the Senate The divisions are those required by the trade. The object of the modification, so far as paragraph b is concerned, is to carryout what was apparently the desire of some honorable members who, after the original request had been dealt with, pointed out that an error had been made. The new wording, of the request will afford the full protection desired by all parties. Glace and dull kid are manufactured in New South Wales of superior qualities, and a duty of 20 per cent, is a necessary protection to that industry. The other leathers are made in several . States in varying qualities, and the 2d. per square, foot will afford them ample protection, while imposing only a nominal duty on the superior qualities imported. That was one of the items which were referred to during the discussion on recommittals in this House in December last. The combined conference of tanners and bootmakers agreed to this proposed duty of 2d. per square foot in preference to the Government&#39;s original proposal that duties of 30 per cent, and 20 per cent, should be imposed. Through an oversight in this House the duty on this sub-item was allowed to go. at 20 per cent., but on the honorable member for South Sydney mentioning the matter, I promised to have it looked into in the Senate. The result is this request to carry out the originally accepted recommendation of the combined farmers&#39; and bootmakers&#39; conference. Twopence per square foot works out at considerably less than 20 per cent, on the better classes, and up to almost as high as 36 per cent, on the cheaper classes. </para>

                    <para>.Under this proposal, the industry will receive no protection, seeing that the duty on its raw material is 15 per cent. At least, the dutv should be fixed at 20 per cent. Originally it was proposed to levy 30 per cent. ; then, as a compromise, it was reduced to 20 per cent. ; and now it is proposed to give no protection. Why is not the industry entitled to some protection? Under the Victorian Tariff a duty of 33 per cent, was levied. So fair as stained glass windows  are concerned, I am in favour of prohibition, because they are made in Germany, where men work seven days per week.

                <para class="block">Surely the churches of Australia are not in favour of utilizing the products of1 Sunday labour in Germany ! I am sure that not one person in a thousand will be in favour of having the&#39; churches fitted with stained glass windows made on Sunday. In the case- of this industry I would just as- soon vote for free-trade as for a duty of 15 per cent., because that is no protection at all. In Australia the workers &#39;in this industry are paid&#163;3 a week as against , &#163;1 iri Germany. No less than 250 persons are engaged throughout the Commonwealth, and yet they are to be told to-morrow that they are to receive no protection, although their raw materia&#93; is taxed at the rate of 15 per cent. </para>

No reason has been given why we should. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 30 per cent., but now we are asked to impose a duty of only 15 per cent. I trust that the . Committee will adhere&#39; to its original decision. </para>

                    <para>. - This is one of those cases in connexion with which apparently no one desires to say anything lest he should offend a body of very excellent people, who are no doubt very useful in their way. The proposal that these stained glass windows should be admitted free of duty is put forward as a concession to the churches. I agree with the honorable member for Batman, that the proposal should be resisted if the Committee intends to deal justly by local artists. We have taxed nearly the whole of the materials required in their industry, and vet it is proposed that the . finished product should be admitted at 15 per cent. If there is any hypocrisy in this legislation it is in this proposal. It cannot be excused by anything but the unmanly desire to  please everybody, even though just claims should be ignored. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise to discover what is really the attitude of the Government on this question. I understood from the earlier debate on the item that the Government were prepared first of all to agree to the admission1 of stained glass windows free, and then to impose a duty of 15 per cent., which every one seemed to be in favour of. Afterwards, when some one so much as whispered 20 per cent., the Minister was ready to propose that duty. I understand that the Minister was at first disposed to accept the Senate&#39;s request, but he has now decided that it would not be politic to do so. I should . like to know whether the attitude of the Government in the matter is based on fiscal grounds? It is well known that the Treasurer postures as a protectionist throughout Australia, but we have heard to-night . that he is in favour of the introduction of stained glass windows free of duty. </para>

                    <para>.I am prepared to support a duty of 15 per cent. in this case. It is very strange that the Senate, which is supposed to be a protectionist Chamber, after suggesting the increase of many duties passed by this Committee should, in the matter of stained glass windows, be prepared to tax the local manufactures on the glass, oil, paint brushes, lead, and everything that goes to make a stained glass window while requesting that the finished product of the industry should be admitted free. I should like to know why this is so. I wish also to point out to the honorable member&#39; for Batman that it is proposed to levy a duty of 15 per cent. only upon the finished article. Nobody would dream of importing stained glass windows unless they were of good quality, and under the circumstances I think that 15 per cent. is a fair, rate to impose. I believe that stained-glass windows can be produced in the Commonwealth equal to any that can be imported. I know that in South Australia a firm known as Montgomery and Grimley used to do excellent work in the production of this class of. windows. Formerly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Montgomery</inline> was accustomed to send out stained-glass windows of his own manufacture from England. But after establishing himself in South Australia he found that a prejudice existed against the Australian article. As a result, one of the partners had to leave the firm. I shall support the proposal of the honorable member for Wentworth. </para>

                    <para>.-Sir Joshua Reynolds, whose name is famous in the art world, once attempted to paint a window in one of the churches at Oxford ; and it was acknowledged by himself to be a failure. It is only the man who. has had experience in this particular branch of art who can make a painting on glass. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> know that as distinguished from seascape, skyscape, or landscape, painting on glass is an art in itself ; and it is a fact that on the Continent one work of art of the kind is taken as a model, and hundreds of replicas are produced, for which the original artist receives not one penny. I should be willing to admit free a window, if it were made evident that it was an artist&#39;s own work and not a replica, turned out, as it were, by machinery. If the  deputy  leader of the Opposition would make inquiries, he would see that the artists here ought to have a fair chance of competing. </para>

                            says that, but for the tax on the raw material, he would not have required a duty on the finished article. I venture to say, however, that a duty of  10  per cent, would be more than compensation.

I  very much regret that owing to a mistake which was entirely my own, the honorable member for Capricornia&#39; was precluded from being paired in the division on the definition of &#34; superficial foot &#34; in connexion with the timber duties. I arranged to get a pair for the honorable member, but found that I could not do so. I extremely regret the mistake which occurred, and am only glad that the absence of the honorable member from the division in no wav affected the result. </para>

                        <para>-  I should further like to say that the honorable member for Capricornia remained unpaired owing to no fault of mine. What happened was that each honorable member who desired to have a pair was paired so far as I knew. But I understand that the honorable member- for Wentworth, in order&#39; to insure&#34; a pair .for the honorable member for Angas, took the precaution to get two. honorable members ti stand out from the division. When I discovered that,&#39; there was no way of remedying what had been done except by altering the pair-book, as originally entered up. This the honorable member for Wentworth did without my sanction, by altering a pair I had inserted, and writing in one to suit himself. &#39;  1  at once protested against the alteration, and insisted upon the original pair being retained. &#39; I am sorry that the &#34;honorable member for Capricornia did not get his pair, but the fault was not mine. </para>
