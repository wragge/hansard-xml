                        <para>- The answers to the honorable member's questions are as follow :  -  1 and  2.  Yes. In 1904 the Militia Garrison Artillery at Warrnambool and Port Fairy was converted into a Field Battery. The battery was armed with four 40-pounder R.B.L. guns pending the arrival of carriages for the 4.7-in. Q.F. guns with which it was proposed to equip the battery. These carriages are now available, and the battery will shortly be equipped with comparatively up-to-date 4.7-in. Q.F. guns. These guns will be available not only for service with the Field. Force, but also for garrison defence. It is considered that 4.7-in. Q.F. guns compare very favorably with any fixed defences which could, at present; be provided at these places. </para>

No honorable member of this Parliament, and no citizen of Australia, will dispute the statement that the first task incumbent upon  this House after the last general election was to deal with the Tariff proposals of the Government, at all events, it would be impossible for this Government to subordinate that question at this time, and under present circumstances, to any other, no matter how important that other issue might be. We owe it to the commercial community, to industrial Australia, and to our constituents, that no matter what transpires in this House, there shall be no interregnum, so far as&gt; we can prevent it, between the return of the Senate's suggestions in regard to the Tariff, and their final disposition by agreement between the Houses. </para>

                        <para>- I thought that on Thursday, night - and think so still. On Thursday night, the suggestions made by the Senate in regard to the Tariff had not been placed in my colleague's hands from his officers, and have only been under his consideration since that time. The Cabinet had not seen them. Consequently at that moment it would have been impossible to proceed with their consideration, as we now propose to proceed, at the earliest possible day. There has been no postponement. . If honorable members will look at the number - several hundreds - of suggestions which have been made, and recognise what their complete classification and consideration means, I. think that they will agree with me that remarkable expedition is being displayed in dealing with them, if we are prepared to take them in hand, as we propose, next week. Speaking for this House as a whole,' we have, 1 believe, an immediate duty in that regard, which has claims prior to any other claims that can . be urged upon us - not that this comprises by any means the whole programme of this Parliament or of this Government, nor that it is the only obligation, for there are many, more. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. We were urged by its mover to regard it as a perfectly friendly motion. The action taken was not that honorable member's' fault, nor was it the fault of any other honorable member, it was simply in the discharge of what the Government believed to be its duty. But that is a matter with which I shall take an opportunity of dealing when the question comes before us again. It is only from motives of our own, and in accordance with our own policy, that we feel obliged to treat it as hostile. But that is of our own choice. There is nothing in the motion itself which necessarily conveys a reflection on this Government. The Government do not recognise that the condition of the Postal Department which calls for special treatment or- for inquiry has been brought about by any legislative or administrative action of their own or of this Parliament. But those questions will be dealt with in their proper place. Consequently, although there has been no change in the attitude of the Government in that regard, I see no constitutional obstacle to the House proceeding with business. But I shall endeavour to meet, as far as possible, the wishes of the House as to the particular business to be proceeded with. For instance, I take it that the Additional Estimates are not likely to arouse what may be strictly considered party feeling. </para>

                        <para>- It should be dealt with as such. Consequently I suggest its inclusion in the list of matters to be considered. I also suggest - in regard to a measure which meets with the unanimous approbation of the House - the consideration of the Surplus Revenue Bill. Upon that measure practical unanimity exists. But dealing with business in advance, it is probable - or, at least, we may hope - that when the Senate has the Tariff returned to it, the justice and wisdom of any amendments made by this House, will be so luminously' apparent that we shall have it returned without any further requests, and thus shall not be required to occupy time in reconsidering it. -At all events our object now is to deal with the Tariff and with no other question, except for the purpose of utilizing any necessary intervals of parliamentary time, for which we shall not be responsible. So far as is possible we are anxious to deal with the Tariff 'and with nothing but the Tariff. But we wish to put to some good use any intervals which may occur. </para>

                        <para>- Whether they have ceased to blow or whether they rise again, nothing can alter the necessity of the present situation, which is to dispose of the fiscal question. In public, honorable members opposite have been praying for that for a long time past, and honorable members in the Opposition corner have apparently desired nothing else. There can be no question as to what this side of the House wishes in the matter. Consequently, I believe that we may expect an absolutely unanimous vote in favour of f ul&gt;filling the duty of Parliament in the present situation. I have, therefore, great pleasure in moving the motion. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that we may all congratulate the Prime Minister upon his apparent recovery from that, acute fit of political indigestion from which he was suffering on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday last. I had not the pleasure of being an inhabitant of- Melbourne during the past three or four days, but I have sufficient information to know that the members of the Government have passed through a very trying time. So have my honorable friends below the' gangway. 1 </para>

The honorable member for Gwydir is in a position to know - and every honorable member who voted with him oh Thursday night, knows - that in no way whatever did he or any other, member of the party to which he belongs inform me of his intention to take the step 'which he did-. He took that step entirely without any intimation to me, and from first to last I have not exchanged a single word upon the subject either with the honorable member himself or with any other honorable member of his party .who voted with us on that occasion. When, therefore, the Prime Minister accused me of political cajolery in influencing members of the Labour Party he gave me credit for more than I deserve. Asa matter of fact, I made no such endeavour, and I think that the reflection conveyed by his accusation is not upon me, but is upon those honorable members who are suspected, of being likely to be influenced by any advances which I might make.. </para>

I am satisfied so long as the honorable member will have that opportunity. But I must say that I think that the Prime Minister -I am sure it was not done designedly - forgot the ordinary courtesies that were due to me in relation to this matter. When an arrangement had been made between two leaders in accordance with which the head of a Government proposed to take a certain course of action, I think it was. due to me that the Prime Minister should have told me what he was. going to move and why hie was going to move it. The honorable gentleman gave me no hint. </para>

                        <para>- There is a proper way of dealing with a proposition of this sort. Only trouble could arise out of an indirect method. The only method which the honorable member had of bringing forward his proposition in a distinct way was by following the course which he adopted. Private business has been abandoned for the rest of this session. No private member can bring any thing before the House unless in the way which the honorable member for Gwydir adqpted. I did not desire to see the honorable member deprived of his fair and legitimate opportunity of proposing a thing which I heartily approved of. I did not want him to be deprived of that opportunity by what seemed to be sharp practice -because the effect of it was sharp practice. The effect of the amendment of the Prime Minister for adjourning grievance day would have been to deprive the honorable member of his opportunity for a month. Would that have been dealing with the honorable member fairly? What I desired to do was this : An amendment was actually drafted to carry out the undertaking of the Prime Minister. We were going to propose an amendment in place of his, the effect of which would have been that we should have gone on with the Capital Site question, and the Government would also have given the honorable member for Gwydir an opportunity of proceeding with his motion immediately that question was disposed of. That amendment was written out at the table, but before I had an opportunity of suggesting it, the Prime Minister rose, and asked leave to withdraw his amendment. I rose to suggest 'the course that I had resolved upon, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> very properly informed me that there could be no debate on the question of withdrawal. I had no opportunity, therefore, of endeavouring to solve the question in a manner that would have been just to the Government, just to the Capital Site question, and fair to the honorable member far Gwydir. I had to accept the request of the Prime Minister that he have leave to withdraw his motion. But to me it will be wonderful if it turns out that honorable members knowing on Thursday that the honorable member for Gwydir was going to take the action that he. did - and I am told that it was well known in the corridors during the day that he intended to do so- </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the solidarity party ought to complain if occasionally the Opposition has a spasm of solidarity. Honorable members who year after year stand together as solid as adamant might occasionally allow honorable members below the gangway and the Opposition to vote together. That does not occur very often. </para>

                        <para>- In the ranks of their supporters the Ministry have only two representatives of New South Wales and one representative of Tasmania. If five or six members of the Labour Party at any time asserted their independent convictions on a matter of considerable importance on which they felt strongly they would certainly cause a crisis. The position of the Government is. such that a crisis would occur at any time that five or six honorable members of the Labour Party differed from them on an important matter such as is that relating to the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the administration of a Department of the Public Service. The Opposition are not to blame. I do not think they are ashamed of the vote they gave. I do not think that we have reached a position in which any honorable' member is a bit ashamed of the vote he gave. The crisis has been caused by six or seven members of the Labour Party exercising their honest convictions on an important matter without regard to the interests of the Government. We are not responsible for that. It is rather too bad to expect us to go to the assistance of the Government, although' it would be very convenient for them if we always did so. They have had our votes more than once to save them when the Labour Party have been against them, and they expect us when six or seven honorable members of that party break away, to rush to their assistance and patch up their position. I do not think an Opposition can fairly be expected to perform that service for the Government unless there is involved a matter of principle on which they are in agreement with the Ministry. Unfortunately on the occasion under review we were absolutely opposed to the Government. We felt that a Royal Commission should be appointed, and the only course open to us was to vote for the honorable member for Gwydir's proposition. I can only say that if the honorable member for Gwydir accepts the compromise proposed by. the Prime Minister I accept it with him. I raise no point upon it, feeling sure that he will carry his proposal to a straight out issue when the proper time comes. As to the Tariff, could any one have a greater interest in getting it out of the way than the Opposition have? The Opposition is absolutely powerless so long as the fiscal question remains unsettled ; consequently, the Prime Minister, so far as party interests are concerned, has taken a course which is just as advantageous to the Opposition as it is to the Government. </para>

                        <para>- It is advantageous to all parties. I urged at the last general election that we should allow the fiscal question to remain undisturbed - that the Tariffshould remain as it was-but a large majority of the electors decided that the fiscal question should be re.-opened. To complete it and put it aside now that it has been re-opened is an interest common to all parties in this Parliament, and it will be well for the Commonwealth when that has been done. That being so, the actual result of this arrangement will not be harmful - it will probably be beneficial so long as the matter respecting which we have been so much in earnest is not pushed aside. I hope now that this storm is over we shall be able to go to our respective homes and enjoy a very pleasant Easter. </para>

I was aware at the time that even if my motion were  brought on and carried on a division the Government would not regard it as a vote of censure. </para>

                        <para>- No; but the Prime Minister himself a few days before the occasion in question had endeavoured to secure for me an opportunity to submit the motion to the House. I was therefore quite right in doing what I did to secure an opportunity to carry it. I can assure the Prime Minister that, when speaking to the leader of the Opposition, I was careful not to indicate when I intended to submit the motion, and I repeat that it was with the knowledge that the Government would not regard the carrying of the motion as a vote of censure upon them, that I took action. Having done that, I sought support for it in every part of the House, and the support of the right honorable member for East Sydney as well as that of other honorable members. I have spoken now merely with the desire to remove what seemed to me to be an impression that I was doing something that was unfaithful to my party. </para>

I am glad that the honorable gentleman's declaration that the Government' intend to proceed with the consideration of the Tariff until it becomes law has been received with so much favour in every quarter of the Hoube. </para>

                        <para>- When it is convenient to do so I am always very glad to answer interjections, but I venture to say that the main object for which the House assembled to-day . has been accomplished, and it would be of no use to. debate other questions. I presume that honorable members wish to catch the Inter-State trains that they may enjoy a week's holiday in their homes. We have every assurance that the important question dealt with in the motion of the honorable member for Gwydir will be fully discussed, and that an ample opportunity will be given the House to arrive at some conclusion upon it. The question to which it must give place is one which concerns the country rather than members of Parliament, and every one will be exceedingly glad that the Prime Minister has undertaken to complete its consideration at the earliest possible moment. I wish to suggest to the honorable gentleman that it is doubtful whether any other business should be permitted to intervene between the settlement of the Tariff and the resumption of the debate on the motion of the honorable member, for Gwydir. I congratulate the House upon the. wav in which the Prime Minister's motion has been received. </para>

I set out to deal with the matter covered by my motion in no. party spirit, and without any desire to make it a party question. The re-adjustment of the wrongs that are known to exist in the Post and Telegraph Department should, in my opinion, be a matter absolutely above all party interests. </para>

                        <para>- I wish the honorable member for Robertson would say something relevant or intelligible when he speaks. So far as I am concerned,. I have felt it to be my duty to endeavour to secure the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into matters which I think can only be properly investigated by such a body. It is not a matter of very much consequence to me by. what means the appointment of such a Commission is secured. That is proved by what I said on Thursday evening, and by the fact that I stepped across to the other side of the House when the question of the adjournment of the debate came to a vote, because I thought that by doing so I was adopting the best means to bring about the result I desired. On that  occasion, it appeared to me evident that the Ministry were not prepared to give definite time for bringing my motion to an issue, and that is- why I voted as I did. At present, however, I have an assurance that the House will be given an opportunity to record a vote on my motion, and, consequently, I feel assured that I shall be able in the near future to secure the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department. </para>

That may be a disappointment to the honorable member, but I have no desire to help him over here. I can honestly say that, having had an opportunity to review the position since Thursday evening, I have found that to have pressed my motion to a vote on Thursday might not have resulted in the attainment of the object for which I moved it. I prefer to take no chances in the matter, and to accept a proposal which will lead to the attainment of the object I have in view - a thorough investigation of and report upon the Department in which I have interested myself.I repeat that I have no apologies to offer for taking the course I did. It is not my mission to put Governments out of office, or to serve the Opposition. It is rather my mission to serve the people, and that is what I have tried to do in the most effective and disinterested way possible under existing conditions. </para>

I, therefore, content myself by saying that in repeating what he had already said when interviewed by representatives of the press, the Prime Minister has, this afternoon, made some statements which are absolutely incorrect, and for which there is not a tittle of justification. What happened on Thursday afternoon? Honorable members are aware that the honorable member for Gwydir was anxious to discuss the question of an inquiry into the condition of the Post and Telegraph Department, but the moment the House met the Prime Minister, with an acrobatic swiftness which has never been equalled here, jumped in ahead of the honorable member with an amendment declaring that the consideration of that question should be postponed until the following day, knowing, when he did so, that the question could not be discussed on the morrow. </para>

                        <para>- It is idle for the Prime Minister to say that we were trying to block the Federal Capital question, when we were seeking by every means in our power to provide that it should take precedence of the motion of the honorable member for Gwydir. I think it right to make this explanation as to what actually took place on Thursday last. We did not object to the Prime Minister's amendment we took no exception to it. What we did want to provide, however, was that the matter should not be postponed for three weeks, and we endeavoured to secure that the Federal Capital question should not also be shelved. These two desires were in no way inconsistent. The Prime Minister, of all others, was the honorable member who, after declaring that the Capital. Site question should be decided at an early date, did his best to postpone it for at least three weeks. On him, therefore, is the responsibility for any delay that has taken place in regard to the settlement of that question. I do not mind, telling the Prime Minister something else about the Federal Capital question, if it will do him any good. I do not mind saying that, so far as I am concerned, a delay of a day or two will not hurt. That I wish the Prime Minister to understand, and I hope he is satisfied now. </para>

                        <para>- I believe time is fighting a little on the side of the honorable member just now, and doubtless that is. why he looks so pleasant. My answer to all the jibes of the Prime Minister is that we do not object to the postponement of the Federal Capital question for one or two days. This has been a mock political crisis  -  a sham affair - all through. It has been pathetic to read in the newspapers of the desire of the Prime Minister to resign office, and of his, only at the last moment, consenting to remain in office. These reports may or may not be correct ; the Prime Minister has not said one. word on the matter. But we have seen the Prime Minister in this kind of mood before.  His  attitude to-day is, "I do not wish to remain a minute in office, but for heaven's sake do what you can to keep me here ! " That is the explanation of what has gone on during the last week-end. Where is the Government Whip? That gentleman never had such a busy time in his life as he has had in squaring matters outside; and -the result of it all is that the Prime Minister has consented to retain office, in order to put the Tariff through. There may be some danger to the Tariff in consequence of a possible change in the Ministry, but, personally, I confess I do not see what that danger is, having regard to the position of the Tariff in this House. The Government, however, seem to scent some danger, and even the scenting of danger was a sufficient appeal to the Prime Minister to take the steps he has taken during the last week-end to ultimately persuade my honorable friends in the corner to take the action they propose to-day. I should like to know where we now stand. We are told that the motion of the honorable member for Gwydir is to be postponed until the Tariff is out of the way. But what is meant by the " Tariff " ? Do the Government mean by the " Tariff " the schedule of requests that is now before the House? Are my friends of the Labour Party going to assist the Government to put this Tariff on the statute-book at the earliest possible moment,' and then trust to luck as to the complemental part of the " new protection " in which they- are so interested? Does dealing with the Tariff mean dealing also with the "new protection," or are the members of the Labour Party going to deliberately assist the Government to pass the Tariff at the earliest possible moment, and then, it may be, aid in putting the Government out of office before the "new protection" proposals are dealt with? If that be so, I can only congratulate them on their attitude. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member ought to be under no misapprehension as to my attitude on. that question. It is for the honorable member to bear his own responsibility ; I have no right, and I do not propose, to quibble at any vote he may give. But it does seem to me that, after the specific declaration of the Prime Minister that the new and the old protection are indissolubly bound, so far as he is concerned, we have a right to have it made clear whether the postponement of the motion of the honorable member for Gwydir is to be until the complete protection proposals have been dealt with, or only until the old protection proposals have been placed on the statute-book ? That is a question on which I should expect to hear something from .my honorable friends in the Labour corner. I dare say they have made up their minds, and I only throw this hint out, because I shall be glad to hear what the complete proposals of the Government amount to. As I said before, this " crisis " has, in my judgment, been a sham from beginning to end. The threatened resignation was a sham - there never was a resignation, threatened or intended. This is simply a repetition of tactics on the »part of the Prime Minister with which we are by this  time well acquainted, and they, . therefore, cause us no surprise.  I say now,, as I have said during the whole qf the last week-end, that there will be no resignation, and that no resignation was ever intended by the Prime Minister. </para>

                    <para>-- I have never heard the honorable member for Parramatta speak without something of bitternesss. It is not,' perhaps, altogether what the honorable member says, but " it's the narsty way 'e ses it." Of course, the old fable of the fox and the grapes will naturally recur to : honorable members. There was one word I was sorry to hear from the honorable member for Parramatta, and that had reference to his charge of an absence of straightforwardness. When the honorable member was a leader of the Labour Party, I know that we wished we could transfer him from- New South Wales to Victoria, but, after my experience of him in this House, I am glad that we did not catch him. </para>

                        <para>- There may be, but the honorable member for Parramatta has certainly astonished some of his friends, and, I dare say, some of his enemies. We may, however, compliment the honorable member on his unswerving opposition to the Government. I really believe that . if the Government were composed of angels from heaven, the honorable member for Parramatta would be able to find some grounds for complaint. I hope that some day the  honorable member will be freed from the duty of filling the disagreeable post of acting leader of the Opposition, by the House deciding to elect its own Ministers. In that event there will be no Opposition in the present sense, when the " outs " are always trying to displace the " ins." I am sorry that the right honorable member for East Sydney is not in the chamber. He made a statement that was not fair to the Government, to the effect, that there were no. South Australian or. Western Australian members sitting behind them. Mav I ask him how many members from Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia are sitting behind him? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member's opinion of that corner nearly coincides with my own, and I do not think they would welcome it. The right honorable member for East Sydney did not mention the fact that New South Wales, by its population, can claim twenty-seven votes in this House as against Victoria's twenty-two. The difference is five votes and the direct Opposition ' has exactly' five votes more than the straight-out Ministerial party. There is nothing for the right honorable member to boast of in that.  The honorable member for Parramatta will admit -that in the direct Opposition there are  members who are more in unison with the Labour Party than with the Opposition Corner Party. Out of the twenty-seven New South Wales members, there are only about twelve behind the leader of the Opposition, while he has not even one Victorian supporter. I hope the proposal of the Prime Minister will be agreed to as quickly as possible. By no act of mine in this House would I willingly have thrown the Tariff into the turmoil of a political crisis. I know that in one firm alone, over 200 more employes have been taken on, while 800 have had their salaries increased. That was due to the difference of 3d. agreed to by this House in the Excise duty on hand-made and machine-made cigarettes. If we went back to the conditions of the old Tariff, which was most incomplete, 200 employes at least would lose their places, and the other 800 would have their wages reduced. For that reason alone, I would take no step to prevent the Tariff from finally passing. I am, after eighteen years' experience in Parliament, against Royal Commissions. If the House wants to remove the abominations that may exist not only in the Post and Telegraph Department, but in other branches of the Public Service, let us be honest, pass an eight-hours Bill, provide that every, hour of overtime shall be paid for, and compel officers to send in their claims every week. If that were done, there would be no need for a Royal Commission. Later on, when that question comes before the House, I shall put my arguments forward. I will content myself now with saying that I hope the day will come when there will be no Opposition to be led by the honorable member for Parramatta, and when, no honorable member will consider it his duty to strike at the Government at every opportunity, no matter what happens. That is not democratic, or in accordance with Australian sentiment, and the sooner it is ended, the better. </para>

                    <para>. - I deeply regretted to hear from the Prime Minister's statement that Order of the Day No. 2 - Seat of Government Bill - would be postponed. I think he assumed more than he was justified in doing, when he . assumed that his amendment, moved on Thursday last, in connexion with grievance day, was going to be defeated. I came to the House specially to deal with the Federal Capital Site question, putting aside several important, business engagements to' be present. Before I came to the House I made inquiries in the proper quarter as to the course I should have to take to bring forward on grievance day my motion to place the Post and Telegraph Department, in Commission - a determination which would revolutionize that part of the Public Service. I might have prepared to rise just as the honorable member for Gwydir rose, to put forward my motion, had I wished to postpone the consideration of the Capital Site question. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. I want the Prime Minister to understand that the House may not have been against him on that day, when he thought it was. I was prepared to bring on my motion, but had no intention of pressing it then, because I understood that the Prime Minister wished to bring on the Federal Capital Site question. The honorable gentleman did not take a vote, and so he does not know that ' this side would have voted against him, but he withdrew his motion. He must not' be piqued," therefore, because he had a wrong impression, and so postponed the consideration of the Capital Site. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so; a great deal of impromptu talking was done, but, if honorable members had had an opportunity for reflection for an hour or so, many of those speeches would not have been made. What I am concerned about is that the Prime Minister is now going to penalize New South Wales because of what appears to be a crisis. If I am a judge of what is going on, there is no course open to the Prime Minister except to resign on a certain day - that is, When Orders of the Day Nos. 4 and 5 have been disposed of. I hope, however, that the Prime Minister will not take that course, but will go on with the Capital Site question. If he is prepared to condone and overlook the humiliation that certain honorable members have sought to impose upon him, he can safely do so. I will support him to the fullest of my power, if he will bring on  the Seat of Government Bill after the consideration of the Tariff has been disposed of. </para>

I must congratulate the Prime Minister on having been able so successfully to save his face on the present occasion, but I warn him that the people of New South Wales, at any rate, are getting tired of these proceedings. </para>

If a situation unpleasant to Ministers has arisen, the responsibility rests, not with the Opposition, but with that section of Ministerial supporters. Personally, I was desirous of getting on with the Federal Capital question, and rose several times to speak, but was unsuccessful in catching your eye, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> 1 hope that the question will be revived at as early a date as possible. I wish also to protest against the proposed postponement of business now. Notwithstanding the declaration of the Prime Minister as to the urgency of dealing with the Tariff, it is proposed that we shall not enter upon our work for another week. Some honorable members have been obliged to travel 600 miles to get here this afternoon, and we have to-night to return another 600 miles without having, done anything. We have met, but there is no business to be transacted. The least the Government might do, before calling the House together, is to find business for it to proceed with. Honorable members who have to travel long distances to attend here have a legitimate grievance when, on getting here, they are told that it is proposed to  adjourn for a week before proceeding to business. These proceedings are in the last degree Gilbertian, and those who read the accounts of them must be impressed with the absolute insincerity of the Government which is responsible for them. </para>

                <para>Mr.DEAKIN (Ballarat - Minister of External Affairs) [3.55]. - There is little to reply to, except the insinuation of the  deputy  leader of the Opposition that my course in withdrawing my amendment for the postponement of the consideration of grievances on Thursday last was taken because of my knowledge of his intention to propose another amendment. No hint, suggestion, or conception of such action on his part, or on that of any other honorable member, was in my mind when I withdrew my amendment. I wished to ask ten or fifteen minutes earlier for leave to withdraw it ; but, on mentioning the matter to my colleagues, they said, "Wait until we are certain that the House really wishes you to withdraw." What decided me in asking leave to withdraw my amendment was not a doubt as to what the House wished, but the objection that notice had not been given of my amendment. I admit that notice was not given, and that objection having been raised, felt bound to recognise it, and did so in the only way in my power, by asking leave to withdraw the amendment. </para>

                <para class="block">I allowed the formal motion for going into Committee of Supply, under which grievances are debated, to be proposed in the ordinary way, I should be challenged with having broken the compact with the Opposition. It had been telegraphed all over the Commonwealth that members would be invited on Thursday to vote on the Federal Site question, and no other, and I felt sure that, when it was found that they were being asked to deal with any or every grievance, I should be charged with having deliberately brought about the postponement of the Federal Capital Site question. My mistake was, that directly I found out that Thursday was grievance day., I did not point out the position to the House, and give notice of my intention to move to postpone the consideration of the Order of the Day for going into Committee of Supply. My action in moving the postponement of all grievances was impelled by the necessity for1 fulfilling our pledge; because I thought that my inaction would be distorted into an attempt to defeat the wishes of those to whom I had promised that we should deal with the Capital Site question. Those remarks dispose of the statements of the  deputy  leader of the Opposition, who has since said himself that there was strong reason for not dealing with the Capital Site question on Thursday, and that he had a motive for not wishing that the question should come on on the day fixed. </para>

                        <para>- I will be judged by those who heard what was said a few moments ago. The Minister of Trade and Customs replied by interjection to the statement of the honorable member. A colloquy took place between them, during which the honorable member stated that the prospects of Dalgety that night were too good. My colleague picked up the remark, and rejoined that he  thought that that was so, and that time was helping him. The honorable member for Parramatta did not agree with that statement, although he implied most distinctly that on Thursday last the prospects of the site which he is most anxious for were not so favorable as he wished them to be. </para>

                        <para>- I prove it by these facts : When I discovered that Thursday was grievance day; I took the only step in my power to keep the promise I had made to the House, that the vote on the Seat of Government Bill should be taken then, by moving the postponement of the consideration of grievances. I was aware that probably several honorable members intended to move amendments to the formal motion for going into Committee of Supply.

No one was certain that any of these amendments would be moved ; but every one knew that there were likely to be three or four amendments to the motion to go into Committee. I interposed with my amendment for the postponement df the consideration of the Order of the Day - not to interfere with the action of honorable members, but to keep faith with the House in regard to the Federal Capital Site. The instant I did so the leader and  the deputy leader of the Opposition took objection to that course, urged every reason against it, and appealed to the House to insist on the discussion of grievances. They did not- say " instead of the discussion of the Federal Capital Site " ; but the consideration of the Order of the Day involved the postponement ot the debate on the Seat of Government Bill. I warned them distinctly by interjection that by their action they were putting off that decision, and in spite of my warning they objected, as <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> have said.'

                        <para>- What would have been the result if his leader and himself had moved the amendment which they say they had prepared? Simply a debate on that amendment which would have shut out the Capital Site question just as decisively as anything else. Had they submitted an amendment of that character - to put aside the proposal of the honorable member for Gwydir in order to allow the Capital Site question to come on that evening - its consideration would have occupied the greater part, if not the whole of that sitting. Would a number of men who were so strongly moved as they afterwards stated in regard to the necessity for. a postal inquiry that they would allow nothing to intervene - would they 'have stood aside lo allow even the Capital Site  question  to intervene ? If the pledge to me had no binding effect on those who made it to me, why should it have a binding effect on those who did not make it, and therefore had not the same obligation? Therefore the statement as to the amendment is a mere cloud to cover their escape from the fact that their action put aside the consideration of the Capital Site, that their amendment would have done the same thing; and this too after an agreement had been arrived at all round the Chamber for its consideration on that day. I regret, sir, that I have been, obliged bv these constant interruptions to reply on this matter, but  venture  to say that there is nothing that honorable members on this side have to conceal. Certainly I shall be  only  the better pleased the more attention the honorable members opposite call to their conduct on the occasion referred to. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to debate the question,, but merely to state the' facts so far as I know them. I went and saw the Prime Minister on the evening of Wednesday last with- the honorable member for Parramatta. We both .arranged with the honorable and learned gentleman, in the ordinary parliamentary way, to take the vote on the Seat of Government Bill on Thursday afternoon at half-past 5 o'clock, or so soon afterwards as reasonable discussion would permit. At that time I had not the slightest knowledge of any business which was to intervene on " grievance " day. </para>

                        <para>-  What I wish to be distinctly understood is that I thought that the arrangement was that the consideration of trie Seat of Government Bill was to go on from Wednesday into Thursday, with no other business intervening. On Thursday morning I heard that other business was to intervene, and that there would be no opportunity to get to the Seat of Government Bill. The next day I was told by the honorable member for Booth by that several days before he had warned the Prime Minister that the proposal of the honorable member for Gwydir was to be moved, and that the numbers were against the Government. </para>

                        <para>-  I also rise to make a personal explanation. What the Prime Minister has said is correct so fax as it goes. I have not risen for the purpose of disputing what he said, except so far as he has tried to read into the report of Thursday's proceedings something which I think does me an injustice. An agreement was made, and I do not take any exception to anything which he said in that regard. But I do take exception to his statement that we insisted upon breaking the agreement. Here is <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and the honororable member will not find one word in the report of what took place on Thursday to show that I had any other desire than to facilitate the consideration of the Seat of Government Bill, as my interjection to the honorable member for Gwydir clearly proves. </para>

That is my explanation. </para>

                        <para>-  I also desire to make a personal explanation. Some days ago the honorable member for Boothby informed me that he was in favour of a proposal for appointing a Royal Commission in regard to the Post and . Telegraph Department. He said that the question was coming on again. There was no reference made at that time, and certainly I have not the least recollection of the honorable member referring to its being set down for, or coming up, on any particular day. In fact, at that time, I believe it was on the notice paper,and could not be brought forward on "grievance" day. The honorable member also told me, if my memory serves me aright, that he thought that a majority of his party were in favour of the appointment of a Royal Commission. He may have meant a majority of the House, but, if so, he did not convey his meaning to me. I took him to mean that a majority of his party were in favour of the proposal. I understood him to be referring to his own party. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps I may be permitted to take this opportunity of stating a point of order, because it bears so directly on what the honorable member for Melbourne has just said. The Prime Minister rose to ask leave to withdraw his amendment, and while he was standing, the honorable member for Parramatta called " I object," but that was not a call of which I could take any notice, because it was made while he was seated, and also at an improper time.I at once rose, and asked "Is it the pleasure of the House that the Prime Minister have leave to withdraw his amendment," and there was no objection. Had there been a single objection to that request - from the honorable member for Parramatta, or from any one else - I should have had to take notice of it, and the amendment could not have been withdrawn. </para>

                        <para>-  The honorable member for Melbourne is quite right. I did object to the Prime Minister withdrawing his amendment. But what was it? It was one to provide an opportunity for the consideration of the Capital Site question before the proposal of the honorable member for Gwydir. I did object to the with-' drawal of that. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to bring under the notice of the House a very regrettable fact, and that is that in Victoria criminals are being made indirectly out of the old-age pensions system. Anything I could say to persuade honorable members to push on with the question of establishing a Federal system I would gladly say. In Victoria, married sons, with families dependent upon them, are being sent to prison simply because they have not complied with an order made by a Court to contribute so much towards an old-age pension. The sooner that this question is taken up by this Parliament, the sooner will that regrettable state of things be removed. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner,- to his honour, instructed that no one should be sent to prison on account of his poverty, but I am sorry to say that it is now being done in Victoria under cover of a failure by a son to contribute to the provision of an old-age pension for his parents. </para>
