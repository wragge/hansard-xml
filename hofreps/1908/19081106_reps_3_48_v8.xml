                    <para>- I wish to make  a personal explanation. In to-day&#39;s issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> about one-third of a leading column is devoted to the report of the vapourings of a drunken man who was removed from the gallery yesterday. I have no complaint to make of that, because it is in keeping with the sense of proportion of those who conduct that paper in regard to the reporting of the proceedings of this House. But in that report I am represented as having intervened with some observations of a rather stupid character. I may make stupid observations - perhaps I make them frequently - but on this occasion I said nothing at all. That part of the report is, therefore, in keeping with the policy of the paper in regard to the truth. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister of Defence, a day or two ago, in answering a question which I addressed to him regarding the cost of &#39;the naval and military defence scheme, and the probable expenditure in the first year of the new system, suggested that the new system would not come into operation until the year 1910-11, or two years hence. That being so, I ask the Prime Minister fo consider - I do not expect an immediate answer - whether it would not be wise to appropriate the &#163;250,000 paid into a trust fund last year to the strengthening of the reserve for the old-age pensions, which are to be paid from the 1 st July next. </para>

                    <para>.- In view of the exceptionally long list of clauses recommitted, and the fact that the amendments foreshadowed completely alter the Bill, would it not be wise for the Government to withdraw it, and introduce a new Bill embodying their new proposals? A short time ago they proceeded with this Bill, and pushed it on with&#39; some degree of force, as though it were a life and death matter, involving the fate of the Government. Now, after a few days&#39; consideration by the Committee, the Treasurer submits a list of amendments which completely alter the whole character of the Bill. The dates are altered in a positively astounding manner, and the amounts reduced in some instances by almost 50 per cent. Yesterday the total sum was &#163;250,000. To-day it is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;150,000.</inline> Having dropped <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100,000</inline> in a day it is possible that by Tuesday next the Government, despite the eight years&#39; consideration previously given to the subject,  2114 <inline font-style="italic">Manufactures</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Encouragement Bill.</inline> may drop another &#163;100,000. From my point of view, the Bill would be more acceptable if that were done. </para>

If the Treasurer will withdraw the Bill, and submit an entirely new one, embodying the amendments which we are now asked to consider so hurriedly, it may receive a little more support than is Likely to be given at present. </para>

There is to be no undue change in the measure, and the amendments I have moved on this clause will simply postpone the commencement of the Act to the 1st January next. If the Bill is to be gone on with, I would ask the Committee to deal with it at once. Of course, if honorable members object to going on with it, I shall not be responsible, but shall do my best to pass it. </para>

                        <para>- Then how is it that so small a sum will be payable for those six months in respect of this industry, which we were told was to assume such gigantic proportions and employ thousands of men? The Government proposal seems to show rather a miserable state of things. Is it really contemplated that the output of pig iron, puddled bar iron, and steel, during the first half of next year will be so small as that amount indicates? </para>

                    <para>.- While I appreciate the desire of the Treasurer to have some limitation of the obligations under this Bill, I ask him to give us the benefit of his view as to the method of allocation. If this Bill were exceptionally successful and brought into existence, say, several two-blast furnaces, it is possible that the output of pig iron would be more than sufficient to absorb the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;30,000.</inline> Are we to understand that the Government, under regulations, will take into account the claims of the contending applicants, or will the measure be administered on the basis of first come, first served? I can conceive of circumstances under which, if several firms were permitted to claim, it would be necessary to spend &#163;50,000; and I should like to know how the Treasurer proposes to get over the difficulty? </para>

                        <para>- If I had to deal with the matter, J should make regulations to specify the kind of iron, and for the provision of full particulars, on which I should be guided. The foundation of all is the pig iron ; and it might be, if sufficient of that were produced, that there would be a desire to encourage the production of angle and other iron. I am afraid, however, there is no chance, for some years at least, of the supply of local pig iron being greater than the demand, having in view the large importations at the present time. I am now merely expressing an opinion without having carefully thought the matter out ; but I should say that the regulations would set forth the proportion in which the bonus would be paid on each class of iron. </para>

These people, I suppose, will be entitled to the bounty, and also those engaged in making wire-netting window blinds, bird cages, and so forth. It would be interesting to know how the Treasurer proposes to sort out applications under those headings. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment submitted by the Treasurer seems to emphasize the position to which I drew attention a few moments ago. That amendment does not appear on the printed list which has been placed before us, and, personally, I did not hear a proposal that clause 5 should be recommitted, though I have no doubt it was submitted. At any rate, it would appear that, while, a few hours ago, the Treasurer had this printed list of amendments before him, as representing the sum total of his desires, we now find him submitting a further important amendment which does not appear on the  list. At first blush, the suggested amendment seems plausible, inasmuch as it is intended to prevent any particular manufacturer from scooping more than  &#163;30,000  in any one year. That is, perhaps, a reasonable suggestion on the part of the Treasurer, particularly in view of the fact that he is somewhat at a loss to find even the  &#163;^30,000  for the first year. Nevertheless, there are a few peculiar words added which, in my opinion, will enable manufacturers to wait, in case their plant is not in readiness this year, next year, or the year after, and, at the end of the five years, practically demand the whole of the  &#163;150,000.  The Treasurer, ought to retain that portion of his amendment which prescribes that no more than  &#163;30,000  shall be spent in any given year ; but I urge that if the amount is not claimed in that year, then it ought to be forfeited. Unless that is done, the Bill is not a Bounties Bill in the ordinary sense, but really provides for the present of  &#163;150,000  to some firm or firms. The question of the employes does not enter into the matter at all at this stage. It is possible that during the first two or three years the manufacturers may continue without asking for a bounty; but it is unreasonable to suppose that they will continue on terms not suitable to them, and, at the same time, not claim the bounty. There is no likelihood of any but one firm securing this bounty ; and, consequently, it would be better if we were to plainly say in a Bill of two clauses that the sum of  &#163;150,000  shall be paid to that firm at any time up to the end of  1914.  Apparently the Treasurer has only thought of this particular amendment within the last few hours. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with the caution displayed by the Treasurer ; and I took it that he meant the Parliamentary Draftsman. But why was this amendment not submitted to the Parliamentary Draftsman at the same time as were the other amendments? As a matter of fact, this amendment is merely an after-thought ; and the Treasurer does not seem to know for more than ten minutes at a time what he really wishes in reference to the BiU. I do not know whether the Treasurer has sufficient numbers behind him to pass the Bill in whatever form he pleases, but, seeing the indifference he displays, that is really the situation. So far as some members are concerned, at any rate, this amendment was not previously thought of, and has not been discussed either in House or Committee; and, practically, the only explanation given by the Treasurer is that the proposal will prevent more than  &#163;30,000  being paid in one year. As I say, that, at first sight, seems reasonable, considering the financial situation; but when there are words added which enable a manufacturer, at the end of five years from the 1st January next, to demand from the Federal Government the sum of  &#163;150,000,  no matter what the financial situation of the moment may be, it seems to me that the Treasurer has not fully considered or stated his case. It might be that for two or three years no demand would be made ; but it will be quite foreign to the elements in our national life for those entitled to bounties to delay their demand for any longer period than that laid down in the law. It is within the bounds of probability that early next year the Treasurer will have presented to him a request for payment of the bounty, in accordance with the general provisions of the Bill. What the prescribed regulations may be I do not know, but I hope that they will be drafted by the Crown law officers ; otherwise we may find that, with that liberality that characterizes some Treasurers, the honorable gentleman may, without prescribing regulations of a reasonable character, throw out the money to the persons whom he has in mind at present as intending to make application. When I heard the amendment read, it appeared to me to be of an exceedingly important character. It may reasonably be dealt with </para>

                    <inline font-style="italic">Encouragement Bill.</inline>
                    2117  in two parts. I fully agree with the first part, which provides that the maximum amount of the bounty that may be paid in any one year in respect of the goods specified in clause 1 of the schedule shall not exceed
                    <inline font-style="italic">&#163;30,000.</inline>
                    But the sting of the amendment is to be found in its tail, wherein it is provided that, where the maximum amount is not so paid in any year, the unpaid balance or any part of it may be paid in any subsequent year, in addition to the maximum amount for that year. We might have a manufacturer drawing during the first and second years only a few hundred pounds in respect of the bounty, and making a claim in the third year for something like &#163;90,000. The Treasurer would then find himself in an awkward predicament. I can imagine the situation so dramatically depicted a few days ago by the leader of the Opposition when, in referring to the financial situation, he pointed out that, had a few pounds more been expended here and there, the result would have been a deficit. Supposing that the Treasurer adheres to the Treasury bench for another three years, and then brings down a Budget similar to that which he submitted a few days ago, what will be the position of the leader of the Opposition if the Treasurer finds himself suddenly met with a claim for a. bounty totalling
                    <inline font-style="italic">&#163;85,000</inline>
                    or
                    <inline font-style="italic">&#163;90,000?</inline>
                    We should then have a deficit, not of a few, but of scores of thousands of pounds. If I read aright that part of the Budget which deals with contingencies likely to arise, the Treasurer has not made full provision for possibilities. We have had the criticism of some honorable members who claim to have special knowledge in this direction that the Treasurer seems to have lamentably failed to have regard to expenditure that is likely to be incurred in the future under measures to which the Legislature has already committed itself. Having been permitted to pursue his present course with impunity, it is reasonable to suppose that the Treasurer would continue to believe he could escape once more, and might with impunity bring down a Budget of a character that does not propose to meet such possibilities as this amendment suggests. I suggest to the honorable gentleman, with all due respect, that the latter portion of the amendment be excised. My object is to insure that the finances of the Commonwealth shall not be penalized to a greater extent than
                    <inline font-style="italic">&#163;30,000</inline>
                    in any one year during the five years period to which this provision relates. If the persons at whose instigation this Bill is put before the House failed during any one year to comply with the requirements of the Bill, they should forfeit the right to claim any portion of the bounty set apart to be paid in respect of that year&#39;s operations. We shall be doing reasonably good work if we say to those already engaged in the industry, or who may propose to embark upon it that provided they comply with the provisions of this Bill, there shall be at their disposal by way of bounty, &#163;30,000 per annum. But we should not say that irrespective of the conditions laid down, they shall all be able at any time within the five years period to make application for the full sum of
                    <inline font-style="italic">&#163;150,000</inline>
                    proposed to be set aside for this purpose. I hope that the Treasurer will agree to the excision of the latter part of the amendment.

                    <para>.- There is one point that I should like  to  ask the Treasurer to consider. In order  to  claim the full amount of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;30,000</inline> proposed to be set apart for the payment  of a  bounty at the rate of 12s. per ton, it will be necessary for the manufacturers to have an output of 50,000 tons per annum. According to the reports submitted to  us  the one firm now engaged in the industry at Lithgow could produce practically all the pig iron required to enable it to claim the whole of the bounty payable in one year. If the latter portion of this amendment is agreed to, it may suit the managers of the works to double or treble their output in any one year, to then put off their men and to claim the bounty in the following year. Our desire is, if possible, to keep the men in the industry in steady employment, but the latter portion of this amendment will leave the door open to men being discharged, and the works being shut down in the way I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>- No, but that course might be adopted for money -making purposes. The honorable gentleman ought to know that in many cases employers close down their works for their own purposes. A glut in the market is sometimes created, so that works may be shut down for a stipulated period. We ought to provide that the bounty payable in any one year should be claimed only in respect of pig iron produced during that year. 2118 <inline font-style="italic">Manufactures</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Encouragement Bill.</inline></para>

                    <para>.- There is a good deal of force in the contention that we should provide that the bounty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;30,000</inline> payable in any one year, shall be claimable only in respect of pig iron produced during that year. The main object which those who advocate the bounty have in view is to provide employment which shall be effective, in regard not only to the&#39; wages, but in respect of its continuity. The only modification of the amendment that now occurs to me is one which I think I put forward on a former occasion, and that is that we should provide that where pig iron has been manufactured so late in one year as to render it impossible for a bounty to be claimed on it during that year, the amount payable should be carried forward to the next year, so that it may be claimed in respect of the material which has actually been produced during the year for which it was set apart. I think that that is a fair way of doing it. There may be difficulty also where goods, though practically manufactured in one year, are finished in the next, though, no doubt, the regulations can provide for that. If nine-tenths of the work which is finished this year was done last, part of the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;30,000</inline> should be carried forward to provide for it. </para>

                        <para>-  I admit that the matter is a comparatively small one, and can, perhaps, be dealt with by regulation. But the clause should be so framed as to permit the carrying forward of an amount for application next year in regard to goods practically manufactured, but not finished, this year. The general principle that the payments should be about the same each year is a good one. </para>

                    <para>.- One gets a sharp shock of disappointment in comparing the Bill with the pictures of the enormous volume of industrial employment which it will bring about with which the Treasurer has delighted the people of Australia. According to the figures put before us, the whole amount of the bounty can be absorbed by the production of only  50,000  tons of pig-iron. If the manufacturers go beyond this rudimentary process, and convert the pig-iron into puddled bar-iron, a production of  25,000  tons will absorb the bounty-; while, if they go further, and make the bar-iron into steel, a production of  17,500  tons will do so. </para>

                        <para>- If there is a surplus in the first year, it should be carried forward. We should do nothing to prevent expansion. If this year the whole amount of the bounty is not applied for, any surplus - say <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10,000</inline> - should be available next year. That arrangement would tend to encourage expansion. We are voting a sum of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;150,000</inline> to give encouragement to the industry for a period of five years. But if we thought that the only effect of the bounty would be to bring about the production of  50,000  tons of pig-iron, and that no bar-iron or steel would be produced, we should not be enthusiastic about the project. Our hope is that the bounty will bring about the establishment of a great national industry. Since we are granting a bounty of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;150,000,</inline> we should not prevent the Government from meeting any expansion that may take place. Nothing would be gained by doing so. There is no principle in the arrangement as to annual payments. </para>

                        <para>- My proposal is in the interests of firms which have not yet come into existence. If <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10,000</inline> is left over from the first year, and goes to the second, a new firm may arise to claim a share in it. Honorable members have spoken as though only one firm is concerned, and I wish therefore to emphasize the fact that those at the head of it deserve everlasting credit for their industrial enterprise. Of course, all business men seek their own profit ; but what admiration can we have for those who will not invest <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> in an Australian industry until the public has been yarded up for their benefit, and prevented by a duty of 50 per cent. from buying any but local manufactures? </para>

They employed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allard,</inline> one of the best accountants in Australia, and threw all their books open to him. He was allowed to submit to the whole public of Australia a report showing every figure in the books. Those figures have removed from my mind many objections which I had on the score of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> had said. I find that the firm, instead of being able to succeed in an industry which is perhaps the most deserving of its kind in Australia, have by their enterprise got into a position in which it must be a matter of serious concern to them whether they will be able to carry on or not. </para>

                        <para>- When one cannot get information for one&#39;s self, one has to get it somewhere, even from the most polluted source. If that remark is too strong, I will say from what in this instance is the most thoroughly filtered source. My own impression was that 12s. a ton was perhaps a little too much ; but looking at the whole enterprise - and in this I do not refer to the honorable member for Kalgoorlie - the gentlemen who threw those magnificent protective encouragements and barricades round the softgoods manufacturers and others need not squirm at this little help to the great iron industry. I have worked out what the bonus really means.I am told that there are 750 men engaged at Lithgow in making the raw material into pig iron. Dividing the amount of bounty by that number gives <inline font-style="italic">&#163;40</inline> a year towards each of them ; but if the pig iron is converted at the works into puddled bar-iron, not another penny is provided for the men who do that work, and if the puddled bar-iron is converted into steel, there is not another penny for those engaged in that work either. The&#163;30,000 has to cover all the operations, from the raw material up to the finished steel. Consequently, this firm are not getting any great hold on the public purse, while if they establish the industry they will have rendered in return a much greater public service than do most other Australian manufacturers. The Denton Hat Mills have been paying good dividends. </para>

                        <para>- I accept the honorable member&#39;s figures. I do not wish to pick out the Denton Hat Mills in any invidious way, because it is a great industry - although we have to pay for it - but when those mills were making large profits on their capital they were clamouring for another 10 or 20 per cent. protection, and there was actually a proposal before the House that they should pay over the counter of the Customs House the duty on all the machinery that they wanted - and that machinery, instead of being made by Australian artisans, was to be made in other parts of the world - and then go to the back door and get back every penny they paid. That was a monstrous proposal. When I drew attention to it it was denied, and then it was stated that it was nothing new, although I do not think that that made it any better. I have no opportunity of getting information myself in regard to the Lithgow enterprise, because one does not like to go directly to a person interested in the industry, and I would rather take the information from some responsible member of the Government. Although I feel that the encouragement offered by the Bill to the industry is very small, still if there is any question of the rate of bounty being too high I am quite willing to assist the honorable member for Kalgoorlie in demanding some satisfactory explanation from the Government to show that the rate proposed is required. After all, the industry, even with this bounty, cannot be looked to to expand as we hoped that the iron industry would expand. It will have a rough time ahead of it, even with this assistance. Amongst all the fiscal proposals made in this House I do not think there has been a fairer one than that with which we are now dealing. </para>

                    <para>. - I would point out to the honorable member for Cook and other honorable members that this industry is not altogether on all fours with the hat-making industry and others in which factories can be closed down and started again at a moment&#39;s notice. In this case blast furnaces have to be run. It costs a considerable amount to get them ready and it pays to continue running them where an ordinary factory under certain conditions would cease operations. </para>

I am favorable to the most generous treatment of the Mother Country in every way, but I draw the line at giving a bounty on wire made in the United Kingdom. I recognise that the draft amendment which the Treasurer has handed to me will be a great improvement on the Bill as it stood, but, while it disposes of my point as to foreign-made wire, it still leaves it necessary to consider the question of wire made in the United Kingdom.

                    <para>. - The reason is that circumstances have altered very considerably since this bounty was first proposed and included in the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. This provision was introduced by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> some six years ago, when there was no attempt being made to manufacture those implements in Australia. This matter was dealt with in an Act which has since been declared unconstitutional, but a re-enacting Bill is in draft. </para>

                <para class="block">Those are the words which were inserted at the instance of the honorable member for Illawarra, and they carry out the intention I had when I gave notice of the amendment I have just indicated. My desire is to prevent the bounty being paid through Messrs. Hoskins to the Government of New South Wales. There was an agreement entered into by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> to hand over to the State Government any bounty, in &#39; consideration of the increased price paid by the Government for the manufactured goods. I was approached last night by honorable members, who pointed out that there was a desire, if the State undertook&#34; the industry, that the State should have the advantage of the bounty in the same way as any other manufacturer. The provision in the Bill interferes only when there is a sort of triangular contract, the Commonwealth giving the bounty, the manufacturer turning out the product, arid1, under an agreement, handing the bounty over to the State Government. </para>

I understand that, in view of* what is provided in clause 3, the Treasurer does not propose to proceed with the amendment of which he gave notice ; but there remains the further question as to what extent a State could claim the bounty if the industry be carried on by the State. </para>

                    <para>.- I think&#34;, that clause 3 referred to by the Treasurer is adequate. The honorable member for Illawarra showed me the form of his amendment prior to submitting it, and we considered  it covered the case of contracts with the New South Wales Government. Under those contracts the State Government got the benefit of the bounty by deducting it from the contract price, and that I regarded as very unfair. The amendment of which the Treasurer gave notice, though it might, perhaps, accomplish the same end, is objectionable, because it would not only prevent bounties being indirectly obtained by a State, but also prevent them being directly obtained if the State entered into the industry ; and I do not see why there should be any differentiation. The provision in clause 3 was carefully drafted by the honorable member for Illawarra, who had special knowledge of the position. </para>

                    <para>.- Although I have closely examined this clause, I am unable to determine what it is really designed to accomplish. I take it that the bond to be given by the contractor will be forfeited if he refuses to transfer his works to the Government of any State that may desire to take them over within twelve months after the cessation of the bounty ? </para>

                    <para>. - If the honorable member for Kalgoorlie will allow me, I should like to explain that the clause was framed as it stands because we have no power under the Constitution to pass such a provision as he suggests. But for that, we should have drafted the clause on the lines which the honorable member now asks us to adopt. All that we can do under the Constitution is to provide that refusal to transfer should be punishable by a penalty, but we can make that penalty so high as to compel conformity with the wishes of the State concerned. I have consulted the representative of the Crown Law Office present as to the reason why the clause was drafted in its present form, and am informed by him that if it were amended as the honorable member suggests, it would be in contravention of the Constitution. I do not pretend to be able to give a legal interpretation of the Constitution; I am simply telling honorable members what 1 have been advised. </para>

                    <para>. - There is reason to doubt the constitutional right of the Commonwealth at the present time to assume control of an industry of this character. I would remind honorable members, however, that this Bill relates, not to the present, but to a period that will at least cover the lives of two new Parliaments. Having regard to the fact that at each general election about 30 per cent. of the retiring members are not re-elected, it is not unreasonable to assume that before the expiration of the period during which the bounty will be payable, we may have . in this Parliament a majority prepared to support an amendment of the Constitution, if it be necessary, to enable the Commonwealth to take over the industry. </para>

                        <para>- The point that I wish to emphasize is that the Bill does not relate merely to the present. It will cover a period of some years, and it is intended that those who engage in the industry shall be liable to a penalty if they refuse, within twelve months of the expiration of the bounty, to transfer their works to a State. But that penalty might be made a very small one by a Minister who was opposed to the nationalization of the industry. </para>

He will admit that there is a serious difference of opinion on the part of constitutional authorities as to the power that we may exercise in this direction. I believe that we have the power under the Constitution to declare that, in order to secure the effective defence of Australia, it is necessary for the Commonwealth itself to establish the iron industry. I think that the High Court would interpret the Constitution in a liberal spirit, believing the intention to be to confer that power. Will it be seriously argued that in time of emergency it would be necessary to obtain an amendment of the Constitution in order to provide raw material for the manufacture of weapons of defence? </para>

                    <para>. - 1 wish to suggest a possibility which may affect the whole Bill. To my mind, the clause is so worded that it will be ineffective. It is a principle of law that, when there is annexed to a grant or bounty, or imposed in connexion with taxation, a condition which seems to be the basis of its policy, the instrument must be ineffective if the condition is. held to be bad. Since the Bill was recently drafted, the High Court, in three or four cases, following American decisions, has held that, where a condition seems to be so interwoven in an Act as to indicate that Parliament would not have passed the Act had the condition not been contained in it, the Act must be regarded as unconstitutional if the condition is so. It may be held by the High Court that we have no power to pass this provision, and the Court may go further and say that, as the condition which we wish to attach to the granting of the proposed bounties is not severable from the general policy, the whole of our legislation is bad. Are honorable members who are supporting&#39; the granting of bounties prepared to face the possibility of the Act being declared invalid some fifteen or sixteen months hence, after work has been entered upon on the assumption that the bounties will be paid? The person claiming a bounty is to comply with a certain condition. That is, the bounties are to be paid only to those who comply with the conditions of clause 9. If those conditions are held to be bad, the whole measure may be held to be so. Not only may the clause be ineffective for the purposes intended, but it may imperil the measure itself. If the Government wish to assist honorable members in bringing about the nationalization of the iron industry, it should insert a provision empowering the Commonwealth to acquire it. It is more likely that that would be held constitutional. </para>

                    <para>.- The clause contains a provision which must be held to be bad the moment it is examined. The assessment upon which a State may take over iron works is to be submitted, in the case of dispute, to the  President  of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. That is an extraordinary condition for us to seek to impose upon the freedom of a sovereign State. Every one of the States has unlimited powers of nationalization, according to such assessment as lt may see fit to provide for. Therefore the proposed restriction would be strenuously resisted on constitutional grounds. If honorable members desire to bring about the nationalization of the iron industry at some future date, they will be unwise to. vote for the clause as it stands. As they know that I am opposed to such nationalization, they will, of course, examine most critically what I have to say ; but if they let their judgment guide them, they will see that no attempt to prevent the States from taking such action as they may desire will be effective. I sympathize with the honorable member for Kalgoorlie in the demand that the Government should put into plain language its often expressed desire to assist the nationalization of the iron industry at some future date. If it does not, he and those who have suffered with him in the past&#39; will be justified in believing that the maze of words which has been put forward has no other design than to bring about an adverse judgment when the measure is tested in the Courts of the country. </para>

                    <para>.- I have from the first consistently supported the proposal to grant a bounty for the production of iron. But, as we progress, the Government give way more and more to those who favour the nationalization of the iron industry. Therefore, if this clause is passed, I shall feel compelled to vote against the third reading of the Bill. A practical point to which I direct attention is this : A large amount of money must be invested to make the iron industry a success. A large expenditure has already taken place at Lithgow ; but if enterprises are to be opened up in Tasmania or South Australia, further large sums of capital must be invested. No one with capital would enter into these enterprises should the proposed clause be agreed to. No capitalist would risk losing the results of his ability and information by the taking over by a State of an enterprise in which he had invested money. It has been frequently alleged that the Bill is designed to assist only one firm - that now operating at Lithgow - and unquestionably that must be its effect if the clause is agreed to, because no other firm will enter the industry. Those who have invested in the Lithgow works have shown commendable enterprise, and are committed to the risks connected with it; but no new firm would invest capital under the proposed conditions.  2126 <inline font-style="italic">Manufactures</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Encouragement Bill.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - There are several reasons why the Committee should not accept the proposed amendment. It purports to confer upon the Commonwealth or the State power to take over the industry. Whether we have that power or not depends not upon any enactment of our own, but upon the words of the Constitution. We certainly cannot confer power upon a State to do it, as the State&#39;s power depends upon its own Constitution read in conjunction with the Federal Constitution. </para>

Under the States Land Acquisition Acts there isa regular form of procedure. To accept this amendment would be an assumption on our part of the right to confer this power upon a State. The amendment also purports to give the Commonwealth power to take over the industry ; but we cannot confer power upon ourselves by a declaration in our own Statutes. The Iron Bonus Commission was very fully advised at the time by the Attorney-General that the Commonwealth had no power to nationalize industries, and that advice is fully set out in the Commission&#39;s report. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps so; but the very clear rule of interpretation of Statutes laid down by the Courts is that if you purport to exercise a power which is wider than the absolute grant of power in a Constitution, and the clauses are not severable, the whole Act is void. Speaking from memory, I think that was recognised in the trade marks case in America. Congress had power to legislate as to trade marks so far as Inter-State trade was concerned, but they did not confine themselves to that. They attempted to exercise the power generally, and the Court held that the whole Act was unconstitutional. The wording of the proposed amendment is absolutely outside our constitutional powers. Apart from that, its language is very uncertain ; but, of course, if that were the only trouble, the wording could easily be altered. It is a matter of principle that causes the Government to oppose the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I see no harm in the proposal contained in the clause as it stands, that any person who receives the bounty should give his bond to the Commonwealth to allow a State to acquire the industry. The provision is unobjectionable, because the State need not take action unless it chooses. It is left entirely to the State, and I am inclined to think that the State has power to take over any such industry by its own legislation, unless some Commonwealth law is superior to the State law in that respect. But as we have no Commonwealth law enabling us to take over any particular industry in a State, the State law would be supreme, and without this clause the State could at any time take action. The only benefit of the clause is that it puts the person accepting the bounty, as it were, &#34;on notice.&#34; If the State did resume his works, he could not demand compensation from the Commonwealth on the ground that when he accepted the bounty he understood that he would be allowed to go on continuously under the same conditions. </para>

                        <para>- It is a principle that I am opposed to. I do not wish to give effect to it, or extend it, in any shape or form. If honorable members opposite can induce the majority of the people to sanction an amendment of the Constitution in the direction of Commonwealth industries, well and good; but at present I am not of the opinion that I should help them towards that object. The notice given by the clause is sufficient in any case, because it would practically cover the case of the Commonwealth should the owners of the works claim compensation from the Commonwealth for alleged losses, on the industry being nationalized a few years hence. It would be a perfectly equitable and sufficient answer to say that in the Act itself the owners were given fair notice that a State could take over the works, and that that implied that the Commonwealth could take them over. The clause, in safeguarding the future with reference to the power of the State, incidentally safeguards the exercise of the power of the Commonwealth, if the Commonwealth does only that which the State has a right to do. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that the words of the new clause, to which the honorable gentleman reters, give the option.  to the Minister of paying rates of wages that are less than those paid in the industry at the present time. The words &#34; below the standard rates paid in the locality in which the goods are manufactured &#34; are exceedingly wide and indefinite, and so play into the hands of the employing section that it is open to question whether the new clause is any improvement. The Bill as it stands is reasonably clear, inasmuch as the rate of wages shall be that prescribed by a State or a Commonwealth tribunal, whereas in the proposed new clause no such standard is provided, the matter being left entirely to the Minister. If I may take <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> a criterion the attitude of the Minister in desiring this great liberty, then the outlook for the employes is not a very good one. The Minister in suggesting this amendment seems to me to indicate the absence of a desire on his part to do anything of a specific character beneficial to the employes. In exercising this optional power, he would be controlled by the words &#34; below the standard rates paid in the locality in which the goods are manufactured.&#34; The whole trend of legislation of late has been to place the determination of rates of wages in the hands of what are, at any rate, nominally impartial tribunals, because the prevailing standards in different localities have been so wretchedly low. Yet we are asked by this new clause to perpetuate a system against which the whole trend of the legislation of the States and the Commonwealth Parliaments has been fighting for a number of years. Surely the Minister has not carefully considered the proposed new clause? </para>

                        <para>- And objection has been taken to it. Under the proposed new clause, the award of a Commonwealth authority will first of all govern the wages to be paid. It is only in the absence of an award by a Commonwealth or State authority that the Minister is to have power to say what wages shall be paid. I think that the honorable member for Adelaide will admit that he was not quite fair to me, when he said that the amendment did not indicate any strong .desire on my part, to secure the payment of reasonable wages. &#34;My chief object in submitting it is to allow the rates of wages to be determined by a Commonwealth or a State authority, and to strengthen rather than to weaken the position of the men. I am informed by the Attorney-General that there is a similar provision in the Sugar Bounties Act. In that Act it is provided that, if the Minister finds that the rates of wages are below the standard rates paid in the district in which the sugar is grown, for similar white labour in the industry, then the Minister may withhold any part of the bounty. </para>

                    <para>.- That is precisely the contention against which I argue. I contend that there should not be given to the Minister the alternative power, in the absence of an award by a Federal or State tribunal, to prescribe the rates of wages prevailing in the locality. If we are to allow that option, then some of the States Governments, as they exist at present, will not put into operation a tribunal of a character likely to regulate the wages in a reasonable manner ; neither will there be an incentive to move the Federal tribunal into action. It will be contended that there is no occasion to move into action either a Federal or a State tribunal, since the Minister has power to prescribe the rates of wages. </para>

                        <para>- If I used that word, I withdraw it. If the alternative power would give the Minister a free hand, there would not be so much objection to this amendment; but he is not to have a free hand. He is to be restrained in a manner inimical to the interests of the workers in the particular locality where the industry is carried on. He may, first of all, prescribe such rates as are agreed upon by a State or Federal tribunal. Therein he is limited in a manner to which I am not at present taking any exception. But in the event of his having to resort to the alternative suggested in his new. amendment, he will be limited in a manner that calls for the most severe condemnation. He must be guided, in fixing the rates of wages, by the standard rates paid in the locality in which the goods are manufactured. Surely there can be no desire to revert to a position in respect of wages against which every Legislature in Australia has been fighting for a a number of years. Whilst I am prepared, irrespective of whether or not I believe in the absolute sincerity of the Ministry that I may be supporting, to let the Minister for the time being prescribe a reasonable rate of wages, I am not prepared to have the Minister limited in this way. The standard rate of wages prevailing, say at the Blythe River, may be entirely different from that prevailing at Lithgow. Where then is the use of the bounty if the Minister may not act as he would desire but is to be limited to prescribing the rates of wages that prevail in those localities? The workers at Lithgow are at present receiving, I understand, somewhat better wages than are paid in Tasmania. The Treasurer, with an apparent show of sincerity- </para>

                        <para>- I am not committing myself any further than that. Surely I am generous in saying that, with an apparent display of sincerity, the Treasurer stated yesterday that this was not a bounty for any particular firm or locality. He named, with some degree of force, a district in Tasmania, where there was every probability of the industry starting.&#34; So much confidence had he in the deposits of ore there, that he said had he the funds he would immediately invest in the Tasmanian venture. In the event of his having to resort to the alternative of fixing the rates of wages in accordance with the standard prevailing in the different . localities, what would be&#39; done ? Being limited in the exercise of the power to prescribing the rates of wages prevailing in the locality, he would be forced to provide for the payment of wages, in the one case according to the standard prevailing at Lithgow, and to provide for the observance of an entirely different rate prevailing in Tasmania. The Treasurer is asking for a specific power, and plausibly telling us that which&#34; he now seeks is better than that for which provision is made in the clause as it stands, </para>

                    2131  meaning thereby that the employes are likely to get better conditions under the suggested amendment than under the clause in the Bill. The Minister is forced to admit that, should he be put to the necessity of exercising the alternative which he praises, the rates of wages in one part of the Commonwealth may be 7s. a day, and in another part, 5s. 6d. That would cause an outcry on the part of those receiving the smaller amount. A firm compelled to pay the higher rate would complain of the unfair competition of those paying the lower rate. Then, no doubt, another measure would be introduced, as loosely drafted as this is, and, after about eight years of discussion and postponements, the proposals of the Ministry would be entirely altered by an amendment suggested in Committee. I hope that honorable members will force the Minister to prescribe that the rates of wages shall not differ. The peaceful conduct of the industry would be impossible if other works started and paid rates of wages differing from those paid at Lithgow.

                        <para>- No. It seems to me that the word &#34; may &#34; has been used to give the Minister the opportunity to say to a firm, &#34; Unless you pay the standard rates of wages you will not receive the bounty.&#34; Perhaps the use of the word &#34; shall &#34; would put him in a fix. I understand that this new provision is being substituted for the old, because of objections of some weight which were taken to the original proposal. Power is given to make regulations not inconsistent with this Act, and &#34; in particular for &#34; certain prescribed purposes. A doubt was expressed as to whether the words &#34; in particular &#34; did not mean &#34;of the same class.&#34; If they did not, regulations as to wages would be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> Now that a separate clause giving the power to make such regulations has been drafted, the right of the Minister to act is beyond dispute. No doubt a large power is to be vested in the Minister, who will occupy a difficult position in having to decide whether bounties shall be payable. I suggest that there should be an appeal against his decisions to the  President  of the Court of Arbitration, whether he finds that wages are adequate, or that they are below the standard. &#39; The Minister will occupy an invidious position. Personally, I do not like to give discretion to Ministers where payments involving thousands of pounds are concerned. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not see that the substitution of &#34;shall&#34; for &#34;may&#34; . will make much difference, but I think that the words &#34;if the Minister finds&#34; ought to be left out of the proposed new clause. We do not desire that months, or perhaps a year or two, shall be permitted to pass, as in the case of the Harvester and Spirit Excise Acts, while the Minister is informing himself. </para>

                        <para>- In connexion with the Harvester and Spirits Excise Acts, nothing was done, although the Minister was repeatedly urged, in this Chamber and elsewhere, to take action. The Spirits Excise Act provided that if, on a certain date, the Minister found that certain rates of wages were not being paid, he should impose Excise duties; but he did not institute his inquiries until that date had expired, and probably has not yet informed&#39; himself on the question. Were the provision amended as I have suggested, the direction to the Minister would be stranger than it is now. Should the Minister be allowed to use his discretion, it would be implied that initiative lay with him, and I regret to say that experience has shown that it .is not safe to trust Ministers with discretion in a matter like this. </para>

                    <para>. - As the honorable member for Boothby has pointed out, our experience in giving a Minister discretion in a case of this sort has not been satisfactory. In connexion with the sugar industry, the Minister was asked to say whether a rate of  &#163;1 2s.  6d., which has given the greatest dissatisfaction to the employes, was satisfactory. If the rates of wages, or any of them, are below the standard prescribed, the Minister ought not to pay the bounty. Parliament should make that the law. Then employes who thought they were getting insufficient, could complain to the Minister, and the employers would also state their case, when the Minister would hear both sides, and decide accordingly. The Minister would act without having to find out the wages for himself. It is too much to expect a Minister with all his other duties to constitute himself a Board of inquiry to ascertain what wages are being paid all over the Commonwealth. I know that in a previous case I asked the Minister to take action month after month, and actually brought him lists of persons who were not complying with the Act, but still he would not move. &#39; It should be left to the persons claiming the bounty, and the persons claiming the wages, and not to the Minister, to ascertain what wages are being paid. I have no doubt that they will look after their own interests. </para>

                        <para>- It provides for a possible third stage. It is highly probable that the first part of the sub-clause will come into operation in New South Wales, because we have those industrial authorities in that State, although some of the workers repudiate the particular industrial authority which is in force there at present. I understand from the honorable member for Nepean that the ironworkers have accepted the Act and are ready to form a Board. </para>

We cannot have a standard unless there is an industry in which wages are being paid that would form the basis of a standard.

                        <para>- That would involve an alteration of the Constitution, which may not be approved. If honorable members are prepared to accept statements such as the Treasurer has just made, as if they were actually amendments of the Constitution, they should be reminded that their experience in that direction has been rather disappointing. We should not put the people who are going to invest their capital in this industry in an uncertain position as to their right to get the bounty, because the whole benefit of the bounty system is destroyed unless there is a carefully established method by which compliance with the conditions will enable the bounty to be earned. Unless there is a proper standard in the Act, some unreasonable Minister, if the matter is left to his discretion, may create endless difficulty, which would prejudice the position of those in the industry. I do not think, however, that that would occur, as every Minister would be anxious to administer the Act in a liberal spirit. But the difficulty remains that, outside of States which have industrial authorities, there can be no standard in this particular industry. It is a pity to pass legislation </para>

If these words are left out, the Minister&#39;s power to withhold the bonus will depend upon his being able to show that the rates of wages are below a certain standard. If he has no power by regulation to show that, how is he to find out? The absolute duty will be cast on him, no matter what he surmises that the wages may be, to pay the bounty. If, however, we leave these words in, the Minister can say, &#34; I find that the wages are not up to the standard, and therefore I will not pay the bounty.&#34; It will be a mistake to strike them out. The first part of the clause might stand as it is, and then we might go on to provide that if the claimant does not satisfy the Minister, or, on appeal from the Minister, say, the  President  of the Court of Arbitration, that the wages are up to the standard, he shall not receive the bounty. </para>

The clause does not stipulate that the claimant shall pay a fair wage. So long as he certifies to the Minister the wages that he is paying, the Minister must pay the bounty, unless he takes the trouble to find out for himself that the wages are not fair. How is the Minister going to find that out? What we desire to do is to take away the responsibility from the Minister, and leave the claimant to prove that he pays proper wages. The more we look into this new clause, the more unsatisfactory it appears ; and we should have been better advised had we retained the original provision. </para>

                        <para>- It does indeed, as the words show. The finished product of wire netting consists of wire which is netted ; and the  10  per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valoremwill</inline> cover the value of the English-made wire as well as the value of the Australian-made wire netting. </para>

                        <para>- That confirms my position. I do not know the values ; but to the extent of the value of the wire, we shall be giving a  10  per cent. bounty to the English maker. However, if that be the desire of honorable members, of course the responsibility must be left with them. </para>

                        <para>- No one can say that we agreed to give a bounty on a material manufactured in another country ; at any. rate, I arrived at no such agreement. But the preferential treatment extended to the Mother Country has been so unsatisfactory that, if the Government desire to give this advantage to the English manufacturers, I do not feel inclined to prevent them. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister would have done well to adhere to his original proposal, even supposing he had paid a little too much bounty. This would have enabled the manufacturers in Sydney to compete with the manufacturers of the imported article, with the result that farmers and pastoralists would have got cheap wire netting. However, this proposal having been made by the Government, I think our best course is to support it. </para>

                    <para>.- The leader of the Opposition has done quite right in pointing out the mistake we are making in adopting the amendment proposed by the Treasurer. I think, however, that the right honorable gentleman ought to give us an opportunity to vote on a further amendment, to carry out the ideas he has expressed. It seems rather ridiculous for an honorable member to complain of a provision in a Bill, and not be prepared to suggest an alteration. I appeal to the right honorable member to give us a chance to so vote as to confine the bonus to the Australian-made article. </para>

                    <para>.- The correct way of arriving at the true value of the additional manufacture of the article as a basis for the . bonus would, I think, be to follow the Canadian principle, and provide (for a different rate where the commodity is made from imported raw material. However, it would be a pity to split hairs, because, all through, we have recognised the principle of giving two or three bonuses - that is, we give a bonus on the puddled iron, on the wire, and on the wire netting. </para>

                        <para>- From the honorable member for Nepean; and I shall read the figures. There is a loss of 3s. on the manufacture at Lithgow, which I may point out is not a manufacturing <inline font-style="italic">town</inline> indie neighbourhood of Port Jackson. le is on the other side! of the Blue Mountains,, and even at the special rates granted for the benefit of the industry, the cost of carrying iron, thence to Sydney, where it begins to compete with iron from abroad, is 6s. per ton. That, added to the loss of 3s. per ton on the production of the iron before it reaches Sydney, makes a total&#39; of 9s. per ton. There is an additional, cost in carrying it to Melbourne and to Adelaide, and a still further cost in conveying it to Fremantle. The cost of <inline font-style="italic">6s.</inline> per tonto convey the iron from Lithgow to Sydney, added to the loss of 3s. per ton on the iron at the works, gives us a total of 9s. per ton, which comes very close to the 12s. per ton bounty, for which provision is made, and which is not unreasonable, if the manufacturers are to obtain any interest on their capital. </para>

                        <para>- I have always said that the advantage of granting bounties for the encouragement of industries - which is a. national policy - is that under such a system the nation, and not the individuals- who patronize the industry to which it relates, has to bear the burden. It has always seemed to me to be a hideous injustice that the individuals who patronize the industry should have to bear the burden of any increased expense resulting from action taken to encourage it. Under the bounty system it is the nation that pays, and ought to pay ; the buyer is not handicapped or penalized by encouraging the industry. If honorable members were prepared to vote for the encouragement of the sunflower industry they ought surely to be ready to grant a bounty on the production of iron. I am satisfied now that the rate per ton proposed to be given is perfectly fair and reasonable. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to intimate to the House, and to the country, that which I have already privately intimated to the Prime Minister: that the Labour Party can no longer support the Government. I can only say that our relations with the Ministry, personally, have been of the most friendly character. Although from time to time embarrassing circumstances &#34;have arisen, we have always endeavoured to co-operate in every possible way with the Government in regard to matters that we thought concerned the welfare of the Commonwealth. There have been situations of embarrassment in which I have always sought, to the best of my ability, to safeguard the interests of the Parliament, and the well-being of the country. Whilst I freely admit that we have frequently felt the restraint that a large party such as ours must feel in difficult circumstances, I, personally, have always held that, occupying the position that we do, we must treat any Government situated as this </para>

                <para class="block">Ministry is, in a perfectly straightforward manner. We. are taking this course now, because it is, to our minds, one, of decency, and of order. The time might come when one party or the other might take such action as would create a crisis, in circumstances that would render it impossible for the country to learn exactly how the situation arose. I have endeavoured, whilst safeguarding the interests of the &#39;Commonwealth, to restrain within reasonable bounds any adverse criticism, and now that I can no longer do that, I think that I am performing what is more a public than a party duty in telling the House and the country the determination at which we have arrived. I have stated our position as plainly as I can, and have only to add that in taking the course which I did during a previous crisis, I had the support of my party, the members of which felt that until at least the Tariff was dealt with there rested upon us the public duty of giving the Government a reasonable support in every situation that a party placed as they were and are might find themselves in. </para>

I therefore indorse the statement made by the honorable member for Wide Bay as to the relations that have subsisted between his party and the Government. As to the attitude that they now see fit to adopt, it is not only perfectly within their rights, but, so far, beyond any challenge of mine. </para>
