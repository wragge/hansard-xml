                        <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation. In replying to a question that I put to him last Thursday, the Minister of Trade and Customs appeared to suggest that I had endeavoured to place a false construction upon some papers I had looked through at the Customs Department. He spoke these words- </para>

                    <para class="block">It is true, as the Minister said, that I looked through the papers, and in order to clear myself in the eyes of the House from the imputation which would otherwise rest upon me, I must say what I did find. I found that oh 27th August last the Collector of Customs at Sydney had sent some wire about paper used by the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> to the Department of Trade and Customs in Melbourne, and that, although a reference to it existed, the telegram itself had been lost. On the 30th August, a gentleman connected with the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> made representations to the Department, and those representations were simply minuted - " Is this super-calendered paper known as news' paper?" The next reference is dated 2nd September, when the Collector in Sydney wired to the Comptroller-General - </para>

                    <para class="block">On the same day the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> was advised by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.. Wollaston',</inline> whose message concluded with the words "first intimation of difficulty received to-day." . Two days later - not the same day - a gentleman connected with the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> proprietary was informed by the Department that, they could also have their paper free. The Minister, therefore, was not stating a fact when he' appeared to put me in a false position by saying that the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> were "advised" on the same day. The question I asked him was why it was thought' necessary to inform the Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir- William</inline> Lyne, of a matter of Customs departmental administration. The answer that he gave me may or may not have been intended as 'an evasion of my direct question, but certainly the reflection upon myself which the Minister's words involved , was not justified by the facts I have just put before the House. . </para>

                                <para>- I understood that the honorable- member for Wentworth wished in the first place to imply . that favoritism had been shown in respect of the admission of certain paper, and I requested him to give notice of his question, so that I might answer it. He' did give notice, and in answering his question I invited him to examine the departmental papers. On Thursday, when he put a further series of questions to me, without notice, I invited him to give notice, of them, and it is significant that he has not thought fit to put such questions to me upon notice. The honorable member now returns to the charge by means of a personal explanation, in which he asserts that I cast a reflection upon him. What I said was that as he had examined the departmental papers he must be aware that notice of the decision was sent to several newspapers on the same day. </para>

                                <para>- The departmental papers bear out . my statement that notice was sent to several newspaper proprietors. Even if notice was not sent to all on the same date, that is a matter of  no moment. Then, again, the honorable member for Wentworth said that the papers referred to a telegram which apparently had been lost, thereby wishing to convey a further inference. I do not believe that any paper has been lost. A telegram would be despatched by the Collector of Customs, in Sydney, to the Comptroller-General, and I think we are satisfied that those officers are not disposed to show favoritism. If my memory serves me rightly, a communication reached the Department by telephone and not by telegraph. </para>

In many of the streets of the East End the Chinese' are hunted as soon as they appear, and those captured are severely used. . These violent methods have been adopted with the object of intimidating the Chinese, and preventing tbem taking employment on British ships. The British sailors allege that many of the Chinese cannot pass the language test, which the law insists shall be imposed on foreigners seeking employment on British vessels. </para>

                        <para>- The statement in question is not altogether correct. The Department has a right to see that the kerosene imported into the Commonwealth possesses a flash point sufficiently high to prevent danger being apprehended from its use. Under the old Tariff and up to the present the flash point of 73 degrees Fahrenheit has been observed by the Department. There has, however, been a great deal of conflicting evidence upon this matter, which is now under consideration. No alteration in the flash point of kerosene will be made until the Department is satisfied as to what is the proper thing to do. </para>

                    <para class="block">While there has been much profession of the intention of the Federal Government to place the Defence question on a sound footing, an example is furnished locally of the manner in which business which should receive immediate attention is delayed. About eight months ago a cadet corps was formed by the Gordon Club, an. association of lads. Some two months ago official papers were received. These were filled in promptly, and at once returned. Nothing has, however, been heard since, and many of the boys, who have been drilling regularly, are becoming disheartened. The probability is that unless the authorities take some action the movement will collapse. </para>
                    <para>Can the Minister advance any reason for this extraordinary delay, and will he take steps to prevent its recurrence? </para>

I should be pleased to take him to the spot and leave him where the travellers by motor car, to whom reference has been made, have been snow bound. It is at. Kiandra, which is almost as close to Canberra as it is to Dalgety. The honorable member must have noticed that that is so, and one of the chief attractions of the future Federal Capital is that the snow line is within 60 miles of it. If I were in order in doing so, I should like to ask the . honorable member and those who are imbued with similar sentiments,' why the great, zeal which they evidenced some weeks ago in securing a settlement of the Federal Capital Site has disappeared? </para>

                        <para>- That, is so; but there is such a strong difference of opinion, that I hesitate to move to that effect, because I do not think there is the slightest chance of carrying the motion. I have been informed that if this requested amendment be made there will be a desire to admit free other items of a similar character. Further, if we were to accept the amendment, I am told that difficulty will arise as to which stained glass windows should or should not be admitted. The desire of some honorable members is to have free admission when the stained glass window is the original work of art, with some restriction on the admission of replicas ; but I ' (am told by the officials that it will be difficult to say what is original and what is not. The Department is not in favour of the proposition, for the reason that it is so difficult to discern an original work of art from a copy. Before I had looked carefully into the matter, I gave an intimation to the effect that I intended to propose that the Senate's requested amendment be made. But the considerations that I have now explained had not at that dme been brought under my attention. Another matter that escaped my observation was that there is  ai  duty of 15 per cent, on the raw material from which stained glass windows are made. Under these circumstances, I feel that it would be! idle, and would simply conduce to a long debate, for me to move the acceptance of. the Senate's request. I therefore move -   That the requested amendment be not made. </para>

                    <para>Stained glass windows for churches and other public institutions under Departmental by-laws, Free,  were suggested to me by the Comptroller-General as the best formula for carrying out the intention. I think that most honorable members were in favour of a lower duty than that originally proposed by the Government. Some suggested 15 per cent. The debate turned on whether - the duty should be 15 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> or.  whether  the item should be free. The item, having been postponed at the Minister's request for further consideration, came on for discussion again at about half-past five or six o'clock one morning, when most of us were only half-awake. The Minister had. then forgotten his promise and nothing was done. What we are now considering is a request by the Senate similar in form to the amendment which I formerly suggested. The Treasurer has apparently repented of his . promise, and has proposed that the requested amendment be not made. I hope that the Committee will recollect that this is really a tax on works of art, which will be very burdensome on some churches. If we do not make the item free we should, at all events, agree to a lower rate of duty. </para>

                        <para>- But we* were given to understand that stained glass windows did not come under that item. The original duty was, I think, 30 per'cent. A duty of 15 per cent, was suggested by the honorable member for South Sydney. It ought to be remembered that the production of stained glass windows involves 'a consider- ' able amount of artistic skill. Some such windows may not be works of high art, but there are some pictures in our national galleries that are not worth very much. Good stained glass windows are very expensive, and highly-trained workmanship is required to produce them. I do at the same time recognise that some of our local producers would be entitled to complain of having to pay a duty of 15 per cent, on their raw material if stained glass were admitted free. I have letters from one or . two men engaged in the industry who, I believe, are very competent artists. I replied at length to the case which they placed before me. </para>

                        <para>- I pointed out that what we ought to do was to make both the raw material and the stained glass free. A Melbourne manufacturer is prepared to work under free conditions- as long as his raw material is not taxed. I do not, however, think that the cost of the raw material constitutes a very large proportion of the total value of the finished output.-. So that a duty of 15 per cent, on the raw material is not likely to be an exceptionally heavy burden. I have, in mind in relation to this item that there is an Anglican Church in Adelaide which is importing a large stained glass window upon which the duty at the old rate would have been£92. That is a very severe exaction in respect of a window that does in some degree minister to the public taste for the aesthetic. I hope that the Committee will accede to the Senate's request. </para>

He does the artists in stained glass in Australia the credit of admitting the injustice to . which they will be subjected if the Senate's request be agreed to in its present form ; and then he calmly expresses the hope that the request will be accepted, so that the artists will be placed in that unjust position. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member expressed the views of the artists in fairness to them, but concluded with the hope that no attention would be paid to their views. The honorable member should know with his parliamentary experience that we have passed the stage at which any discussion can take place in regard to the duty on the raw material. I do not think that the trade in stained glass windows is likely to constitute a very big industry in Australia, though, to accept the Senate's suggestion and make the item free, would constitute the gravest possible injustice to those who are working in the industry at present. I do not ask for any extravagant duty, but the very least that' those who think the articles should be free might do is to put upon the manufactured article a similar duty to that exacted upon, the raw ma- . terial. There is something in the contention of the honorable member for Angas, that there is a difference in value between the completed article and the raw material used in it, but if we make the amendment requested by the Senate, then not merely works of art of original design will come under it, but ' stained glass windows that are mere replicas of some design made, perhaps, centuries ago, will also be imported free, and the local designer and art worker in stained glass will be placed at a disadvantage, because he will still have to pay duty on all his raw material. I do not think the Senate fully appreciated the situation when the request was made. If the effect upon the local worker in stained glass had been pointed out to honorable senators, they would not have asked for the item to be made free, although they might have asked for a reduction of the duty. I trust that those who think that the item ought to be free will, at least, make the concession of extending as nearly equal conditions as possible to the local worker. </para>

                    <para>.- The rate of duty on stained glass windows agreed to in this House was that recommended by the Tariff Commission. The Senate thought it wise to alter that, and tried to bring stained glass windows under  " Works of art." The Treasurer has explained that they are not all separate Works of art, and I should like to add that in Birmingham, for instance, there are companies that make numbers of copies from the one design, and send them all over the world. Therefore, to make the amendment requested by the Senate would not be to encourage art in the sense that it is the production of one artist, or that each stained! glass window is a separate design. There are companies in Great Britain which pay a man a high fee for designing windows, and manufacture fifty or sixty copies of each design. We are, therefore, asked, not to encourage art, but to assist an artful combine in the. Old Country who work this trade for their own ends. Whilst I am not inclined, as a rule, to vote for high duties to build up a trade, I am opposed to placing a disability upon an established Australian industry, which would be the  effect if the amendment were made. Fifteen per cent. is charged upon the raw material, and the finished article would be allowed to come in free. That is a complete reversal of the usual position, and if honorable members vote for it they will be imposing cruel conditions upon our people. In Australia, wages are higher, and hours are shorter, than in the same class of occupation elsewhere. The duties originally passed by this House were 30 and 25 per cent. This article is not a necessary of life, but the Committee, time after time, have agreed to duties of 40 or 50 per cent. upon ordinary necessaries, and surely the duty which the Minister is asking for upon what is practically a luxury, is not too high. I am glad that the Minister is opposed to the request. Some of these windows may be distinct works of art, but a great many are not. A way out of the difficulty is this - if the Senate are really anxious not to penalize art, I should be prepared to make the item free if each window were accompanied by a certificate that it was a special work by one particular artist. </para>

                    <para>.- Most honorable members would like to grant a concession to the churches if it could be done with justice to established industrial interests, but I believe one of the conspicuous anomalies of the old Tariff was the fact that stained glass windows were admitted free, whilst the plate and cathedral glasses forming the raw materials were dutiable at 15 per cent. Two manufacturers - one in Adelaide . and another in Melbourne - came before the Tariff Commission and complained most bitterly of the operation of that anomaly. They pointed out also that the industry of painting on glass and' burning in the tints was by no means small, but was rather a growing one. 1 believe that in Adelaide there are no less than four firms, in Melbourne four firms, and in Sydney two firms, producing stained glass windows for churches and various public buildings. In addition to the ordinary mechanical operation of producing the glass windows, there is the preliminary or associated industry of art designing, and unless encouragement is given to that industry, those art designers, who are instructed in public schools and institutions, will have little scope for the development of their talent. It is, therefore, most desirable, from an artistic as well as from the ordinary mechanical point of view, that there should be at least equality of competition between the imported and the locally produced article. I believe that if the anomaly in the old Tariff is perpetuated in the new, it will give serious grounds for complaint amongst those who are endeavouring to build up a new and important industry in Australia. Not only is there a duty upon the raw material, but when the raw sheet and cathedral glass is imported and manipulated, there is a serious wastage. Very often 50 per cent. of a sheet of. glass is actually wasted in the operation, and upon that waste material duty has been paid. The complete manufactured article, if brought in free, escapes not only the duty, but also the liability to wastage and breakage which the local manufacturer has to suffer. There is, therefore, a most serious anomaly which I hope will not be perpetuated. I am informed that under the Tariff as introduced by the Treasurer a duty of 30 per cent. was collected upon this stained glass under item 249 - glass bent, bevelled, and heraldic. I should be prepared to vote for. a lower duty than 30 per cent., which is somewhat high if riot extravagant. I favour some moderate intermediate rate. </para>

                        <para>- The duty should certainly not be lower than 15 per cent-. The local manufacturers say that if the raw material were duty free they could compete on equal terms with the imported article. Unfortunately, we cannot now raise the question of the duty on the raw material, because that has been finally dealt with. I think that these stained glass windows might fairly be subjected to a moderate duty. I hope that justice will be done to. the local manufacturers in that way ; otherwise I believe .they will have serious ground for grievance and complaint against Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. -I agree with the honorable and learned member for Bendigo that we should reject the . amendment requested by the Senate. We are doing too little at the present time in Australia for the encouragement of the higher forms of art. This is certainly a case in which we might do something in that direction. The productions of the local  industry  referred to are certainly equal to most of the imported specimens. We have men in Australia who are capable of turning out artistic designs for this kind ot work, of as high a class as any that can be' obtained from the Old Country. I do not think that a duty of 15 per cent., or even of 20 per cent., would be a sufficient duty to impose.' It is suggested  that, in view of the duty on the raw material, a duty of 15 per cent, would equalize matters ; but, in view of the waste referred to . by the honorable and learned member . for Bendigo, I think that such a duty would not afford adequate protection to the industry. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but there is a great deal of waste in the industry. I should like to know why we should make any exception in the case of stained glass windows, when we charge duty on other fittings and ornaments of churches. We impose duties on organs, pianos, and harmoniums used in churches, and .it would be just as reasonable to contend that they should be admitted free of duty as to contend that stained-glass windows should not be dutiable. </para>

                        <para>- Pianos are played in some churches, and harmoniums and organs are played in others. Honorable members will probably admit that many of the organs erected in churches are works of art, and why .should they not, as well as' stained-glass windows, ' be admitted free? The beautiful ornamentations of some of our church pulpits will be admitted to be works of art. I have seen magnificent specimens of the carver's art used to ornament church pulpits, and they should be admitted free if it is contended that everything used in a church or a public institution should be free of duty. To do that would involve a remodelling of the Tariff. No persons connected with any. church in Australia need fear that they will not be able to secure locally, at a reasonable price, stained-glass windows, which, as works of art, will be equal to anything they could desire. For these reasons, I oppose the requested amendment, and I think that no lower duty should be imposed, than that to which the Committee has already agreed. </para>

                    <para>- - Very' little has been said on the point that the Senate's request refers only to stained-glass windows imported for churches or public institutions. Honorable members are aware that these represent special gifts for memorial purposes or the charity or benevolence of persons interested in these institutions.  To impose a duty of 15 or 30' per cent, on such importations would only mean that those introduced in future would be of less value than they would be if no such duty were imposed. Something, has been said about the waste in the manufacture of stained-glass windows in Australia, but it must be remembered that that is a disadvantage which is common to the industry carried on in England and in other places. It should' be remembered also that if a duty of ' 15 per cent, were- imposed on the finished article, the real duty would be higher than has been suggested; because the imported window would, carry a duty on- raw material, and on the artistic work comprised in it as well. It is too late now to talk of introducing the raw material duty free, and, as we are expected to adjust anomalies in the Tariff, it seems to me that it is necessary that we should impose on the -finished article a duty equal at least to that imposed on the raw material. There is the other consideration to which I have referred, that the Senate's request deals only with  stained glass windows required for  churches and public institutions ; and the people who worship in the churches and those who admire works of art and like to see them exhibited in our public institutions cannot be said to- derive any benefit individually from their importation. I. direct attention to the beautiful window to be seen in the Council Chamber of the Melbourne Town Hall. I consider that it represents a magnificent work of art. It was brought from abroad, and completed in Australia by additions which give it a  local character. I question whether it would be possible for local manufacturers to produce so fine a work. This window was a gift to the City Council of Melbourne, and nearly all the works of art we possess have been gifts. The stained glass windows found in our churches are, in most instances, copies of original works of art. The picture known as " The Light of the World," the exhibition of which caused so much sensation in Australia some little time ago, although a great picture, was really a replica. No one will say that it was not a great work of art, because the artist himself admitted that, in his opinion, it is finer than the original picture. I have seen the same picture many times in stained glass windows, which represented really imitations of the original picture. We shall not go far wrong if we adopt the Senate's request to make these works of art duty free if imported for churches and. public institutions, but if we wish to adjust anomalies in the Tariff, a small duty should be imposed, in view of the duty on the raw material. </para>

Strange to say, it is in the large cathedrals only that the productions of the local industry  are  not used. The stained glass windows in St. Paul's and St. Patrick's Cathedrals, Melbourne,  were  imported, but those' interested in churches in the country towns have had the stained glass windows they require made . locally.

                        <para>- I say that this artist, who did some of the .  work of which I have been speaking, did the same class of work in London for 30s. a week. That is the swom evidence he gave before the Tariff Commission. When he came to Australia, he secured a position at <inline font-style="italic">£3</inline> 5s. a week. Surely the honorable member for North Sydney will not assert that we cannot make stained-glass windows here. </para>

In my judgment, what he does not know about . these things is a very great deal. He seems to get hold of a report, and on the statement of one man - which he takes to be gospel truth - regarding the state of the industry as a whole in the Old Country, he paints a word picture. If the man whom he quoted was a good artist - and I have no reason to doubt that he was - he was wasting his time to be in London at all. In the heart of the potteries, where </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that in Australia there are men who can make these windows. I was surprised a few moments ago to hear the honorable member for Hindmarsh bewailing the fact that no encouragement is given to our artists. He went on to' say that we could produce artistic work equal to anything produced in the world if only sufficient Tariff encouragement were given. That is in direct conflict with the doctrine which he has constantly preached. I have always heard from him, and those who believe in the same economic theory as he does, that an artist painted because he could not help doing so, that no matter how we might equalize wages or conditions, that had nothing to do with the fancy of the artist, who simply worked, irrespective of local environment, and hard economic conditions. But when we are discussing the Tariff, the honorable member, heaves overboard! all such statement's, and says that we get so much artistic work for so much Tariff encouragement, and wages from week to week. There seems to be no more anomaly in the freeing of works of art,- such as church windows, from duty, than there is in the freeing of works of art which have their destination in other directions. If a person imports a work of art, say a beautiful vase,- to be placed in a church, no duty will be charged. He may present to a church any work of art, except a church window, without a duty being charged. What an anomalous condition, of things that is ! Why should we stop at a church window ? </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I believe that in. Victoria there is an industrious gentleman who makes these windows, and, I am given to understand, that he turns out very good work. I hope that he will prosper, as he deserves to do, and that his artistic fancy may be indulged in this direction for many a year to come, for the benefit of Australia, and the beautifying of its churches. Perhaps he has some claim upon us, owing to the fact that his raw materials are taxed. To what extent the cost of the raw materials affects' the price of a window, I 'am at a loss to understand. Take, for instance, a work of art such as an oil painting. I venture to say that' the cost of the oils on which duty has to be paid is scarcely worth mentioning in comparison with the value of the finished painting. So again with the glass, or the canvas upon which an artist paint's. The cost of the glass in a work of art is small in proportion to the total cost. The fact remains, that we tax all the articles with which the artist works, and that would seem to make' out a claim for a duty on the finished article. When the honorable member for Bendigo talks of 25 per cent, as a fair duty to compensate the artist- </para>

                    <para>. - For many reasons I should very much like to support the request of the Senate. I think that the beautifying of churches with these works of art should be commended.' Very often the cost of the work amounts to such a very considerable sum, that the duty acts as a deterrent in the direction of beautifying church structures in that way. But I recognise that with respect to this particular provision there is a difficulty. Whilst it is true that the art cost is much greater than the cost of the material, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that we have placed a duty on glass, and other materials required by our artists for the. production of stained glass windows. Therefore we cannot make stained glass windows free without doing so at the expense of our own citizens, which I am not prepared to do. They should have, at least, the same facilities as the foreigner. I trust that the Committee will agree to a middle course, making the duty on stained glass windows equal to that on glass, namely, 15 per cent. If that modification is moved, I shall support it, though I intend to vote against the Minister's motion that the requested amendment be not made. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied that he has been talked over. We know him to be a man amenable to suggestions from lobbyists, and it is evident that those who are trying to make the stained glass windows in Australia have had his ear. We should above all things encourage the taste for works of art. The beautifying of churches is part and parcel of the religious life of the people, and an aesthetic taste which should be encouraged. In the Old Country, where artistic works have been accumulating during the centuries, persons will, at considerable expense, make long pilgrimages to view objects of art, in one place of another. We shall be making, a mistake if we encourage a very small local industry by putting a tax on stained glass windows. I am sorry that the honorable member for Batman has a soul so small that he puts the manufacture of stained glass windows on the same level as the manufacture of boots. We should foster the artistic sense of the community. This is done by the exhibition of pictures and works of art, and still further encouragement is needed. Stained' glass windows are placed in churches for the satisfying of an artistic taste, but the mere manufacture of replicas of no particular interest is not to be encouraged. I shall not, if I can avoid doing so, vote for a duty of 15per cent., because, in my opinion, the Senate must have had a good reason for its request, which should be complied with. </para>

If the requested amendment making these windows free is not made, we shall not be able to propose a modification, and therefore I think that it would be better to agree to a duty of 15 per cent.

His  second alternative is that there be placed on imported stained-glass windows a duty equal to that levied on the raw material, namely, 15 per cent. I suggest that we should adopt that suggestion.  His  third alternative is that no stained-glass window be a'dmitted free unless accompanied by a  certificate or declaration that it is the original design of one artist - giving his name - and that it is not a copy or a replica of any other window executed by the exporting firm.

                    <para>.- The Treasurer might very well accept as a compromise the modification proposed by the honorable member for Angas. An illustration of the difficulty surrounding .this matter is afforded by the experience of a gentleman who recently presented to an Anglican church in my electorate a stained-glass window in memory of his late father. The window was designed and executed by a leading artist in the Old Country who did some of the work in St. Paul's Cathedral. When the order for this window was placed the old Tariff under which it would not have been dutiable was in operation, but when it reached Australia it was found that it was dutiable at a high rate under the Tariff now before us. There are many similar cases. I think we should be justified in differentiating slightly between original works of art intended for use in public buildings - where they may be seen and studied, and must therefore have an educational effect - and ordinary windows. I recognise that we are in somewhat of a difficulty, lt is unfair to tax the raw material of the local manufacturers whilst the finished article is free. That being so, I think that this compromise might be accepted. The Department of Trade and Customs refused to class as a work of art the window to which I have referred, although there are many works of art that are not so difficult to produce as a stained-glass window portraying a certain individual. The proposed- modification will not handicap our local producers, nor fall too heavily on those who make gifts of stained-glass windows to churches and public institutions, and who perhaps should be encouraged. . </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that the Treasurer, has abandoned his original intention to accept the' request made by the Senate. I was under the impression that his desire was' to dispose to-day. of the remaining requests', yet at the inception of our proceedings he has taken up an attitude which must tend to delay that work. The honorable gentleman would do well to accept' the proposed compromise: As a matter of fact I do not favour compromises, and if - I strictly followed my own principles I should vote for stained-glass windows and other works of .art, 'whether 'for public institutions or private individuals, being .admitted free. Why should private individuals, who desire to beautify their homes by the use of stained-glass windows, be prevented from obtaining free' of duty the best that artists can produce? We should encourage amongst the great masses of the community an appreciation of art in all its forms, but, unfortunately, I am in such a small minority in this regard that I am sure it would be. useless for me to attempt to have such advantages placed within the reach of the masses of the people. The majority of honorable members are rather inclined to place obstacles in the way of their enjoying, at the lowest possible cost, the benefits of all that the artistic world can furnish them. This form of art is being largely employed in domestic architecture. In an increasingly large number of suburban villas of modern design .an effort is being made to get away from the old practice of using plain windows, and to adopt .various designs in stained-glass art windows. The duty now levied will make this a luxury that may be indulged in by only people of "means. It is too late, however, to deal with that aspect of the matter, since there are limitations imposed on the wording of the item, but I should like to know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> what is the position in regard to freeing these windows for churches and public institutions? I wish to vote for their free admission, but, failing the adoption of such a proposal, I should like to vote for the modification proposed by the honorable member for Angas. </para>

                    <para>.- I draw the attention of the Treasurer to the evidence given in Adelaide by a manufacturer,' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarkson,</inline> who said that it would' be more in the interests of the general class of window-makers if the duty on material and glass were omitted ; but that, having regard to stained-glass windows alone, a 20 per cent, duty on the finished article was preferable. That should be a sufficient justification for imposing a duty of 20 per' cent, or 25 per cent., such as I suggest. I shall, therefore, vote against the proposed modification, and if the Treasurer will propose, as a further modification, the imposition of a duty of 20 per cent., he will open up a fair way of meeting the difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- At an advance upon the price of the imported article. That, I contend, is tantamount to a tax upon affliction. I am not so lacking in humanitarian feeling that I am prepared to go to the beds of the sick and maimed to obtain revenue. The duties levied in respect of this item will be especially felt by the poorer classes of the community, who can least afford to pay the higher prices that will be demanded for these very necessary appliances to aid them in their time of suffering and trouble. it certainly redounds to the credit of the Senate that the item should have been regarded from a humanitarian stand-point, and this amendment suggested. </para>

                    <para>.- This item is, I think, altogether different from a previous one in regard to which I opposed the proposal of the Treasurer. These surgical appliances can be, and are, made quite easily in any part of Australia, and, further, there is an advantage in having them manufactured in such a place that patients can be measured for them. Under the circumstances, I think we might accept the proposal of the Treasurer. </para>

                    <para>- - There may be a trade distinction between operating tables and dental chairs, but I venture to say that there is scarcely an honorable member who does not realize, from bitter experience, that dental chairs are operating tables ; and up to the present  the Treasurer has given us no good reason for leaving such chairs out of the free list. So far as I understand the matter, dental chairs are not made in Australia; and, if that be so, why should they be taxed? In any case, I should like to know under what item dental chairs will come, if they be omitted from this item. </para>

There is absolutely no difference between the dental chair of to-day and a surgical table. Surgical tables are made here, because any one can make a wooden table. </para>

                        <para>- What I submit is that dental chairs come within the same category a operating tables, because they are made of metal in such a way that special machinery is required in their manufacture. The dental profession is beginning to take a higher place than formerly, dentists being qualified in exactly the same way as are medical men; and there is no doubt that before -long there will be numerous dental hospitals throughout Australia for the purpose of treating the poorer classes. I remind honorable members on the Government cross benches that' it is the poorer people whom it is proposed to tax by omitting dental chairs from the free list. These chairs are used very much for philanthropic purposes, and it would be a hardship on hospitals and other institutions if a heavy duty be imposed. </para>

It has occasioned a considerable amount of pain to members of the Opposition to notice the manner in which the people have been loaded with extra duties. As I have told the Treasurer on former occasions, his name will be handed down with execration to future generations ; but he would avoid some of that obloquy if he agreed to accept the suggesr , tion of the Senate in regard to dental chairs. . </para>

                <para class="block">This schedule is a very important one. I do not wish honorable members to vote without knowing exactly what it means and what the effect will be. Some honorable members are anxious to obtain a rebate on certain classes of machinery, not only up to the time named in the suggested new schedule, but for a longer period. The honorable member for Maranoa desires' to obtain a rebate on machinery for the manufacture of fibrous material and for wool scouring. This is the time when that matter can be discussed. It has also been represented to me that machinery which is being imported for the making of wool tops should be admitted duty free. ' I must confess that I should like to see it exempted from duty. The intention of this schedule is to validate certain things that have been done by the Customs. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I have not yet moved for the acceptance of the Senate's request, because I wished that honorable members should first have an opportunity of knowing exactly what it meant, and to ascertain if there is any desire to extend to any particular classes of machinery the privilege as to rebate which has been granted to others up to a certain period. I wished honorable members to understand that the rebate ceased on the date named. </para>

                    <para>. - I think the Minister's last statement is not quite correct. I take it that the rebate ceased to be payable the moment we inserted these classes of machinery under the general machinery items in the schedule. After that date the individuals importing these particular classes of machinery had no right whatever to the rebate, and had to pay the duty equally with the rest of the machinery users in Australia. I do not think it makes the slightest difference whether the requested amendment is made or not, except as to the legality of something done some time ago. </para>

Representations have been made to me regarding wool-scouring machinery, and machinery for the making of wool tops, but the duty is being charged in all these cases, and will continue to be charged unless the Committee makes some alteration' in ' regard to the schedule. I gave the honorable member for Maranoa a pledge, on a previous occasion, that I would attempt to give a drawback on certain machinery, but when the matter was debated in this Chamber, the honorable member generously released me from that promise. I did not want this amendment to be made- without the Committee knowing exactly what was being done, or without giving an opportunity, if there is still a desire to admit these classes of machinery free, for the Committee to take action accordingly. </para>

                    <para>- - I do not know why this matter requires such an elaborate explanation. I look upon it with doubt. For a long time after the Tariff was- tabled, honorable members did not seem to recognise that on page 49 there was a schedule headed " Rebate for Home Consumption," but one night the leader of the Opposition drew attention to it, and the public were awakened t'o a knowledge of things that  did not  appear to be quite straight. It was proposed to give the Denton Hat Mills, the woollen mills, and some other mills, a huge protection, and, in addition, to give them their machinery free.  When I suggested from my place here, as representing a large mining constituency, that the mining and other industries were reasonably entitled to the same concession, the Committee ignored the claim. Now we have an explanation from the Treasurer, which is as confusing as all his other explanations have been, and when I interjected across the chamber that it looked like some dodge, I meant it. I mean it now. I do not believe that the explanation is a correct one. If it is true that the object of the amendment is simply to legalize something done by this Committee previously, then the Treasurer's long-winded explanation is not necessary. It appears to have been made on the old principle, that language was given to man to conceal his thoughts. Apparently, language was given to the Treasurer to do something in that direction to-day. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a very simple explanation of this matter which has not been furnished by the Minister, and which it is a great pity that he did not give. On referring to the debates in another Chamber to ascertain what really took place, I find that the Department paid some of these rebates, to which the persons claiming were clearly entitled, anterior to the date when this Committeestruck out the schedule. But whilst those particular manufacturers had been alert, others, who apparently were equally entitled to the rebate, did not apply for it during the term that  the schedule was operative. </para>

                        <para>- I do not gather that from what was stated elsewhere. The explanation certainly is that those persons did not apply for their rebates. Does the Treasurer now say that the object of the Senate's proposal is to allow rebate to be paid on. machinery which was in transit and had not arrived at the time? We have no right to grant a rebate upon anything which had not been imported and installed before the date on which the schedule was struck out. The Minister now says that some people did not take possession of this machinery, and therefore, were not entitled to the rebate. If they had not taken possession of their machinery before the date specified, they were clearly not entitled to rebate, so that what the Treasurer is proposing to do is to legalize an illegality. If we are to do that kind of thing, we should, as the honorable members for Indi and Maranoa have pointed out, serve all alike. Why should we single out these two kinds of machinery for this specially favorable treatment? That is neither fair nor just. I suppose that we shall shortly hear some more from the Minister when he has had it pumped into him from behind the Speaker's chair ; but, in the meantime, the position appears to be as I have stated it! There can be no . objection to the proposal in. so far as it refers to rebates earned during the specified period. But if that is the scope and intent of the proposal, what is it needed for at all ? The persons concerned were . entitled to rebate up to the time when we altered the law. It appears to me that this proposal is possibly intended to provide for rebate on machinery in transit at the time. </para>

                            says that it is not. He says that in some cases manufacturers received their rebates, but in other cases they neither claimed nor. received them, and the object of the amendment requested by the Senate is to see that all are treated alike, and to place . those who did not apply for rebates on the same footing as those who did, and received them. Does the Minister say that there are persons who were entitled to the rebate who did not apply for it during the specified period?. I should like to have an answer to that question. This proposal is not necessary for any refunds made prior to the date of the alteration, and can only relate to refunds intended to be made since that date.

                        <para>- That machinery was not subject to rebate. The machinery with which we are now dealing was subject to rebate under the Tariff as originally introduced. The amendment requested by the Senate is intended to provide for the payment of rebate in the case of machinery that was imported, but not installed, up to the date referred to, and I think that it is only fair, that rebate should be allowed on such machinery. </para>

                        <para>- No; it has not been done. Rebate has been refused unless the machinery has been installed. I know of one case where the machinery was lying on the wharf at a Queensland port, and the importers could get no rebate because it was not installed. I wish to have no insinuations made in connexion with this matter, because I have had nothing whatever to do with it. I feel that it is only a fair thing that the importers of this class of machinery who had landed, but had not installed, their machines up to the date referred to, should receive the same consideration as those who had installed their machinery at that date. I am not sure that it would not be wise, if we were in a position to do so, to deal in the same way with all machinery which could not be manufactured here. Feeling in this way, I do not think I should have been justified in letting this matter go through without informing the Committee as to what the requested amendment really means. It is due to our exclusion of a provision which appeared in the Tariff as' originally introduced, and the request is made in order to validate certain things done up to the elate when the alteration was made. </para>

                    <para>-- The Minister may accept my assurance that this proposal would not be agreed to without explanation. I might describe the discussion which is . now taking place as the last act in connexion with one of the most objectionable features of the Tariff. I do not say that it is not the duty of the Committee to keep faith with people who were invited to import goods under certain conditions, but I do say that it was a most objectionable thing for the Government to propose any such arrangement, and it would be still more objectionable to continue it. The Government having entered into an obligation to give a rebate to individuals importing a particular class of machinery in the event of its being installed for a particular purpose, must keep faith with those individuals. I do not approve of the granting of these' rebates, but the Government being committed to it, it is the duty of Parliament now to see that individuals who were able to have this machinery installed a few days earlier than others, because, perhaps, they knew more of the ropes, should not be given an advantage which is denied to others engaged in the same industry. I understand from the Minister's third explanation that it is the object of the requested amendment to provide for the grant of a rebate under bylaw in compliance with the provision struck out of the Tariff as it appeared originally, in respect of certain machinery only up to the dates specified. The honorable member for Maranoa suggests that the provision should apply to machinery' required for wool scouring, but it is absolutely impossible to give effect to that suggestion at this stage. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that there is some justification fpr my honorable friend's suggestion that the people who have derived this advantage are those who have been able to have their views presented to Parliament every day of the week. I say that it is our duty at this stage to confine the application of the objectionable provision to what it was at first intended to apply, and to see that this shall be the last of the . arrangement for the granting of rebates to persons introducing machinery required for industries the productions of which are themselves highly protected. If it can be demonstrated to Parliament that the machinery necessary for the carrying on of any industry cannot be made in the Commonwealth, such machinery should be admitted free; but we  should not agree to a proposal to allow the Minister to grant rebates only to such as may happen to catch his ear. </para>

                        <para>- I take exception to the proposal to allow refunds. When the Executive resolution imposing a new Tariff was laid upon the table, the old Tariff was superseded unconditionally, and, as the honorable member for Maranoa has properly contended, if one industry is now to be given an advantage; all should be similarly treated. During the long, tedious debates on the Tariff, numerous appeals for the consideration of the primary industries have been made in vain. The requirements of the mining companies have been brought under notice, and the honorable member for Maranoa has called attention to an important industry connected with pastoral pursuits ; but, apparently, it is only, those industries whose directors are able to get the ear of the Minister which are to be benefited. We know that the Denton Hat Mills are situated not far from here, so that their directors may have' frequent interviews with the Minister. Such interviews seem to have taken place with advantage to them. As I showed some months ago, they have for the last two years paid dividends of 10 per cent., and have put 5 per cent. to their- reserves, while their £1 shares were quoted a few months ago at 38s. At  that time their hats were protected by a duty of 25 per cent., and are now protected by specific rates ranging up to the equivalent of 120, and even, in some cases, of 180 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> Yet it is proposed tq single out the hatting industry for exemption in respect to duties on machinery. Some of the low-grade propositions, as they are called, in Western Aus-' tralia, whose results barely pay wages, are charged the full duty on their machinery. So, too, are the industries connected with pastoral pursuits. Yet the hatting industry is not only coddled by high protective duties on hat's, but used also to enjoy the peculiar privilege of being .exempt from the payment, of duty on machinery. The Minister tells us that he thinks it a fair thing that a rebate should be paid on the machinery imported for hat-making, but how have other industries been treated ? I brought under the notice of the Minister of Trade and Customs a case in which a New South Wales industry had been required to pay ,£600 in duty under an item which Parliament subsequently made free, a . refund of the money so paid being refused. If it is only fair to make a refund on machinery imported for hat-making, why should not a refund be made in the case to which I refer? However, it is proposed to treat the hat industry differently from, any other, up to a certain date. The Minister tells us that the schedule has been brought forward to permit the refund of duties paid during the time which elapsed between the introduction of the Tariff and the consideration of the machinery items. I do not think that the industry is entitled to the proposed refund. The Tariff- resolutions abrogated the Tariff of 1902, including its exemptions, and every industry became liable unconditionally for the payment of the new duties. Until Parliament agrees to the proposed exemption, no industry will be entitled to a refund. I submit .that the proposal should be negatived. I. object to it, first, because it differentiates between this one industry and others ; secondly because there , are hundreds of cases in which duties' not sanctioned by Parliament were paid, and will not be refunded ; and, thirdly, because the proposal, being in the nature of an appropriation, should be conveyed by a message, and cannot be included in a taxing Bill. </para>

                    <para>.- The proposals should do good by  forcing the Committee to realize the effect of refusals to give similar consideration to other industries. Nothing is more calculated to make protection unpopular than the proposal before us. One large mining company alone has had to pay £25,000 in duty on imported- machinery, much of which is covered by patent rights, and cannot be manufactured in the Commonwealth; but the representations on behalf of the mining industry were not listened to. The hat-making industry is well established,' and yet- it is proposed that the machinery required for hat-making shall be admitted free. If the Government has made a promise which it is legally bound to fulfil, I suppose we must consent; but the honorable member for Parkes says that it is not so bound. In my opinion, favoritism is being shown) which nothing can justify. Similar treatment is not proposed for the wool -scouring industry. Apparently, protectionists are ready to consider only the interests of manufacturers who make things to sell in this country; they will not consider the interests of those whose productions have to compete in the markets of the world.  </para>

                    <para>.- I shall not occupy time -by repeating the remarks of other speakers. In my opinion, the honorable member for Parkes raised very strong objections to this proposal. The honorable member for Darling has referred  to the lack of consideration given to the mining industry. It is singular that the hatmaking industry, whose productions receive a protection equivalent to 120 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">aif valorem,</inline> is alone to be permitted to import its machinery free. As I have said on many previous occasions, the engineering trades have received least consideration under the Tariff. Those connected with them are taxed on their hats, and on everything else they wear or use. Yet, while they have to pay duties for the advantage of the hat-making industry, they get no return, since it is allowed to import its machinery free of duty. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie said that this is objectionable ; I say that it is scandalous. I hope that the protectionists of the Committee will show themselves disposed to assist the engineering trades, and will vote against the proposal. Why should this advantage be granted to the industries specified? 'Not only the people on the spot, but also the industries on the spot have received the first consideration. One of the reasons why I changed my attitude on fiscalism was because such industries had received special treatment, while industries far removed-  from this city had been neglected Throughout the consideration of the Tariff I have been fighting on behalf of the engineering and machinery industries. They have received the least protection, and when there is a chance for them to do some work, surely they have a claim upon a highly-protected industry like hat-making ! It is really scandalous that any protectionist should allow this proposal to pass. Those who should receive some consideration are picked out to be penalized in the interests of the proprietors of woollen mills and hat factories. </para>

It ought to be done in a separate measure. I do not see how the Minister can ask for an indemnity'in this Bill. For that reason, and others, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> shall oppose the proposal. In my opinion, it is a dangerous one. </para>

What I said was, that I wanted the 'Committee to understand that there was lying on the wharf certain machinery, which was in exactly the same category as machinery which had been installed, and oh which a rebate had been allowed. It seemed to me to be unfair to give a rebate to one man simply because he happened to get' his machinery installed a day before the machinery of another man was landed on the wharf. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Maranoa saw me on .the subject', and I made a promise to him. I moved that special wool-scouring machinery, which, according to my information, was not made here, should get a rebate, because I had made a promise to that honorable member, as I deemed that it was just ; but he relieved me of the promise, and, therefore, I did not persevere with my proposal, and there the machinery has remained ever since. AIT I wanted to do to-day was to explain what this meant. If the Committee desires to allow a rebate on the machinery which has not been installed, it can say so. The Department will not, and cannot. </para>

                        <para>- It will not. Under the provision I have quoted, and also under the old Tariff, a rebate was allowed 'in the case of this machinery, and the day that this schedule was cancelled by the Committee was the last day on which. a rebate was given. There has been none paid since that time.  The object of this proposal is to validate what was done under the schedule before it was repealed. </para>

I take it that the phrase " when installed " is the condition precedent to any rebate. There, can be no rebate paid on any machinery which has not been , installed. </para>

The object of this schedule is to validate the payment of the latter claims. I am informed that,- unless it is passed, the Comptroller-General will be called upon to recover the moneys which have been re-: funded. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister's pious expression of . opinion of what would be a fair thing has nothing to do with the provision. We are only confusing ourselves when it is imported into the debate. I take it, therefore, that the object of the proposal is merely to validate applications which came in at the same time as the others, and were equally - good, and that unless it is passed the rebates will have to be recovered from the applicants who were paid. We must accept the responsibility for our action. If we led these person's to import this kind of machinery up to a certain date, and promised them a rebate of the duty up to a certain date, we must keep faith with them no matter how wrong it may be to distinguish them from other sections of the community. That is the point I take - the simple point of justice. I admit the anomaly, but there is the contract. </para>

                        <para>- We have authorized them- as we have authorized all duties that have been collected and not refunded - not under the Tariff, but under, the Customs Act. Under that Act, refunds need not be made. We are entitled to retain all that we collect, unless there is some specific provision for a rebate. We have in this schedule a specific provision, and under its terms some rebates have been made in the case of certain applications, but refused in respect of others which were lodged at the same time, but in Sydney instead of in Melbourne. Owing to their being lodged in Sydney instead of Melbourne they have not been granted. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that there can be any doubt that, following the usual practice in these matters, we must validate what has been already done. It is not easy for the House to say that it has given no express authority for any rebate, because Parliament is responsible for the acts of Ministers. We can punish Ministers; but an executive act must be upheld by the House. We cannot repudiate what has been done by executive' authority ; all that we can do is to punish those who have done wrong. That being so, we are compelled, whether we like it or not, to validate what has been done. I do not think that any great measure of sympathy need, be extended to those engaged in highly protected industries in respect of their having to pay duty upon their machinery. I am prepared to vote that they be called upon to pay duty on their machinery, but when we have to deal with a mere question of validating acts done under resolution of the House, it seems to me that the only course open to us i.o to approve of the request of the Senate as it comes to us. I regret that it is not possible to make provision for some of the cases mentioned by the Treasurer. I know  of a case in my own electorate where, following the encouragement offered under the Bounties Act, passed last session, to the wool " tops " industry, a lot of machinery is about to be imported into Australia- </para>

This machinery is intended for use in an indus-. try which is not protected, although Parliament recognised, by granting a bounty, if it is successfully established here, that it will lead to great industrial changes in Australia. Machinery of this kind has not been made here, and it seems, rather unwise to hamper the establishment of a totally new industry .by imposing a duty upon it. </para>

                    <para>.- A few moments ago, I gave expression to a certain opinion which the discussion, to my mind, has proved to be well founded. If the Treasurer had told the Committee what this request really meant, we should have understood his action, but I think that the requested schedule means a very important leakage. The Treasurer has repeated the words I used on a previous occasion when the. leader of the Opposition drew attention to this most remarkable schedule providing for a rebate on imports for home consumption. The debate on that schedule took place on the 28th November, and we then' struck out of it not only item 124, but items 164 and 166. We prohibited the granting of any further rebates under the schedule from that date, yet we now find that it is proposed under this request that rebates shall be granted up to and including nth December, 1907. </para>

As a matter of fact, we made no alteration in respect of the date; we struck out the whole schedule. This request has been made to justify the action of the Treasurer, and the Government have actually exceeded the power granted by Parliament. The schedule was not debated on nth December, and this House did not agree to rebates being granted up to that date. </para>

                        <para>- I have looked up <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and know what I am talking about. I well remember when the schedule was under consideration. It was then said that consideration should be given to pastoralists who had to import machinery, and also to those engaged in the mining industry. That consideration was not granted. I have a particularly clear recollection of'' the incident, because I drew attention to the fact .that the Stanley Mining Company had imported special machinery which could not be made here, and that it could not obtain a rebate of duty, although a rebate was granted on machinery imported for use in the Denton Hat Mills, which are protected to the extent of 150 per cent. As the leader of the Opposition said, the Government collected the duty on hat-making machinery at the front door and returned it at the back door. We now have a proposal to exceed the power which the Committee then gave the Government. I say, unhesitatingly, that this is a proposal to extend the granting of rebates from 28th November until the nth December. If the Government can deal in this way with the revenue of the Commonwealth, then Parliament has very little power over it. I agree with the statement made by the honorable member for Parkes that a special Bill is necessary to' legalize this proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that some confusion has been created in the minds of honorable members owing to the manner in which the reason underlying this request' was placed before the Committee by the Treasurer. As I  understand it, this schedule is merely intended to validate the action of the Customs Department up to certain dates - the dates upon which we made alterations in the rebates granted upon the articles therein enumerated. To that request I take no exception whatever. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">But the Treasurer is apparently anxious to feel the pulse of the Committee in regard to quite another proposition, and it would be unfortunate if he were to gather from the attitude of honorable members that he could do what he seemed to suggest would be fair, namely, grant rebates to. those persons who, whilst they had on the wharfs at the period indicated, machinery, intended to be used in woollen mills and hat factories, had not actually installed it in their factories. Such a step would constitute a grave departure from the whole principle which has hitherto guided us in respect of similar matters. It would be an attempt to remedy, perhaps, two or three cases of hardship whilst ignoring thousands of cases in which an equal amount of hardship has been imposed in connexion with other' items in the Tariff. There is no difference - so far as the hardship inflicted is concerned - between machinery which was lying on the wharfs and had not been installed in factories upon the date that we made the alteration in the rebate of duty, and machinery on which duty was increased which was on board ship at the wharfs and the entries in respect of which had not been passed. </para>

                        <para>- I fail to see it. We know that those having goods in vessels which have discharged the goods at their first port of call on our coast have only had to pay the lower rate of duty in respect of those goods, whereas at their next port of call they halve been obliged to pay a higher rate upon the same class of goods. Although such cases may seem to be hard, the Treasurer has declined to consider them. He has adhered to the principle that the duties imposed by this Committee ought to be collected from the date upon which they were levied. I do not know whether he intends to submit a proposal of the character to which I have previously referred. </para>

I do hope that, for the sake of equity and symmetry, he will not make an exception in the present instance,' seeing that he has already refused to make an exception in thousands of other cases involving an equal measure Qf hardship. </para>

                    <para>- - This schedule has been inserted  by the Senate, and purports to permit of rebates being made upon certain articles intended for home consumption. The rebates relate to piece goods used in the manufacture of rubber waterproof cloth and to machinery used in woollen milts of hat factories. I have listened attentively to the several explanations made by the Treasurer as to the reason why this schedule was inserted by the Senate, and I confess that I am not quite clear as to what really lies behind it. In. the first place, the honorable gentleman has told us thai, prior to the dates specified in the schedule, the Customs Department made certain rebates to the importers of these articles, and that it is necessary to indemnify the Treasury for the action that has been taken. The point upon which I am in doubt is why the Department made these exemptions? </para>

                        <para>- Nor do I, but certainly that is the inference to be drawn from the remarks of the Treasurer earlier in the evening, when he indicated that he did not wish his proposition to be passed without the Committee being fully aware of his meaning,' and of their powers. If I have correctly interpreted the utterances of the honorable the Treasurer,  1  should like to know what are the privileges of the Committee with .respect to other branches of industry? Would it be possible for an honorable member to move an addition embracing some other industry which is quite as much in need of the concession as is the particular industry referred to? Here we have a Victorian industry, which has enjoyed the advantage of high protection for twenty-five or thirty years- advantages which have never been denied by the Federal Parliament - and this' industry is carried on with the aid of duty amounting to 120 per cent, on some lines. One particular firm was mentioned by the honorable member for Parkes, and the figures he .quoted showed it to be a fairly flourishing industry, paying 10 per cent, on its capital, carrying 5 per cent, to a reserve fund, and having its paid-up £1 shares quoted at 38s. in the market. This is an industry which was specially favoured by the Treasurer under the old Tariff, and it is the industry for which this special concession is now sought. I ask the Treasurer to compare this industry with the farming industry in his own electorate, which is just now being overwhelmed by the rabbit pest. In the original Tariff the Treasurer proposed to impose duties of 25 per cent, and 30 per cent, on wire netting, but the House decided to remit that taxation. Only the other day I received a letter from a constituent who was compelled to pay <inline font-style="italic">£^5</inline> in duty on 5 miles of wire netting necessary to protect his holding against the rabbit pest, but it is not proposed by the Treasurer to indemnify that struggling man, and thus .place him in the same position as those who imported prior to 8th August, or since 1st May. If the whole question is open, as may be gathered from the Treasurer's remarks, I should like to move a further addition, placing wire netting on the same basis, and empowering the Treasurer to return to the users - I do not say the importers - the duty paid on the wire netting actually used in enclosing land against the rabbit pest. As to the particular interest under discussion, I have no desire to deal with it harshly, because I should like to see the necessary machinery introduced as cheaply as possible; but I do object to an industry being so coddled as to be given a distinct advantage over other industries. The agricultural and pastoral industries are vital to the progress of the Commonwealth, and those engaged in the fight against the rabbits deserve every consideration at our hands. It is unfair that those who were compelled to fence during the time the duty was eoi'lected should be penalized, whilst those who imported prior to the 8th August, or since 1st May, should obtain their wire netting duty free. With a view to testing the question, I give notice that at the proper time I shall move the addition to schedule B of the following1 - </para>

                    <para>. -  The , proposal foreshadowed by the honorable member for Calare is just what.  one might expect to result from: that now submitted by the Government. This is not a new question, but one handed down from the Tariff of 1901-2; and such a provision is bad, and ought not to have been introduced by the present Government. An opportunity should have been given to the Committee to say whether they would perpetuate an advantage to any particular industries. At any rate, the Government now ask the Committee to validate what has been done, and that, I think, is a proper thing to do. Possibly the Government have been advised by their Attorney-General that there is some technicality as to date, and to make matters doubly sure, as has been the way of the Government all through, we have this proposal before us. . Even if it were possible to- bring -all classes of machinery under such a provision, I should still regard it as unsound and unbusinesslike, for the reason that it would give those already in an industry an advantage of 75 per cent, or 1 00  per cent, over those who might subsequently enter on the  same line of business. I should even regard the provision outlined by the honorable member fr.r Calare as unfair and unsound, inasmuch as the rebate would never find its way into the pockets of the people who have paid for the wire netting at the increased cost ; and thus the advantage would really go to the importer or distributor. I  think, however, that there must be something more in the mind of the Treasurer than has been made clear to the Committee. The honorable gentleman would never waste the whole afternoon on a  proposal  so simple as that in the schedule, but must, I think, have an' intention of, by-and-by, submitting an amendment to include consignments of machinery that were on the wharf, and not actually placed in the factory, on the ground that those who- had in good faith introduced those imports, should- receive some consideration of the kind. If that be the intention, I assume that I would be out of order in discussing it at the present time. I may say, however, that I should regard such a proposal, as quite improper, because all engaged in importing should be placed on exactly the same level. It may be that these few anticipatory remarks may have the effect of inducing the Treasurer to change his mind, seeing that he has not had the courage to table a motion to the effect indicated. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the discussion on this schedule closes, I desire to say one or' two words in modification of an opinion I expressed at an earlier stage on the constitutional aspect <inline font-style="italic">el</inline> the question. I was under the impression, when the present Tariff was intro'duced, that there was not a similar provision in the Tariff of. 1/901.-2. .From that I made the deduction that the rebate could not be given, and that this provision was an improper one. But I find that at the foot of the page upon which the duties- upon machinery are included, there is a note to this effect - </para>

                <para class="block">That seems to me to. get rid of the objection that the rebate provision in the schedule is in the nature of an appropriation, and would require a different Bill ; because the note gives it the character of a modification of a duty introduced in the Tariff. But it seems to me, also, that that note cuts the ground from under the proposal which the honorable member for Calare has indicated ; because it is quite clear that no rebates could be provided for in the part of the schedule which we are now debating, unless there had been some provision in the Tariff originally for rebates which it is intended to indemnify the Government for having paid. I still, however, hold the opinion that the provision now under discussion is unnecessary. It -may be. desirable to have it in for the sake of extra' precaution, but if the schedule provides fora rebate, then I do not see. any necessity for putting this new provision into the Tariff at the present time. I shall not, however, find fault with it on that ground, because it only makes what is intended to be correct, doubly correct. I want to say a word about the prolongation of the debate. I quite agree with the honorable member for North Sydney that the whole matter has been accentuated largely by reason of the very confused statements which the Minister has made. </para>

His  character reminds me very much of Bret .Harte's " Heathen Chinee." He works in the dark, and one never knows what he has up that wide sleeve of his, to bring forth at any time and lay upon the table. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie seems to think" that everything is clear and above board. But it is not so clear as the honorable member seems to think. </para>

Well, I need not tell the Committee that under this provision, unless the machinery is actually " placed," on or before the dates mentioned as to those two particular classes of machinery, the owners will not be legally entitled to the rebate. </para>

                        <para>- It must be " in position '.' ; and, therefore, whatever the Treasurer may think to be a fair thing - and I am bound to say that a fair thing in his mind is a very .varying factor, according to the point of view, and the peri sons whose interests are affected - will not make it law. The Treasurer, therefore, will have no possible right to make a rebate, as to importations in the past or in the future, with regard to any machinery that is not actually placed in position on or before one of the dates mentioned. The Treasurer says - or did say in. another of his speeches - that the money had been paid, and that this provision . was merely to indemnify the Government for what they had done. Perhaps the Treasurer is going to propose an amendment in order to enable the- rebate to be paid to those who had machinery on the wharf but not placed in position. But when he was asked during the course of the debate whether he intended to submit an amendment, he said that he did not; and. when the honorable member for North Sydney addressed .the Committee after the dinner hour and asked the Treasurer whether he intended moving an amendment extending the rebate to cases ' in which the machinery was upon the wharf but not placed in position, he simply smiled. I may again mention the "Heathen Chinee" as a fair illustration of the sort of smile. He would not say, in answer to the honorable member for North Sydney, whether or not he would' favour an amendment, if moved, for the  purpose of granting a rebate in cases where machinery was not placed in position. Well, I do not know that 'anybody has shown any inclination or disposition to move such an amendment. But I hope that if one is suggested, the Committee will remember this. I can mention a number ot cases. One occurred in my own  constituency,  and came very prominently under my own notice. Ritchie Brothers, the well-known agricultural machinery makers, imported some machinery for use in their own industry. They wanted it immediately, in order, to complete a very big work. They paid £600 in duty upon that machinery. This House subsequently made the goods free. Of course, an application, was made for a refund of the whole or part of the payment, but none of the money was ever refunded. That was in accordance with the principle acted upon by the Customs authorities under the law towards all persons who pay duty upon goods afterwards ' made free of duty. </para>

                        <para>- There are, but I only mention one, because I happen to know of the circumstances. If we are going to adjust matters by what the Minister considers to be a fair thing, I consider that it would be a fair thing to refund the thousands of pounds which have been paid in duty in cases where the House has afterwards decided that no duty is to be imposed. Therefore, if the Treasurer knows of any amendment, or- intends moving one himself,  which  would have the effect of giving a rebate upon machinery which was not fixed in position as required by the law, I hope the Committee will set its face against such a proposal, and will say that if we are going to make fish of one we shall make fish of all, and not treat one set of people differently from another. The case which has been mentioned by the honorable member for Calare and the honorable member for Kalgoorlie,  where a refund to the last copper was made on machinery imported by a hat-making company, which is' making ' profits of 15 per cent, per annum and setting aside a large sum tq a reserve account - although that machinery has not been placed in position - is one of those conundrums which I do not pretend to solve. I do not think that the case would have been unearthed except for the leader of the Opposition's comments upon the unfairness. I think that the Treasurer ought to tell us whether anything more is to be paid. I ask him to tell me now whether there are any rebates, which have not been paid, upon machinery which had not been placed in position prior to these dates. </para>

                    <para>- In face of that statement, and of the fact that the schedule as originally introduced gave him the power to make rebates, where is the necessity for this declaration of the validity of his action? I do not subscribe to the doctrine of dodgery in connexion with this matter, no do I believe in taking up that line of debate, but the Minister must surely admit that under the resolution which he moved when he submitted the new Tariff schedule, which superseded the old Tariff, he had authority to pay rebates, and evidently he has done so. </para>

                        <para>- It may suit- the Minister to throw the responsibility on the Opposition, but other honorable members wanted enlightenment as to the effect of the proposal. If that is the extent of it, I see no reasonable objection to it, although it appears to be a duplication, but if there is any intention of making it a searching provision in order that some other people may get rebates, I can assure the Treasurer, that he will receive a hundred applications ' for consideration from my constituency alone in connexion with imported articles the duty on which has since . been ' reduced or removed. There would be no end to it. The Committee hais, I think wisely, decided that no more applications for rebates are to be considered. The Minister might have stated whether he intended to submit an amendment with the' object of giving special consideration in the case of certain other kinds of machinery, but I admit that he is not compelled to show his hand. I warn him, however, that if it is to be a question of getting special consideration for certain classes of machinery, I shall probably entertain or penalize the Committee with an enumeration of cases that are deserving of consideration if any are to be considered. </para>

                    <para>.- I quite agree with the general position taken up by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, but I think he is forced into the position of being a trusting onlooker of the Treasurer's action. I do not think he wishes to give the Treasurer the enormous powers which he will undoubtedly get under this proposal if it is passed, especially in view of the Minister's doubt as to whether or not he has anything up his sleeve. He first of all told the honorable member for Kalgoorlie and the Committee that no further rebates were going to be paid under this proposal . Then he said that some might have to be paid ; and afterwards, when we pressed him, he said he would not bind himself one way or the other. I rise to suggest to the Treasurer a means by which he can prove his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline></para>

                        <para>- We seem to have been looking for several hours at the pathetic picture of a fairly intelligent Committee trying to understand a still more intelligent Treasurer. The Treasurer has made no fewer than seven speeches to explain his  position, and the Committee have made even more numerous efforts to understand him. We appear now to have the Minister in an absolute dead-lock. He says, on the one hand, that no more payments will be made, and, on the other, that he is not' going to give his position away by definitely admitting that no more payments will be made. The Committee 'is dead against the making of these payments by the Government contrary to the intention of Parliament. We can take that as an axiom. If any more rebates are to be paid, I would suggest that they receive the formal ratification of Parliament, in the same way as is done with regulations under certain Acts. If further payments are to be made, why should not! the Minister place them in a schedule and ask both Houses to pass a resolution to make them law? Will the Minister adopt that course? I think we are entitled to a reply, even if the Minister is still at this eleventh hour trying to understand . the subject. If he will not reply, he will put us in the position of having to move some such motion as I have foreshadowed. I cannot make the honorable gentleman out. Our difficulty is to understand what is behind that forehead of his. </para>

I have offered a suggestion with the most friendly feelings to a Minister who is obviously floundering in difficulties. He will not be straightforward with the Committee. It is only circumstances - I will not say constitutional disabilities - that prevent him. </para>

                        <para>- I told the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, perhaps more distinctly than any other member of the Committee, that the rebates paid, or to be paid, were made under the schedule which appeared in the Tariff as originally introduced, and which was rejected by the Committee when we reached it. On the nth December last, so far as piece-goods were concerned, the schedule referred to was annulled; but up to that date it gave authority for the payment of rebates, and up to the 28th November the same provision applied to the machinery referred to in the schedule. </para>

                        <para>- The remark was intended to be insulting, and we have arrived at a stage when I shall not quietly submit to insults from such a source. I stated to the honorable member for Kalgoorlie that rebates would only be paid in respect . to piece-goods, up to the nth December, and of this class of machinery, up to the 28th November, 1907, the dates on which the Committee decided to omit the provisions of the rebate schedule. I have no personal knowledge of the matter, and I spoke only from information received from the Customs Department, and I say that there has been nothing on which rebate has been promised or paid that was not installed before the dates referred to. Why I mentioned the matter at all was because rebate was not paid on some imported machinery which was left on the wharfs, and was not installed, and I felt that it ought to have been dealt with as if it had been installed. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that unless something more is done by the Committee, it would not come under the rebate schedule, and rebate could not be paid in respect of it. Honorable members appeared to be in doubt as to whether rebates were to be made. I said that there might be disputes in connexion with some claims for rebates which have not yet been met, but that there . was no proposal to pay rebates in respect of importations after the dates named in the schedule. I did not ' know how much was involved. I was not aware at the time that some payments were not made, and I wished to guard myself against a reply without- absolute knowledge. Some honorable members desired to trip me up afterwards, and say a claim of £20 was not paid here, or a claim of £10 was not paid there. </para>

I said that I believed that all claims for rebate had been met, and that no rebate would be paid in respect of piece goods that were not imported up to the11th December, or in respect of machinery that was not installed before the 28th November. I have been as straight as I could be in dealing with the matter, but deliberate attempts have been made to misconstrue what I said. The Minister of Trade and Customs is present, and I know that he will not allow the payment of any rebate , which was not covered by the schedule. </para>

The Minister has said now that only machinery which was installed before the 28th November, 1907, can be considered for rebate, and honorable members will agree that the Government must meet any valid claim for rebate in respect of such machinery. </para>

                    COOK (Parramatta; [8.55]. - I take it that the honorable member for Wentworth will not, press his amendment after the statement we have just heard from the Minister. If the honorable member was not convinced before, he ought to be after the lucid speech to which we have just listened. I venture to say that all the trouble which has arisen has been due to a lack of straightforwardness on the part of the Minister. The honorable gentleman's tactics during the evening have been in the direction of what is called " feeling '' the Committee to discover whether honorable members would agree to a further modification of the proposal as it comes to us from the Senate. All his talk on the subject has tended to confuse the issue, and his six or seven explanations were made with the object, if possible, of enlarging the scope of the Senate's suggestion. The Minister has practically  admitted   that if he has not said so in so many words. The whole evening has been wasted by the honorable gentleman's effort to discover whether the Committee would stand any more of this kind of thing. Now that he has stated exactly the scope of the requested amendment, honorable members will have no difficulty in agreeing to validate anything which might legally have been done before the dates mentioned in the rebate schedule. To do so will be to do a simple act of justice. Other industries do not share in the favours granted to those specially referred to in the schedule, because we did not place them in the  same  favorable position when we originally considered the Tariff. That is our own doing, and we must abide by it. I take it that, after the last explanation of the Minister, which has cleared up all our doubts, the Committee will be prepared to vote with him for the validation of the payment of rebates to which importers are really entitled.

                    <para>.- Whilst I am unable altogether to subscribe to the very flattering interpretation which the honorable member for Parramatta has placed on the inability of the Treasurer to explain himself, I do not propose to press my amendment after the ninth - or was. it the tenth explanation - which the honorable gentleman has delivered. I  am  unable to agree with the honorable member for Parramatta that the Treasurer's speech was a. lucid one, because I had to leave the chamber while he was delivering it. I Understand, however, that the honorable gentleman has now definitely told the Committee that a sum of£41 5 is the most that is involved in the present proposal. In view of that circumstance, I am prepared not to press my amendment, and, for the further reason that we may proceed with the consideration of the item covering pianos, in connexion with which I have certain hopes for the Treasurer, because of the soothing charm which music is said to have in certain directions, I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Under the circumstances, it is well to emphasize the attitude of certain honorable, members, and their evident desire to protect foreign rather than Australian industries. Therefore I refuse to allow this 'motion to go on the voices. A great deal of notice will be taken of the division . lists in the manufacturing centres of the Commonwealth, and I wish that to be done, so that it may be known that there is a leaven amongst the representatives of the people here, destroying Australian industries. </para>
