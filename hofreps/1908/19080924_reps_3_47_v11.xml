                        <para>- I am not aware that the information is inadequate. As the appointment of a Committee would mean the indefinite postponement of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, I do not think it should be asked for. Similar legislation has been before us on two or three occasions; and in the debates upon it full use has been made of the results of the prolonged investigation of a Commonwealth Royal Commission. I am at a loss to understand how anything can be added of that kind. </para>

                            <para>The staff at the post office is considerably undermanned. Under a State Department there were four officers; now, under Federal control, there are a postmaster, one officer, and a lad. The work of the office has nearly doubled with the return of good seasons. Mails are now forwarded to the Far North by nearly every special, and, as these trains leave at various times of the day and night, this, in itself, is no small task to cope with? </para>

                    <para>.- On a former occasion I asked the Treasurer to permit the motion to be regarded as unopposed, but he did not extend to me the courtesy that I hoped he would. He told me that it would be opposed, and consequently the motion which was on the paper all through last session never came before the House. It involves information which I hope will be useful to the Commonwealth, and there should be no opposition to any motion of that kind. In these circumstances, I shall press it. </para>

                            <para>- It comes to the same thing, and I would rather put it my own way. So much attention has been called to this question that I thought it advisable to ask the House, without saying anything detrimental to any of the companies, to help me to obtain a Select Committee to quietly examine witnesses, go into  the whole question of insurance, and ascertain whether or not the present method is honest, just, legitimate, and righteous. If it is not, let us devise some system or form that will do justice to .the whole of the people without injuring any. The basis of all life assurance is a graduated system of premiums according to age. The actuaries are 'able to state what is the expectation of any healthy man's life at any age. That is all laid out, and on it they are able to calculate how much a man al any age should be called upon to pay. If, then, we can get at the absolute figures, and are in a position to secure the required information, it seems to me that no honorable member should hesitate to agree to the appointment of this Committee. I have not named the Committee, because I want to draw it from all parts of the House. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> in his <inline font-style="italic">Official Year-Book</inline> for 1908, gives most interesting figures. For ordinary life assurance the number of policies in force in Australia, in 1906, exclusive of annuities, was 446,894. The amounts assured, exclusive of bonus additions, etc., were ,£107,809,911; the bonus additions totalled £13,809,062 ; or a grand total of £121,618,973. The annual premium income for the whole of the Commonwealth was ,£3,648,914. In regard to industrial insurance, the number of policies in force in 1906 was 346,283. The amount assured came to ,£7,301,581, and the annual premium income was <inline font-style="italic">£$9A5i-</inline> The receipts and expenses for 1906 for ordinary life assurance" in Australia were - receipts, £5,372,054; expenditure, £3*688,338 ; excess receipts- addition to funds - £1,683,716. The receipts and expenditure for industrial insurance for 1906 were as follow : - Receipts, ;£42°&gt;337 ; expenditure, £284,385; excess receipts - addition to funds - £135,992. It is claimed - I do not sa.y that I have any evidence of the fact, except the common reports - that the expenses of industrial insurance are very high, and fall particularly on the poor ; that some of the companies that are doing industrial insurance get so much extra for it that it enables them to reduce the cost of the ordinary insurance ; whereas, if the ordinary insurance had to stand upon its own basis its expenses would come out very heavy indeed. It is asserted that by taxing the very poorest people in the community - those cases where the collectors go from house to house gathering in 6d. or is. a week, as the case may be - and by adding that to the totals, the companies are enabled to reduce the cost of the ordinary insurance on those that are- well able to pay for it. We have to ascertain if there is any truth in that statement. I am not making charges against any company ; I think that all the companies are endeavouring to do what they conscientiously believe to be right. But the time has come for all parties of whatever shade or colour of politics to take a broad, liberal view of the legitimate commercial enterprises of the Commonwealth, wherever carried on. It is our duty to guard both rich and poor, and particularly to guard the weak against the encroachments of the strong. As the great Gladstone said1, it is the obligation of the Government to make it as hard as possible to do wrong, and as easy, as possible to do right. I should like now to quote from the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> the  President  of the Congress of Actuaries of New South Wales, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Banking and Insurance Record</inline> of the present month. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> in the course of his remarks, said - </para>

                        <para>It has been stated by actuaries and statisticians that every man is an asset to his nation, an asset of monetary value, well into three figures in pounds sterling. How does the nation treat these valuable assets? Is not the nation criminally wasteful or ignorantly uneconomic in its behaviour towards these assets? Is not a better system possible, and cannot you actuaries supply us with some better scheme, and afford us some idea of the financial cost of inaugurating and carrying on some such improved and more rational scheme? This question, or series of questions, were put to me somewhat in these very words only last Christmas. Not being able to deal with these points off my own bat, I now pass them on to my own brethren. </para>
                        <para>At the present time a certain section of the community meets this demand by mutual cooperation in the shape of medical attention and sick pay at their own cost. It is suggestive  to notice how the friendly societies are more and more becoming endowed by the State, but also more and more tending to what I may call unofficial servants of the State. This process of nationalising friendly society benefits will probably continue. The provision for premature death is at present met by life assurance, supplied to the member at his own cost, by private companies, run for profit to the members, and, in some cases, for profit to shareholders. Will such a condition continue? I doubt it. Will the State, which has, in the interests of all, taken over the police from local government, the education of the people from the religious bodies, the management of water supply and sewerage, the management of railways, tramways, harbours, roads, lighting, ferries, and so on, now stop short? Personally, I think it will not be allowed to so continue, although I am not yet prepared to admit as desirable such a measure of interference as some others advocate so strongly ; but we must certainly expect a steady increase in this governmental interference. At the present moment in this Commonwealth we are promised new insurance legislation, and in this I hope our society will make its influence felt. The development on collective lines will not come all at once; it will follow the present course of social development, and gradually nationalize one industry after another. There is but little  room even now for small omnibus lines, factories, gas companies, water companies, tramways or shops; the field is occupied more and more by large companies, mammoth stores, universal providers, and so on. The same is true in insurance companies, everything points to the business being done by a few giants in place of a multitude of small companies. This may be strictly " economic " as far as the nation-unit is concerned, and 1 have no doubt that it is; but as far as the individual unit is affected he may be excused for looking at the prospect from his own or selfish point of view. Now he is a man able' to look forward to working his way on to independence, trusting to the might of his own right arm and brain; in the future all but a very few can only look forward to positions- of salaried servants in huge offices or companies. The prospect is not too alluring, but that is how it appears to me. These huge offices and companies will practically form monopolies - and since monopolies are  rightly  distrusted except when under very stringent legislative conditions, as far as the indispensable necessities of life are concerned, the State will practically have to lake charge of them. Insurance will not for long be permitted to remain in the hands of private bodies, mutual associations or proprietary companies. It will be supplied by the State at public cost to all. Not only insurance against death, but also insurance against illness, and consequent lack of income for those dependent on the sick man, and also provision for maintenance and old age will be provided by the State. Every man will be assured that in case of premature death his wife and children will not be left to the somewhat cold mercies of a heedless public; he will know that if he falls ill, he and his will be kept during the period of his incapacitation, he will know that if from old age or from incapacity through illness he will have a steady income. The field of insurance companies will be restricted to providing additional benefits over and above those provided by the State; friendly societies and accident assurance will probably find themselves <inline font-style="italic">functus officio.</inline> Insurance thus being a matter of State concern, like education, many companies will disappear as so many private schools have done. The field for managers and actuaries will be sadly circumscribed in comparison with the present field. </para>
                        <para>In the field of life assurance as we all understand it, the principal shoals seem to be well and clearly marked', and every one who has well and truly learned his trade can safely steer his way through and reach his port safely. Of shoals known to exist, but not precisely surveyed, buoyed and lit, is one, namely, the admission into a valuation of -the lapse  el-  i ment. This elment does exist always, and in any particular experience follows a law varying in each case, of course, much more steady and calculable than some are disposed to admit. To treat this factor as absolutely non-existent we know makes for safety, but to know of the existence of a factor always existent and yet to contentedly remain ignorant of how and to what extent it affects our results is, I venture to think, a reproach to us as a scientific body. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have quoted largely from the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> because he is not a labour man or a Socialist, and because he recognises that in this age of progress and civilization, the time has arrived for the State to do its duty towards the poor and the weak of the community. One of the fundamental functions of Government is to keep the peace. The Government must interfere whenever necessary to prevent violence, oppression, extortion, or any other wrong sought to be inflicted upon the people. We ought to have in Australia laws regulating and governing fire, life, and industrial insurance; but, if we have any of consequence, I have failed to discover them. It seems to me that they live only in the imagination, or that, if they do exist, they consist principally of statistical inventions and irresponsible evasions. We want prosperity for all in the Commonwealth, and honorable members will stand in their own light if they attempt to oppose the inquiry for which I ask. At times it appears to me to be almost preposterous to ask the House to carry a proposal of this kind. I admit that to a certain extent the inquiry will involve an interference with vested interests; but no honorable member desires even to attempt to touch or interfere with legitimate, honest business. Honest business and prosperity axe synonymous terms. Wherever a business is honestly conducted, wherever it is legitimate, the people engaged in it need have no fear. It is unnecessary for me to enlarge upon this subject. Honorable members are familiar with, it, and I understand that the Government do not intend to oppose my motion. Will the Attorney-General inform me whether that is so? </para>

                            <para>- I shall show the honorable member. Under the Constitution we have full power to legislate with reference to lire, life, and marine insurance. Just before we went into recess at the close of the session of 1906, this matter came before the House, and I then promised that the whole question of insurance would be inquired into, with a view, if possible, to its being dealt with in a comprehensive measure. Almost immediately afterwards  we were plunged into the throes of a general election. But on returning to Melbourne in February or March of last year I caused the question of the drafting of a Bill for fire, life, and marine insurance to be inquired into. I have now before me a rough draft of a Bill containing sixty or seventy clauses, dealing with life insurance generally. I may say that the matter of fire insurance was considered, and that a' request was sent by the Government to the United States with a, view to obtaining the latest information regarding the proposed legislation there. In reply we have recently received certain information together with draft copies of proposed legislation. I also noticed that the . Imperial Parliament had recently passed an Act dealing generally.  with the codification of the law of marine insurance. That codification was prepared by the greatest English expert on the subject, but it related only to the law of contract of insurance. I had circulated a Bill on the same subject; but when we come to deal with the whole question of insurance, and especially with the life assurance branch, we find that difficulties arise not only in regard to the contracts made between insurers and insured, but, as the honorable member for Darwin has incidentally mentioned, as to the particular terms and conditions under which life assurance should be carried on. </para>

                    <para class="block">We have involved in connexion with the question of life assurance a series of problems; such as the terms and conditions under which foreign insurance companies should be allowed to carry on business in Australia, and the guarantees which they should be required to give if allowed to conduct business here. Then a further question arises as to the nature of the returns which should be furnished by insurance companies. That branch of the subject alone involves inquiry. We have to consider whether we should have complete supervision over insurance business - whether we should continue the existing system under which a lot of returns are sent in and nothing more is heard of them, or whether we should have a superintendent of life, marine and fire insurance business to examine on behalf of the people the reports that are presented to Parliament by these companies, and to report upon them- </para>

                            <para>- Maybe ; but I am dealing now with only one problem. Considering the diversity of operations that are carried on, it seems to me that something in the direction I have mentioned is necessary. -In Australia we have no less than twenty companies carrying on _ life assurance business, the majority having their head offices in the Commonwealth. The sure assured on the lives of Australian policy holders is upwards of £100,000,000, and the assets of Australian companies total £38,000,000. These are large sums, and inquiry shows that probably as much life assurance business is done proportionately in Australia as in any other country. An analysis of the returns shows that in Australia nearly all the policies are for small amounts, the average policy being for about £250. The policy-holders are scattered all over the continent, many of them at great distances from the places where their affairs are conducted by the directors of the companies with which they are assured. Therefore, so far as life assurance is concerned, it is highly desirable to obtain thorough and complete publicity as to the manner of doing business. In inquiring how best to frame a uniform insurance law, which would be of great advantage to policy-holders, I found that the law of life insurance is in many of the States involved in the law of corporations, and it seems to me that when we come to deal with insurance, banking, and other  commercial law, it will be our first duty to frame a basic corporations Act, building upon it the Acts necessary to govern special branches of commercial dealings. </para>

                            <para>- I think that there should be a general companies law, and, built on it, particular Acts containing the modifications requisite for the various branches. At the present time, the law' relating to life insurance is, in some States, involved in the companies law. In each of the States a different provision exists for the winding' up of insurance companies, and there are six different provisions for the amalgamation of such companies. The framing of a general corporation law is a matter which will be expedited as much as possible, and! I have already a rough draft containing a large number of sections. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know how that estimate was compiled. It is necessary that this business should be placed on a proper b:isis. The English method of dealing with insurance has been to require full publicity, so that the people might judge of the stability and soundness of the companies doing business, whereas the American system has been to appoint State supervisors, and to fix standards ; but even in the United States there have been serious difficulties in connexion with  insurance. After looking into the matter carefully, I intend to recommend to my colleagues that complete inquiry should be made regarding, not merely methods of business, but insurance law generally. </para>

Some elasticity would, no doubt, be desirable, and it would be for Parliament to say, in framing such a policy, what portions of it should, and what portions of it should not, be capable of variation. I should not, however, care to frame such a policy without first obtaining the opinions of those interested as to what would be fair conditions to impose. </para>

                            <para>- I said it would require to be widened and altered. Strictly speaking it confines the inquiry only to matters of management. The inquiry ought to be into something more. It would be of advantage to hear the opinion of honorable members generally upon a subject which is so obviously above party. It is a matter affecting very seriously very many individuals in the community, because, to the credit of Australians generally it can be said that the duty of the individual to insure for the benefit of those dependent upon him is widely recognised in the Commonwealth. At present, I am rather inclined to favour the appointment of a Commission, but that is a matter upon which I shall have to consult my colleagues. The trouble about appointing a Select Committee is that I do not see how any adequate inquiry into this matter could be conducted within this session. </para>

                            <para>- Upon the question, I promise that I shall consult with my colleagues, and have a statement made at an early stage. Personally, I think that a small Commission, that will take complete evidence, and be properly equipped with powers to conduct a thorough investigation, is the proper thing, because the law relating to life, marine, and fire insurance has not, so far as the whole public of Australia are concerned, been adequately considered. In Queensland, the life insurance law is fairly good. I think the honorable member for Brisbane introduced it. </para>

I am quite prepared to recommend to my colleagues the principle of inquiry before legislation. </para>

                    <para class="block">The first two amendments would extend the inquiry in the way the Attorney-General seems to favour. I disagree with the wording of the second paragraph. I do not think we wish to see even the rich subject to extortion. We ought to put the motion in order, for we do not legislate for either the poor or the rich. We legislate in the interests of both, and the wording should be "To protect the public against extortion." If the motion is amended in the way I have indicated, it should cover all that is desired. The mover was wise in not making any charges against any of the companies. The question of insurance has agitated some of the State Legislatures for a good many years, and it is quite true, as the Attorney-General says, especially in South Australia, that it is difficult to get the necessary information. I am satisfied, however, that a Committee would get information, because, as a private member, I was able to get information that ought to have been given to Parliament at any time, and yet such was the power of the companies that it was impossible for it to be given. I, however, found that it was possible to learn sufficient to make what turned out to be an accurate guess as to what happened. The insurance companies in South Australia were so anxious to hide their business that their compliance with the law was practically an evasion. Although the whole of the returns as to premiums received, and losses paid, had to be sent in to the Fire Brigades Board, they used simply to be handed to the secretary, and the members of the Board did not see them at all, because they were locked up in a drawer. The idea, of course, was that one company should not know another company's business; but we have a right to know a good deal more of insurance companies than we do at present. It is no secret that there is a solid ring controlling fire insurance - one that has operated most injuriously for years, according to some of the leading business people of South Australia. There will be no difficulty in getting information in regard to that matter, and I am  satisfied that if a Committee were appointed, information would be obtained that, whether complete or not, would be useful to the House and to the Government in framing legislation. </para>

                            <para>.- The honorable member for Darwin is to be congratulated upon presenting the motion in its present wide form. If the House desires to make it still wider, I have no doubt the honorable member will willingly agree. I was pleased to hear the Attorney-General's speech as to the necessity for legislation to deal with insurance companies throughout Australia. In dealing previously with one form of insurance, I have made pretty definite charges against the, methods employed, and it was very satisfactory to me to hear the Minister this afternoon state that there is urgent need for legislation to remove some of the disabilities under which the insuring public at present suffer. I quite agree with the Minister that if there is to be an inquiry into insurance matters, it is not necessary at this stage to enter into exhaustive reasons why certain conditions that now exist should be altered. That may well be left till we have the conclusions of those who will have an opportunity of thoroughly examining the methods at present in force, and recommending alterations which will be satisfactory to the public. I want to see something definite done. In view of the great difficulty of getting a private Bill through the House, and as I now have the assurance of the Minister that the Cabinet will at once take the question into serious consideration, I am prepared to postpone the discussion of my Bill dealing with fire insurance. I am satisfied that if inquiry is made into the methods of dealing with the unfortunate victims of fire in various portions of the Commonwealth, the need for immediate reform will be amply demonstrated to the House. Consequently I am prepared to accept the Minister's word that he will have the question attended to immediately. Anything that the mover may consider to be the most satisfactory way of achieving the object which we are aiming at, I am prepared to fall in with. </para>

                            <para>.- It would be a mistake to exclude from the inquiry men who have special knowledge of this complex question. Hence, I propose to move to leave out the words " Select Committee," and substitute other words that will not curtail the Government in its choice of investigators. The question of life, fire, and marine insurance is highly technical, and it would be more satisfactory if, instead of restricting the inquiry to members of this House, we were able to draw upon the expert knowledge of outside authorities. I thoroughly agree with the honorable member for Darwin that an inquiry into the question of insurance institutions is highly desirable. And I am absolutely certain that one of the companies, on which onslaught has recently been made, will cordially welcome the most exhaustive inquiry that the House is prepared to authorize, and that a great many other Australian companies have nothing to fear from the most rigid scrutiny of their affairs.

We ought not to give an inquiry of this kind anything of the nature of a parliamentary complexion, seeing that amongst honorable members on both sides are many directors of assurance companies. It would remove any danger of a misunderstanding, if an inquiry of the kind were conducted by outside individuals. </para>

                            <para>.- The honorable member for Darwin has again placed the House under a debt to him for bringing before us a matter of vital importance to the general public. Indeed, marine, fire, life, and prudential insurance is a question on which the Commonwealth Government should have taken action a considerable time ago; my own opinion is that this was one of the first duties of the Federation. Apparently, however, it is necessary for a private member to move, in order to make the Government take any action out of routine. The object of the honorable member for Darwin is to have some method devised by which the poor may be guarded against extortion; and the honorable member, as one who for years was engaged as a canvasser, desires, doubtless, to give us the benefit of his knowledge. It would appear, according to the motion, that extortion is practised by insurance companies in the case of the poor of the community. Here I may observe that this House is as full of insurance directors as a hawthorn bush is of berries; and my only hope is that those gentlemen will give us the benefit of what knowledge they possess, so as to enable us to decide whether or not it is absolutely necessary a . Select Committee should be appointed. Fears are justly felt in regard to the weakness of many of these institutions ; and, if possible, I should like those fears to be allayed. The honorable member for Coolgardie is the only live director who has up to the present favoured us with his views on the motion ; and I think that we might have had a few words from others. I intend to oppose the amendment for the reason that a Select Committee could obtain evidence from accountants and actuaries, whose assistance the honorable member for </para>

The word poor " ought not to be eliminated, and the word " public " inserted ; because the rich do not need any protection from extortion, seeing that they can take very good care of their own investments. I am astonished that the honorable member for Coolgardie should be so anxious about insurance companies when he, as a member of the Labour Party, ought to be keenly solicitous as to the position of the general public who contribute to the. funds of these organizations. The honorable member ought to be prepared to trust his fellow members, who are returned as the representatives of the masses and of the general public, and not as the representatives of accountants and actuaries, who, after the Commission is over, will depend on insurance companies for their livelihood. </para>

                                <para>- But the Select Committee would be able to balance the evidence of one witness as against that of another. The fees of the honorable member, as a director of the Citizens Life Insurance Company, ought to be increased in view of the attitude he has taken to-day ; but his experience must have shown him that one, the Mutual Provident Association, for instance, might reject the evidence of a well-known actuary, whose testimony had been accepted by another association. Only in bad times can the stability of insurance companies be tested ; we have had no such cataclysms as those which occurred in the United States, and good times have really preserved the solvency of many of the institutions. In other words a succession of good seasons has put a screen across most of the insurance companies, and there has been no severe test of their solvency. I make no charge of insolvency, because to do so would be unfair ; but I have a strong suspicion that many of the companies are levying unfair charges on the public. </para>

This is a very inviting subject; but, as I said before, I do not desire to make any charges. I certainly hold the view that there is not room for all the present insurance companies in a small community like that of Australia ; and I am astounded that they should continue year after year to declare such enormous dividends. The honorable member for Darwin is to be complimented on bringing this subject before us. While I oppose the amendment of the honorable member for Coolgardie, I should have no objection to turning the Select Committee into a Royal Commission ; but men appointed by both Houses ought to be capable of presenting a report on which we could take action. No doubt, if a Select Committee be appointed, we shall have among its members men who are large shareholders or directors of insurance companies doing business in Australia. It would be most difficult for the Prime Minister, in appointing a Select Committee of members of this House, to avoid men who were not actively connected with such companies. That being so, the various institutions into whose business the Committee will inquire will have ample protection. </para>

I do not wish to insinuate that because a man is a member of Parliament he should not be a director of a company.

                                <para>- All that I contend is that the insurance companies have nothing to fear; that members of the Select Committee who were directors of such institutions would take care that their interests were not improperly interfered with. There ought to be an inquiry, and I propose to vote for the motion. A Select Committee consisting of honorable members should be able to make a thorough investigation, and to obtain from experts the information it desires. I am surprised that the Government have not long since introduced legislation on this subject. Shortly before Federation, when Australia was passing through a very serious crisis, it was discovered that faulty banking laws, or the absence of banking legislation, permitted unstable institutions to trade on the credulity of the public. Something was said at the time as to the position of insurance companies, but the results of the failure of the Government to introduce legislation dealing with the whole question have been minimized by the good seasons which we have since experienced. Bad seasons would have tested the statements made as to the stability of some of these institutions. The investments of insurance societies are interwoven with the general welfare of the community, and it is well known that the dividends declared in some cases are out of all proportion to those declared by similar companies in other parts of the world. So far as Australian life assurance companies are concerned the people are so much interested in them, and so familiar with their investments that they can fairly well determine their solidity or otherwise. I do not think that the honorable member for Darwin is adopting an attitude of spread-eaglism in asking for this inquiry. In the honorable member we have a representative of the people who has done well for himself on what may be described as the seamy side of life assurance business. He has vied with other canvassers in trying to put before the general public the advantages of life assurance, and if a select committee be appointed he will be able to place before it the result of his own practical experience. From the remarks that he has made to-day one may gather that his knowledge of the inner working of life assurance companies in Australia is sufficient to enable him to present to the House a good case for inquiry. Companies that are solid and substantial will heartily welcome the proposed investigation, and I am satisfied that any body of men that we may appoint will deal fairly with the whole question, and present a report that will place Parliament in a better position than it is at present to legislate on the general question of insurance. I have read at times most alarming statements with respect to certain institutions - statements in which their . stability has been called in question. I do not know whether they are stable or unstable, but the sooner we take action with a view of ascertaining their position the better. If these charges cannot be sustained it is only right that the public should be so informed, and I hope that the House will agree to appoint the select committee for which the honorable member for Darwin has moved. </para>

                            <para>.- The motion meets with my full approval, and I may say at once that I fully expected the favorable reply which the Attorney-General has made to the remarks of the honorable member for Darwin, knowing that it is only a few years since he  introduced a Bill dealing with the question of insurance. I was somewhat surprised at the proposal of the honorable member for Coolgardie, that we should deprive members of Parliament of the right to examine into the statements, whether true or false, that are, or may be, made against any of these companies. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member has moved an amendment providing for the omission of the words " Select Committee" with a view to inserting words providing for the appointment of a Royal Commission consisting of persons " with special knowledge." I would ask the honorable member what the policy-owners in these various companies would say if we proposed that a charge against a lawyer should be investigated by a Judge and jury consisting wholly of lawyers, or that a charge against a doctor should be dealt with by a jury consisting wholly of medical men. We all know that those occupying the most lowly positions are mulcted in larger percentages than are those in the higher walks of life, and I am satisfied that they will have more confidence in a Select Committee consisting wholly of members of Parliament than they would have in an expert board. If a Select Committee is appointed, it will be able to avail itself of expert skill ; it will be able to take upon oath the evidence of actuaries, accountants, and others familiar with the technicalities of insurance business. Like the honorable member for Darwin, I do not intend to make an attack upon any company. I shall not mention names, and I was sorry to hear the honorable member for Dalley, whose views I almost wholly indorse, refer specifically to one company. I propose, however, to put before the House what was my own experience. I had taken out a policy of insurance, and being somewhat pressed for money, inquired at the office of the company how long my policy would remain in force if the premium remained unpaid. I obtained from the company a statement in writing on the subject. In the course of a few years, I mislaid that document, and subsequently received from the company a peremptory note. I may say, in passing, that it was not a mutual company in the highest sense of the term - such as the Australian Mutual Provident, the National Mutual Life Association, and other mutual societies, but I was determined not to lose my policy. Having perhaps a little more fight in me than the average man, I instructed a lawyer to take the matter in hand. I could not discover the missing letter from the company, and in the circumstances my lawyer was surprised at my action, and advised me to pay up. My reply' was: "No; I intend to stand on my rights." Ultimately the letter on which I relied, but of which the company could find no record, turned up, and my legal adviser was then informed that, in the circumstances, mv policy would be continued, and I would be allowed to nay my premiums. I venture to say that had my experience been that of the average working man, or one who did not care to consult a solicitor, the policy would have been sacrificed. As it is, my lawyer's bill of costs has not yet been paid by the very wealthy company in question. Reference has been made- to the profits of these institutions, and I believe that many honorable members agree with me that it would be to the advantage of the people to establish a Government system of fire, life, and marine insurance. I have here copies of Bills dealing with the question of insurance which were passed by the Parliament of New Zealand as far back as 1874. One of these is out of print, but by the courtesy of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon,</inline> who was my friend, I am able to produce three copies of Acts. We know that many life assurance companies incur heavy expenditure, but when Government officers - men in the Railway Department of this State - are allowed to collect premiums for some of them, I think that honorable members will agree that the cost of collecting must be materially reduced. </para>

Some honorable mem-, b'ers may not like to hear hex name mentioned, but it is a favorite one with me. I have visited the country three times, and like it, the fine race of people which inhabits it. and the laws which govern them. If the Minister in framing his Bill would like to be supplied with the information which I possess on this subject, I shall be pleased to place it at his disposal. I am glad that he has dealt so courteously with the motion, and I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn, because, in my opinion, it is opposed to the teachings of the party to which! both the mover and myself belong, and to those of every liberal. Splendid as the hospital systems of the Continent mav be, they are not comparable with those of Great Britain and Australia, because, while they are managed by clever and able physicians and surgeons, ours are managed chiefly by the laity. On this point my facts are incontrovertible, as I could make plain to any one by going into details. With regard to Royal Commissions, I hold that the witty and caustic German philosopher spoke truly when he said that, had the Almighty placed the_ -making of the earth in the hands of a Commission, it would never have been made. My experience of Commissions in State politics was that they only created delay. Fortunately, the Commonwealth1 Commissions have shown more energy and push. </para>

                                <para>- The duties are not yet high enough. I should have liked to see more stalwart protectionists on that Commission. Time is ripe for something to be done in amending our insurance laws. The statements have circulated freely, not merely in small, but also in large newspapers, that threats of legal proceedings are treated with contempt and laughter, and that dead men's hands can trace signatures. These and similar statements are too serious to be left unnoticed. There must be something wrong about the operations of companies which send collectors to the kitchen doors and charge servant girls three or fours times as much as is paid by their mistress for like insurances. </para>

                                <para>- My honorable friend knows more about costs that I do. The Post Office is not administered in that way. A servant is not charged for a postal note , four times as much as her mistress is required to pay. Although the expense of collection may be great, those who insure ought to get at least as much from their policies as they would get if they deposited the amount of the premiums in a savings bank, where every depositor gets his money returned with interest. Would any one defend a system under which working men and women pay, say, <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> in premiums, to ultimately receive back 12s. or 15s.? The Attorney-General introduced, about two years ago, a Bill which I regret has not become law. In speaking on it the honorable member for Hunter mentioned some very grave facts which come under the notice of medical men in Great Britain more often than here. He showed that child insurance often causes child murder. </para>

                                <para>- The way to prevent these abuses is to follow the example of Switzerland, where no man, woman, or child is buried as a pauper, all being given decent burial. An insurance agent came to my house, and, catching my good lady napping, got her to insure my boy. The company wished to call in the policy, but, either from a spirit of mischief, or because I felt that I had not been fairly treated, I insisted on keeping it open, and am paying a premium of 6d. a week to see what I shall get out of it. The appointment of a Committee of this House would be justified, and would have the confidence of the people. If I called a meeting of my electors, and said to it, " Would you like your life insurance affairs investigated by a Committee of Accountants and Actuaries?" the people would say, " We considered you a fit person to represent us in Parliament, and we consider you fit to represent us on a Commission or Committee of Inquiry, where you will have power to take sworn evidence, and to make use of the brains of the best experts available." I hope that the motion will be agreed to, so that a Committee may be appointed, presided over by the honorable member for Darwin, who has a larger knowledge of life insurance than any other man in Australia. Its appointment would be of great advantage to the public, and would do great good for those who cannot afford to pav lawyers to look after their interests, and are now sometimes dealt with in a way in which we should not permit any company carrying on business under the Australian flag to deal with its clients. </para>

                            <para>. - There has been a good deal of argument in favour of a Committee pf Inquiry into the methods of insurance companies, and I am glad that the Attorney-General has expressed at least some opinion as to the attitude of the Government towards it. I have had to complain before, when private motions were brought forward, seriously affecting the business of the Government, that the Government have sat by and given no indication to the House of their attitude. On this occasion some indication has been given. The vagueness is as to whether the Government will favour a Select Committee or a Royal Commission. </para>

                                <para>- I know; and then the Government, who agreed to certain proposals at the Conference, brought in a Bill that differed from the recommendations of the Commission, and from the decision unanimously arrived at at the Imperial Conference. That is the result of that Commission so far. Mv point is that the result of these Commissions is not at all in proportion to the work or the expense. There was a Committee on Coinage, whose report was, I think, unanimous, and adopted by the House, but that is all the effect it had. Nothing has been done since. I fail at the present moment to remember one Commission whose decisions were so influential that they had any practical effect. </para>

                                <para>- It largely affected honorable members, and, consequently, one section of them would be likely to be influenced in the same direction as the whole body. I am not going to oppose the motion, for I do not object to an inquiry into assurance institutions if the inquiring body be properly constituted, but I am afraid that it is a simple method of delaying legislation for an indefinite period. The Minister has before the House at present one Bill dealing with insurance. He has also promised a Life Insurance Bill. Is he going to delay those measures until the Committee or Commission reports? </para>

                                <para>- Consequently, that necessary legislation, which should have been brought forward much earlier in the history of the Commonwealth, and which we are empowered by the Constitution to deal with, will be delayed. There is a necessity for uniform legislation in connexion with life and fire insurance. That is one of the duties imposed upon the Federal Parliament, but, instead of doing those things which were near at hand, we have been seeking to legislate on speculative lines, trusting to our work going through the High Court. But here we have important work at hand committed to us by the Constitution. We have neglected it, and now, when the Minister is about to enter upon it, we are asked to delay it still further for the report of a Committee or Commission, which, to judge by other Committees or Commissions, will probably have little influence on the House or on legislation. There are two aspects of this matter. The first is the necessity for imposing uniform laws for Australia. That must be founded upon the experience and the most advanced legislation of other countries. After that there is room for inquiry, if desired. :as to the proceedings and methods of management of the companies which work under our insurance laws in Australia. But, distinct from that altogether, there is the immediate need for a law of which the provisions should be gathered largely from the experience, not only in this country, but throughout the world, of different insurance systems and of the different dangers which have been shown to exist. All the dangers have not been shown here. We have not experienced many which have been shown throughout the world to  affect  life, fire, and other insurance. Such a law is wanted, irrespective of any inquiry, and no inquiry will form a sufficient basis for an Act of that nature. </para>

                                <para>- We have a sufficient basis for that legislation without any Committee of Inquiry. We have the laws and experiences of other countries. If this Commission or Committee is to rove the world for information, or to seek that which the Minister has now ready to his hand in the legal enactments of other countries in the Library and elsewhere - if the Commission is to embody all that sort of thing, it will be unending, and I am afraid no one will ever read its lengthy report. I quite admit that such a body may give us useful information as regards the management and methods of offices in Australia, but, apart from that, the Minister has already a sufficient mass of information to prepare legislation on the. lines I have indicated. If he is going to delay that by waiting for the report of this body, another' Parliament, another Ministry, and another set of members may have to deal with it. Why should the Minister delay legislation on lines based on the experience in Australia hitherto, and on that of other countries, and on the most up-to-date provisions now existing? </para>

That Bill is necessarily heavy; but its preparation will not be delayed. It will be submitted at the earliest possible date, irrespective of any Commission. </para>

                                <para>- Even so, that legislation ought not to be delayed for the report of a Committee or Commission. If the inquiry is to deal with all that has been .foreshadowed or indicated, its report will probably not come before this Parliament. Our object in any Parliament ought to be to get what we consider necessary legislation carried out in the life of that Parliament, giving priority, of course, to that which is most necessary. Some rather severe remarks have been made about insurance companies. I am neither a director nor a shareholder in any. My only relationship to them is as a policy-holder. So far, the insurance business of Australia has, generally speaking, been conducted on very creditable lines. I will not say that there may not prove to be exceptions to that, or that in connexion with industrial insurance, which is necessarily a most extensive form of it, some objectionable practices may not have arisen, although I do not know that they have. It is perfectly right that those matters should be looked into; but, speaking generally, the insurance business of Australia has been conducted most creditably, and we have some institutions which cannot be bettered, and are an example to the world. Therefore, I do not think 'we should, as some speakers have done, without sufficient support, or giving sufficient instances, cast reflections, on insurance management generally in Australia. What I fear is that, in appointing this Committee, as very often happens in any Parliament, the mover will endeavour to have as colleagues men of similar opinions on the subject; and there may be an indisposition to be influenced bv adverse evidence. It may be said that Parliament has the chance of reviewing the evidence ; but if that evidence be voluminous, how many members take the trouble to peruse it?' </para>

I do not object to any inquiry, by a proper tribunal ; but, before that inquiry is made, or coincident with it, legislation should be passed. If the inquiry should subsequently show the necessity for further amendment of the law, that amendment could be made. This is the third Parliament of the Federation ; and if there be any delay now, I can see no chance of legislation during its existence. </para>

                                <para>- Did the Minister ever know of a Commission of the kind, involving inquiries throughout the Commonwealth, present a report under eighteen months? In this connexion, the Commonwealth Government has a clear and plain duty laid upon it, which presents no greater difficulty than that involved in passing any uniform law. For instance, the Marine Insurance Bill introduced by the Government, is practically a transcript of the British Act; and there should have been no difficulty in submitting that legislation some time ago. The measure is none the worse for being a transcript, seeing that England is the centre of the Imperial insurance world, and the British Act may be accepted as the last word on the subject. And so with the Acts relating to fire and life insurance. </para>

Why should we wait until there has been an inquiry by a Select Committee or a Commission, which cannot be as good an authority on the law, apart from the practice, as that presented by the legislation and experience of other countries? If there is one matter on which there ought to be uniformity, it is that of insurance, and I hope that there will be no further delay. </para>

                        <para>- When we have the list we may be able to judge what use may be made of it ; and I have not heard, in any other Parliament, a refusal to grant a request of the kind. Were I asking for a copy of the documents, I could quite understand the Government replying that there were questions of policy involved. During the whole of last year the Government opposed a motion of this kind; and, apparently, they intend to oppose it again. What is there in the information asked for that should not be granted? Is there anything behind that Ministers wish to conceal? I do not think there is; but, on the other hand, it is most extraordinary that Ministers should refuse information of so harmless a character. </para>

                    <para>.- I can quite understand that the Government may feel it necessary to oppose the motion in its present form. The honorable member for Denison knows that there are despatches which pass between the Governments, which, being marked "Secret" and "Confidential," cannot be disclosed to either the Imperial Parliament or this Parliament without express authority. But if the motion were amended so as to give the Government proper discretion, it is not likely that it would be opposed. There can be no objection to producing a list of the despatches which are not of the secret and confidential class ; and such a list would be most interesting and useful. A vast number of communications pass between the Governments on a variety of questions of great importance; and, as I have indicated, a list of the sort desired would be very useful. </para>

                        <para>. - I said last night that it was my duty to introduce to honorable members what I might appropriately term the Cinderella of the sites. Unfortunately, that which I favour has not had among its advocates a Minister of the Crown, and it would seem that those that have not come under the immediate patronage of Ministerial office have been allowed to remain out in the cold. Sites which have received Ministerial support have loomed so largely in the public eye as to completely overshadow others that are equally deserving of attention; but I hope that the data which 1 propose to give, and which have been culled from official records supported by sworn evidence, will do something to affect the decision of the House. Although my only desire is that the? best site shall be chosen, the fact that that which I favour is in my electorate prevents me from posing as a purely disinterested advocate of its selection. I am prepared, however, to trust to the actual information to hand in regard to it to support my case. The main objection to Lyndhurst - the site which I favour - is that the water supply of the western division of New South Wales, wherein it lies, is inadequate. That contention I propose to dispel. Whilst I admit that a good water supply is a most important consideration, I deny that it is the only one. I would remind; those who run away with the idea that it is the sole point that we should have  in view in making a selection, that there are many other considerations - considerations in regard to which Lyndhurst outweighs all other sites - and that this preponderance overcomes any little deficiency that may appear to exist by comparison, and by comparison only, in respect of it. Lyndhurst has recommendations which apply equally to the adjacent towns of Bathurst, Orange, Millthorpe, and Carcoar - but as it is the site in the district concerning which inquiry has been made, I must pin my allegiance to it. It boasts of no less than five sources of water supply- In the first place it has the Coombing rivulet to draw upon. I am led to mention a rivulet in this connexion because Canberra, as we all know, depends upon such a stream for its water supply. I believe that it was in flood when a number of honorable members inspected the site some time ago, and that consequently it has risen in their estimation to the distinction of a river j but in its normal condition it is only a rivulet. The Coombing is only 9 miles from the site. Then we have Flyer's Creek, 15^ miles away, Cadiangullong,  j8  miles distant, Brown's Creek, 12 miles distant, and the Lachlan, 22 miles away. From the hitter an inexhaustible * supply may be obtained by means of a pumping scheme, but from the other four sources, water could be supplied by gravitation to the site selected by the Commission. The fact that that site is 2,280 feet above sea level, should be a guarantee of the purity of these streams at this point. In such high country, they must be tapped practically at their source, and a large expenditure would not be necessary to enable Lyndhurst to draw its water supply from them. From one of these sources alone could be obtained a supply sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Capital for the first few decades of its existence. If the Lachlan were drawn upon, the scheme would involve 1,400 feet of pumping. That, however, should not put it beyond the pale, because I understand that other sites which are favored by some honorable members, would depend upon similar schemes to place their water resources in an indisputable position. I would also remind honorable members that at the present time, a very large scheme to construct a dam at Wyangala  -  a very little distance from Lyndhurst - is under consideration. A surveyor is now at work there, and the project is likely to reach maturity. Its magnitude is such that it would bear comparison with the great Barren Jack scheme, the largest undertaking of the kind in Australia. The Barren Jack reservoir is capable of damming back as much water as is contained in Sydney harbor, and, although the Wyangala scheme would entail pumping, it would place the Federal Capital at Lyndhurst beyond the possibility of an inadequate water supply. The point at which the Wyangala supply would be tapped is 20 miles from the suggested site, but pumping would be entailed. The official reports show that the minimum supply that would be obtained from all four gravitation schemes, would be sufficient for a population of 89,000, and that; with the Lachlan pumping scheme there could be obtained a supply sufficient to meet the needs of a city with a population of 292,000. This estimate does not allow for the Wyangala darn, since that scheme was conceived after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> took evidence on the subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> the Engineer-in-Chief of Water Supply in New South Wales, in discussing the water possibilities of Lyndhurst, makes _ this comparison - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The daily consumption of water by Sydney, with its population of about half-a-million souls, is about 20,000,000 gallons. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> estimates the storage capacity for Lyndhurst at equal to 135,000,000  gallons per day, which, as shown by the quantity consumed in Sydney, would be equal to the requirements of a- city containing <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> population of several millions. As the requirements, with the Federal Capital at Lyndhurst, would only be 9,000,000 gallons per day, there would be close on 130,000,000 gallons per day available for irrigation and other purposes. In this connexion of water supply notice the contrast between Dalgety and Lyndhurst in regard to the rainfall. The" mean annual rainfall at the Lyndhurst site for the 21 years ending 1902 was 29.54 in., distributed over 87 mean annual rainy days, whilst the mean annual rainfall at the Dalgety site for the 15 years ending 1902 was only "26.37 <inline font-style="italic">in-i</inline> distributed over 80 mean annual rainy days. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>These facts should satisfy honorable members that Lyndhurst is capable of meeting all the exactions in the matter of a water supply that are likely to be placed upon it. Even if it involved the expenditure of a few thousand pounds more or less upon a water supply, that should not deter us. . from selecting Lyndhurst as the site of the Capital, having regard to the many other considerations in its favour. Commissioner Oliver - and I quote the separate authorities on the question of water supply, because they express somewhat divergent views, but of the two we must favour the expert evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> - says that, allowing for run off and evaporation, the four gravitation schemes would provide 12,500,000 gallons daily. Sydney with its population of half-a-million persons consumes 20,000,000 gallons daily, and therefore we can fairly allow that Lyndhurst could sustain a quarter of a million people with its water. supply from gravitation schemes only ; because this estimate, which is a moderate one, and lower than that which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade's</inline> would pan out at, allows for a supply of 12,500,000 gallons daily. Of course, one cannot question the Dalgety water supply ; it stands supreme, and therefore I do not propose to say more in that regard, than that the water is very cold; but that I presume is a detail. In their report of 1903, the Commissioners state that a scheme for 50,000 persons at Dalgety would cost .£328,000 approximately/ whilst at Lyndhurst it would cost ^427,460 approximately to supply the same number of persons with water. Now, considering all the wonderful facilities there are at Dalgety for a water supply, and that we could get an adequate supply for the same number of persons at Lyndhurst by an additional expenditure of a little more than £100,000, that is, in my opinion, a very good argument indeed in support of the latter site. Under such circumstances, and seeing that when such :i large issue is at stake we cannot be narrowed down to one consideration, the argument which, it is said, should place Lyndhurst beyond the pale goes to pieces. The deficiency at Lyndhurst in regard to water supply is more than set off by the many minor deficiencies at Dalgety, which in the total sum amount to a very great deficiency. The Lyndhurst site is well equipped in every other regard, while in most other considerations the Dalgety site is deficient. I. contend that the former is far superior to the latter, as I shall endeavour to prove from the data I have at hand. We are told that the Snowy River has electrical possibilities. Whilst I do not despise electrical possibilities, still I have reliable authority for stating that coal is more economical than water for the production of electrical power, even when the latter is present in abundance. </para>

                            <para>- I take that authoritative statement to mean that if we have water in abundance at one place, and coal in abundance at another place, it is cheaper to produce electricity at the latter than at the former. That is a fair way of reading the statement , and, coming as it does from a very reliable source, I consider that it is preferable to the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of the honorable member for Bass. In addition to that, the water power, which, of course, does exist at Dalgety, is regarded by the New South Wales authorities as a State asset. I make bold to say that, even if this House should select Dalgety, we shall again be faced with the difficulty of getting the selection indorsed by the New South Wales Government. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that the difficulty with the members of this House will be the first stumbling-block. At Lyndhurst we have a coal supply only 95 miles away. That distance, of course, is a detail compared with the fact that the nearest coalfield to Cooma is 170 miles away'. I contend that the coal supply is sufficiently adjacent to Lyndhurst to justify the contention that electrical power could be developed there by the coal which is accessible at a cheaper rate than, or at an equally cheap rate as, it could be generated by water at Dalgety. The cost of coal delivered at Lyndhurst is 15s. per ton. </para>

                            <para>- No, and hence the necessity for getting coal. At Dalgety there is no alternative, and we know that the rigour of its climate demands that we must have warmth. So that, apart from the generation of electricity for any manufacturing industries which may be developed, there is the fact that for ordinary everyday purposes coal will have to be taken to Dalgety. In a cold country that is a vital point, and one which I desire to emphasize. Honorable members will have to view this question from a very matter-of-fact stand-point when they are cooling their heels at the foot of the Snowy Mountains, possibly waiting for the delivery of coal, and having no means bv which they could facilitate its delivery. In addition to the authority I have quoted in regard to water supply, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blomfield,</inline> Resident Engineer of the Department of Public Works of New South Wales, reported in 1900 that, as regards the Carcoar- -Garland site - that is, the Lyndhurst site - there was no difficulty about supplying water foi a large population. I just add that, because in New South Wales his opinion is regarded as eminently reliable. I suppose that we must take the Canberra site very seriously. It appears to command a sort of semi-Ministerial support, and, therefore, it has been made to loom very large in the public eye, and the rivulets that we have heard so much about call for a little investigation. Tn his report, the honorable member for Swan said he believed that there need be no anxiety as to the sufficiency, although there was not a splendid supply of water at Canberra, referring, presumably, to the Cotter and the Gudgenby, two small streams. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Weedon</inline> , another authority, says that the Cotter scheme would involve 24 miles of pipe line, and the Gudgenby scheme 25 miles of pipe line, before any reticulation could take place, and further, that 225 square miles of catchment area would be wanted for those two streams. That is a very large consideration. There we have two little streams, and naturally they want n wider area in order to insure the purity of the supply. As the possibility of our acquiring control over 225 square miles of country is rather remote, the possibilities of the Canberra water supply are much inferior to those of any other site, so far as I can gather. If any site should be placed outside the pale on account of deficiency in that regard, it is Canberra, and certainly not Lyndhurst, where we have not only the water supply, but the rainfall, which permits the water supply being- supplemented in many ways. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> - the Premier of New South Wales, I believe - says that the Gudgenby scheme presents none of the advantages shown bv the Cotter scheme, and he suggests recourse to the Barren Jack, which is 36 miles off, as a source of electrical power. That is a far-away cry. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know anything about that. I am not quoting Barren Jack in support of Canberra, but merely to show how far away are the possibilities of a water supply for Canberra. Thirty-six miles off, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> says, there are possibilities of getting sufficient water power for electrical purposes. The Lyndhurst site has a scheme only 20 miles away, which is equal to Barren Jack, and that is the Wyangala scheme. It is not quite so far advanced as is the Barren Jack scheme, but is more than in the air, and therefore I feel quite justified in quoting it as a possible source of supply in the future. The soil of the Canberra district is inferior, whilst the rainfall is only 15 inches as against 30 inches at Lyndhurst, and 36 inches at Orange, with an average of 23 or 24 inches. I therefore contend that Canberra is not in it in regard to either water supply or rainfall. We cannot ignore the importance of the climatic conditions of the site selected, and on that account I could wish that the members of the Federal Parliament had been given an opportunity to visit the most southerly site at midwinter, or during the winter, because we can have no guarantee that the Parliament will not be sitting at some time during winter months. We cannot presume that the Federal Parliament will be sitting only in the summer months, when the district around Dalgety becomes a tourists' resort. </para>

                            <para>- I shall refer to them presently, and it is possible that those which I quote will not agree with those quoted by the Minister. I must leave honorable members to decide between them. The records of winter temperature at Dalgety are such as to make it very questionable whether, as a matter of life and death, we should take the risk of moving to such a place to transact the legislative business of the Commonwealth. It should not be forgotten that Australia for the most part is a semitropical country, and we have some honorable members in this Parliament who come from districts which may be regarded as being in the tropics. It is,, in my opinion, unreasonable to ask them to go to a place with a climate resembling that of the South Pole to legislate. It is not calculated to give the best results in Federal legislation, or to attract desirable men to Federal politics, that members returned to this Parliament should be penalized by being asked to go to a place like Dalgety. I contend that we shall take our lives in our hands in undertaking to settle in such a place. I know something of a cold climate, but, when it comes to living in a place where it is 10 or 20 degrees colder than the place in which I have been accustomed to live, I think it is time to object. Australians are a warm-blooded people, and it cannot be expected of them that they will do their best work in Arctic regions. ' According to official reports, Dalgety is situated 2,650 feet above the sea level, whilst the height of Lyndhurst above the sea level is 2,280 feet, which could not be objected to by men coming from any part of Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">With respect to rainfall, I find that the annual rainfall in Dalgety is 26.37 inches, over eighty mean annual rainy days&gt; I take this from an unofficial report. W"e have been told that the data supplied with regard to climatic conditions are unofficial, and we are justified in assuming that they are, therefore, largely- tinged with local bias. If a district has the reputation of being somewhat cold, the tendency of local bias in the compilation of records of temperature is to add a few degrees to the records. In the same way, where the rainfall is somewhat scanty, the local man. would think nothing of adding an inch or two to the annual record of rainfall, or of regarding a year in which there has been a heavy rainfall as an average year. I allow for this kind of thing, and honorable members will take unofficial records with a grain of salt. I have said that the mean annual rainfall at Dalgety is said to be 26.37 inches for a mean of eighty rainy days annually. This is the record over fifteen years'. The official record for Lyndhurst is a rainfall of 29.54 inches, with a mean of eighty-seven rainy days annually, over a period of twenty-one years. That will be admitted to be an excellent rainfall for Australia. </para>

                            <para>- It is possible to have teo much, even of a good thing. It is because Lyndhurst preserves so satisfactory a mean in all these respects that I have every confidence that honorable members will give it its proper place when selecting the Capital site. An annual rainfall of 29.54 inches may be regarded as ideal, and, when we consider the altitude of the site, and the fact that there is no swampy land there, it will be seen that we have no miasma to fear. At Canberra we are told that the mean annual rainfall is 23 inches. That, I suppose, may be said to be sufficient for all practical purposes, but it is a lower rainfall than that recorded at Lyndhurst, and, as the site is very much less elevated, the climate cannot be compared with that of Lyndhurst. The temperature at Dalgety is given as unofficial. It is stated that during the summer months it ranges from 70 to 80 degrees, and there is a tardy admission that on rare occasions it reaches 104 degrees. The winter readings are as low as 26 and 30 degrees, and one reading of n degrees is admitted. Nothing more is said on the subject. As unofficial records, these may be assumed to be affected by local bias, that tuc best face may be put upon the facts when submitted to the public. While on this subject, I may quote from the report of the Commonwealth Meteorological Bureau with respect to the climate at Dalgety.

                            <para>- No official figures are given for a term of years with regard either to climate or rainfall at Dalgety. The official figures given for Lyndhurst are from readings taken at Carcoar. I admit that Lyndhurst is somewhat similar to Dalgety, in being a township in which there are no officials equipped with the necessary scientific instruments, but the records taken at Carcoar, which is only 7 miles from Lyndhurst, may be regarded as authoritative. That place is only 7 miles distant, and is 83 feet higher than is the proposed site at Lyndhurst. There the highest reading within 16 years was 98.4, and the lowest r.5.4. The highest reading at Dalgety was 104 degrees, and the lowest 11 degrees. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. That is a fact which has not been stated by the Minister of Trade and Customs. It is admitted that at Dalgety the thermometer has recorded 104 degrees during summer, whereas the highest reading at Lyndhurst during sixteen years is only 98.4. Bearing .'n mind the extreme cold of the winter at Dalgety, and the intense heat of the summer, I ask, " In what sort of a climate is it now proposed to establish the Federal Capital? " I consider that it is my duty to protest against the parliamentary representatives of Australia being compelled to live in such a place. The mean temperature at Lyndhurst during the four hottest months of the sixteen years to which I have alluded was 78 degrees, whilst for the four coldest months it was'35.2 degrees. That is a very modest record. We cannot find any other place in Australia which boasts such an equable temperature, and, therefore, one which is so suited to the varied experiences of those who will have to reside there during the greater part of the year. In fixing the Federal Capital at Dalgety, where the temperature ranges from 11 degrees in winter to 104 degrees in summer, we should be practically inviting legislators to their doom. At Canberra the highest reading recorded is 109 degrees and the lowest 16 degrees. Its mean summer temperature is 69.7 degrees and its mean winter temperature 45 degrees. These readings are rather high, I think, although they are not such as to irrevocably damn the site. But they are not official readings. Indeed my complaint is that very little seems to be known about </para>

                            <para>- It may be beautifully undulating, but there is too little known about it to enable me to pronounce a definite opinion upon it. Very little significance can be attached to a casual visit to any site. For instance, one might strike the Cotter River when it was in flood and come away under the impression that he had seen a noble river, or he might visit Dalgety when the glass registered 90 degrees and consequently be induced to believe that it possessed a lovely climate. On the other hand, he might visit the latter place when a blizzard was blowing, and leave it under the impression that a blizzard was always blowing there. Any casual inspection to be of value must be supplemented by considerable data. From the standpoint of productiveness, Lyndhurst can safely challenge all other sites. Here I might pause to inquire whether productiveness is not one of the first essentials of a Federal territory? We have heard a lot of sceptical talk about the means of transit being sufficient to render unnecessary special attention being given to productiveness. But in selecting the Federal Capital we must prepare for all contingencies which we know have beset similar cities in the past. It is more than likely that OU] permanent Seat of Government may have to withstand a siege. In any case no harm can result from locating it close to our food supplies. That desideratum can be secured by the selection of Lyndhurst. I hold in my hand a comparative statement of the production for the year ended 31st March, 1904, within a radius of seven miles of four suggested sites, namely, Lyndhurst, Dalgety, Tumut, and Yass. From this table I learn that during the year in question Dalgety produced 5,943 bushels of wheat, 427 bushels of barley, 1,905 bushels of oats, 2,695 tons of hay, and 377 tons of potatoes. Lyndhurst during the same period produced 1,239,903  bushels of wheat, 71,275 bushels of maize, 2,786 bushels of barley, 190,683 bushels of oats, 26,410 tons of hay, and 12,318 tons of potatoes. Similarly, Tumut produced 195,393 bushels of wheat, 232,362 bushels of maize, 659 bushels of barley, 14,268 bushels of oafs, 5,528 tons of hay, and 503 tons of potatoes. As I am given to understand that Yass is not in the running, I shall not quote the statistics relating to it. Lyndhurst is a leading producing centre of these staple products. This claim is amply demonstrated by the fact that little railway stations, such as Millthorpe and Carcoar, show far larger returns than do other larger places. In other words, when one is at Lyndhurst, he is at the very source of our food supplies. The country there is closely settled, and its products always command the highest price in the Sydney market. Its volume of trade is simply enormous. No valid argument can be urged against a site which can boast of such possibilities. From the stand-point of fruit culture, its potentialities are simply limitless. The land is specially adapted to the cultivation of fruit. Around Bathurst and Orange, fruit culture is being actively carried on, and experimental farms have justified the farmers there in considerably extending their operations. The fruit commands the highest prices, not  only  in the Sydney, but in the London market. From the stand-point of food supplies, therefore, this locality stands pre-eminent. These areas are practically regarded as the granary of New South Wales, and certainly as the source of its fruit supplies, Sydney waiting every year for the early fruits from the high lands around Orange and Bathurst. As an example of what may be done there, I may mention that the average return for 1,000 acres within a radius of 30 miles of Lyndhurst, is estimated at <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> 2s. per acre. That circumstance indicates that the residents of this locality are in an affluent position. But it has still deeper significance. It proves that if the country is utilized for a Federal Capital, the Commonwealth will get a splendid bargain. Although the cost of resumption might be greater than it would be elsewhere, that fact should not weigh with honorable members if they are satisfied that the Federation would be obtaining a better bargain. It would be preferable to pay ^10,000,000 for the purchase of land upon which we could .obtain an adequate interest immediately than to spend ,£2,000,000 upon the resumption of land at a place like Dalgety, where we could not secure any interest whatever upon the outlay. At Dalgety, it is too cold to grow maize, and it is ad'mitted that dairying cannot be carried on there in the winter. The local witnesses would not admit that within a radius of 50 miles of Dalgety, sufficient food could"  be grown for the requirements of 50,000 people. I am prepared to say that within a radius of 10 miles of Lyndhurst, sufficient food can easily be produced for a population of that number. In view of the fact that we are about to select a Federal Capital for all time, and of the contingencies which must sooner or later beset it, I ask whether it is not wise for us to see that our food supplies are light at hand? For this reason, I contend that we ought to select a capital away from the coast. There is nothing to hinder the Commonwealth from owning a port, but that matter ought to be considered quite apart from the question of the establishment of the permanent Seat of Government. A highway from the Capital to a port for . us will also mean a highway from a port to the Capital for an enemy. That is an undesirable state of affairs. All principles of strategy and military precedent point to the necessity of entrenching the Capital in such a way as to make it as inaccessible as possible to an enemy. On those grounds there is every justification for selecting the Capital on the other side of the Blue Mountains. There are other sites which would do as well from that_ point of view, but Lyndhurst is one that has been reported upon as being admirably situated in regard to its strategical position, as well as in regard to food supplies. If due weight is given to these considerations there can be no valid argument against the selection of that site. In regard to building material, the official reports do not disclose very much difference between the sites in question. But, of course, we do not live upon stone, and the food supply question is much more important than that affecting building material. Still, it is as well to point out that there is ample building material available to meet all requirements in and about the suggested area. Not very far away we have the Molong and Borenore marble quarries, which have supplied marble for some of our best works, including the hall of the new Sydney railway station. This marble could be ' used for the Federal Capital buildings. Ordinary building stone is available in limitless quantities. In that respect there can be no gainsaying the possibilities of Lyndhurst. As to fuel, the same arguments as are used in regard to coal for electrical purposes will apply. A good supply of wood is available at Lyndhurst, but is not available at Dalgety - though that, I suppose, need not enter largely into the question, seeing that coal is now regarded as the main essential. As to timber for building purposes, Lyndhurst is very favorably situated. It is not far away from an abundant supply of cypress pine. It is generally known, I think, that that is the only class of timber that will withstand the ravages of white ants. No matter how hard may be the wood from other parts of Australia, white ants will attack it j but cypress pine is absolutely immune from them. There are also available black butt, tallow wood, peppermint, and turpentine, forests of which are found within 20 miles of Bathurst, a.nd that means that they are not very far from Lyndhurst. Any amount of hard wood of the nature of cypress pine can be obtained at Lyndhurst from 7s. 6d. per 100 feet. To obtain cypress pine at Dalgety would, I suppose, involve a much larger cost - probably up to £1 per 100 feet. In regard to accessibility - another of the main considerations, so far as Australia is concerned - I said just now that we want a site that could be made as inaccessible as possible when necessary. But that is only so when there is danger of invasion. It would be inadvisable, however, to have a site that could be cut off. So far as internal accessibility is concerned, we. want a site that will be easily reached from other parts of Australia. I contend that Lyndhurst in that respect is the best site that has been suggested. Assuming that access by railway is provided ere long, and that such lines as that from Dalgety to Bairnsdale and that from Wellington to Werris Creek are built, according to whichever site is selected, the following figures show pretty clearly the respective distances of Lyndhurst, Dalgety, and Canberra from the capitals of the States of Australia. Assuming the construction of the lines of railway I have mentioned, the distance from Lyndhurst to Sydney would be 191 miles ; from Dalgety to Sydney, 296 miles ; Canberra to Sydney, 204 miles. The distance from Lyndhurst to- Melbourne would be 443 miles ; Dalgety to Melbourne, 355 miles; Canberra to Melbourne, 431 miles. The distance from Lyndhurst to Brisbane would be 654 miles; Dalgety to Brisbane, 950 miles ; Canberra to Brisbane, 929 miles. The 'distance from Lyndhurst <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> Adelaide would be 749 miles ; Dalgety to Adelaide, 835 miles ; Canberra to Adelaide, 914 miles. The distance from Lyndhurst to Perth would be 2,317 miles; Dalgety to </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">Perth, 2,492 miles; Canberra to Perth, 2,449 miles. The distance from Lyndhurst to Hobart would be 902 miles ; Dalgety to Hobart, 1,064 miles; Canberra to Hobart, 912 miles. The average mileage to all the capitals would be, from Lyndhurst 876 miles, Dalgety 998 miles, and from Canberra 981 miles. Those figures show a considerable advantage in favour of Lyndhurst in respect of the mean average distance. The advantage amounts to about 100 miles in the case of each capital, and that I maintain is a large saving, which should be considered by the representatives of the respective States. I also have some figures before me which show that' Lyndhurst as compared with Dalgety is nearer to Sydney by 105 miles, to Brisbane by 296 miles, to Adelaide by 86 miles, to Perth by 17,2 miles, and to Hobart by 162 miles. Lyndhurst is further from Melbourne, but I consider that, in view of the advantageous position which Melbourne has been occupying for so long, no rational objection can be taken on that ground. The striking feature of these figures is 'the aggregate distances between Lyndhurst and Dalgety and the six State capitals, Dalgety being 734 miles further away than Lyndhurst. Leaving Hobart out of the calculation, because of the sea journey, the figures show that if Dalgety were finally selected as the Capital, 572 more miles of railway would have to be kept up to express traffic standard than if Lyndhurst were chosen. That is an important consideration. In addition to the immense cost of connecting the site with existing lines, estimated at upwards of ,£2,000,000 in the case of Dalgety, the expenditure in the case of Lyndhurst would be ,£70,000, that place being already on a railway line. The fact that an expenditure of ^£2,000,000 would be involved immediately in bringing Dalgety into touch with our existing railway systems, whereas only £70,000 would be required to bring Lyndhurst at least in reach of all' the capitals, has to be considered in conjunction with the facts that in Lyndhurst we have a site that is thoroughly equipped in every respect in regard to climate, arability and other requirements, whereas Dalgety has nothing to recommend it apart from its beauty and its altitude. I urge that it would be most unbusinesslike to choose a site involving an expenditure by the Commonwealth of £2,000,000 on railway connection, in return for which we should obtain a site possessed of nothing beyond altitude and picturesqueness. In the case of Lyndhurst we should obtain an adequate return for our money immediately. Further than that, the trend of population is undoubtedly  northward. That has been shown by several honorable members who have preceded me. Seeing that it is impossible to go as far north as Armidale - so far as I can gauge the opinion of the House - the next best thing that we can do is to obtain a site that is reasonably near the part of Australia to which population is trending, and which will be more and more the centre of gravity in regard to population. So much can be said of Lyndhurst, whilst it cannot be said of either Canberra or Dalgety. </para>

The only advantage would be to Victoria. The disadvantage would rest with the four other States - three of them the most progressive in the Federation. </para>

                    <para class="block">Seeing that the trend of population is northwards it would be ridiculous to place the Federal Capital in the south-eastern corner of the continent. The fact that Dalgety will in the future be remote from the centre of population should, apart from all other considerations debar it, and the objection that it would be a coastal Capital puts it entirely beyond the pale. The weakness of the contention that its nearness to Twofold Bay is an advantage has been made plain by previous speakers; but I would again lay stress on the fact that to make that port equal to the demands of shipping generally it would be necessary to construct a very expensive breakwater, and, as that portion of the coast is most exposed, the taxpayers would have to provide for frequent and costly repairs. There is no reason why the Commonwealth Government should not control a port ; but there is no need for the Capital to be close to it, and a better port than Twofold Bay can be found. As to the relative accessibility by railway of Dalgety and Lyndhurst, let me read again from a letter which appeared some time ago in the Sydney press - </para>

                        <para>Let the reader take a railway or an ordinary school map, and mark these lines of connexion, and he will be struck with the premier position they give to Lyndhurst as the Federal Capital site in comparison with any other. Connecting lines from Wellington to Werris Creek (New South Wales), and from Warwick to Brisbane (Queensland), give a nearly straight line between Lyndhurst and Brisbane. From Lyndhurst to Perth (Western Australia), includes the extension from Cobar to Broken Hill, <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> Wilcannia, then to Port Augusta and <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> the trans-Australian line, an almost direct route to Perth; but this distance could be shortened by upwards of 30 miles at least, by a line from Condobolin to Broken Hill, <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> Menindie. It must be remembered that the trans-Australian line is one that must be built for defence purposes, if for no other. That was a weighty argument at the time in favour of Federation. The distance from Lyndhurst to Adelaide appears to be fairly direct with the connecting line from Hay to Morgan, <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> Wentworth. The present estimated distance, however, will certainly be decreased, as, for instance, by the proposed line from Temora to Barellan, and carried thence to the Hay line, all through fine country ; and possibly a branch from the Temora line to a point on the Blayney-Harden railway. The ramifications of the railways on the line commanded by such a position as Lyndhurst are capable of immensely wide expansion, with the probability of access from- the "north-eastern .districts of Victoria, and the south-eastern parts of South Australia. </para>

                    <para>Lyndhurst is now. the centre of a very comprehensive railway system, and will inevitably have its communications with distant parts of the Commonwealth greatly increased in the near future. Lines intended to open up the far inferior will of necessity be connected with that now in touch with Lyndhurst. In short, every facility will be available for getting to what must be the Mecca of Australia, if the Capital is placed there. Dalgety, on the other hand, is out of the way, and will not have the advantage of the network of communication which will join Lyndhurst with the capitals of the States and other parts of the Commonwealth. The ordinary development of the country will cause a vast improvement in the already extensive railway communication of Lyndhurst, and the selection of that site for the Capital site will be more and more justified as the years, go on, whereas, if Dalgety is chosen, there will be but an accumulation of regrets. </para>
                    <para class="block">To connect Dalgety with other places by rail, it will be necessary to continue the present railway from Cooma, at a cost of £142,000, whereas Lyndhurst is already on a main line. According to official figures, railways to link up Dalgety with other parts of the Commonwealth, would cost £8,341,683, and similar railways in respect of Lyndhurst £8,433,597 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> but, whereas the improved railway communication of Lyndhurst will be of material benefit to the State, because the trade of Australia must pass its doors, the railways built to Dalgety will be useful for no other purpose than to enable persons to travel to and from the Capital. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. A good deal of the work of connecting Lyndhurst would, in the natural course of things, be done in any case, whereas the expenditure that would be entailed in linking up Dalgety to make it reasonably accessible would amount to nearly as much, and there would be no other object in spending that money than to bring there those who would have to go there. There would be no return from it as the years went on. It would be a burden to us - a capital expenditure the interest upon which would stare us in the face year after year. In the case of Lyndhurst, however, the expenditure must be incurred anyhow, will be amply justified, and will engender no vain regrets. If' there is one thing that we need to avoid in selecting a Capital it is the vain regret for which there is no redress. The cost of resumption for a city site and catchment, area for 50,000 people at Dalgety is estimated at £50,000. At Lyndhurst it is estimated at £180,000. That is just the difference between buying a good thing and buying a bad thing.' It does not matter how little the bacl thing costs, if it is not going to give any return, you are better without it, but if you can see returns immediately ahead, it will pay better to give even £10,000,000 for a good thing than £50,000 for something that will not only give no return, but on which you will have to spend money perpetually' to make it worth having at all. That is the difference between the sites so far as I can assess it. </para>

                    <para class="block">Another factor which has not been touched upon is the question of liability to earthquake shocks. The Rev. W. B. Clarke, who has made a special study of seismic disturbances, has compiled a record of from so to  300  shocks experienced in New South Wales. Most of them have been felt between Goulburn on the one hand and Albury on the other. Lyndhurst- is without any record against it. Bathurst has had two shocks, one in  1872  and another in  1886.  Goulburn has had ten since  187 1;  Yass, three since  1871;  Lake George, three since  1886;  Queanbeyan, seven since  1871  ; and Braidwood, five since  1871.  At Dalgety there have been five within comparatively recent years. An earthquake shock may not result in the death of anybody, but in view of the great expenditure that is bound to be entailed in ornamental buildings at the' Federal Capital, of which, of course, we expect to be very proud, and which will be the cynosure of all tourists' eyes, an earthquake shock there might do a million pounds' worth of damage in a single night. That is a thing to be guarded against, or at least taken into consideration in selecting a site. At places within the area determined on by the Commonwealth Parliament in selecting Dalgety there have been earthquake shocks as follow : - At Boloco, one on  27th  May,  1.894,  and another on  25th  February,  1897  ; at Bobundara, one on  25th  February,  1897 ;  two on  27  th March,  1901  - if there had been expensive buildings there then, irreparable damage would probably have been done to them - and another on  22nd  April,  190 1.  That makes a total of five shocks in the Dalgety area within comparatively recent years. ' We cannot say how many more there will be, but the fact that there have already been more 'there than anywhere else in New South Wales in the time, is a distinct mark against the selection of Dalgety as the Federal Capital. I leave the matter in the hands of the House with every confidence, that, if a. dispassionate view is taken of the data available, Lyndhurst or some similarly situated site will be found to best meet all requirements. I admit that it is not pre-eminent in the matter of water supply, but that is not everything. Its abundant sources of food supply and security are quite as valuable as is a. surplus water supply, which seems to lie the objective of those who seek to fix the Federal Capital at Dalgety. </para>

                        <para>.- I should have offered an apology, at this stage of the debate, for attempting to occupy the time of the House, if it were not for the very important nature of the proposal' we have to consider. We have been told that we are to look at this question from' a national point of view; and I fear very much that there are other than national interests creeping in which may result in our selecting a spot to the detriment of Australia for all time. I feel that I should be recreant to the trust placed in me if now, or at some time during the debate, I did not raise my voice in protest against the action of some honorable members in favoring a site which I believe cannot be to the best interests of the Commonwealth. The honorable gentleman who leads the Government is held up to us as one of our great Australians; and there are some measures on the statute-book, not only of the Commonwealth but of Victoria, in which he takes pride; but I fear that if the Bill we have now before us becomes law, and the site proposed is made the Capital, he will have done much that will militate against the good he has accomplished in the past. I am afraid that if that site be selected the name of the future capital city of Australia will be known as " Deakin's Folly." </para>

                            in reply, said there was no doubt whatever regarding the admirable facilities offered by Jervis Bay as a port. As for the suggestion that the Government should offer access to the sea for the purpose of inducing the Commonwealth to select Canberra, such a course would be unwise and impolitic. The Commonwealth was in this sense master of its own business, and if it had any request to make to the State it would be received in a reasonable spirit, with a keen desire to arrive at finality and compromise.

                    <para class="block">That is the attitude which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> has assumed all through ; and the expressions used by the honorable member for Hindmarsh are not at all warranted by the facts. The honorable member for Wimmera specially urged the New South Wales members not to be governed by parochial views, but his view is that the Capital site should be selected somewhere on the border-land of that State and Victoria. The honorable member endeavoured to show that the selection of such a site would be to the best interests of the Commonwealth ; but when . he was directly asked whether,' in the event of Dalgety being accepted, he would be willing to proceed at once with the erection of a bush capital, he could only say that after a reasonable period - whatever that may mean - he would be willing to commence building operations. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo, in a very able address, discussed the legal and constitutional view ; but I do not think that the legal view is disputed. Every one admits that if we take merely the letter of the Constitution, the arrangement with the Premiers cannot be relied upon. It is admitted that any document which led to the passing of the Constitution - any document other than the Constitution Act itself - would be blocked as evidence in a law Court. I think, however, that New South Wales is entitled to ask that something more than a mere legal view should be taken of the question. Continually Parliament is applied to in private interests, as an ultimate court of appeal against legal decisions which work injury and hardship. It is the right of any member of the community to petition the House if he thinks he has a grievance ; and such petitions are dealt with in a spirit of justice and equity, without regard to strict legal technicalities. If that be so in the case of individuals, why should it not hold good in the case of a State ? When a State is applying for justice to this Parliament, are we to take into consideration only such matters as might be regarded as evidence in a Court of law? Are we not to have regard to any facts that will enable us to arrive at an equitable decision? It is true that the Constitution says the Federal Parliament is to be situated in New South Wales, beyond the limit of 100 miles from Sydney; but it is equally true, as the memorandum of the Premiers shows, that that decision was arrived at with a view to placing the Capital within a reasonable distance of that city. The Premiers were the agents of their respective States, and that memorandum, which was published throughout the length and breadth of Australia, ought to be taken into consideration as showing their intentions. ' The honorable member for Gippsland the other day interjected that this memorandum was not known to the different States; but even if that were so, it would not alter the fact that the arrangement was known in New South Wales ; and the agreement ought to be adhered to. I contend,  however, that that memorandum was made known to all the States, though I was challenged by the honorable member for Gippsland when I previously made a statement to that effect. The memorandum was published in the newspapers of all the States of the Commonwealth; and, as showing the attitude of the States at the time, I quote the following from a leading article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 31st January, 1899 - </para>

                        <para>Replying to an interview to-day, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner said he was perfectly certain the representatives of Victoria would not attempt in any way to block the Federal Parliament from selecting a site for the Federal Capital in New South Wales, and having the necessary buildings erected thereon at an early period of the Federation. Furthermore, he has not the slightest doubt that the question of the site will be submitted to the Federal Parliament during its first session. . . . He was confident none of the Colonies would attempt to do anything unfair. A compact had been made that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales, and whatever his feeling might be concerning that concession to the Mother Colony he would not lend himself to any movement to back out of it or to nullify it in any way. </para>

Evidently, at that time, the honorable gentleman considered that the Capital was going to be somewhere near the 100-mile limit, and was arguing that by ordinary methods of measurement, Bathurst and Goulburn, which by radial measurement were excluded, ought to be included and be open to selection.

                        <para>A debate took place in the Legislative Assembly of this State on the 21st February, 1899. It was a debate on the address in reply to the Governor's speech, and it was spoken to by the Right  Hon.  G. H. Reid, who was at the time Colonial Treasurer, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edmund</inline> Barton, gentlemen who took a very leading part in the bringing about of federation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> had come fresh from making a compact with the representatives of Australia in Melbourne to the effect that the federal capital should be in New South Wales, and that it should not be less than 100 miles from Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton</inline> was accepted as the greatest authority in Australia upon the Federal Constitution and upon federation. I take it that there is no stronger proof to be found of what was intended by the Premiers when they met in Melbourne than the opinions of those two gentlemen ; and for the information of the House I will quote what they said at the time. </para>
                        <para>In regard to the 100-miles limit, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton,</inline> now <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, said :  - " If the Capital is a little more than 100 miles from Sydney it will still be within n three-hours rail journey, and I take it that it will be the endeavour, however federal and however patriotic-minded they may be, of a large number of the representatives of New South Wales, and most of them, so long as considerations of position and climate are faithfully observed, to see that that Capital is not placed too remotely from either Sydney or Melbourne." </para>
                        <para class="block">That was the expressed opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton</inline> on that occasion. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> in the same debate, expressed himself in the following manner :  - "In my opinion, if I may give it for anything it is worth, the Federal Capital, although in a country district, will be as near as possible to the 100-miles limit." </para>

                        <para>That expresses fairly well what I remember was the opinion of the general body of electors in the State of New South Wales at that time. And I might repeat that coming fresh as it did from those gentlemen, when the matter had been under consideration, it proves to me that the intention was, that if a suitable site could be found, complying with the other conditions necessary, on the margin of the100-miles limit from Sydney, that site was the one intended to be chosen. </para>

                            <para>- If I may remind honorable members again, the Premiers' Conference met with a request from the Legislative Council of New South Wales that the Federal Capital should be situated in Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner would not consent to that request ; but in order to meet the people or, if you like, the Legislative Council of New South Wales - in order to meet the opponents of the Bill - he did consent to the Capital being put at a point about100 miles from Sydney. The argument used last night by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, that because we could not get the Capital on the  100-mile  limit, therefore we could go anywhere, is, I think, not a proper one to employ. Surely in order to observe the spirit of that compact we should, other things being equal, get as near to the limit as possible. If we have two sites of which one is near the limit and the other altogether outside it, then, in order to give effect to the compact which was made between the States, the one nearer to the limit ought to be selected. </para>

                            <para>- When the right honorable gentleman is speaking later on my honorable friend can ask that question. At the first referendum in New South Wales there was a very strong opposition offered to the Constitution Bill. Although we got 100,000 votes for the Bill, there were 83,000 votes cast against it, so that nearly 45 per cent, of the people who exercised the suffrage voted against the Bill. It was only by reason of the amendments made in the Bill that it was carried at the second referendum. There is no doubt that if those amendments had not been made, if, for example, the New South Wales people had known at that time that the Federal Parliament would meet for eight years in Melbourne, and that Dalgety would be selected as the Federal Capital, they would not have gone into the Union; the Bill would not have been accepted. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite true. At the first referendum a majority of the votes were cast for the Bill, but the majority required by the local law was not obtained. In New South Wales there was a very strong minority against the Bill, the minority in the other States being comparatively insignificant. </para>

                            <para>- The people of Sydney have a right to be considered, and if this bargain was made to conciliate them, that is all the more reason why honorable members should adhere to it. The honorable member for Wimmera invited us to take a view which would be consistent with the interests of all the States. But his idea of being consistent with those interests was to put the Federal Capital close to the Victorian border, and on the coast line. He thought that the wishes of all the States would be met by adopting that suggestion. I think that if we were untrammelled by that agreement, a number of the arguments of the honorable member for New England would carry considerable weight. To any man who looks at the trend of the times, there can be no doubt that the drift of population is to the north-east of the Commonwealth, and that at the end of twenty-five or thirty years, the centre of the density of population will be' considerably, north of its present location. </para>

                            <para>- Even in Western Australia, there is a great drift of population northward. The northern portion, of New South Wales is being developed, and that will alter the centre of the density of population. If I thought that it was within the bounds of the compact, I should consider very carefully the arguments of the honorable member for New England in regard to the Armidale site. There is very  much to be said in- favour of .it, and except for the position I take up, that we can get a nearer site which will fall in with the compact, and answer all purposes, i should be very much tempted to support the honorable member in his advocacy of the Armidale site. Considering the great development which is taking place, even on the northern rivers of New South Wales, I venture to predict that at the end of twenty-five or thirty years, we shall probably have as many people settled on those rivers as are in the whole of the State at the present time. These considerations suggest that the Capital should be put in a northerly direction rather than towards the south. The increase of population, too, is in favour of the larger States. Between the  31st  December,  1900,  and the  31st  December,  1907,  the population of New South Wales has increased from  1,360,000  to  1,568,000,  being an increase of about  15J  per cent. In Western Australia also, there has been a very marked increase. I shall content myself with giving the percentage of increase in each State. During the period I mentioned, it has been 44^ per cent, in Western Australia,  15J  per cent, in New South Wales,  9I  per cent, in Queensland,  8 1-5  per cent, in South Australia, <inline font-style="italic">6\</inline> per cent, in Tasmania, and only <inline font-style="italic">4^</inline> per cent, in Victoria, where the population has increased by only  51,000  persons. The tendency of population is to increase in the larger States and not in the smaller ones. But Armidale, I repeat, does not fit in with the compact which was made, and, to my mind, the only site which approaches most nearly to the compact is Lyndhurst, of which the honorable member for Macquarie spoke at such length this afternoon. I do not want to repeat the arguments which he used. I think that he put his case fairly and straightforwardly, and I hope that the House will give every consideration to the figures and ' the facts which he used in support of that site. Lyndhurst meets these requirements more nearly than any' other site proposed, because it is the' centre of the density of population at the present time. As the honorable member for Macquarie showed, when railways already projected are constructed it will give the shortest distance from all the States capitals. The honorable member proved that statement by quoting the mileage from the various States capitals to Lyndhurst, and if, as the honorable member for Wimmera has said, we should consider the other States, it should be borne in mind that from the point of view of distance from the States capitals,, as well as from the point of view of the centre of population in the Commonwealth, Lyndhurst meets the requirements better than any other site. The only argument urged against the selection of Lyndhurst so far is that it has not as good a water supply as Dalgety. But it has been shown that the water supply available at Lyndhurst is quite sufficient for any capital we can build there, and for the population we are likely to have there. By. a gravitation scheme sufficient water may be obtained in the immediate vicinity of Lyndhurst to supply a population of  50,000,  which is a larger population than we are likely to have at a Federal Capital for perhaps the next fifty years. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member had permitted me to conclude my remarks I should have said that a water supply might be obtained at Lyndhurst that would meet any requirements of the future. The right honorable member for Swan has made a fetish of a water supply. Really ' all that can be said for Dalgety is that it has a water supply, and a good one. We may drink water, but we cannot eat it or sleep in it, or live in it, and Dalgety has nothing else to recommend it but the fact that good water can be got there, and mighty cold water at that. I suppose that there is no bleaker or colder place in the Commonwealth than Dalgety. I certainly know of none. There are two localities which in New South Wales we regard as preeminently suitable for the establishment of sanatoria. One is the western mountain slopes and the tableland around Orange and Bathurst, and the other the northern table-land around Armidale and the New England district. But Dalgety is a very bleak place. I doubt sometimes whether honorable members, especially from Queensland, realize what it would mean to be compelled to live at Dalgety all the year round. </para>

                            <para>- I know the district well. It has been said that Parliament will not be sitting there all the year round, and 'we could dodge the winter. But even if that be true, and from our parliamentary experience so far I very much doubt it, are we going to condemn those who must reside at Dalgety if Parliament meets there, to live there all the year round, when we acknowledge that the place is not lit for us to live in ? Only last winter, when the Minister of Trade and Customs wanted a holiday, he did not go to Dalgety, but to Cairns, in Queensland, in order that he might get a little warm. </para>

                            <para>- I might reply to the honorable member, by saying that we have reports showing that there is very little settlement on the site at the present time, and that practically all the land is Crown land. The right honorable member for Swan, with his experiences, and some of them very bitter experiences, in the West, has no doubt got water on the brain. He seems to think and dream of nothing else but water. So long as a site possesses a good water supply, the right honorable gentleman is quite satisfied. As a result of his bitter experiences in the Western deserts, I have no doubt that when he sees a decent stream of water anywhere it appeals to his heart. But I remind honorable members that the right honorable member for Swan has shown us what can be done by engineering skill, even when, by force of circumstances, a city is established, as Coolgardie was, in the middle of a desert. How many hundred miles was it that he was able to take water to that city, and make the scheme a financial success? We should need nothing of that kind at Lyndhurst, because within so or 30 miles, around the Canoblas, we could get all the water we should require for ordinary purposes, whilst, for the generation of power, we should have the Murrumbidgee not very far away. But there are other factors besides that of a good water supply which must be taken into account in estimating the suitability of a site for the Federal Capital. I repeat that Dalgety has nothing to recommend it but a good water supply, and it is, and always will be, absolutely unsuitable as a site for the Federal Capital, except in that one respect. The Minister of Trade and Customs has exhibited a picture of a very pretty fall somewhere on the Snowy River, near Kosciusko. We all admit that Kosciusko is a very nice place as a tourists' resort, and I admit that a visit to the district might be very enjoyable. But it is 40 miles from Dalgety, and, if ease of access is taken into account, it will be found that it is almost as close to Canberra. </para>

                            <para>- I doubt very much whether it would be possible for the Government to make arrangements to heat Parliament House at Dalgety sufficiently to keep the honorable member's teeth from chattering in the winter. I give way to no one in my admiration for mountain sites. I love mountain scenery as much as any member of this House can possibly do. I am as able to live on the mountains as any other member. I have been living on the mountains for a considerable time, and, in spite of a certain rotundity of waist, I might undertake to measure even with the honorable member for Maranoa. We must remember that the Monaro tableland is a very different place from the western mountain district of Katoomba and other mountain sites in New South Wales that are tourists' resorts. There is a difference of only some 300 feet in altitude between Lyndhurst and Dalgety, but the fact that Dalgety is on the eastern side of the Dividing Range makes the difference most appreciable. The mean temperature of Dalgety in the winter is something to make one shudder. The honorable member for Hindmarsh has asked what is a difference of3 degrees in temperature? </para>

                            <para>- I should like to inform honorable members that there is a difference of only 3 degrees between the mean winter temperature of the city of London and that of Dalgety. The mean winter temperature of London is 39.3 degrees, whilst the mean winter temperature of Dalgety is 42.2. Comparing Dalgety with the capitals of the States in this respect, the mean winter temperature of Melbourne is 49.2, or 7 degrees higher than that of Dalgety; Adelaide, 52 degrees, or 10 degrees higher; Hobart, the most southerly capital of all, which is open to the Southern Ocean, has a mean winter temperature of 47 degrees, or 5 degrees higher than Dalgety. Those honorable members who have visited Hobart in the winter, and have learnt how the wind can blow from Mount Wellington when it is covered with snow, can imagine what it would be to have the wind blowing from Kosciusko down upon Dalgety in the middle of winter. </para>

                            <para>- From Knibbs' latest statistics. If the honorable member wishes to verify them he can do so by reference to two volumes, which can be obtained in the Parliamentary Library. Sydney has a mean winter temperature of 53 degrees, or 11 degrees higher than that of Dalgety. Brisbane boasts a mean winter temperature of 60 degrees, which is 18 degrees higher than that of Dalgety, and Perth has a mean winter temperature of 55 degrees, or 13 degrees higher than the winter temperature of the site in which we are asked to shiver. Dalgety, besides being unsuitable on account of its climate, is also unsuitable by reason of its inaccessibility. I would remind honorable members that the New Zealand Parliament was removed from Auckland to Wellington because, although the former city is the capital of the island, it was not sufficiently accessible to members of the New Zealand Parliament. In view of that circumstance, I ask honorable members to imagine what will happen if we establish the permanent Seat of Government at Dalgety after wasting , £500,000 in constructing a railway that will never pay? Some reference has been made to the possibility of connecting a railway from Bairnsdale with Dalgety. </para>

                            <para>- No. But the honorable member will have an opportunity of refuting my statements. Personally I am in favour of the selection of Lyndhurst but I am prepared to accept Canberra as a compromise if I cannot obtain a better site. It is true that the temperature of Canberra is higher than that of Dalgety by only 3 degrees but we have to remember that while the Dalgety site is according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> situated in an exposed position, the Canberra site is sheltered, and under such circumstances the climate is not half so trying. That is a matter of common knowledge to every person who has lived in the mountains. It has been urged that Dalgety possesses a port in Twofold Bay. But if Twofold Bay is the port of Dalgety, I claim that Jervis Bay is the port of Canberra. </para>

                            <para>- In going from Dalgety to Twofold Bay there is a sheer drop of almost 2,500 feet, whereas the drop from Tarrago, on the Cooma line, to Jervis Bay is very much less. Upon the first occasion that I made that trip I was about twelve years of age, and as I have made it many times since, I know the district very well. From my own personal knowledge I say that Jervis Bay can be approached very much more easily from Canberra than Twofold Bay can be approached from "Dalgety. I would further point out that if a line were -constructed from Tar.rago to Jervis Bay it would traverse a much bigger strip of dairying country than would a line from Dalgety to Twofold Bay. The reason that Twofold Bay has not progressed more than it has done is that the mountains approach the shore too closely and that there is very little good grazing land in the neighbourhood. </para>

                            <para>- The ' experience of New South Wales in building breakwaters in the northern portion of that State do not encourage the belief that any breakwater at Twofold Bay could be erected that would effect much improvement. Another reason why I prefer Canberra to Dalgety is that the land around the former is very much superior to that around the latter. Of course there is very good grazing country at Dalgety. As a matter of fact, any rotting : gram [ic country is good grazing country. The honorable member for Hindmarsh described the Canberra site as an admirable cricket pitch.- I would remind him that it is -impossible to get a cricket pitch at Dalgety. Something has been said about the difference "of opinion amongst the New South Wales representatives. We have been told that if they would only agree amongst themselves something might be done to meet their wishes. But with the exception of two of the New South Wales representatives in the Ministry, every honorable member from that State is opposed to the selection of Dalgety. Consequently, although we may not be unanimously in favour of any particular site, we are unanimous upon the question of the unsuitability of Dalgety as the site for the future Seat of Government. 1 thank' honorable members for the patience with which they have listened to a rather long speech, but I felt that it was due to myself and my constituents that I should place upon record my opinion in reference to this measure. Should Dalgety be chosen in spite of all that I have said, 1 shall, at any rate, have the satisfaction of having discharged my duty, and future generations in Australia will hold the representative for Nepean guiltless of having committed the egregious "bl under of voting for the selection of the most" unsuitable of all the sites that have "been proposed. </para>

                        <para>.- "The honorable member for Nepean dis- » covered one argument to support his case which may be used with greater force against him. He urged that we should not select Dalgety as the Federal Site because the trend of population is northward. But that is a reason for not selecting any site , . at all just now. If the centre of population is likely to shift, and it is desirable for the Federal Capital to be near the centre, then we ought to delay the selection, since we do not yet know where the centre is to be. It would certainly be rash to assume that settlement in the honorable member's State is to be confined to present limits. It may happen that one, if not both, of the leading' States will lose their predominant position, and that a capital situated near the southern coast will be too remote from the population centre. Personally, I have recently come to the view that the selection might advantageously be postponed for at least a generation, and until development more clearly reveals the necessities and potentialities of Australia. But the question having been forced to the front by the clamour of influential coteries in Sydney, in common with other honorable members, I am obliged to make a choice. I do not propose to speak at any great length, because this question has been absolutely threshed threadbare. Not one fact, reason, or argument can be adduced that has not been already advanced <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam,</inline> both in this House and in the press. As, however, I .have made only brief reference to it during previous discussions, I may be pardoned for saying a few words now in justification of the vote which I propose to give. It seems regrettable that this issue is not being decided squarely on the floor of the House, but that its settlement is being affected by such influences as were the subject of complaint during the Tariff debates. </para>

                            <para>- The less said about the matter the better. I merely desire to express my regret that such influences have been operative. The one paramount consideration in the settlement of this question is not the welfare of any particular State or capital city, but the welfare of the future Australian nation. No other influence ought to be admitted for a moment to the minds of honorable members. And if this ideal be .kept before us the complexity of the question disappears. It is  solely  because extraneous purposes and  parochial interests have been interposed, that the House is split up into irreconcilable sections, and unfit to make a choice which can be defended before posterity. Now, the Constitution leaves this Parliament absolutely free in regard to the selection of the site, with two conditions ; namely, that it shall be within the State of New South Wales, and not less than 100 miles from Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- If a 'signed agreement exists I have never seen it. Let those who rely on such a document produce it. At any rate, it is not embodied in the Constitution. I hold that we should be little short of traitors to Australia, if we allowed any other consideration than the future welfare of the nation to determine our votes upon this question. Subject to the fulfilment of these conditions - and I arn for their literal fulfilment - our right to do what we think best for all Australia, cannot be circumscribed. I take my stand on the Constitution, and say that my vote will be given in strict obedience to its mandate. There is no other consideration in the bond. </para>

                            <para>- Probably the honorable member for Wentworth knows more about the characteristics of Shylock than I do. I stand by the bond contained in the Constitution for another reason, namely, that I object to the dictation - the offensive dictation - to this Parliament which has been attempted bv certain politicians in Sydney. Such conduct was altogether unjustifiable, and for that additional reason I am the more inclined to stand strictly bv the terms of the Constitution than otherwise I might be. </para>

Let me remind him that there is no time limit in the Constitution as to when the Federal Capital is to be established. There was a time limit in regard to the Tariff ; but in respect to the Federal Capital, the framers of the Constitution evidently intended that this Parliament should be its own master, and, do what it thought fit at the proper time. </para>

                            <para>- That sliding scale was of no advantage to Western Australia. It is a totally irrelevant matter ; but, to make a passing reference to it, I may observe that the duties under the sliding scale were paid by the people of Western Australia, and not by the people of any otherState. That remark disposes of the honorable member's interjection at once. I was rather astonished at a speech made in this House on the last occasion when the subject was before us. by the honorable member for South Sydney. It surprised me that he should put forward the view that the feelings of a small minority in Sydney, as he admitted they were - an insignificant minority, as I believe they really are - should be considered before the judgment and the views of the rest of Australia. I believe that the agitators who have created all the noise on this subject are an insignificant majority even in .Sydney itself. The people outside Sydney do not wish to exercise any unfair influence upon this Parliament. I do not believe that the people of New South Wales generally desire the Sydney influence to dominate our choice of a site for the national Capital. </para>

                            <para>- Now, why should this House yield to factional clamour? It emanates in a quarter from which, ever since Federation was established, has come consistent and relentless hostility to the ideals of Australian democracy. How honorable members , who perused the correspondence with the Sydney Government can vote to re-open this question passes my comprehension. Just consider one, though not the most audacious, of their many impudent pretensions. I had wished to avoid reference to it, but the attitude of honorable members opposite shows" that they sympathize with and indorse the actions of the Sydney Government. This Parliament wisely decided that the Federal Capital should have access to the sea. I think, in view of our experience of the provincialism of Sydney politicians that that was a very wise decision. It would be sheer madness to permit our Capital to be hemmed in so that there would be no outlet except through territory controlled by a provincial authority. But now let honorable members listen to the reason why the Sydney Government proposes to refuse to allow us to have access to the sea. Here is a statement which was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hector</inline> Carruthers when he was Premier of New South Wales, not in a speech, but as part of a despatch which he transmitted to the Federal Government. He said - </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. It means this, that, although the contributions of all Australia  would  be spent to create the Capital City and develop the Federal territory, the Customs taxation paid by the people would pass into the New South Wales Treasury, to be spent possibly upon the aggrandizement of Sydney. Surely that is no side issue. We are to be refused access to the sea because of the desire of Sydney to obtain for all time the Customs revenue payable by residents within the Federal territory. </para>

The position of the Sydney Government appeared to be this : " The territory we are asked to hand over is now part of the State of New South Wales, which benefits by the Customs revenue contributed by it. You must continue to allow us to enjoy that revenue after the territory becomes Federal property, and though the revenue is paid by people who, but for Federation, would never have been residents of the Federal territory.", They virtually claimed that for all time the Customs revenue collected in the Federal territory should pass into the New South Wales Treasury, to be spent in that State. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. The argument was put forward as a justification of the refusal of the State Government to give the Commonwealth access to its territory by sea. After our experience of this Sydney Government, we should be the veriest fools if we placed the Federal Capital in territory which had no outlet to the sea. </para>

                        <para>.- I should have been glad had the spirit of the remarks of the honorable member for Coolgardie been more in accord with the pious wish with which he concluded. I utterly resent the attempts made on these occasions to belittle the people of New South Wales. To each State in turn have certain Federal matters been of peculiar interest. For instance, there was no written agreement about a transcontinental railway. In  1899,  the then Premier of Western Australia asked us to give him a written agreement for the construction of such a line, but we declined to do so. </para>

                            <para>- Although there was no written agreement, and we refused to embody  a pledge in our report, I, for my part, felt that we had encouraged the right honorable gentleman to believe that we should be favorably disposed towards the construction of a transcontinental railway should Western Australia join the Union, and every member of the Conference, when a member of this House, loyally and staunchly supported the project. Never did the right honorable member appear to greater advantage; never did I feel a stronger appreciation of his manly character,  and the sturdy way in which he has always stood by the legitimate interests of the great State which he represents, than upon that occasion when he indulged in flights of oratory which are not usual with him, but which proceeded from a laudable and sincere feeling. The heroic explorer, who had faced the burning blizzards of the central deserts of Australia without turning a hair, was utterly broken up; manly tears rolled from his noble cheeks, as he implored us to honour that somewhat shadowy obligation. The right honorable gentleman and the other Premiers in these six States deliberately signed a written understanding that, although the Capital should be not less than 100 miles from Sydney, it should nevertheless be "at a reasonable distance " from it. If such an undertaking had occurred with reference to Perth, what would my right honorable friend have said if there was a project to put the Capital up at Geraldton? Supposing there had been a similar compact with reference to Melbourne, what would have been said to a proposal to put the capital at Mildura or Echuca? We should have heard torrents, volumes, of righteous indignation at the breach of this distinct understanding - an understanding which enabled Australia to federate. Now, when this great achievement has" been won, the way in which that bargain is, being observed does not reflect great credit upon those who were immediately concerned in making it. The peculiar interest of Victoria in this Federation was to get a high protective Tariff. Did we not notice the determined zeal and united enthusiasm with which the Victorian members struggled night after night and month after month to put up that protective fence to the highest possible pitch ? </para>

                            <para>- I ask my Queensland friends to understand that I am saying to them all that I said about the Victorians. There are some honorable members who have a genius for repetition. 1 should like honorable members to recollect that Australians may be pardoned for taking an interest in matters affecting their own State as well as the Federation. The fact that we come from New South Wales does not, I hope, make us any the less Australians. The fact that the people of New South Wales represent much more than one-third of the population of Australia does not, 1 hope, make them less worthy of consideration and respect. I wish to admit at once - because I do not want to pitch this claim of New South Wales too high - that there is no word in the agreement that binds this Parliament to choose an unsuitable site anywhere. Unless we have a site within a reasonable distance of Sydney, suitable for the Capital, New South Wales has no right to ask this Parliament to choose an unsuitable site simply because it is within a reasonable distance of Sydney. It is only fair to honorable members who differ from us on this subject to say that if they are of opinion that we have no suitable site within a reasonable distance from Sydney, they are perfectly justified in voting for some other site. I put the Canberra site forward as an eminently suitable one, but I shall not repeat all the arguments which have been advanced in respect of the different sites. I shall only refer briefly to the three or four leading points by which such a matter should be tested. Convenience of access to the people of Australia is an important matter in an Australian sense, quite apart from any interests of New South Wales. Surely, comparing Canberra with Dalgety, there is no doubt as to which is the more convenient point for Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I think the honorable member would find a bitterness and bleakness about the climate of Dalgety in winter from which Canberra is absolutely free. From the point of view of beauty, the wildest advocate of Dalgety cannot say  that it is the preferable site. There are beautiful spots 50, 60 or 80 .miles- away, but the place itself is one of the bleakest in all Australia. </para>

                            <para>-  1  am sure the Treasurer would do the Minister of Customs a good turn if he could, but Dalgety is too much of a demand upon his brotherly feeling. It is a sacrifice which Damon cannot make to Pythias. Do the Government really mean to go on with this Capita.!, because there are a number of questions lying under the surface? Are we to take the action of the Government, in bringing forward this Bill in a short session, when there are a number of important matters to be considered, as a declaration on their part that they are honestly desirous of settling this question? Settling it does not mean passing a Bill, it means building a Capital. The mere passage of a Bill is simply an affront to the legitimate demands of the people of Australia.. May I suggest, as a matter far above a question affecting the people of New South Wales, that it does not befit the dignity of the Australian people to be without a Capital ? lt does not befit, their dignity. to remain the guests of a generous community, such as that of Victoria has been. We must thank the people of this State for the generous way in which they have acted towards the Commonwealth ; but we desire to have a home of our own - a Capital in which the power of the Commonwealth may be exercised free from any strong local influences. The question whether the Capital should be in the country or in a large city, was fought out and settled at the Federal Convention ; and hence the provision as to the area of the territory in which the Capital was to be. On the question of expense, I wish to say at once that, if we desire to study economy, we shall not have the Capital in a big city, but in the country. Do honorable members think that, if we took' some part of Melbourne or Sydney for the purposes of a Capital site, we should not have to pay for it? Do we expect any large city to present the Commonwealth with buildings which have cost hundreds of thousands of pounds? And, even if that were so,1 should we be mean enough to take the territory and buildings? </para>

Four year's ago we determined that the Capital should be within 17 miles of Dalgety; and now we are asked to I! determine more definitely " the site, and our way of doing that is to provide that i,t shall be anywhere within an area of 900 square miles. This is one of the incidents of comic opera legislation with which we have become familiar. Indeed, it is one of the silliest things in the world, as is shown in the fact that those of us who are altogether opposed to Dalgety are absolutely compelled to vote for the second reading of- a Bill to " determine more definitely ;! the Seat of the Federal Capital at Dalgety. Is this not rather too clumsy a way of settling this question? What is the simple issue before us? </para>

                            <para>- I admit that Dalgety is open to many grave objections - many "grave" objections. As for Tooma, I have not yet had an opportunity of inspecting the site; but I do say that, in my opinion, the selection of Tooma would represent even a graver infraction of the spirit of the arrangement entered into than would the selection of Dalgety. It is rather remarkable that the Treasurer should have occupied a seat in the Government for four years since the Seat of Government Bill was passed, although he has been moving heaven and earth to undo what Parliament directed the Government to do. I think that the Minister of Trade and Customs had better address his colleague on these inconsistencies. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs will not be led by his praiseworthy devotion to this part of his electorate to seriously imperil his returning health. Perhaps I may now be allowed to point to one or two extraordinary provisions in the Bill. The Constitution provides, of course, that the Federal Parliament shall determine the Capital, which must be " within territory which shall have been granted or acquired." The logical process is to determine the locality in which we are going to have the Federal Capital, and then take the territory, but not to tie ourselves to one particular part of the territory. In other words, we should first fix on the territory and leave ourselves open to afterwards select the site of the Capital. But the other process was adopted of fixing the Capital at the centre of an area of  900  square miles, the provision being that it should be " within17 miles of Dalgety." I think that clause  3  of the Bill is one of the most original provisions I have ever seen in any Bill. It reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is a definite proposition ; and if we turn to schedule A we find the territory defined in a most correct and accurate manner as to its outward boundaries.

                            <para>- It seems to me to be scarcely clear, and to point to a serious difficulty. The expression used is " not less than 100 square miles, " and it has to be construed according to legal principles. We could not take 1,000,000 square miles, because the Act refers to " not less than 100 square miles." That must mean some area within a reasonable proportion of the area mentioned. In many cases a question has arisen as to the meaning of an agreement to deliver so many sheep, more or less. </para>

Those who think we have a legal right to claim an area of 900 square miles merely because we have in the Constitution the words, " not less than100 square miles," make a grievous mistake as they will find. There should be some sort of friendly disposition to deal with the Government of New South Wales in this matter. If the one party stands upon its strict rights in a harsh spirit, the other can do the same. There is not a word in the Constitution about New South Wales granting a means of access to the sea. That is a request for a concession which New South Wales is not bound to give. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; it is a most extraordinary way of treating the Mother State.First of all, she is to grant an area of not less than 100 square miles, and' that provision in the Constitution is tortured into one to require 900 square miles. Then there is to be a means of access along a line 125 miles in length and within an area fifteen miles broad on either side. In other words, there is to be, from the site to the sea, a road 125 miles across New South Wales, by a breadth of thirty miles. I, do not say that the whole area of thirty miles wide is to be taken; but the right to a means of access within that marked area is desired. That is a pretty considerable liberty to take with the territory of a friendly State, and to embody in an Act of the Federal Parliament. When honorable members approach the Mother State with a desire to arrive at some friendly settlement of these difficulties, a generous disposition on the part of the Federal Parliament should be shown.. Would it not be a generous action on the part of New South Wales to grant us an area of 900 square miles under a Constitution which speaks of an area of " not less than100 square miles" being granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth ? Would it not be generous if New South Wales gave us a right of access for125 miles across its territory from the Capital to a port? The concession asked for is a serious one. What I should like very much to see is a generous disposition on both sides: that there should be no harsh, unfriendly spirit displayed by the Government of New South Wales nor by the Commonwealth. This Parliament has rights which it must safeguard. I quite admit that it is not called upon to choose an unsuitable site for the future capital of Australia. No man in New South Wales makes such a demand. All I say is that Canberra seems to be a suitable site, and that its selection would be agreeable to the people of New South Wales, who would regard it as a more loyal performance of the spirit of the agreement under which New South Wales Joined the Federation. I believe that if New South Wales is approached in this friendly spirit the Federal Parliament will meet with a reasonable response to all its legitimate requests. What does the term "means of access" mean. It cannot mean taking territorial rights; it can mean only acquiring a right of access, or in other words, a right to use a thoroughfare in common with other persons in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member has put in a nutshell the meaning of the term. "Means of access" does not mean that the Commonwealth is to take the land, and block some people in New South Wales from using it. If the Commonwealth will make a beautiful public thoroughfare from the Capital to the sea at its own expense, I do not know that New South Wales will grumble much at so judicious an expenditure. But the idea beneath this proposal, that the Federal Parliament in selecting a site in New South Wales should take the precaution that one would take in. the country of an enemy is, to my mind, repulsive. This stipulation represents a belief that the people of New South Wales would use their power to block the legitimate intercourse of the Commonwealth with not only the seaport named, but any other seaport in that State. The idea at the. root of the provision is contemptible. What would this blocking of the Commonwealth mean ? It would be impracticable. There is not a road in New South Wales that is not as open to a Frenchman, a German, or a Chinaman if he is there, as it is to every inhabitant of the State. What power has ever been known, especially in Australia, which would allow the people of New South Wales to go along a track, and say to some Commonwealth officer, "You cannot use this road"? </para>

In the Constitution, as he knows, there is a provision that the Commonwealth shall not tax the property of any State. This wire netting was imported by the State, and was its property, and it was a question of legal determination whether the term " property," in the Constitution, included the right to import it free of Customs duty. May I suggest to the honorable member that whether that was right or wrong depended upon the decision of a Court of law ? </para>

Let me now get back to the real question. Here is a public road in New South Wales, which connects the Federal territory with the sea. Can_ any one conceive of any Government say-" king to a Commonwealth officer. " You shall not walk along this road," whilst the people of New South Wales may. Such :&gt;, situation is impossible*. The theory of a public highway will not allow of such things being done. Every human- being within a State,  white, yellow, red, or black - Commonwealth or State - has the right to use the public highways. </para>

                            <para>- That is another matter. Honorable members must recollect that the building of a railway involves the resumption and severance of private lands, and the erection of fences, but a public highway injures no one. I wish to see all these questions settled in a thoroughly amicable spirit. If the Federal . Parliament thinks that it is worth while to have a means of access, I raise no objection, though I. do. not see the slightest necessity for it. But if it is to take the form of a public road constructed bv the Commonwealth, I think that the State might well welcome it. </para>

                    <para>It is therefore absurd in this Bill to use the words " means of access " as meaning something contrary to that. We cannot amend the Constitution by using such vague words in an Act of Parliament. If, however, that is meant, this is a very dangerous way of trying to get it ; it is not a straightforward way. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing to .prevent the Commonwealth, if it wants a harbor, from' selecting a Federal territory with a harbor. But may I' suggest to honorable  members who are talking so strictly about the terms of the Constitution that if they read it in that rigid way, this demand of 1 means of access is absolutely unconstitutional and wrong, lt is craving a concession. Speeches such as the honorable member for Coolgardie made are an insulting way of approaching .any one from whom honorable members wish to get a- concession. There is an air of lordly superiority about it, an unfriendly suspicion that the body to be "done " is the Commonwealth, not the State. But - the terms of this Bill mean that it is the State which is to be " done " by means of a Commonwealth demand. If honorable members will have access to a port, and still select the Federal territory 125 miles from the sea, I ask them as- men of common sense to try to meet the State to some extent in the way in which they exercise their choice. If they want favours they had better act liberally. If they want to get a harbor, let them take a Federal territory with a harbor. They can do that, but they cannot select a Federal territory 125 miles away from a harbor, and then demand that territory and a. road to the harbor, and the harbor too. That is altogether beyond the bond. It is a most extravagant request to make if it means anything at all, which, I admit, is doubtful. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to criticise that expression in the former Bill, because it had a good motive behind it. I believe that I was mainly responsible for securing its insertion. I pointed out that we could not legislate beyond the terms of the Constitution, and suggested the insertion of the word " should " to make the measure us little offensive as possible, substituting a request for a demand. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member will see that, august as this Parliament is, it cannot carve a line of  125  miles out of a State without (he authority of the Constitution. I got the provision in the former Bill toned down. I said to the Government, " Do not make in an Act any claims which you are not entitled to make. Make them the subject of friendly negotiation in connexion with that which you have a right to do." I suggested that they should be made the subject of negotiation, as it was a request which the Commonwealth wished to make, not having the right to enforce it. To sum this matter up, I wish again to point out the absurd position we are in. According to parliamentary law, no amendment can be made in this Bill which would reverse the nature of the Bill. If, for instance, a majority of honorable members desire to omit the reference to Dalgety, any attempt to put some other locality into the Bill in its place must be ruled out of order on parliamentary law, because this is a Bill -  to determine more definitely the Seat of Government in the neighbourhood of Dalgety,  and no amendment can be accepted which would be contrary to its scope, or would nullify its effect. That is laid down by <inline font-style="italic">May.</inline> The point arose in the House of Commons a good many years ago - I think in  1880.  Honorable members must remember that we cannot deal with the schedule of  a  Bill before we get to it, and any amendment which would have the effect of interfering with the schedule, if moved in </para>

                            <para>- A motion would not affect that in any way. Might I suggest that a motion to obtain the opinion of the members of this House in  1908  would be quite permissible, in spite of the existence of. the Act passed in  1904.  Any motion inviting the opinion of the House on any subject can be submitted, in spite of any Act of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but even if it were an enacting measure, there would be nothing to prevent the House from expressing by resolution any opinion it pleased. That would be a simple and direct course to follow in, this case. If the  motion were negatived, there would be an end of the matter, as it would mean that the House did not propose to go behind what was done four years ago. But if the motion was passed it would mean that it was the intention of the House to reconsider the matter. I am very sorry that the Bill has been brought in in this way, as it has the effect of submitting the question in a most awkward fashion. What I do particularly desire is that if the Government are in earnest in this matter, they will proceed without any further delay, and that it will not in the year 1912 be our duty to determine that the Capital Site shall be, say, within 18 miles of Dalgety. </para>

                            <para>- I think I have asked a fair question. Is this game of bluff to go on to all eternity? The Treasurer is telling his friends in his  large  electorate, in which he has three or four Capital sites, " Austin has got the whip hand of me so far, but I shall be too much for him. I am lying dark on the weather bow. We have arranged that he shall get Dalgety twice, at intervals of four years. I am going to get my choice twice 'at intervals of four years, and then I am going to have Tooma, for a finish in the year 1950." This sort of conduct must come to an end. If a majority in this House decides now, on reconsideration, that this desolate out of the way spot, with a glorious river - we all admit that - and one or two dejected inhabitants, is to be the site of the Federal Capital, will the Government go on earnestly in order to give effect to that decision? I am not one of those who say that this Federal Capital should involve an expenditure of millions. I should be the first man to say that we should have no Federal Capital if it involved an expenditure of millions. That would be a monstrous proposal. </para>

Surely, if in the majestic days of the United States fifty or a hundred years ago, ' when they had an infinitely larger population than we have today, they were content with humble and simple surroundings, an Australian Parliament is capable of beginning the establishment of the Capital in this country spot with becoming economy and becoming modesty? I believe that in the end there will be infinitely less money spent on this country Capital than there would be if the Capital were fixed in either Melbourne or Sydney. All I can say is that I am in favour of Canberra in preference to Dalgety ; but if it becomes a question between Dalgety or Bombala, or Tumut, or Tooma, I shall vote as I did on a previous occasion. </para>

                        CHAPMAN (Eden-Monaro - Minister of Trade and Customs1 [10.14]. - The right 'honorable gentleman's speech might impress those who know nothing of his previous political utterances en this question. It might impress those who have taken no interest in the Federal Capital proposals, but I doubt whether it will have much effect upon those who know what his attitude has been regarding the Capital, and how he has wobbled from one side to another on this question, as he has frequently done on all questions. It will not be likely to impress those who know that when he was Prime Minister of the Commonwealth he said that this question was settled, and, backed up by his Minister of Home Affairs, told the people of this country and the Parliament of New South Wales, that the decision arrived at was final and mandatory.

                            <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta will not put me off the track. The right honorable member for East Sydney has asked whether the Government are really in earnest in this matter. He asks, "Do the Government intend to give effect to the decision of the House?" "Are they honest?" Well may he ask these questions, when he knows full well the reason why we were unable to give effect to the decision of Parliament during the past two sessions? Has he not publicly stated that he blocked action in that direction ? And why did he block it? Because he thought that he would be able to secure a site which would be more acceptable to him. Yet he has endeavoured to fool honorable members this evening by conveying the impression that the Government are responsible for the delay which has occurred. I ask whether it is better to make bald statements or to base one's remarks upon hard facts? Upon previous occasions the Victorian representatives have been taunted with having blocked a settlement of this question. But when it came to voting, some of those representatives supported Lyndhurst, others voted for Tumut, and still others favoured Dalgety. There was no concerted action on their part. As a matter of fact, they have always exhibited a desire to arrive at a settlement of this question as early as possible. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is probably a good judge of "smoodging." Why is it that we are confronted with such a solid phalanx, composed of members of the same old brigade who are in favour of half-a-dozen different sites, but who all pull together in opposition to Dalgety? Only last week it was stated in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> that if this Parliament dared to select Dalgety, it would merely mean indefinitely postponing a settlement of this question. That is the policy of these gentlemen - " win, tie, or wrangle." I now propose to read an extract from the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Speaking in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, during the time that the right honorable member for East Sydney was Prime Minister of the country, the Premier of that State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> said - </para>

If they are, the Federal Capital will be established in New South Wales at .no distant date. But just as it is possible for the Federal Parliament in its treatment of the subject to so act that there will be no Capital in New South Wales within a reasonable time, it is possible for the Government and Parliament of New South Wales to so act that there will be no Federal Capital in New South Wales within a reasonable time, unless we have an inherent right to select the Capital by our own will. That is a° question of serious importance, which I hope will never have to be considered.

If its settlement is left to the next Parliament, judging by the disaster which overtook the Ne&gt;v South Wales "supporters of the right honorable member for East Sydney at the last general election, I should be justified in hoping that a still more favorable reply will be forthcoming when the electors are again appealed to. What did New South Wales do at the last general election? What site was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sydney</inline> Smith in favour of? What site was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conroy</inline> in favour of? What site was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> in favour of ? What site was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Lonsdale</inline> in favour of ? Four of the bitterest opponents of Monaro received from New South Wales constituencies, notwithstanding their strong personal influence, a decisive expression of opinion as to their services. They were " wiped out " at the last election. </para>

Let me say, also, that I will take good care in future that he shall not be able, by any inference of any kind, to say that he ever had me near his net. No attempt has been made by any member of this House while I have been listening to the debate to point to any one site that is better than Dalgety. The only argument against it has been abuse. Nothing is too bad for it. The wildest statements are made. They amuse me. </para>

Now let us see what was stated by the honorable member for North Sydney with regard to Dalgety. He stands deservedly very high in the esteem of this House.  His  word is known to be his bond. That being so, and knowing that he is to-day so averse to the site, let me quote from an official document, written while he was Minister of Home Affairs, and ask whether it is not a fair and honest description of the site in question. We know that he was not very friendly to it, but this is what was stated in an official communication to the Premier of New South Wales - </para>

                            <para>- What is this honest understanding? Prior to Federation it was thought that New South Wales was trying to induce the other States to join, but after it had been agreed by the representatives of Australia that the draft Constitution should be accepted by a majority, consisting of at least 50,000 voters, an act of treachery to the other States took place while the right honorable gentleman was lending the New South Wales Parliament, the maximum being increased to 80,000. </para>

                            <para>- We were able to secure a substantial majority in New South Wales for the Constitution, and every one knows that had it not been for the Yes-no attitude of the right honorable member - which he has adopted on this and on all sorts of questions - it would have been much greater. The raising of the minimum in New South Wales was a breach of faith with the other States. After the lapse of many years, the right honorable gentleman began to harp on an understanding, of which none of us had heard before. The right honorable member for Swan, whose reputation is equal to that of the right honorable member for East Sydney - which is one to be proud of, although he has played so many parts that, when he referred to the comic opera attitude of the Government, I thought that he must be speaking of himself - has no recollection of any understanding. </para>

New South Wales and Victoria only - he states that, rather than go to a fertile valley like Tooma, where there is a good climate and a magnificent water supply, he would go to what he called a bleak desolate spot, and this because Tooma is a little nearer to Melbourne.

                            <para>- It was of such little consequence that the right honorable member himself forgot it for years, and raked it up as a last dying hope. Who is to decide this question? ' The State Parliament of 'New South Wales? Their attitude does not represent the views of the people. The people spoke at the last election, and will speak again if they get an opportunity in a way the right honorable member would not like. Is the New South Wales Parliament or the Australian Parliament to decide? What does it matter whether the Capital is near Melbourne or near Sydney? After all, even at Dalgety it would be nearer to Sydney than to Melbourne. Is that the attitude to take? It is like the attitude taken last night by the honorable member for Brisbane, who chided the Attorney-General for being an Australian, and for not taking a Queensland view. What does it matter whether the Capital is 200 miles nearer or further away from Brisbane? I venture to say that the people of Brisbane would not support a view of that kind. It would be on all-fours with the attitude of those Queenslanders who supported the sugar industry in this country by a strong protective duty, and yet refused to give an atom of protection wherever they could to the artisans who buy the sugar. If all the Queensland representatives took up that position I am afraid there would grow up in this House a desire to pay them back in their own coin, which would bring disaster to that great industry, which I hope will never occur. The honorable member for Brisbane wants to go for Queensland interests, as he terms it, just as the right: honorable member for East Sydney wants to go for Sydney interests. As long as it suits Sydney it will do, in the opinion of the right honorable member, and as long as it is nearer to Brisbane the honorable member for Brisbane is satisfied he asked the  Chairman  of Committees catch questions, forgetting that he should? not spread his net in the sight of the bird. He attributed inconsistency to the Attorney-General, who gave a good vote for Lyndhurst, and fought for what he considered to be the best site when he thought it was possible to get it, but who declines to use it as a stalking horse so that Sydney may be benefited. I do not propose to go into the relative merits of the sites. I have given expression to my views before. I notice that the Treasurer has now entered the chamber. I know, his opinions, his vast experience, his practical knowledge of Australia, and the hatred' he has for Dalgety, and I may fairly be allowed to base, my claim on what he has said regarding the Dalgety district.

                            <para>- A while ago honorable members opposite said  that  the port could not be entered.1 The honorable member for Lang has painted a picture to show that it is very shallow. If I produced a statement from the steam-ship company's office, stating that two or three weeks ago their ship of 5,000 tons, which draws nearly 20 feet of water, was alongside the wharf in that port, the honorable member for Lang would probably contend that the ship must be a dream. I prefer to rest my case on facts. Now it is urged that- Dalgety is 125 miles away from the port. It is a good thing that it is some distance away. We want to be able to defend our Capital. But it would be a good thing to have an outlet to the sea and a good thing also to have an outlet to another State. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes went on to say - </para>

                    <para class="block">I will now show what the Treasurer thought of the site. He cannot be accused of being biased in its favour, but I will say for him that he does not disguise his opinions. He has always been against it. He never declared, as the right honorable member did, that he would stand by it to his last dying gasp, and that it would be unfair to attempt to alter the decision in any way. The Treasurer tells us a nice little story about it now, but he has never been at Dalgety in his life. He went once to Bombala, but, unfortunately, fell ill and had to hire a special coach to get away. He brought the honorable member for Perth with him, but, notwithstanding all the dismal stories that the Treasurer told .him on the way, that honorable member has always stood, and proposes now, I believe, to stand, solidly by Dalgety.

                        <para>I think if there is a district in which a railway should be constructed it is from the tableland to the port of Eden. There is no finer port in the Colony, and there is no finer country at the back of it. It is certainly to be regretted that the construction of the line has been left so long in abeyance. There is no possible doubt that the port must become a great shipping port, and it will become a great centre of population. </para>

Time does not permit of my comparing the relative value of the sites, but I desire to make one more statement before I conclude. The honorable member for North Sydney, who was the late Minister of Home Affairs, proposed during last session to get round the Constitution, and he made the most elaborate inquiries as to whether the Seat of Government could not be placed at Moss Vale. </para>

                            <para>- If so, then there is so much less likelihood of the water supply being polluted. Questions have been asked in the New South Wales Parliament, and statements made elsewhere, as to the photographs of Snowy River which have been exhibited to honorable members. The charge has been made that the photographs represent a portion of the stream 40 miles above the proposed site, but, even if that were so, we could only conclude that the river must be a most wonderful stream by the time it reaches the exact locality of the Capital. I cannot conceive that the photographs have been in any way " faked " when the four or five houses which comprise the township are all shown. However, in consequence of the statements made, I applied to the Premier of New South Wales for further pictures, and I am informed by the honorable member for - Maranoa that photographs of this locality are distributed throughout Queensland and the other States as an inducement to tourists. It is strange that if this is the bleak and deserted country represented, the Government of New South Wales should, during the past three or four years, have spent £40,000 or ,£45,000 in making it attractive to tourists. </para>

                            <para>- That is one of the paltry arguments which has been raised against Dalgety. I had an appointment with the leader of the Labour Party at Maryborough, and, in order to keep it, I travelled there as a sick man ; and yet that fact is used, as I say, as an argument against the Dalgety site. The great daily newspapers of Sydney desired to know why I ran away from my own district, and I present them with the argument for all it is worth. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members opposite will some day be in a warm place from which they will not be able to escape. On one occasion the honorable member for East Sydney was asked what would happen when the fateful day for him arrived, and he replied, with characteristic humour, " I suppose the fat will be in the fire." To return to the question of photographs, I want to give the facts to the House, and to leave honorable members to draw from them their own conclusions. I have given expression to-night not to what are merely my own opinions, but to indisputable facts. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miller-,</inline> the representative of Monaro in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, to obtain from the State </para>

                        <para>The following extract appears in the issue of that paper of the 10th instant, and as it has not been qualified I take it to be true, namely :  - "... the advocates of Dalgety, led by the Minister of Customs, have made their plans for a campaign which should produce some interesting results. Photographs of Dalgety are to be placed alongside the pictures of Canberra, and the sympathy of new members is being appealed to through the plea that to disturb the choice of the last Parliament would simply delay the settlement of the question without permanently achieving any step in that direction." </para>
                        <para>Under the circumstances, I did not consider further the question of photographs of Dalgety, as there was the obvious danger of clashing with the 'Minister of Customs, who is also member for the particular district concerned. </para>

Last night he was asked a catch question as to whether he would grant the Commonwealth access to Jervis Bay in the event of the Canberra site being selected, and he fenced with it. He insulted honorable members of this House  by  imagining that they would  be  such noodles as to believe that statement. Honorable members are being cajoled and pressed to turn turtle on the votes they have previously given on this question - to desert what is a truly Australian site, and to vote for another merely to please certain people. </para>

                            <para>- At all events, I wish, as far as I am personally concerned, to absolutely deny the statement that I am interested in the selection of Dalgety. As a matter of fact, all my interests are centred round Canberra. The selection of that site would put money into my own pocket, and thousands of pounds into the pockets of my relatives. That being so, honorable members may imagine how deeply I feel the insinuation that I am directly interested in the Dalgety site. And what is my position from a political stand-point? As a matter of fact, there are more voters in my electorate in favour of Canberra than there are in favour of Dalgety. But I intend to fight for what I believe to be the best site. I know both Dalgety and Canberra well. I have not a word to say against the latter, but, in my opinion, there is no comparison between the two. Canberra is close to my home, and its selection, as I have said, would increase the value of our property ; but those who know anything about the two sites, must agree with me that to compare Dalgety with Canberra is like comparing this House with a 6 x 8 tent. There can be but one selfish reason advanced in favour of the selection of Canberra, and that is that it is closer to Sydney than is Dalgety ; that if it were chosen Sydney would be, for all time, the centre of its trade ; and that Sydney merchants would be benefited, since the Capital would have no other port. If the Capital be established there, it can never have a big population, and we cannot hope for that class of Federal legislation that we require. That is my answer to those who say that Canberra should be selected. I have nothing to say against the district itself. It comprises splendid country ; but, in my opinion, is unsuitable for the site of the Federal Capital. We should try to view the question from a purely Australian stand-point; we certainly ought not to attempt to deal with it from the pettyfogging view advanced to-night by an honorable member. We ought not to consider it merely from the point of view of Sydney or Brisbane. What divine right have those big centres of population to all trade? Centralization has been the curse of this country, and we are seeking a change. Yet, when the opportunity offers to open up an area that is a State in itself, to open up immense tracts of country where there is no railway communication; where there is no cultivation simply because there is no market; where there are hundreds of thousands of acres ready for the plough; and where homes for the people can be made, we are told that we ought not to embrace it. Are we to sacrifice this great opportunity to petty provincial feeling - to a desire to help Sydney? I would not insult the intelligence of honorable members by urging provincial considerations. I have not pressed any one to vote for Dalgety. I have put the facts before the House, and I leave them to the good sense of honorable members. I believe that this is an Australian Parliament. Probably not many of us will see this Capital completed. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members laugh, but the Capital cannot be dumped down in a day like a tent. First there will be the necessary surveys to be made. Then will follow the laying out of a great city ; a city not for to-morrow or for next year, but for all time. A city unique in its beauty and utility, with broad avenues intersecting its regular squares, with frequent reservations of grass, flowers, and fountains, with its trees and parks, substantial business houses and sightly dwellings, its schools, universities, galleries, and museums, its monuments and public buildings, its noble rivers and picturesque landscape, its rugged mountains and fertile plains, with Kosciusko in the distance, piercing the sky and lifting itself like a heavenly dome. These, and many other natural advantages, will offer a noble panorama and a more inspiring contemplation than can possibly be afforded by any other city in the world. Our Federation will live and grow, and with that growth we shall have a Capital expanding with every  turn of the prodigious wheel of which it will be the axle. Plans for its improvement will abound. One can contemplate here the erection of halls like those of the ancients, where the eye may behold revived the architectural creations of bygone nations. Many schemes are worthy of consideration, but die essential must come first. We must have new railways, the means of communication with other great cities, necessary public buildings, and suitable accommodation for Parliament, press, and people. There will be no renting of rooms in which our public servants are to carry on the business of the nation, no placing them in dingy lodgings like transient visitors or postponed claimants. This will be a city that will live for all time, and it consequently demands provision for health and comfort, and all that is becoming to its importance. Whatever we do in building should be the best of its kind in plan, material, and execution. All our public buildings should be of good design, and as to the Capital itself, it, should be such as will express to the beholder the stability, the dignity, and the grace of the Australian nation. In it science will find a fitting home; in it that inventive genius which in the past has added to the comfort of the poor man's cottage will be sheltered, and, while discharging other useful functions, will assist to give precedence to our products in the markets of the world. It is our desire, I take it, that the inventor shall have every scope in a city that will one day loom large among the great cities of the world. We also require a city that will be a fitting place in which to receive the official representatives of every civilized nation, and men of high standing in the political and social life of the people they represent. In it those who make and interpret our laws will assemble. There also will be the great Departments in which the nation's affairs are transacted, -where public policy, internal and external, is determined, and from which the national progress is directed. Where, if not in this city of the future, can the stranger expect to find adequate representations of our people, of our institutions, and of all things that go to fill the measure of a nation's wealth and civilization? I look at the matter from the Australian stand-point. And I say that on this occasion we should cast our votes according to our honest convictions, independently of whether a site is closer to a particular town or not. I feel satisfied that honorable members will do that, and that the verdict will be in favour of die territory which has already been selected - Southern Monaro. </para>

                        <para>.- Through you, sir, I desire to put a question to the Minister who is also  Chairman  of the Postal Commission. On the 10th instant I received a circular - I take it in common with other honorable members - with reference to the sittings of the Commission. It drew attention to the fact that it had entered upon its investigation of the post, telegraph, and telephone services, explained that it was specially charged to inquire into certain matters which were enumerated, and proceeded to' say that if there were any associations or public bodies in an electorate it would be glad to hear their views. . I have communicated the contents of the circular to the municipalities in my electorate, and ascertained that some of them are desirous of placing certain matters before the Commission. I desire <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> know the earliest date on which it is likely to take evidence in Sydney? </para>

                            <para>- I think that it was made a public document. I was informed that the honorable member for North Sydney had applied for the information, and it seemed to me that it was a way of getting behind the Constitution, or trying to get round it, because Moss Vale is well known' to be within the 100- mile limit. But immediately he told me that it was not so, I said that I accepted his disclaimer. </para>

                            <para>- It was printed and distributed. I think that I got it out of a Moss Vale newspaper. I had it typed, and I shall be glad to tell any honorable member how I got it. What appeared to me as strange, until the honorable member made his denial, was that the honorable member for Maranoa did not apply for the information. I accept my honorable friend's statement, but it does not affect the position one way or trie other. I quoted it as a document which had come into my hands. I wish to explain to the honorable member that if I did not accept his disclaimer at the time, I intended to do so. Perhaps, in the heat of argument, I may not have made myself clear to him. Whatever he may do in regard to the selection of a site, I am sure that any one in the House will accept his disclaimer at  any  time. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope that the honorable member who stated just now, perhaps in the heat of debate, that he would never .consent to go to any Parliament in Dalgety, will not carry out his threat. I hope that he will not suggest to the Opposition such a terrible temptation to vote for Dalgety - because we have sufficient trouble amongst ourselves without having an awful temptation of that sort held out to us. I also trust that the Treasurer, if the House should select Dalgety, will not apply any of his infernal tactics, and accuse us of blocking the movement for a Capital. I hope the honorable gentleman will not carry his opposition to the choice of this House so far as to deny New South Wales any chance of getting the Federal Capital until he is suited. </para>

                            <para>- I could not live there, and the right honorable member for Swan would die there very soon. In reference to the return to Sydney of the Postal Commission, I understand that, as soon as the business here will allow, the Commission will return to take evidence in Sydney. The  Chairman  of the Commission has gone home, and I cannot say exactly when that will be. The Commission takes evidence very rapidly. </para>
