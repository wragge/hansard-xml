                        <para>- Some three years ago I suggested in this House that members of our partially-paid naval forces - the naval brigades - should receive long-service medals similar to those awarded to members of our partially-paid land forces. I should like the Minister of Defence to say whether the Department has yet dealt with the proposal, and whether it ever comes to a decision on any question? </para>

                        <para>- If I may be permitted to answer that question, I should like to say that we have on several occasions communicated with the Post and Telegraph Department with regard to this service, but that it is maintained by the Department that the prospective returns from it would not warrant its consideration. We had formerly an intermittent service from Cooktown by a very small steamer, but the proprietors of that vessel did not tender again when tenders were last invited for  the carriage of mails. Having regard to the interests of Papua and of Australia, as connected with those of Papua, 1 think that an extension of the service is. desirable. . If the House will be prepared to consider it, I, or whoever occupies my present position, may make some proposal in regard to it in connexion with next year's Estimates. </para>

The lateness of this meal, and the fact that only four of the officers attending the camp had any previous experience of camp work, caused some -slight confusion, and consequent dissatisfaction, over the issue of breakfast on Tuesday morning.; this was immediately adjusted. </para>
                        <para>The daily scale of ration's was - 1¬º lbs. of bread. ¬Ω lb. meat, ¬æ lb. mixed vegetables. 1/3 lb. potatoes. 3 ozs. sugar. <inline font-style="italic">¬º</inline> oz. salt. ¬Ω oz. tea. 1/8 lb. jam. 1/8 lb. treacle.  ¬Ω  lb pudding.  ¬º  lb. rice or oatmeal. </para>
                        <para>Total weight of ration, 4lbs. 3¬æoz. The total  amount issued to members of the. Militia -Forces in camp is 4 lbs. 8 17-32 ozs. per day, and to members of the Permanent Forces in quarters 4 lbs. 5-6 oz. per head per diem. It will be seen, therefore, that the daily ration was very liberal for boys between the ages of twelve and fourteen years. The contract price was 8¬Ωd. per head per diem. This includes cooks, fuel, and transport. The contract price in the case of the Militia Forces is9d. per head per day. The Militia scale allows1¬Ω lbs. of meat daily. It will be seen that the allowance of meat was ¬Ω lb. per head daily. Instead of a heavy meat ration, which is unsuitable for boys, one meal daily, consisting partly of meat, was considered quite sufficient, the medical officer of the camp fully concurred in this. Breakfast consisted of porridge and treacle, bread and jam, and tea. Rice was substituted for porridge on alternate days. There was a plentiful supply of bread, the amount provided was( the same as that allowed to the adult forces, viz.,1¬º lbs. per day. The tea was good, and was always tested prior to issue. When any shortage occurred in the first issue of rations, additional quantities were immediately forthcoming. The officers supervised the meals of the Cadets under their own charge on all occasions. There was an entire absence of dissatisfaction in regard to the amount and quality of food supplied. The distribution of the rations was submitted to the Medical Officer daily. He expressed himself as being entirely satisfied with the quantity, quality, and variety. The apportionment of food to messes was supervised by a Staff Officer at every meal. </para>
                        <para>I visited the camp on Tuesday, the 24th instant., arriving . at 1.45 p.m. I at once assembled the Commanding Officers, Headquarters Staff and Medical Officer, and went carefully into the matter of food -supplies and sanitation generally, and directed an alteration in the daily allotment. I made further inquiries of Officers and Cadets - more than half the entire number - taken at haphazard from the various companies, and found that all were well satisfied with the food supplies. The' health of the camp was excellent throughout. </para>

On inquiry it appears that the militia in Victoria have already put in so many parades' and drills that four days in camp -will make up "the 16 days' training for 'which pay is provided.

                    <para>. - In dealing with these Estimates of the Department of the Treasury, I' should like to draw attention to verv considerable increases of expenditure, both in these Estimates themselves and, incidentally, in the Estimates for the other Departments. I wish to deal with not merely the administration of the Department of the Treasury, but also the Treasurer's administration of the finances of the Commonwealth. I am not going to make my statement a lengthy one, but I think I can show that there have been considerable increases of expenditure which seem to be committing us to extravagance, unless, of course, explanations by the Treasurer can show the contrary. I think that it would be unfortunate if, merely because so much of the financial year has elapsed, we were to accept these Estimates as being of little interest to the Committee, and not to submit them to the careful examination which other Estimates have received. Hitherto the Parliament of the Commonwealth has not deserved the accusation of extravagance that has been so freely made in connexion with it. . The members of this Chamber, and also the' members of another place, have examined with a very proper care, and have criticised with a keen appreciation of the public interest, the accounts that have been submitted by various Treasurers. I am afraid, however, that on this occasion that criticism is considerably blunted, and that that examination is not in evidence. Possibly, the partial cause is that we have been passing Supply Bills month by month. The usual tendency of living by Supply Bills is to encourage excessive . expenditure in 'Departments, and to make Parliament less eager and less careful to examine the Estimates, owing to the fact that the money has practically been all spent. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It is a very dangerous system. Under it, Parliament surrenders its functions; and unless it has the strength of mind, when the Estimates do come before it, though its criticism may be of very little use as to the expenditure of the current year - unless then, I say, it has the strength of mind and the determination to see to it that the expenditure is not unduly increased - it means that the year that is neglected becomes a steppingstone to a higher level of expenditure in  future years. </para>

Of course, the excuse this time is that we have been dealing with the Tariff. But,- nevertheless, I do, say that it is possible to bring in the Estimates earlier than they are usually brought in, and not to require the constant granting of supply for- unchecked expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- I have taken some figures out of these Estimates, and in doing so I may state that . I am not merely dealing with the Treasurer's administration of his own Department. That is a minor duty, so far as he is concerned. I am dealing with his administration of the finances generally. I find, from a rough examination of the Estimates - of course one has to go through a good many figures to obtain these particulars - that there has been an increase practically in all the Departments under the different headings to which I will refer. In salaries and temporary assistance, the total increase is ; ¬£61,318. In postage and telegrams, the increase is ¬£2,120, spread over all Departments. In printing, the increase is¬£2,331, spread over all Departments,: except one. In travelling expenses, the increase is¬£2,715, spread over all Departments except one. In office requisites, account books, and so on, the increase is ¬£6,957, spread over all . Departments except one. In incidental and petty cash expenditure, the increase is ¬£398, spread' over all Departments except one. These figures make, with the increase of , ¬£61,318 in salaries, a total of ¬£75,839. </para>

                        <para>- I will mention the particulars for the Treasurer's information ; but will' first conclude what  I have to say on this point. We all recognise that if not one additional employe were added to the Commonwealth service, there must be, under the provisions of our Public Service Act, increases of expenditure, by the movement of officers from grade to grade, and through increases within the classes. The increases must be earned, by merit and service, but, given these, . they come automatically. Consequently, if there were not an increase in the number of public servants in any- one ' year, there would still be an increase in the cost of the service, and this will continue to be the case -until the retirements balance the increases, an equilibrium which is not likely to be reached for many years. The increases to which .  I have referred, ' 'however are due largely to additions to the service. It must not be thought that I have tried to be too critical. I have not taken into account new Departments, or Departments which! have not been in existence for two  years. I have not reckoned in the Meteorological and Statistical Departments ; the increase in the Printing Office, which, being largely for material and wages, may be due to an increase of work j the increases in trie Defence Department, except so far as the central administration is concerned ; nor the large increases in the Postmaster-General's Department in connexion with the climatic allowance of a.n additional 5 per cent, to certain officers in Western Australia and elsewhere, and certain allowances to postmasters. I have dealt only with the Departments and the routine work they have been doing for a number of years. In the Department of External Affairs the increases amount to ¬£1,5857. </para>

                        <para>- The total increase may be <inline font-style="italic">¬£91</inline> ; but, in comparing the total expenditure. of a Department during two years, it must be remembered that some items in one year do not occur the next. For instance, last year we voted ¬£46,000 extra for electoral expenditure, which we are not' asked to vote this year, because no elections are to take place. In the Department of the Treasury . there is an increase of ,¬£5,143 in salaries and temporary assistance, of ,¬£270 in postage and telegrams, of <inline font-style="italic">¬£20</inline> in, printing) of ¬£225 in.- travelling expenses, of ¬£235 in office requisites, and of- ¬£"75 in incidental expenses and petty cash, making al total of .¬£5,968. The; greater part of these increases occur in connexion with the Auditor-General's Department. The increases there of salaries come to nearly ^5,000, which is equal to almost 50 per cent, on the expenditure of last year.  <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne. - That is accounted for by the transfer of certain officials from the Department of Trade and 'Customs. </para>

                        <para>- That may be a good answer, but I can show that, notwithstanding that transfer, there is a large increase- in the expenditure of the . Department of Trade and ' Customs. I do not see  what good reason there .can be for these increases throughout all the Departments, in connexion with the items which I have enumerated. If we are not prepared, or have not an opportunity, to give to these Estimates the close scrutiny they require, in order that each of the items to which I have referred may be tested, we ought, at least, to indicate that in passing them we desire that they shall not be regarded as a proper basis. for future Estimates. ' They ought not to be accepted as a basis for further increases next year and thereafter. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman says that he has been sitting tightly on the Treasury chest, but judging by these items he is a lighter weight than I imagined. A careful examination of the Estimates should satisfy the Treasurer that there has been a remarkable increase in every Department.- I recognise that possibly the fact that he had charge of the Tariff in this House prevented him from giving to them the attention that they would otherwise have received from him. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer, at all events, ought to take care that, in the absence of good reason for so doing, future Estimates are not framed on the basis of those now before us. I have not -included in my figures the meteorological and statistical branches of the Department for Home Affairs. The items relating to those branches of the service are not quite new, but I have not endeavoured to take any advantage of the increases relating to them or in any new service. An examination discloses that items relating to the routine work of the-old Departments have increased to such an extent that, in passing these Estimates, we should indicate by motion our sense of the necessity for some reduction in future Estimates. </para>

                        <para>- I am not endeavouring to lay the- blame on the shoulders of the Treasurer ; but having regard to the fact that, notwithstanding the assurance given to. the House that the Supply Bills provided for the carrying on of the services of the Commonwealth on the scale of last year's Estimates, we now find that there has been a considerable increase, we must hold the Government responsible. I recognise that the Treasurer might have found himself compelled to meet unforeseen items ; but I do say that the cost of the ordinary routine working of the Departments should not have been increased under the Supply -Bills, unless Parliament was so informed. </para>

                        <para>- That is what the officers think. In dealing with the cost of telegrams, they say, in effect,  'After all it is only a book entry ; the cost to the Government is nothing." As a matter of fact, the increased use of the telegraph wires by the various Departments of the Commonwealth means an increased demand on telegraph operators and telegraph wires, and often results, in general business being blocked. I should like to think that this increase in respect of telegrams was due to increased departmental activity. That would be a rather surprising development; but I am afraid that the  true explanation is 'that many officers consider that' it is less troublesome to send a telegram than to write a letter. In these Estimates the cost of telegrams is not separated from the cost of postage, but there must have been a considerable increase in the telegraphic messages sent by the Departments,  for the large increase shown under that heading would not be due only to additional postage. ' We have always devoted  very serious attention to' the expenditure of the several Governments' that have been in power since the establishment of Federation. Honorable members on both sides of the House have been ready to consider any legitimate criticism of the Estimates, and even Government supporters have criticised any proposals that seemed to suggest Federal extravagance. I am afraid, however, that we are departing from that stand. Owing to circumstances which are rather extraordinary, we have allowed a series of Supply Bills to be passed with, I fear, the usual result. Expenditure has gone on increasing, and there has been no opportunity of criticising it. In some -cases, apparently, the expenditure has not been restricted. It Has simply been a case of " Here is a demand to spend money, and we must spend it." </para>

                        <para>- I think that the figures that I have mentioned would justify the Minister in making a searching examination of the expenditure of the Departments. The Estimates of working expenses are composed of a number of small sums which, grouped together, represent large amounts, the total shows a great expansion, but, under the circumstances, we can do nothing effective. There may be a tendency, I am afraid, to accept, these Estimates as legitimate, and as fulfilling the desires of Parliament, and to make them the. basis of. the Estimates of next year, and an excuse for large increases then. In the Treasurer's Department there is an increase of nearly 50 per cent, in the salaries - that is, in the Auditor-General's branch. This may be perfectly explainable by the transfer of officers, it may be, from the Customs Department; but, at the same time, the expenditure has increased in the latter Department; also to the extent of ¬£13,502. </para>

If I have erred at all, I think I have erred on the side of. not being unduly critical ; but I must protest against an increase which is serious, and more marked than any increase in other Estimates, even after allowing for the additional expenditure caused by new legislation. Unless the Minister can show that this increase is justified, not merely in his, but in other Departments, or will otherwise satisfy me, I must enter a protest in the least offensive way, of indicating that Parliament does not accept these Estimates as the proper basis of future Estimates, but will require, in the future, evidence of the need for considerable increases in . the items to which I have referred. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to take the present opportunity to say a few words on' 'the criticism that has been offered by the honorable member for North Sydney. In the first place, I have to say. that, while I have been Treasurer, I have tried my best <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> keep down expenditure, especially in one or 'two of the Departments. First of all, however, I was met with the objection that I had no right to interfere. I know what my rights are as Treasurer, and, though there might be some question raised as to interference in the expenditure of money authorized by Parliament, I take it that I have a right to the fullest information when it is sought to have additional expenditure in any one of the Departments. Every proposal for additional expenditure has been criticised by me most keenly. That has been so, not only in regard to salaries, which are under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, but in cases where I have been requisitioned to supply the funds to enable the number of employes to be increased. These requests have in some cases almost frightened me, and I have done my best to keep the expansion within bounds. In some Departments I have refused any advance of money except on the certificate of the Public Service Commissioner, who I know has taken a very great interest in this matter. All along the line, however, it is urged upon me that the Departments have hitherto been undermanned, more especially in the case of the Department of Trade and Customs and the Post and Telegraph Department. I have interviewed both Ministers and heads of Departments, in order to ascertain whether it is really necessary to temporarily, at any rate, make the fresh appointments desired, and I conceive that this is the duty of a Treasurer who desires to keep the Estimates within reasonable limits. I fear that unless a firm grip is taken, we may, in a year or two, find ourselves in such a position that there will be an outcry for retrenchment. I am met with statements to the effect that certain Departments are earning much more than in the past, and that the expansion of business makes additional assistance necessary ; and, again - I am referring more particularly to the Department of Trade and Customs and the Post and Telegraph Departments - I was advised by one of the principal heads of the Customs Department that in Sydney the business could not be carried on unless more assistance was given - that everything was checked owing to undermanning. </para>

                        <para>- I generally am; but I may say that I have had to bear a great deal - I shall not say abuse - but of odium, because I would not grant the money asked for. I have no desire, of course, to curb reproductive expenditure, but only to check any undue expansion in the administrative Departments. I cannot go into the details now, but I hope to have the Additional Estimates on the table tomorrow or the next day, when honorable members will be able to judge how this expansion has progressed. I do not blame any one, and the expansion may be absolutely necessary and inevitable ; but I am not going any further until Parliament votes the money which has been asked for. This, in my opinion, is a very serious matter, and one for the House to deal with. . I hope, however, that there will be nothing in the shape of a vote of censure. </para>

I have no doubt that the heads of the Departments will take notice, as I shall myself, of such speeches as that delivered by the honorable member for North Sydney. The carrying out of the works need not all be rushed into the one year, but should go on year by year. I have pointed out to the Public Service Commissioner, and to the heads of Departments, that the last year or two have been boom years, and that, therefore", the time may come when we shall feel the pinch, and have to retrench. Personally, I have no desire to see a repetition of what occurred in the past in New South Wales ; and I have issued a warning accordingly. A Minister at the head of the Department of Trade and Customs or of the Post and Telegraph Department, must depend on his officers to a large extent - he can only govern totals, and not always these. The honorable member for  North Sydney referred to the danger of Supply Bills, but was generous enough to say that this session their submission had been caused bv the consideration of the Tariff. Personally, I think Supply Bills are highly improper,' and I have fought against them in the State Parliament of New South Wales. </para>

The honorable member said that he thought in connexion with the expenditure on postage and various things of that kind that there was a more general use of the telegraphic service by the Departments than was formerly the case, and that that entailed the employment of additional hands and additional lines.

                        <para>- I should hardly think that that is the explanation. I doubt whether there has been an increased use pf the telegraph service to any appreciable extent. It is only from the Departments which use the telegraph most that we can find that out. As to the increases in the Customs Department, I find from the Secretary of the Treasury that the increased expenditure is ¬£1,498. In regard to the Auditor-General's office, provision was. made for the transfer of officers who were previously in the Post Office and the Customs Department. Those officers have' been transferred to the Auditor-General, and their salaries are now debited to his Department. The increase is due to the larger Customs revenue, and' to the consequent increase of work. That is the answer given to me by the Secretary of my Department as to the- reason for the Auditor-General's Department being increased. I knew it before, but I thought it advisable to get a statement from the Secretary to the Treasury. </para>

                        <para>- When I was Minister of Trade and Customs, I went to the Customs House in Sydney to look into some complaints as to there being a block, in the work. I found in one room - the invoice room, I think it was - that the space was insufficient. I had to have the room enlarged, and to appoint a number of fresh officers, because of the increase of work. Increased importations involve an increased amount of checking. When there is an enormous increase of business we must have additional officers to do it. I wanted the Postmaster-General to hear the remarks of the honorable member for North Sydney, because I know that he is doing his best to keep down expenditure in his Department in a reasonable way.' It takes a man versed in administration to control the officers and the expenditure of a great Department. </para>

Later on I shall have to come down to the -House with additional Estimates to cover a number of items, the particulars concerning which will make the Committee thoroughly aware of the growth of the Department. Practically all the money voted on last year's Estimates for the Department has gone in nine months, and I have had to make provision to carry on for the additional three months of the year. That is really the position. </para>

                        <para>- On works, and departmentally also. But I do not wish to deal more fully with the subject now. I hope that honorable members opposite will recognise that I have  tried for more reasons than one to control the expenditure of the Departments in such a way that it can never be said of me that I allowed an undue increase of expenditure while I was Treasurer. Where money is required I want to give the fullest amount that is necessary, but no more. I want to see the Departments increase as they should increase, proportionately with the work to be done. But I do not want to have the blame attached to me that I allowed Departments to grow unduly, or that I squandered money in any shape or form. </para>

                    <para>. - The speech of the honorable member for North Sydney must have been very refreshing to you. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> in view of the interest which you always take in the criticism of the Estimates. I agree with the honorable member that by our system of passing Supply Bills we are giving up control over the Treasury, and the Departments. We have virtually surrendered our power as representative men, and all that we can do is to wait until next year's Estimates come before us, and to say what we intend to do with regard to them. I appreciate the detailed statements which the honorable member for North Sydney has given us. Their preparation must have involved a large amount of research. The Treasurer himself admits that there has been increased expenditure, and says that he welcomes criticism though he fears a vote. </para>

                        <para>- I am not concerned about a vote, because I have sufficient parliamentary experience to know that a vote cast with regard to any. Minister would be ineffective. We should not expect a Minister to continue in his position in face of an adverse vote on his Estimates. I hope, however, that the Treasurer will not be thin-skinned in regard to this matter. </para>

I am well aware, through inspired paragraphs in the press, that for some time past the Treasurer has been trying to carry out the duties that properly belong to his office, by keeping a tight hand on! the public funds. The same inspired paragraphs have led us to . believe that there has been almost a riot in the Cabinet through other Ministers desiring to get more money for the purposes of their Departments. </para>

                        <para>- I am pleased to know that the rumours to which ' I refer were exaggerated, and that the Treasurer has had the generous, assistance of his colleagues in the Cabinet. He also admits that our method of passing frequent Supply Bills is not a good one, but I point out that the only voice raised against them on many occasions was my own. Time after time, some excuse was made for introducing such measures - either that the Government wanted to get on with some other business, or that the public servants were waiting to be paid, or that the Treasurer wanted for some other reason to get the Bill through. It is to be hoped that next session we shall be able to deal with the Estimates early in the year, so that our control over the expenditure will not be merely a myth. I should like  to draw attention to the enormous growth of expenditure, bearing out what the Treasurer has admitted. He says that we are now enjoying fat years, but that we may have lean years to follow, and that some drastic retrenchment may be forced upon him if he does not take a stand at the present time. If honorable members look at the abstract of expenditure, they will find that increases in all Departments, special appropriations, ordinary votes, and expenditure on new works, amount to ¬£980,691 for the year 1907-8. On a percentage basis, that is about a 25 per cent, increase over the total expenditure for the year 1906-7. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that special appropriations amount to ¬£294,000, and that the Post and Telegraph Department accounts for an increase of ¬£181,000. But, notwithstanding that, there is an increase of close upon ¬£700,000 over and above the expenditure of 1906-7 for all the Departments. I know, however, that Parliament is not inclined to pay much attention to these matters at the present time. Honorable members say that the money has all been spent, and the mere recital of the expenditure is not sufficient to attract the attention of the Committee. If the Treasurer desires to make his control over the finances effective, he is doing the right thing in inviting criticism. The criticism which he has received shows that honorable members appreciate the work that he is doing in keeping a tight grip over expenditure. In the early days of Federation, we had, as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, who made a name for himself in Victoria during her days of trouble by his careful control of the finances, which enabled him to pull his State out of the mud. Any Treasurer who follows in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner's footsteps, even if he errs on the side of parsimony, is a far more useful Treasurer to the Commonwealth thin would be a spendthrift or one who neglected his duty. </para>

                        <para>- The other day, I said that the Treasurer was a miser in regard to public expenditure. But, after all, it is the duty of a Treasurer to be careful with the public funds. I can quite under stand a Treasurer making a good excuse for increased expenditure, and saying that for every needful development of the Post and Telegraph Department and the Customs Department we get additional receipts. If we can, by spending ¬£1, get an increased return of 25s., that is business. But when we see so large an increase of expenditure over that for the year 1906-7, it is only right that we should make our protest. The honorable member for North Sydney has shown the growth of the Departments in detail. If honorable members look at the Estimates, they will find that there have been increases in every Department. On the ordinary votes, the increase is practically ¬£340,000 ; the increase for additional works is ¬£347,000. Now we are told that in a .day or two the Treasurer intends to dump down on the table Additional Estimates that will stagger us. He fears that if we go on in this way there will, in -a few years, be a call for retrenchment. We do not want to live in a fool's paradise. It is far better to keep a careful control over the finances now than to have to cut down expenditure a few years hence. My contention in resisting Supply Bills all along has been, not that the Government would not use wisely the money voted, but that Parliament was surrendering its control over public expenditure. In my view, it is the duty of a public, man to keep his finger upon the expenditure of the country, and to see that care is exercised in the administration of every Department. He tells the electors that he will do so when he offers himself as a candidate. One of his highest functions as a public man is to exercise control over the public- funds. If we are to surrender this right, why should we go through the farce of discussing Estimates? I understand the Treasurer's dilemma. He says that it is all very well for honorable members to complain that he has not proper control" of the public expenditure, but he adds that he himself has cause for complaint, under the circumstances, in regard to their attitude towards the expenditure of the Postal- or some other Department. Honorable members advocate large expenditure in their own electorates, and yet find fault with him for not having proper control over the finances. An honorable member cannot properly urge economy on the Treasurer, and then ask for extravagant expenditure.  His  attitude , should be consistent in regard to all the Departments. The Treasurer has told us that he has been informed by other Ministers that their Departments are unworkable because undermanned. Of course, they rely upon the statements of their officials.. But are we to be content with such statements? Are we going to leave matters entirely to the officials ? . I support the criticism of the honorable member for North Sydney, and trust that in the f future he will strongly oppose the introduction of Supply Bills. I have suggested that, instead of having a prorogation, we should have a short adjournment very soon, so that we may do the financial work of next year at the proper time. The abstract on- page  5  of these Estimates shows that the yearly .expenditure of the Commonwealth is increasing tremendously. This year there is an increase of about  30  per cent, on the expenditure" of last year. The Commonwealth cannot stand increases like this. But, by voting money by passing Supply Bills, Parliament loses its- control of the purse. I hope that honorable members will feel that a close examination of the Estimates is necessary, and, to be effective, it should be the first work of the session. I have heard it said by many a Treasurer on the introduction of a Supply Bill that it is to be the last. I believe the Treasurer said that about the last Supply Bill. I hope, however, since there have been so many lasts, that;- it will be the final last. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that the Treasurer replied to the criticism of the honorable member for North Sydney before the other side of the case had been put. I give place to none in advocacy of economy ; but what is called economy is often merely sitting hard on. the Treasury chest, and refusing to make provision for needed and useful  public works, sometimes with the result of bringing about increased expenditure in the future. The expenditure of the last few months disposes me to criticise adversely the . action of the Treasurer in starving the Departments. </para>

                        <para>- My attention will be confined to the administration of the Treasurer during the past few month-; iri regard to necessary public works, which has been so parsimonious as to reflect no credit on him. Calare is a country electoral division embracing a considerable area, where the population, although scattered among small centres, is increasing steadily, and consequently requires increased facilities in the way of mail service, post-office accommodation, and the extension of telegraph and telephone lines. The Department of the Postmaster-General' has of later years done yeoman service in. trying to meet the growing needs of settlement, and in no way- can we better commend ourselves  10  the people than by providing them with facilities for communication. But during the past few months work has been practically stopped, because the Treasurer has refused to grant the necessary funds. As an instance of this, I may say that, when a few months ago I visited Molong, a very old township in the middle of a well -settled district in my electorate, I found that the mails were still being conveyed from the railway station to the post-office by the letter-carrier. At one time, he could do this easily, carrying the sack on his back, but of late he has had to provide a hand cart, and the work, has increased so much that the public are deprived of his services in other directions. I represented the matter to' the authorities, with the result that tenders were called for the conveyance of mails between the railway station and the Post-office, and a suitable tender was accepted. But, on passing through the town the other day, I found the letter-carrier still engaged in the work, because the Treasurer has refused to provide the money necessary to pay the contractor. The people of that town also petitioned for a telephone bureau. They obtained the requisite number of subscribers, and complied with all the departmental rules, their application being finally approved. But, for want of means, nothing has yet been done by the Department. In another instance, after the retirement of a non-official postmaster, the people' in the locality petitioned for the reestablishment of the office.. That was approved of, and another officer nominated, at a fixed salary. ' But the Department has since had to make it known that the appointment cannot be made until funds are available. I have received a communication from one of the leading residents of the  district, and one of the chief movers in the matter, in which he tells me that the people there seriously think of subscribing, or -obtaining in' some other way, money to carry out this service until the Department can supply the necessary funds. Similar occurrences are taking place in other parts of my electorate, and in other electorates, and no criticism by the press and politicians of . Sydney can do more to bring Federation into popular contempt than the parsimony of the Treasurer in regard to important and much-needed public works. We experience great difficulty in obtaining postal and telegraphic facilities that are urgently needed. It must be shown that a service asked for will pay practically from the start, and in some cases guarantees have to be given. The people cannot understand why, after all these preliminaries have been disposed of, such a big Department should have to explain that it has not available the funds necessary to provide for such services, and that they must wait until the necessary provision has been made by the Treasury. This question may seem unimportant to some people, but it is of vital concern to those directly interested, and the continuance of the present state of affairs will do more to bring the Federation into disrepute than will any criticism hurled at it by the Sydney press or by the Governments of the States. The parsimony displayed by the Treasurer is not in the interests of the people whom we are here to serve, nor will it promote the interests of the Federation'. I have cited only a few of the causes for complaint against the Commonwealth which exist in New South Wales, and I daresay that the position is the same in the other States. Throughout the press of New South Wales complaints of the' undermanning1 of the Post and Telegraph Department are made from time to time, and we are told of a condition of affairs that ought not to obtain under the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of a Government which professes to be taking the lead in the humanitarian movement. Men in the Postmaster-General's Department who produce doctors' certificates showing that their health will be vitally affected by their remaining on duty are often compelled to stand by their posts because the Department has not a proper relieving staff. ' For the same reason the whole system of annual leave is practically at a dead stop. Honorable members will readily understand that men who have served for years in the heat of the back country need to be relieved when they get run ' down. Under present conditions, however, they are relieved only under the most extreme pressure. Those acquainted with the development of New South Wales know that its postal, telegraphic, and telephonic work, has increased by leaps and bounds during the last few years, and that there has not been a proportionate increase in the staff of the Department. " The consequence is that we have men working at high pressure, and numerous complaints of sweating. When we proceed to investigate the matter, we are led first of all to suppose that the  Deputy  Postmaster-General and his staff are responsible. A brief inquiry is sufficient to show, however, that they have made years ago the necessary representations as to the need for meeting the growing demands on the service. Then 'we are told that the Public Service Commissioner, with a desire for economy, has refused to indorse the recommendations of his responsible officers, but finally, as the result of questions put to Ministers in this House, we discover that the Commissioner has made recommendations for a large increase in the service, and that the stumbling block in the way of such an increase is to be found on the door-step of the Treasury. I understand that the Commissioner last year recommended something like 1,000 new appointments to the Public Service, and that although that recommendation was submitted to the Cabinet for consideration in connexion with the framing of these Estimates, no provision has been made to give effect to it. Such a state of affairs ought not to be tolerated. If any one ought to be familiar with the needs of the Post and Telegraph Department, it should be the  Deputy-  Postmaster-General in each of the States, and the Public Service Commissioner, . who has to look after the strength and efficiency of the service. If we are tc permit the Treasurer, in the name of economy - falsely so-called - to frustrate the efforts of those officers - to over -ride the recommendations of the responsible men in a Department - we might as well let him take sole control of the affairs of the Commonwealth, and run them at his own sweet will. Whilst he refuses to grant the supplies necessary to carry on urgent works, he practically controls the whole Federal  machine, and denies to responsible . officers the opportunity to carry on the service on lines which experience leads them to believe are the soundest to adopt. The post-card craze has largely increased the work of the Post and Telegraph Department, and last Christmas /a great deal of friction and dissatisfaction was created in Sydney owing' to its inability to deal with the great rush of work so caused. That inability was due, not to want of foresight on the part of the responsible officers, but to the refusal of the Treasurer to provide them  with the means to avoid it. In order that there might be no block of business, the Deputy Postmaster- General was obliged to employ a number of temporary hands. In that way the pressure, was relieved, but these unfortunate men, who had served the Commonwealth well, were told when they should have received their wages that no money was available, and they had to go without any pay during the holiday season; After pressure had been brought to bear upon the Treasurer, the necessary funds were made available. </para>

                        <para>- I am conscious that in directing this criticism to the  Postmaster-General and his responsible officers, I shall not be hitting at those who should be rightly blamed for the trouble. It is for the purpose of addressing my remarks to the Minister primarily responsible that on these Estimates I have gone into details in connexion with the working of the Post and Telegraph Department. The Treasurer should not consider that the only charge against which he has to guard is one of wasteful expenditure. There is a true and a false economy, and in connexion with the matters to which I have referred, the honorable gentleman has indulged in a false economy which will tend to bring, not only his Government, but the whole Federal machine, into disrepute. I hope that the folly of the parsimony  displayed by the Treasurer will be brought home to him so strongly that he will make provision for the proper equipment and efficiency of the Public Service. What becomes of every penny which, by this process of squeezing, is saved? It goes to enrich the State Treasuries, and yet members of the Parliament of New South Wales have complained to me of the parsimony of the Federal Government in failing to make provision for postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities for small centres of population, as well as in the other directions which I have indicated. Such a condition of affairs is certainly unhealthy, and I trust that the Treasurer will recognise that bv being over-zealous in his desire to keep down expenditure, he is doing an injustice to himself, to the Postmaster-General's Department, to the Commonwealth, and especially to the people primarily affected. </para>

                    <para>.- I hold in my hand the papers which the Prime Minister was kind enough to lay on the table this morning in connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> Commission. I must confess that the papers filled me with mystification more than any other feeling; and I am anxious that the Prime Minister should help us to understand the exact reason for the Government departing from its original promise or understanding in regard to the expense of this inquiry and the report. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to direct attention to the item of ¬£25 for the audit of the accounts of the Northern Territory. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> of the Treasury, has gone to Adelaide in connexion with this matter, and there is no doubt that that gentleman is an able' officer, of whom the Commonwealth ought to be proud. I have been told, however, that the South Australian Government, in order to make as large an account as possible against the Commonwealth, have charged"" cost price for different articles which are second-hand and in an almost obsolete condition, as if they were new material. That is a story which is current amongst a number of officials in the Northern Territory, and the matter is one which ought to be carefully looked into. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins</inline> has done his work well, but, of course, he deals only with Treasury vouchers, and has no idea of the condition of the material when it is taken over. If there is any truth in the rumour, an opportunity is here presented for saving, perhaps, some thousands of pounds. </para>

                    <para>. - It is a great pity that an honorable member should make so general and serious a statement without disclosing any foundation whatever for it. I do not believe that such a thing would be attempted by' the South Australian Government - I am satisfied I can vouch that much. The honorable member for Corio ought to refer the matter back to his authority, and ask for some proof, or, as another honorable member did, admit that he has been entirely mistaken. </para>

                    <para>. - In the newspapers this morning there was a paragraph indicating that it is the intention of the Government to take the work of printing the electoral rolls from the State Government Printing Office in New South Wales and have it done at the central office in Melbourne, and some information on this point would be acceptable. I take it, judging from previous actions of the Government, that this is one' of those unfounded rumours which are circulated for the purpose of discrediting the Commonwealth and Commonwealth administration. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Calare has referred to a matter to which I had intended myself to call attention. I think that the printing of the electoral rolls might well be continued in Sydney until the Federal Capital is established, when a desire to centralize such work could be well understood. I hope the rumour referred to is unfounded, though the action suggested is on all-fours with that which was advocated by some of the members of the Government in regard to having all the postage stamps printed in Melbourne. Do I understand that the Treasurer is still allowing the stamps to be printed in, the printing office, Sydney ? The Minister of Trade and Customs nods assent. I am glad that he does, because on the last occasion, when we discussed the matter, I think he was an advocate of the stamps being printed in Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- It must be cheaper to print them where the electoral office for the State is. The process of revising the electoral rolls is constantly going on. The plates are stereotyped, and the rolls are altered from month to month. The electoral office in Sydney can control this work far more economically when the printing is done close to hand, than would be the case if the rolls were printed in Melbourne. It will be a great mistake to disturb the present arrangement until the Capital Site is established, and we have our own printing office. </para>

                        <para>- It has not been before the Cabinet, and I have not heard it suggested. I do not think that the statement is true. In . regard to the stamps, it was considered necessary some time ago by the Post and Telegraph Department to appoint a Commission to inquire into the question of stamp printing, and into the class of printing that was required. But it will take two years before the recommendations made can be brought  to a head. I believe that it has been stated in New South Wales that I said that the work of stamp printing was to be removed to Melbourne. I never said anything of the kind. I find, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullick.</inline> the New South Wales Government Printer, differs from other printers as to which is the better style of die to adopt. I have compared stamps printed from a steel die and those printed by the other process, which is considered to be cheaper. I must say the cheaper method is not to be compared with the other. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullick</inline> wants them to be printed in the old fashion. ' Personally, I should prefer the steel-die method, although it is more expensive. I am in favour of having the best class of stamp printing, because it must be remembered that stamps are saleable commodities. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest's idea, while he was Treasurer, was that the ' stamps should be printed at. the head office, wherever it was. But it all depends upon whether there is to be a Government Printing Office or whether the work is to be done at a State Printing Office. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest held ' the opinion that all the stamps ought to be printed at one office, under the control of the Treasurer. That is a very proper idea, too. There is no question about that. </para>

                        <para>- Because, for one thing, we shall not be ready to adopt the new method for at least two years. I wish to say also in reference to- the printing office that the State Printing Office, Melbourne, does most of our parliamentary work, and does it well. There has been a strong agitation for the establishment of a Commonwealth Printing Office. The only reason why I have not moved in that matter is that we are not yet established in our own capital. When we are, we shall have to have a printing office of our own. I think that an officer from South Australia is coming over to Victoria to undertake the printing, not of the whole of the stamps, but of some kinds. But that, does not apply to New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- I have never heard a rumour to the effect that the electoral rolls for New South Wales' were to be printed outside the State. I shall certainly make inquiries, but I feel sure . that the statement is an absolute myth. Some one has made it with the view of injuring the Commonwealth. I do not think that there is the slightest shadow of reason for any one to be apprehensive on the subject. In addition to that, as I told the Premier of New South Wales after he made his statement, no person has given the Government Printing Office, Sydney, more work to do than I have. Knowing it as well as I do, I am quite aware that printing can be done there perhaps more economically than' anywhere else in Australia. It is a most up-to-date office, and I am not likely to take any work away from it. </para>

                    <para>.- This question of the printing of stamps seems to be a perennial source of trouble. It has been discussed for a good many years. I thought that we had at last reached finality. But still it crops up again. The fault that I have to find with the Government is that they have not arrived at a decision on the question one way or the other. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the Treasurer has actually taken over the officer. I believe that he is still officially stamp printer in Adelaide, though the work of printing stamps over there has been abandoned. I have constantly protested against the parochial spirit shown in this matter. It seems to be an astonishingly small thing for the Premier and politicians of New South Wales to be troubling about. If New South Wales could have carried out the work of stamp printing as cheaply as it was being done in South Australia, probably she would have had the work to do. We hear a great deal about the unfederal spirit displayed by representatives of other States in relation to . the question of the Capital Site. But here . is a case where it is manifestly cheaper for certain work to be done in the Commonwealth Printing Office, and as soon as it is proposed to take that step, New South Wales, through her Premier, gets on her hind legs and howls till the air is blue. </para>

                        <para>- Under . the circumstances, I withdraw the legs. We have had from the honorable member for North. Sydney quite a sermon in regard to the need for carefully criticising increases of expenditure, even where they may be necessary. But when an opportunity to  save money occurred in connexion with the printing of stamps, every New South Wales representative sitting on the front Opposition bench complained about the proposed transference of work from the Sydney Printing. Office, and the Minister had to explain that, rather than that the susceptibilities of the " Ma " State in this matter should be wounded, it had been determined to allow the stamps required for. New South Wales to be produced by the ineffective and expensive method there in force. The antique method of New South Wales is to continue, and I believe that Queensland is also to be allowed to carry on its clumsy, and still more ancient, mode of stamp printing. The printing of the stamps required for the four other States, however, is to be done by the Commonwealth in Melbourne, and I hope that the Treasurer will soon complete all the necessary arrangements. </para>

                        <para>- That statement is unsupported by facts. In my opinion, there has been a miscalculation as to the extent to which persons in other parts of the world will buy our stamps if they are printed on better paper. We should have in view, not the demands of the Philatelic Society, but the requirements .of our own public, and, therefore, need not give consideration to the possibility of adopting later the more costly production. </para>

                        <para>- I. could show the honorable member some very fine specimens of South Australian stamps.. I. doubt if any but an expert could detect any difference 'in the .quality of printing, though there is a difference in the quality of the paper, and a vast difference in the cost of production. The honorable member may like stamps printed on good paper, but the ordinary commercial man does not put' any additional value on such stamps.  In  my opinion, it will be a mistake to increase the cost of the Postal Department by printing our stamps on paper of better quality than is requisite. </para>

                        <para>- So far as forgery is concerned, it Is not more difficult with one paper than with another, everything turning upon the control. A strong reason for having all the printing of stamps done in Melbourne is that it can be kept under better control in one than in several offices. I ask the Minister to bring about finality in the matter to which I have referred. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> is practically on his way here, and I feel certain,  from my experience of him in South Australia, that his work will speedily commend itself to the Government, and will save the Commonwealth a great deal of money. Our chief duty, as custodians of the public purse, is to see that administration is efficient, and not unduly costly, and I hope that less parochial spirit will in the future be shown in these small matters by representatives of the most important State in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Boothby complains of the display of the parochial spirit by the representatives of what he 'termed the " Ma " State; but even if we were fighting for the " Ma" State, it may be said of him that all he is concerned about is "Pa" Cook. So long as "Pa" Cook <inline font-style="italic">gets</inline> his billet, the honorable member will be satisfied. He concluded his speech by saying that he hoped that "Pa" Cook would at once be brought over from Adelaide, and that the petty parochial spirit would not again be shown bv representatives of the " Ma " State. He objected to the stamps printed in New South Wales, on the ground that they are" antique ; but amongst the " common or garden " variety of persons with whom I mix, to apply the word " antique " to a work of art is to enhance its value. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member had the artistic temperament, he would not ask the question. When we have a Commonwealth printing office in the Commonwealth Seat of Government, it will be parochial to ask that any printing which could be done there should be done in' a State office. It was not the Premier of New South Wales, but an earnest and ardent Labourite representing Blayney, who brought up this matter in the State Parliament last night'. He complained that artisans in the Sydney Government Printing Office were losing their employment, and asked that they should not be. suddenly deprived of their means of earning a livelihood. But the honorable member for Boothby has gone back upon his fellow Labourite. So far as I am <inline font-style="italic">aware not</inline> one of these men who earn their livelihood in the Government Printing Office of New South Wales resides in my electorate. The Treasurer says that it will take twelve months to put the new plant in position. </para>

It is unfair that one State should be given a considerable advantage in respect of prices paid for work done for the Commonwealth ; but in dealing with such matters the responsible Minister should take care that the estimates in all cases are in respect of the same, article, and that such article ' is the best for the purpose. I wish now to refer to the  reply made by the Treasurer -to the observations which I made earlier in the debate. There seems to be some misapprehension, especially on the part of the  honorable member for Calare as to what my objections were. I in no way objected to the increased expenditure that is necessitated by new works, new enterprises, or the growth of business, nor did I make any reference  to an increased expenditure of ¬£826,000 in connexion . with new enterprises or developments for which the Estimates provide. We shall be able to deal with the items relating to that expenditure when we reach them. I merely touched upon  increases in respect of seven of the ordinary items of departmental expenditure, namely, salaries, temporary assistance, postage and telegrams, printing, travelling expenses, office requisites, and incidental and petty cash. I made no reference to the expenditure of the new Departments nor to the expenditure of about ¬£12,000 in the administration of the Commerce Act. </para>

                        <para>- I had overlooked that fact. I did not object in any way to increased- expenditure due to increased work and an increased revenue, nor did I take into account increased expenditure in respect of printing. By way of illustration I would point out that when a Railway Department increases its revenue by ¬£100,000, there must necessarily be a proportionate increase in its expenditure. As a rule, its expenditure is increased by 50 or 60 per cent. No one has ever objected to an increase in such circumstances, but a Parliament would very properly object to the increased revenue of that Department being completely swallowed by increased expenditure. That seems to be the position in relation to some of the items I have criticised. I had intended to move that these Estimates be reduced by ¬£1 as an indication of the feeling of the Committee that they should not be made the basis of future expenditure, but after the remarks made by the Treasurer I shall not do so. The honorable gentleman has practically agreed with the tenor of my criticism, and ought' really to come over to this side of the House. In moving such a motion, I Should not have been actuated by a desire to attribute to the Treasurer the responsibility for the increase. In the remarks which I offered I had no desire to reflect on the central office of the Treasury. The Treasury itself is free from the objection which I raised. My experience leads me to. believe that it is excellently managed. Had the Treasurer refused to take notice of the points that I wished to emphasize, I would have moved the reduction I have indicated ; but since he has said that he se'eks, and will seek, to prevent the mere swelling of expenditure without cause - such as, I infer, from the appearance of these Estimates, has been taking place - I shall not do so. It is highly desirable that whilst providing for new enterprises and developments, we should set our face sternly against that which has occurred in all Departments that have lacked thorough super- vision - the unnecessary growth of expenditure to the consequent injury of the community </para>

                    <para>, - I have to complain of the action of - the Treasurer in permitting the Government Printer to print a document which the House understood would not have to be printed at the public expense. I understand that on these Estimates I am not permitted to go into details, so that I shall not make- more than a general reference to the report in question. In order to substantiate my case, however, I shall refer briefly to the promise which the Government made to the House, and the arrangement arrived at between them and the party concerned. I refer to the agreement made with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> that his Commission and his, report and everything concerned with it should entail no expense to the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I have been asked to give a ruling, but, in the first place. I do- not know what the honorable member for Wentworth is going to say, and, in the second place, seeing that we are now dealing with the question of Government printing, I can come to no other conclusion except that all printing comes under that head, unless, of course, there is some specific item in which it can be included elsewhere. Honorable members will see that if I did not take that view, endless difficulty would arise in trying to' decide as to which Department each item of printing was. connected with. </para>

                        <para>- I have just shown that the fact that these reports were printed in Sydney necessitated a large payment for freight, which might' have been avoided. I find that the report prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> was printed in Sydney on the 8th August, 1907, and that the forwarding of the copies to Melbourne necessitated, as I have said, a payment of¬£13. Consequently I feel that, on the Estimates before us, I am entitled to ask why the Government authorized the printing of this document, in view of the promise of the Prime Minister, to which I must refer in order to prove my contention. </para>

However, that is by the way. The promise was made to this House that the Commission would entail no expense on the Commonwealth; and, in. view of that absolute statement, the House permitted the Commission to go on its way. I now ask the Treasurer how he can justify the payment of any sum of money in connexion with the expense pf printing the report. It strikes me, having regard to the answers given by the Prime Minister to-day, that this Commission may have been deliberately appointed in order to en-' able the expense incurred by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> to be shouldered on to the Commonwealth. I can come to no other conclusion. </para>

I point out, however, that.I have not previously addressed myself to that subject on the items before us, so that the point of order is scarcely valid. In reply to a question to-day, the Prime Minister' said that no payment had been made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> for his services, and, of course, that fact is obvious. But the Prime Minister went on to say that a sum of ¬£68 odd was reimbursed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> on the submission by '.him of a voucher showing that he had paid that amount to Messrs. Baker and Company for making blocks for illustrations. We find, as I have already said, that the report was printed in Sydney, and a large cost incurred in conveying the copies to Melbourne'. </para>

However, I am now asking for information : and I hope that the Government have no objectionable facts to conceal, however anxious they may appear now, by raising points of order, to prevent me pursuing my remarks. I ask the Treasurer whether this account with Messrs. Baker and Company was incurred before or after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> was made Commissioner? </para>

                        <para>- Then I say that it is most extraordinary for the Commonwealth to delegate its arrangements for printing to any but its own officers. The moment the report of a Royal Commission is sent in, the Government may print it or not,, as they choose, with the permission pf the House; but they have no right to delegate the power to any one, however important a political entity he may be. To give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> or any one else, the right to incur expense on the part of the Commonwealth is a bad practice, which I hope I shall not see repeated. I think that I have submitted - with great difficultly owing to the constant interruptions - a case which requires a certain answer from the Government. I certainly think that it is " up to them " to explain why they have gone back on their promise to this House, and have done something which-the Treasurer only a few years ago in New South Wales turned a Government out of office for doing. </para>

                        <para>- Strictly speaking, perhaps you are right, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> but may I put this point to' you? The matter all depends upon this : whether this expenditure was incurred by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> as Commissioner, or before his appointment as Commissioner. We had a definite statement from the Prime Minister that no expenditure would be incurred in the preparation and printing of 'the report. Our contention is that, to get an excuse for incurring this expenditure in the preparation and printing of this report, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> was appointed a Commissioner, and that the matter should have been' re-submitted to this House. That is the point which I wish to get out. </para>

                        <para>- On the second ' occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> who had visited the Continent of Europe, a number of cities in Great Britain, and the United States of America, where he placed himself in touch with the highest authorities on the question into which he was inquiring, prepared hrs matter. He included in his report no opinions of his own on any subject, but simply- collected and collated the opinions of all these authorities. The only expense incurred by us in this connexion is in relation to. the printing and publishing of the report. The whole amount is that paid to the printer in Sydney, the ¬£13 for carriage, and the one account for certain blocks that, I think, could only be obtained in London. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> paid two visits. That is the sum and substance of it all. I must say, also, that I do not know of any Royal Commission in any State, or in any part of Australia, that has been conducted in this economical fashion. I do not know any other Commissioner who, at his own cost, has travelled at an expense of hundreds of pounds, who has collected expert information, and paid the whole of his expenses out of his own pocket, and given all that to the Commonwealth, receiving not one penny himself. This is not -like the other case mentioned, where a Royal Commissioner received a sum of money for expenses in New South Wales. . </para>

                        <para>- I was alluding, sir, to the last insult of the Prime Minister, with which I do not intend to deal further. I do not think it is worth while. What the Prime Minister has suggested is that, although it was promised that the appointment of this man to do this work was going to entail no cost for printing or in any other way, the fact that on his return from one expedition he is appointed a Royal Commissioner to enter upon another,' absolved the Government from its original promise. But the fact that that second expedition was going to entail cost upon the Commonwealth was not explained to . Parliament. . The understanding of honorable members .was, so far as the Commission was concerned, not ' as to whether one journey or another journey was entailed upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale.</inline> The question that concerned us was that there was to be no expense to the Commonwealth connected with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale.</inline> The Prime Minister may think that ' he has at last succeeded in making his case absolutely plain, but he has not succeeded in' satisfying me that the departure made in this case in the administration of the Department was a proper one, or that the course that has been followed is not an extremely dangerous precedent for similar cases in future. </para>

                    <para>.- Although the Prime Minister has explained that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> went away on two different occasions, it must be remembered that both occasions related to the same subject. The Prime Minister's statement as to no expense at all being incurred was calculated to lead honorable members to believe that the Commonwealth would be put to no expense whatever.

                        <para>- I am discussing, not the appointment, but the printing of the report. And I will take this opportunity of saying that I attach, no blame to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> in the matter, nor do I want to discuss his qualifications or the merits of his appointment in any way. I merely want to refer to the breach of faith on 'the part of the Government. I wish to know who authorized this printing, and why it was done after the assurance of the Prime Minister that there would be no expense at all ? On the -30th August, 1907, when the honorable member for Dalley asked whether an amount was provided in the Supply Bill then before us for the report upon, patent medicines, drugs and foods, the Treasurer replied that lie did not know that anything had been paid in connexion with that report. When the honorable member for Dalley stated that it had been suggested that ¬£500 had been paid, the Treasurer replied that the Secretary to the Department knew nothing about it. Of course, the money was not paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale,</inline> but it was paid for the printing of the report. This . afternoon I was informed, in reply to a question upon notice, that no payment was made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> for his services, but that <inline font-style="italic">¬£68</inline> 5s. 4d. was reimbursed to him on the submission of a voucher showing that he had paid that sum for the making of blocks for illustrations. This case is similar to that referred to by the honorable member for Dalley. The gentleman who received payment in that case was not rewarded for his services, but was reimbursed expenditure. </para>

                    <para>.- The question under discussion is, not whether the report on secret medicines, cures, and foods should or should not have been printed,- but whether it should have been printed without reference to honorable members. The distinct undertaking was given by Ministers that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale'</inline> s investigation should not cost the Commonwealth anything. The Prime Minister informed us that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale's</inline> first visit to the Old Country had not cost anything, and that it was only in regard to it that the undertaking was given. T doubt if honorable members knew enough about the matter to distinguish between the first and second visit, or were aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> had on one occasion a letter of authority and on another a Royal Commission. We understood, however, that no expense was to be incurred by the Commonwealth. There were various opinions as to the advisability of sanctioning the inquiry, and had it been known that it would involve a large sum for printing, many honorable members would have had more to say about the matter. The printing of the report has cost over ¬£500, and the honorable member for Wentworth was therefore justified in drawing attention to the promise that no expense would be incurred. That promise was given on two or three occasions, in reply to specific questions. ' As late as last- August, when a Supply Bill was before us, the Treasurer said that neither he nor the Secretary to the Treasury knew anything about a payment having been made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale.</inline> Strictly speaking, that was correct except in so far as a payment of ¬£68 was made directly to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beale</inline> in respect of blocks purchased by him when in England for use in the printing of his report. The fact remains, however, that the House was told that this report would cost the Commonwealth nothing, whereas in respect of printing alone it has involved an expenditure of over ¬£500. The Prime Minister, however, took it upon himself to have the report printed, and since he led the House to believe that no expense would be incurred, he must shoulder the responsibility for that outlay. </para>

                    <para>. - 1¬∞ answer to the honorable member for Nepean, who first put the question to me, I may say that I have just consulted the Secretary to the Treasury, who is unable at a moment's notice to say that the money "was actually paid out of the Treasurer's Advance Account. If it was paid during the period under review, it must have been paid out of that account, since there is no other vote out of which it could have been met. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether there has been any hitch in connexion with the collection of the absolutely new duties recently imposed. As honorable members are aware, duties have been imposed in new ways. I understand, for instance, that in some cases duty is paid upon goods according to their weight ; goods of similar character but of varying weights are charged varying duties. Difficulty' has been experienced by the officers of the Department in determining in some cases the correct duty to be collected, and I should like to know if arrangements that are likely to be satisfactory have vet been made. </para>

                    <para>. - There is always a great deal of difficulty in administering a new Tariff, and especially one under which radical changes have been made. So far as 1 am aware, however, the officers of the Department have overcome, or are overcoming by degrees, the difficulties experienced in connexion with the Tariff, and everything is working smoothly. I shall be very pleased if any honorable member will point out where any friction is occurring, so that we may deal with it. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know whether the Minister has yet decided upon any course of action as to the acquisition of quarantine buildings in the different States. It is surely undesirable to take over properties, the situation of which is unsuitable, or sites that are too valuable to be put to such a use. For instance, the quarantine property in Sydney - which happens to be in my electorate - is very valuable, and the transferred cost must be very large. The questions arise whether it is necessary to have property in that position, and whether the whole of the area is required? Values have greatly increased of late; and, in view of the interest on the transferred properties, the cost of quarantine will appear to be considerably increased on a comparison between Commonwealth and States. These matters require attention before the properties are transferred. Some of the stations are, I believe, unsuitable; and some arrangement for- exchange might be made, seeing that the. States have nothing to lose, but, on the contrary, might gain. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall be glad to make a .note of what the honorable member  for North Sydney has said, because, to a large extent, I am in accord with him. Before the issue of the proclamation, it is our intention to seek the advice and assistance of those in authority in the States. It would be most undesirable to take over properties which are too valuable for the purpose, or are in other respects unsuitable. However, the States Governments have been administering quarantine for many years, and their interests are our interests ; and, as the question will be approached from a commonsense stand-point, I anticipate no difficulty. What has been said in regard to the quarantine ground' in Sydney is very true, and I shall be very glad to have the advice and assistance of the honorable member for North Sydney. Our only object is to make quarantine administration uniform for the benefit of the Commonwealth ; and I hope that, with the assistance and co-operation of the States, the transfer  will  be  amicably  accomplished. </para>

If there are now no Inter-State duties it is hard to understand why there should be a staff of collectors and clerks  on the border between New South Wales and Victoria. Altogether, it would appear that on the border there is an annual expenditure amounting practically to ¬£2,000 ; and I desire to know whether that is really necessary. What do these collectors find to do? </para>

                    CHAPMAN (Eden- Mona.ro - Minister of Trade and Customs) f7-5¬∞]- - The money referred to is for the payment of Customs officers, owing to the fact that there is an Inter-State trade, of which an account has to be kept. I am assured by officers that the utmost economy is practised and the expenses kept down as low as possible. It is essential, however, in the interests of the Department,  that those officers should be there.

                    <para>. - I hardly care to refer to the question of promotion in the- Public Service, seeing that we have a Commissioner who sees to such matters. I desire to say, however, in connexion with the examining officers of the Customs Department that, although they are usually men who have been trained specially in the course of years for their work, they find that others, possibly officers from the clerical branch, with eight or nine years' service, are promoted over the heads of men who have had 3 thirty years' experience. Conditions such as these are very much calculated to make a man do no more than his bare duty, and, indeed, I have heard that opinion expressed  in the past by a Judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- I was only endeavouring to ' show how detrimental it is' to the interests of the service when promotions are made which are felt to be unjust. The complaints on this score have been' very pronounced in connexion with the landing waiters. We cannot blame the Commissioner, because promotions are usually on the recommendation of a superior officer, who claims to be the best judge in a matter of this kind. There  are ' many qualifications other than fitness that lead to an officer's promotion. A man may be an irritable individual, and the officer above him may not like him. I know that in Victoria and New South .Wales there has been great discontent among the landing waiters because of the manner in which promotions are carried on. The Public Service Commissioner is placed in his position to see that justice is done. But still, he carries out, to a large extent, the recommendations of the heads of Departments. As a matter of fact, it has been known in the Customs Department, as well as in other Departments, that an officer has been placed over the head of a senior officer, and the first thing the superseded man has known of it has been when he has seen the notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> Then, perhaps, he inquires why the promotion has been made, and asserts his own fitness for the position. But he is told that it is unfortunate, but that the promotion  has now been gazetted, and nothing can be done. If that sort of thing is continued it will mean good-bye to the efficiency of the public service, and will be another nail in the coffin of the present system of the government of the Service by a Commissioner who is simply a Czar. If an officer is tq gain nothing by applying himself to his work, and if he is to have another man placed over his head, it will simply mean that officers will continue to do their bare duty and no more. That will certainly not be in the interest of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I myself have felt the force, of what the honorable member has said. An officer's fitness for promotion is very frequently a matter of opinion. But I can say this from my knowledge of the Department of Trade and Customs - that I cannot put my finger on any one particular case where there has been the shadow of suspicion of favoritism. There are many instances of alleged favoritism, which I have endeavoured to probe to the bottom, but when inquired into I found that there was no ground for complaint. The statistics of the Department show that since the establishment of Federation the number of officers has been decreased and the average rate of salary has been considerably Increased. I quite recognise that there are a large number of deserving officers, especially in the lower grades whose salaries I should like to see increased. It would be a very good thing if we could increase them, but in the aggregate it would involve such a large sum that it would be very difficult for the Public Service Commissioner to recommend increases. Of course recommendations for promotion have to come from the heads of Departments. If the honorable member knows of any case where there is the slightest suspicion of anything in the nature of favoritism, I should be glad to know of it. It is well in the interest of the service that we should probe such cases. If an officer thinks that he has been unfairly passed over, and is dissatisfied, that is not good for the service to which he belongs. But it is of no use to deal with this matter in a general way. We must have reference made to the particular cases. In the instances mentioned by the honorable member, as I said before, the Public Service Commissioner has reported that the officers promoted were senior. I feel sure that the heads of Departments are themselves only too anxious tb see that no suspicion of favoritism creeps in. From my knowledge of the officers of the Department, I can say that they have to work very hard, and often very long hours, for very small pay. I can say of them that they do their duty well and seem anxious to do their best!. I believe that in the Department of Trade and Customs we have officers as good as are to be found in any private establishment in the world. </para>

                    <para>.- -In connexion with division 42, relating to the vote f6r Queensland officers of the Department of Trade and ' Customs, shall I be in order in discussing the payment of the sugar bounties ? It seems to me that as the Queensland Collector of Customs is the officer who advises the Government in this matter, this would be a convenient and proper time. If, however, you think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that the discussion should be deferred until we deal with the subdivision relating to travelling expanses and temporary assistance, I shall bring it up then. </para>

                    <para>- I point out to the honorable member that we are getting into a method of dealing with Estimates that is not appropriate to their consideration in Committee. When the Budget is introduced and is discussed on the first item of the Estimates, it ls quite reasonable for any honorable member to discuss any particular item or matter of policy, but if we are going to have a discussion on matters of policy on any division in the Estimates, we shall go beyond what is the proper practice. If that were to be allowed, the honorable member will see that it would be possible for every question that can be imagined to be discussed on the Estimates. I take it that the division with which we are now concerned deals purely with the administration of the Department, and not with the collection of the sugar Excise or the payment of bounties. We are concerned purely with how the officers perform their duties. </para>

                        <para>-  On the point of order, I submit that as the Collector of Customs ir¬ª Brisbane is the official charged with the administration of the Department in Queensland, where the Excise duty is- being collected, I shall be in order in discussing the collection of that duty, and  incidental matters, on this division. If we are to be narrowed down to discussing the manner in which an officer discharges his duties, it will be utterly impossible to discuss . intelligently nine-tenths of the items on the Estimates. It is impossible, when we are dealing with 15,000 or 16,000 officers, for honorable members to be acquainted with the manner in which any particular one discharges his duties. Therefore, unless we are permitted to discuss, not the general question, but the question of how the Excise duty is collected under the superintendence of this particular individual, I am afraid that our discussion and consideration of the Estimates will be a mere matter of form. If you rule against rae now, I submit that on a later subdivision of division 42, namely, that pro1 </para>

                        <para>- As long as I am not narrowed down to the precise manner in which this officer discharges his duties I am perfectly content. I think that we ought not to proceed further with the Estimates of the Department of Trade and Customs until we know more about the collection of the Excise duties in Queensland, and more about the cost of collecting them and of distributing the bounty. I take it that the Government are largely influenced in regard to the estimates of revenue and as to the amount that will be paid away in bounties, by the information supplied by the Collector of Customs in Brisbane. In that case the Minister ought to favour the Committee with some information on that point before we go further. The present position of matters in relation to the sugar duties is, I submit, a menace to the taxpayers of Australia. The fact that out of a total revenue from sugar of ¬£746,000, ¬£580,000 is passing into the pockets of private individuals, is a serious matter. </para>

                        <para>- I hardly think that, sir,' because the question of the payment of bounties and the payment of Excise is fixed by law. Therefore it would be useless, if not irrelevant, for me to raise that question now. But I think that I may discuss incidentally the position of affairs, seeing that the policy of the Excise duties is involved in the expenditure we are now asked to vote. </para>

I think that I can discuss that. If we are to be narrowed down to the manner in which an individual is discharging his duties, and whether he is properly rewarded by the salary set opposite his title or not, we should be turning our consideration of the Estimates into something approaching a farce. </para>

                        <para>-  It is surely competent for an honorable member to present a point of view which may not have occurred to yourself or the honorable member for Coolgardie. I submit that, when we are considering the salary of an officer such as this, it is competent to give reasons why he should or should not be paid the amount allotted to him. If the honorable member for Coolgardie can show that the Collector of Customs for the State of Queensland has been guilty of conduct which does not justify the payment to him of his full salary, the honorable member will be within his rights in doing so. </para>

                        <para>- When called to order, I was about to add that the cost of collecting the- Excise - for which this officer is primarily responsible - amounts this year to¬£7,328. Although I cannot furnish proof that he, or any one connected with the Department, has been guilty of neglect of duty, I submit that we are entitled to consider whether one who has led the country into such heavy expenditure should continue to" receive the salary allotted to his office. I do not wish to refer, except incidentally, to the enormous burden which these duties impose on the people of Australia, or to the excessive, proportion which passes, not into the public Treasury, but into the pockets of private individuals. We should have an opportunity, if not  now, on  another occasion, to discuss the effect  of  this policy. When I commenced, I asked your opinion as to whether it would be better to have the discussion on this item',  or  on a later one, providing for the employment of temporary assistance, much '  of  which, no doubt, is required in the collection of the Excise duty. I hope that before we get any further the Minister will inform us what amount of Excise is likely to be collected this year. The figures placed before us were compiled some time ago,, and the Government should now be in possession of later statistics concerning the cost of collection, and the total amount likely to be collected. </para>

                        <para>- I have given the figures supplied to me.  The  total collections for the Commonwealth are estimated at ¬£746,000. As to the cost of collection, the Customs officers are, as far as possible, utilized to conduct the work attaching to the inspection of the sugar districts, the payment of bounty, and the collection of Excise. It is very diffi-' cult, except in the case of temporary officers, to divide salaries in accordance with ' the duties performed. No special statistics are available, but, although the work is so great, involving an expenditure in bounty amounting to ¬£573,000 during the present financial year, the general expenditure of the State has been increased through the sugar work by only 13s. 4d. per ¬£100 of revenue collected. Without the sugar work,- it would cost the Department ¬£4 11s. 5d. to collect ¬£100 of revenue, and with it the cost is ¬£5 4s. 9d. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad to see evidence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonald,</inline> of your attention to the business of the Committee, in your endeavours to confine honorable members to the item before the Chair, although your personal desire and inclination, no doubt, would be to give them every opportunity to ventilate grievances. The general debate closed when the first item was disposed of. As a rule, criticism of the Estimates is hostile to the Minister; but I wish to acknowledge the good work done by the boarding officers, and to suggest the strengthening of this branch, particularly in Queensland, but also in the other States. Last year, Parliament absolutely prohibited the importation of opium, and we require a stronger body of boarding inspectors and assistants to enforce that decision. Last year, provision was made for twenty boarding assistants in Queensland, but this year, notwithstanding that the work of these officers has been increased, only nineteen are provided for. We are suffering a loss of ¬£60,000 per annum in respect of duty formerly collected on opium, yet we find that it is still being introduced into the Commonwealth. It is only reasonable to assume that the smuggling which is going" on is due t'o the want of more officers in the Department. I am glad that the Minister of Trade and Customs has endeavoured to cope with the trouble. I should be out of order in referring to the local production of opium, but I desire to point out that the Minister should not be hampered in his efforts to prevent it being smuggled into Australia by the want of a sufficient number of assistants. A boarding inspector or boarding inspector's assistant to-day must have the capacity of a detective and the knowledge of a seaman. In order that' he may be properly qualified to search a vessel with a view of thwarting efforts to smuggle goods into the Commonwealth, he must have had a nautical training. The average landsman has no idea of the way in which goods can be secreted on board ship. We need men who have been before the mast to cope with the efforts of smugglers. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. This is a part of the service which is overlooked. The "position is the same in regard to examining officers. The more power we give the Minister to deal with commerce, the more assistants we need to give him. The other day, the honorable gentleman determined to issue a regulation prohibiting the importation of cornsacks above a certain size, and an increased staff will certainly be necessary to prevent the violation of that humane regulation.  . I  am glad that the Minister has determined to issue such a regulation; and I shall do all I can to strengthen his hands. If he had in his electorate, as I have, many men who earn only1s.1¬Ωd. per hour, he would recognise the necessity for appointing more examining officers to prevent the importation of cornsacks capable of holding more than  200 lbs. of corn. Then, again, as we have a high Tariff, the necessity for a full staff of officers is greater than ever. </para>

                        <para>- My desire is to point out that the Collector should have a full and efficient staff to protect the revenue. The higher the Tariff, the greater will be the inducement to smuggle, and the more pressing the need for a full staff of officers. In the past, too many Collectors have been in the habit of selecting the ordinary type of official . for the position of examining officer or boarding inspector. My own knowledge of seaports teaches me that men of nautical training are necessary for such positions, in order that smuggling may be put down. Valuable goods may  be  surreptitiously introduced into the Commonwealth in small quantities, and we need expert officers to cope with the evil. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member .for Robertson was rather hard on me just now when he insinuated that I did not know what I was talking about in -reference to the deduction of  ¬£200  in respect of the allowance made by the Department of External Affairs for service's rendered under the Immigration Restriction " Act. I told the honorable member that the amount had been debited to the Department of External Affairs, and was credited in this division. In support of my statement, I would draw his attention to division  16,  item  2,  of tha Estimates of the Department of External Affairs, in which  ¬£900  is provided for payment to the Customs Department in respect of services of officers under the Immigration Restriction Act. At page  61  of the Estimates of the Department of Trade and Customs, there is a deduction of  ¬£200  in respect of the allowance to be made by the Department of External Affairs for services so rendered in Queensland. At page  49,  we have  .¬£200  so deducted in respect of New South Wales; at page  55  a deduction of  ¬£200  in respect of Victoria; at page  65,  a deduction of  ¬£50  in respect of South Australia; and, at page  69,  a deduction of  ¬£256  in respect of Western Australia; making a total of  ¬£.900.  That being so, it is simply a matter of cross entries. I am pleased to be able to help the Minister to explain the item. </para>

According to the Auditor -' General, things are far from satisfactory in the Customs Department in South Australia; and I very much desire to know; not only if an audit staff will be appointed, but when inspectors will be provided, lt is necessary that there should be some supervision, if only for the sake of uniformity. But there are great complaints on the part of the Customs agents. It is said that the present system, without benefiting the Department, is a great inconvenience to the  agents. I do not know whether the method suggested by the agents would be safe or wise ; but, at any rate, they should not suffer any more inconvenience than is suffered elsewhere. </para>

                    <para>. - The matter of the audit staff is being considered. There is no doubt that some alteration should be made, and I hope to be able shortly to intimate what has been done. In regard to the change of the system as affecting the Customs agents, I have had representations made to me previously by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, the honorable member for Angas, and others. In addition, representations have been made by merchants, and the endeavour of the Department is, as far as possible, to meet the convenience of all those concerned. We always invite suggestions, because we desire the business to run smoothly, while taking care that the revenue does not suffer. Some changes, made during the absence of the late Minister in London, are now on their trial ; and, only to-day, the matter was before me. Our only desire is to do the best we can in a business way, and secure uniformity as far as possible, though, of course,' uniformity must not be pressed too far. The practice which may be good at one port may not be suitable to another ; and I think that the merchants and others are beginning to recognise that fact. I agree with the honorable member for Dalley that we should, as far as possible, strengthen our staff in view of the smuggling of opium and other commodities. Wherever there is a Customs House there will be smuggling; and the prohibition of opium makes the position very difficult when we remember the large numbers, especially those of one nationality, who will have it if possible. I quite agree that we must secure the men best fitted to perform duties which are all important ; at the same time, a ship may pass one port and be bailed up at another, with the result of the discovery of fraud. </para>

                        <para>- Although it is a fact that we are losing ¬£60,000 a year, I think it would be difficult to induce Parliament to reverse its decision in regard to the importation of opium. In my opinion, the greatest safeguard against fraud is the desire of the great bulk of merchants and traders to have honest dealings. They feel that, unless there is proper supervision and examination, they are in danger of competition at the hands of those who smuggle or obtain some undue advantage. Therefore, honest merchants and traders are always anxious to help the Customs authorities as far as possible. I shall have no hesitation in asking the Treasurer for advice .and assistance, in view of the fact that he has such a grip of the Customs Department, over which he so long presided. Every effort will be made in the directions indicated ; and we shall do our best to avoid any undue interference with the course of business, while, at the same time, conserving the public interest in the matter of revenue. </para>

                    <para>. - I am convinced that the Minister is filled with good intentions, and will, therefore, be quite prepared to give us full information in regard to the item of ¬£500 for law costs and the preparation of cases. I observe that last year while ¬£20 was voted on this account, a sum of ¬£4,359 was expended. The Minister of Trade and Customs is doing the best he can in the administration of the Department, and half the troubles are naturally not due to himself ; but, while he found his Department an Augean stable when he started, I am sure he will find its funds absolutely cleaned out, if he goes on to spend over ¬£4,000 when only ¬£20 has been voted. I should like to know what proportion of this expenditure was due to the preparation of cases, and how much was due to cases which were actually fried in Court. The honorable member for Hindmarsh raised this question! the other day on a motion for the adjournment of the House ; and I think the Government showed good cause for their action in that instance. But when there is such a discrepancy between the amount voted and the amounts spent, I think there is some  justification  for inquiry. How much of this  money  was due to the-  preparation of cases which were not proceeded with? </para>

                    <para>. - The discrepancy does look- rather extraordinary, but I have to inform honorable members that, when  ¬£20  was voted last year, we had no idea that great Customs frauds would call for investigation. Honorable members agree that when the frauds were discovered, my colleague was quite right in having them thoroughly investigated at whatever cost was necessary. However, we expect that a great deal of the law expenses incurred in South Australia will be recouped. </para>

But in some cases, where we succeed, we are recouped, though, in other cases; to win does not mean to get all the costs.

This is a matter in which we cannot tell what money will be required ; frauds might be discovered tomorrow, necessitating further expenditure, which, of course, would subsequently have to be sanctioned by Parliament. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister has not really answered my main question, which was as to how much of the expenditure had been incurred in preparing cases not subsequently proceeded with. That is the main concern with Parliament, because we are anxious to prevent frauds on the revenue. If the whole of this expenditure has been on cases in which the Courts were actually invoked, well and good ; but if a portion has been spent- in making general inquiries, which, for some reason or other, of which we know nothing, did not result in prosecutions, it is rather a serious state of affairs; and the Committee is entitled to some information. Here is an instance where we have a charge for law costs and the preparation of law cases,  ¬£4,000.  I want to know what the costs were, and what the cost of preparation was ? </para>

It was clearly shown the other day that the cases were not given up by the Department. The parties against whom we were proceeding pleaded guilty. Honorable members watch these cases pretty closely, and they know that there is a good answer to be given in all these instances. While I have not all the figures here, I take it that very little of this expenditure has been incurred in cases that have been dropped by the Department. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that a change has been initiated in regard to Customs duties claimed from oversea ships. I should like to ask the Minister whether such a change has been initiated, and, if so, what the exact effect of it is? Formerly, of course, every barber's shop on a mail steamer had to have all its odds and ends counted, and then duty had to be paid on what was taken out before the ship left . Australia again. I am informed that a slight change has been made in the method of collecting duties, and that now the' only things for which the Department looks for duty are those of a highly dutiable character, such as scents. I wish to know what the change is, as the- matter is of some importance. </para>

                        <para>- It is only reasonable to suggest to the Minister that we are entitled to know what changes have been made in the. administration of the Department. This is a matter that does not affect the mere policy of any particular officer, but is a change that I suppose has been made as the result of an alteration of Ministerial policy. The Minister ought to be able to tell us what has been done. I am not asking for more information than the Committee is entitled to have. </para>

                    <para>.- Some of the items under the heading of contingencies have grown very largely. Last year the total vote was ¬£3,730. This year it is ¬£4,910. This is only one instance of the growth of expenditure under the heading of contingencies. It is going on throughout the service, and is quite distinct from an increase in salaries, which proceeds by the .ordinary method prescribed by. the Public Service Act. The expenditure is largely on account of office requisites. Every Department seems to have made a greater demand for these purposes, and seems to have spent a great deal more money than was asked for. In view of the fact "that we have ahead of us considerable expenditure on Defence and railway construction between State and State, the transfer of the Northern Territory, and increased postal facilities, I think that we might be more careful in watching the outflow of the pence. Here we have for instance an increased expenditure on postage and telegrams. I should not be in order in referring back to divisions with which we have dealt, but I may remark that the expenditure under this heading has largely increased in all the Departments. There must be an end to this sort of thing. This is not a case of increasing expenditure through the employment of more .officers. It is a .case of increasing expenditure through the embossing of. letter paper and envelopes, and a number of things like that. I do not think the Department ought to be extravagant in this direction. Care should be taken to economize in these respects if the affairs of the Commonwealth are to be managed in a reasonable manner. </para>

We are dealing with a considerable increase of business, and therefore we must expect to incur more expenditure on postage and telegrams. There is an increase of ¬£50 under that heading in this instance. Every care is taken to see that there is no extravagance. </para>

                    <para>.- I am surprised at the explanation offered by the Minister. He says that increased business means increased postage and telegrams. But we find that last year the expenditure for these purposes in South Australia was ¬£432, whilst the estimate for the present year is ¬£400 - a decrease of ¬£32.  Evidently the Minister believes that business is not going to increase. I hope that he will not be pessimistic, but at the same time he should see to it that economy is rigidly enforced in these details of Departmental expenditure. Anything you like can be spent on embossing letters and envelopes. The Minister is usually optimistic in his views. I am therefore astonished at his saying, as he does in these Estimates, that since not so much money will be required in South Australia for postage and telegrams this year, as was required last year, there is, inferentially, to be a decrease of business ! I sincerely hope, however,  v  that the Minister will harden his heart, and see that the most rigid economy" is practised in regard to these details. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Wentworth is hardly so logical as he usually is, nor is he justified in suggesting that the explanation which I gave was not a good one. If he had been following the discussion on the schedule closely - as he ' generally does - he would know that the Treasurer does not anticipate such a large amount of revenue next year as was received during the past year: When the honorable member becomes a better protectionist, he will know that one of the effects of a good Tariff is not to increase business in the way of importations. That is the reason why we have not asked for so large an amount cf money for postage and telegrams as was spent last year. It may please the honorable member to bait me about these details, but it does not look well in- cold print to have him charging me with not showing honesty of purpose because I do not put down ¬£500 or ¬£600 for postage and telegrams when I am advised by my responsible officers that ¬£400 will be sufficient. </para>

                    <para>. - I am compelled to continue to endeavour to elicit information from the Minister. Now his attitude is this : A good Tariff, he assures us, decreases business ; and he was referring to business in connexion with postage and telegrams. This is evidence that the Tariff recently passed is superlatively bad, because the estimated expenditure of the Department on this item last year was ¬£350 and the actual expenditure ¬£432. This is his own admission. I only hope that he meant what he said. </para>

                    <para>.- In this, as in other Departments, attention must be directed to the largeness of the increases. I do not know whether it is the practice of this Department, as I have reason to believe it to be the practice in other Departments - to use the telegraph unnecessarily, merely to save the trouble of letter writing. If officers leave to-day's work over until to-morrow because they can then use the telegraph, the expense of administration must be increased. Generally speaking, the heads of the Customs Department cannot be charged with extravagance. On the contrary, considering the efficiency of their officers and the amount of the revenue, if any charge lies against them, it is that of cheese-paring. The Minister has admitted that in the near future we must expect a large decrease in the revenue from Customs duties. If that comes about, the reduction in trade will require a reduction in the staff of the Department and in its cost. The amount asked for contingencies this year is ¬£4,910. Last year only ¬£3,730 was voted, though the actual expenditure was larger. Only ,¬£20 was voted for law costs and the preparation of cases, but the actual expenditure was ¬£4,359, and if similar law costs have to be incurred this year, the expenditure on contingencies will not be less than ¬£10,000. However, as Supply for only two months of the financial year remains unvoted, we cannot do much more than protest against unnecessary increases, in the hope that the expenditure for the forthcoming year will be reduced. </para>

Horses are now bred in the Northern Territory, and might be bred there in greater numbers to the immense advantage of the Commonwealth and of the Empire. Has the Minister considered the exportation I speak of in connexion with the defence proposals of the Government? I merely wish to point out the need for checking it in some way, unless it is intended to leave unhorsed many of the mounted regiments which it is proposed to incorporate in our Defence Forces. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that a proper rebuke has been administered to . the honorable member. If such a duty as I propose were imposed, the exportation of horses and mares would have to be regulated with regard to our local requirements, and the countries to which it was proposed To export. If action were taken in this direction, Australia would largely benefit. The sort of horses required for cavalry purposes can, perhaps, well be bred in the limestone country north of the Macdonnell Ranges, to supply not only the requirements of the Australian Defence Forces, but of the King's Forces throughout the Empire. Every military nation in Europe nowadays breeds horses on a large scale under Government supervision, and carefully regulates the export of stock and the importation of new blood. If we in Australia are to have a large defence force, we must do the same, and might very well work in conjunction with the Imperial Government. Land in large areas can probably be obtained more cheaply in the Northern Territory than elsewhere, and would certainly be available if the control of the Territory were- transferred to the Commonwealth. I ask the Minister to take into his consideration the exportation of brood mares to which I have referred and the suggestions which I have made, so that if the Ministry bring in their ill-matured defence proposals, they may not be lacking in the one essential of a mobile mounted force - horses. The Minister should note the seriousness of this export to Japan and the East. </para>

                    <para>. - I have a question of some importance to put to the Minister, and have no doubt that his attention has been directed to it on more than one occasion. I refer to the steps taken to secure identity of decision in the different States in regard to the classification of imports. There were complaints that imports were classified in one State under a certain heading, whilst in another State they were classified under a different heading. I recognise the difficulty of securing identical and rapid decisions over so large an area as the Commonwealth comprises ; but I understood, when a: complaint was previously made, that steps were to be taken to remove the trouble. I have heard it stated that the Government intend to appoint an Inspector-General ; but I do not know whether that proposal has any relation to an attempt to secure identity and rapidity of classification in the different States. The question is highly important. I should like to know whether the difficulties caused by these varying determinations have been to any extent overcome, and whether there is any proposal to still further facilitate the giving of prompt and identical decisions ? </para>

                    <para>. - So far as possible, we have endeavoured to cope with the difficulties to which the honorable member has referred. One can readily understand that troubles of this kind are likely to arise when one remembers the number of decisions that have to be given. The decisions already given under the new Tariff probably amount to over10,000, and further steps are necessary to bring about the desirable reform which the honorable member has mentioned. It is proposed to make an effort to secure it by the appointment of three inspectors, who will be able to visit every Customs port in Australia at least once in twelve months; but their visits to the more important ports will be far more frequent. After the Tariff has been disposed of by Parliament, the Comptroller General, who is an officer of wide experience and great ability, will be able to visit the chief centres, with the object of bringing the various decisions into uniformity, and promoting rapidity of decision. The question of the appointment of three inspectors is under the consideration of the Public Service Commissioner. We hope to secure for this work young, bright, energetic men, well versed in Customs procedure, and trust that their efforts, coupled with those of the Comptroller-General, will bring about the desired change. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that owners of coastal steamers trading between Perth, Wyndham, and Singapore, are differentiating between ports and between traders at various places. Some time ago, persons on the north-west coast were being served with produce by traders at Geraldton, but the steamship companies trading from Fremantle along the coast actually refused to take cargo . from Geraldton. I brought the matter under the attention of the Postmaster-General, who obtained from the Crown Solicitor an opinion that, under the mail contract, the owners of these vessels are not compelled to carry goods from port to port. I desire that the Minister shall direct the attention of the Collector of Customs to the practice, in order that steps may be taken for its abolition. The Post and Telegraph Department, under the mail contract, has no power to compel these vessels to take goods from one port to another; it can simply direct 'that if passengers or goods' are carried, not more than certain rates shall be charged. The position is rendered the more serious by the fact that these steamers afford the only means of transit along the coast. They enjoy an absolute monopoly. I am not sure what power the Minister possesses in this regard, but he ought to be able to devise a scheme to prevent steam-ship companies from boycotting the traders of any port. The opinion of the Crown Solicitor reads as follows - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>The contract is for a mail service, but . . . does not, in my opinion,' compel the contractor to take all the goods offered for Geraldton or any other port. Sometimes it may be impossible to carry all that is offered at all the ports for all the ports in a vessel the size of the vessels employed in this service, and the contractor must exercise his discretion in selecting what he. will take or leave. </para>
                    <para>The contract, in my opinion, allows the con-' tractor to decide what cargo he will take for any port, so long as he carries such cargo as he reasonably can carry for any port, and he is only limited to the amount to be charged for the cargo he does carry. </para>
                    <para>I am therefore of opinion the facts mentioned, admitting they are true, do not show that any breach of the contract has been committed by the contractor ; and I do not think any contractor would undertake to carry on every trip all the cargo offered at all the ports for all the ports. The laws as to overloading would sometimes prevent him carrying out the contract if he did so. </para>
                    <para class="block">I read that opinion only to show that the Post and Telegraph Department cannot come to the assistance of the people of the north-west, who are now relying upon the Minister of Trade and Customs to help them. It is intolerable that these vessels, having an absolute monopoly, should differentiate between one port and another. No one could defend such a policy. If they had no available space, the position would be different; but on the up journey from Fremantle to the north-west, they rarely carry a. full cargo. The opinion of the people concerned is that these tactics have been resorted to because of a. desire on the part of the steam-ship owners to transfer the trade from Geraldton to Fremantle. The Minister should have power to compel their vessels to take cargo at any port of call for any other port at which they touch, provided, of course, that they have space for it, and that the consignees are prepared to pay the ordinary rates. The ship-owners concerned would benefit by the transfer of the trade of Geraldton to Fremantle, since the latter is practically a day's further sail from Broome. Geraldton is the natural port, or, at any rate, the trading centre for the north-west, and it ought not to be deprived of its geographical advantages by the tactics of any shipping company. I make the recital of the facts as brief as possible, feeling sure that it is only necessary to state them to win the sympathy of the Minister and the Committee for the people who are being penalized. </para>

I understand that a few years ago the Western Australian Government charged less freight on goods which were carried over Government lines and intended for shipment on the Government steamers, than was charged on goods which were intended to be shipped on vessels belonging to some competing line. This question was brought before the House as constitutional point some years ago, and 1 desire to know whether the practice is continued. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member's' recollection of the facts is somewhat  topsy-turvy.  A private ' railway company has a line between Midland Junction and Walkaway, and they ' charged excessive prices to the people of the Murchison gold-fields for the carriage of  goods from Perth to Cue. After repeated and vain efforts to induce the railway company to reduce their rates' to reasonable limits, the Government put on a' steamer, I think the <inline font-style="italic">Julia Percy,</inline> and ran goods from Fremantle to Geraldton, and thence on the Government line to Cue. These are the facts so far as I remember. </para>

I have read_the Prime Minister's celebrated speech with the pleasure which that gentleman's speeches always afford, but I cannot find out from that speech what the Government intentions are in regard to the militia system. In the first part of the speech, for instance, I saw that the militia system is to be abolished. </para>

                        <para>- Absorbed, much in the sense, I suppose, that the honorable member for Lang was nearly absorbed by the crocodile - that is, a kind of absorption that is practically destruction. Then in another part of the speech we are told that the Prime Minister's intention is to . elevate the status of the militia, and we have a right to know what he is going to do - absorb or elevate? Is the elevation to be by means, of a bomb, or by some more gentle process? </para>

                        <para>- That does not get us any " forrader." A Bill may be introduced at the fag end of the session, or a measure of glorious proportions and somewhat uncertain details may be brought down just when we are in the midst of the enthusiasm incidental to the visit of the American fleet. I am as full of martial enthusiasm as is even the honorable member for Corio, but these are matters I prefer to deal with in cold blood ; and, therefore, I suggest that it would be better to report progress now. Personally, I have no desire to impede the passage of the Estimates, nor do I think such a desire is shared by honorable members on this side. It is only courteous, however, to the House in a matter of such importance, to give an opportunity for a rational discussion. </para>

                    <para>.- What would be the use of honorable members coming prepared to discuss these Estimates when, as a matter of fact, all the money has practically been expended. This is only another instance of the evil' of Supply Bills. Here, in Estimates involving large sums of money, we have no power of revision, inspection, or suggestion. Ten  months of the financial year have already expired, and we have no power whatever over this expenditure of some ¬£700,000 odd. We can, however, obtain from the Minister some definite statement as to the time when we may expect the Defence Bill to be introduced. I did hope, after the elaborate speech of the Prime Minister a few months ago, that this session would not be allowed to close without our having dealt with this matter. The Prime Minister placed before honorable members a novel idea as to policy, not of his own, but of the Cabinet, and based on expert advice. When I made some inquiry as to the cost, the honorable gentleman informed me that the calculations were not his, but were those of officers of the Defence Department. From that day until now we have noticed the Minister of Defence taking his part, and the Prime Minister taking more than his part, in the affairs of the Department. I desire to know when we are likely to have the Defence Bill introduced, and whether it will be laid before us contemporaneously with the Estimates next year? An intimation such as I desire would simplify the position, and, I am sure, facilitate business. I draw attention to the fact that upon these Estimates there is an increase for 1907-8 over 1906-7 of ¬£89,000. I should like the Minister to explain upon what lines that increase is warranted. It may not be a good thing to remind him of past promises, but one of the strongest arguments for Federation placed before the people seven or eight years ago was that by the abolition of the six separate systems of defence that existed in pre-Federal days, the expenditure would be greatly reduced. But the fact is that the expenditure to-day is much larger than it ever was before. I am not here to argue that there is no warrant for this increase. But certainly there is no evidence of an inclination to carry out the promise that was made to the people that we should have a more efficient defence service at a reduced cost. We necessarily have to rely to a great extent upon our expert officers as to the necessity for the amounts which we are asked to vote. We are not in a position to know whether the expenditure is warranted or not. The civil authority cannot say whether the sums required are extravagant. Even the political head of the Department is very little more versed in these matters than ordinary members are. However good the information which he supplies to us may be, and however laudable his intentions may be, the military heads of the Department are the only persons who can give us satisfactory assurances with regard to ninety-nine items out of a hundred in connexion with the Defence Department. Indeed, the only true test of whether our defences are efficient in the test of war. Australia has never yet been plunged into war, and I hope she never will be. But without that test we have to take things on trust. We cannot discuss these Estimates without having regard to the new defence policy of the Government. When is that policy to be dealt with by the House? We were told by the Prime Minister in his defence speech that the present political head of the Department was an enthusiast of the warmest kind, and that no man who had been at the head of the Defence Department had the details at his 'fingers' ends to such a degree as the present Minister has. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister spoke of the honorable gentleman in even more eulogistic terms than I can do. Personally I regret that the Minister of Defence surrendered his responsibilities in allowing the Prime Minister to declare the defence policy of the Government. Although the speech was most eloquently delivered, it ought to have come from the Minister himself. </para>

                        <para>- I was surprised that such a stickler for propriety as the Minister did not insist upon delivering the speech outlining the policy of the Government. Here, however, we have an increase ¬∞f ¬£89&gt;¬∞¬∞¬∞&gt; and the least that the Minister can do is to explain why it is necessary. It cannot be said that this is a party question. It can be approached without the slightest idea of party feeling. If anything concerns the people of Australia as a whole, it is the defence of their country. Whatever criticisms are presented are not hostile to the Minister personally. We merely seek for information as to these large increases. It is a matter of surprise to me, too, that the naval are out of all proportion to the military Estimates. For the purposes of a sea-bound continent like ours, the provision for naval defence ought to be larger proportionately to that made for military defence. I should like to see the Government pay more attention to the naval side of the question, and less to the military side. The naval expenditure this year is ,¬£60,000 - and that for a continent with a coast-line of  8,000  miles and with an enormous volume of commerce, which is growing out of .'proportion to that of any other country in the world. Our coastal trade is also very large. If there is to be efficient defence at all, or if there is any danger of invasion, it does not seem to me that our naval provision is sufficient. The military expenditure is ¬£614,000, whilst we propose to spend only ¬£60,000 on naval defence. </para>

                        <para>- If the approximate cost is given to us it will be sufficient. The' Prime Minister in his speech. tried to make us believe that all these new plans would be carried out for practically the same money as has hitherto been expended. When I asked him whether the figures were his own, he said " God forbid; they are not." I certainly was not satisfied that the new scheme could be carried out for the same expenditure as in 1906-7. I do not blame the experts for asking for increased expenditure. There is no science that is so little exact in regard to its estimates as is military science. The estimates are always more or less speculative. The Minister does not know whether they are or are not sufficient. He may be told by his officers that we have, for example, for its size, the best equipped transport service in the world ; but we know that if suburban butchers, bakers, and grocers could not convey supplies to our encampments, the result would be disastrous. We have certainly not an efficient transport service. However, it. is fatuous to suggest  any improvements on the present system. The only thing I can hope for is to elicit information from the Minister. The honorable member for Wentworth made a good point when he said that the Ministry would probably be astute enough to. take advantage of the enthusiasm caused by the visit of the American fleet to launch their defence scheme. A man with a cork eye, as they say in Queensland, could see that they could not, in their own interest, take a better occasion. We do not wish the matter to be pushed through in that way, however, though I should be glad if whatever enthusiasm results has the effect of increasing our naval expenditure. Many interesting subjects could be dealt with on these Estimates; but they are better reserved for another occasion. We have to find out what arm of the Defence Force is weakest, and most requires attention, and how we can get most return for our expenditure. The true test of an army's efficiency is warfare. To render our forces efficient in war, I would gladly vote any reasonable sum. </para>

                        <para>- If a lest proved that our military service had been starved, the Labour Party would be the first to find fault. According to some honorable members, there is no need for a Defence Force ; but I am conservative enough to take the opposite view. I do not regard the whole world as my brother, and in time of trouble I should like to see the British peoples predominate. I do not cavil at the administration of the honorable member for Richmond, who, perhaps, has done better than his predecessors, though, very likely, the same thing will be said of the man who follows him. The political head of the Defence Department who wishes to introduce new ideas has a sorry time, because he has to rely so completely on his expert advisers. Probably, however, a shrewd man. like the present Minister, can distinguish true experts from those who are only advertised as such. I do not see why the properly trained Australian soldier should not be as good as any in the world. Australians excel in law, medicine, and many other walks of life, and I do nor see why, if properly trained, the active-brained Australian should not excel in the art of war. I am not one of those who think that we can get good officers only by importing them. It would be a good thine: to obtain from Great Britain a general officer who had had actual experience in war. We might very well, say to the Old Country : " We are part of the Empire, and wish to make our defences as good as they can be. If you Will send as the most capable officer you can spare, we will entrust to him the funds necessary to put our defence in perfect order, according "to his lights." If we accept the services of such a man, we must rely wholly on him. The strong mind must dominate, and I cannot think it possible that satisfaction can be obtained under a system which makes a master mind inferior to a board or council. I would rather have the blunders of such a man together with his excellencies than the inefficiency of a council. </para>

                    <para>. - As the honorable member for Dalley has pointed out, supply has already been voted for ten months of the current financial year, and therefore these Estimates are not of much importance. Expenditure incidental to the new defence scheme cannot receive consideration until that scheme has obtained Parliamentary approval. It is a matter for the future, though it will be dealt with as early as the state of public business will permit. While at times we may quarrel bitterly, and- may profess to think very little of each other politically, in the back of every man's brain there is the desire to do the best for the country, and I am sure that honorable members will not allow their political leanings to operate to the detriment of her welfare. I have been in Opposition, and know the tendency to believe that everything a Government does is wrong ; but the defence of a country is too serious for any honorable member to trifle with. I have been long enough at the head of the Defence Department to justly appreciate the present position. .Were I not constrained by my sense of obligation to the country, I would not face the labour, vexation, and worry which the introduction of a . new defence scheme must entail. The task taxes to the utmost one's physical and mental vigor, but it is worth doing, and, although personally I should be glad to leave office to-morrow, I hope to remain there long enough to do something towards placing our defence in a sounder and more wholesome condition. No man could see what I have seen without being obsessed bv the need for reform, and appealing to every party to forget party obligations in considering the question. The honorable member for Dalley has stated that the ¬£65,000 expended on local naval defence is inadequate. Under the new defence proposals of the Government, the expenditure in the first year after the approval of the scheme will be ¬£350,000, in the next year ¬£414,000, and in the year following that ¬£471,000, while on the land forces the expenditure will be in the respective years ¬£789,000, ¬£796,000, and ¬£819,000, an increase of approximately ¬£100,000 on the present Estimates.' The vote for the instructional staff this year is ¬£2,000 more than was expended last year. Every one 'will agree that our forces require more instruction. The increased <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> in the Permanent Forces is to provide the necessary staff to instruct the Citizen Forces and to properly look after rifle ranges, stores, and equipment. The Estimates also provide for an increase of ¬£4,451 in connexion with the Militia Forces, the object being to complete the existing units and to provide the requisite men for the field and machine guns already in the Commonwealth. It is. obvious that if we have machine guns we must have competent men to look after them. There is an increase of ¬£431- in respect of the Volunteer Forces, and an increase of ¬£6,160 in respect of camps and schools of instruction. This increase is to provide for the largely-increased number of men attending camp, and I am sure that honorable members general lv are desirous of our camps of training being more largely availed of. In respect of the maintenance of existing arms and equipment there is an increase of ¬£4,898, and an increase 01 ¬£2'336 in the item relating to artillery ammunition. We have a magnificent arm in the i8i-pounder, and it is imperative that our men should receive more training in its handling. </para>

                        <para>- That is a question that might well be asked. The modern18¬Ω pounder is a very fine weapon. Generally speaking, experts; if questioned on the subject, declare that it takes years to make a gunner. Whether that is so or not I am satisfied that our gunners need more opportunities for training than they have had. The honorable member for Corio, like myself, has doubtless known members of the militia to excel our permanent men in field practice. </para>

                        <para>- If a man, instead of making a good display in his front window, keeps all his goods in a cellar, he is not likely to do much trade. To return again to the review of the Estimates, it will be found that there is a decrease of ¬£19 in respect of small arm ammunition, whilst there is an increase of ¬£1,310 in regard to general contingencies, that increase being necessary to provide for expansion of forces. The items relating to railway and steamer fares and freight show an increase of ¬£1,205, to provide for increased <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> and a greater number of inspections, as well as for additional training. Then, again, it will be noted that there is an increase of ¬£20,055 under the heading of Cadet Corps. The Prime Minister has already stated that for the next three years an additional sum of ¬£20,000 will be spent upon the Cadet Forces. </para>

                        <para>- Absolutely. There must be longer training for the artillery. In Australia people generally have much regard for the mounted infantry. The horse, however, is valuable only as a means of rapidly transferring the infantry from one point to another. Ian Hamilton declares that the cavalry in the Russo-Japanese war - I am not referring to mounted infantry - were valuable frequently- because they got to a given point before 'the infantry, and were able to prepare meals for them. </para>

                        <para>- I have endeavoured to ascertain why the British War Office authorities made such a singular mistake as to refuse in the first instance the offer of Australian mounted infantry, but have been unable to obtain any satisfactory information on the point. The artillery will play an important part in future wars, and unless we have first-class men behind our guns, we might almost as well be without them. The next necessity is a considerable augmentation of our infantry. </para>

                    Unquestionably. The Government has taken very definite action in regard not only to obtaining equipment, but in providing for its local production, as well as for the local manufacture of cordite. Our policy is to establish a rifle factory and also a cordite factory in Australia, and, having regard to our. remoteness from the great producing countries of the old world, the establishment of such factories here is eminently desirable. I do not know that it is necessary for me to offer any further, observations at the present stage. These Estimates are really Dead Sea fruit, since the financial' year to which they relate has almost expired. Before any change is proposed by the Government honorable members will have so ample an opportunity of discussing it that I am sure they will be satisfied that the Ministry has dealt fairly with them. In these circumstances,' I had hoped that the Estimates of the Department would be passed to-night.
