                        <para>Kerang is suffering at the present time from departmental disorganization. It was decided to give Kerang a local service, and an officer was sent up to make . all the necessary arrangements. Subsequently, a line foreman was instructed to carry out the work, and he went to Kerang with all possible speed. But when he got on the spot he found that the engineer who planned the new service had omitted to obtain the poles required. The line foreman had to return to Melbourne without really fulfilling his mission, and an inspector was sent up to set things right. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member was good enough to inform me that he proposed to ask this question. I find that the paragraph, instead of being correct, is about as incorrect as it could possibly be. The first duty devolving upon those who petitioned for the exchange some months ago, has not yet been carried out, but the Department is pushing on with the work. The delay has been caused by the destruction of the whole of the material required for this work in. the fire which took place some time ago. We have had to await further consignments. The official reply is as follows - </para>

                        <para>With regard to the paragraph in to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> referring to the Kerang Telephone Exchange, I beg to report for your information that an application was received from the local Progress Association on 26th July, 1907, for the establishment of an exchange, with 38 subscribers. An Assistant Engineer visited Kerang early in August, and collected all necessary data. Up to 4th December, 1907, only three of the 38 intending subscribers had paid their rents. The fire which occurred in Wallach&#39;s Buildings on 30th November, 1907, destroyed all stocks of line material, and nothing could be done for the Kerang service until the stocks were replenished, which took place about the middle of February, 1908. In the Engineer&#39;s original report, 42 new poles were allowed for. These poles were supplied under contract in December, 1907. All these poles are at Kerang. In addition nine (9) extra 35-ft. poles were recently forwarded from Melbourne to meet the demands for extra services and alterations. It is now found that 20 (twenty) additional poles are required. These poles are being specially obtained under &#34; local offers,&#34; and are expected to be delivered in14 days&#39;. . The work at Kerang has been in progress for two or three weeks, and the men are still working there. In this respect, it may &#39;be mentioned that up to 17th March, 1908, only nine of the intending subscribers had paid their rentals, as required ; but it was directed that the work should nevertheless be proceeded with, even although the rentals of the remaining twenty-seven intending subscribers had not been paid, or their agreements signed. The line foreman engaged in the work has not left Kerang since he went there. </para>

In this particular instance, the assertion which the honorable member alleges or implies by his question was not made bv me. I pointed out that at no time had any financial scheme been decided on by this House, nor had it even been discussed, except by individual members at times, and that I was assuming that the scheme which was suggested would be favourably considered by honorable members, only from my general knowledge of their views on this subject. </para>

No proposals for any alteration of the boundary have been submitted to us. If any are made, of course, they will be considered. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation in reference to a statement I made yesterday, and in answer to an interjection as to the financial proposals of the right honorable member for Swan while he was Treasurer of the present Administration. My statement, I observe, has led to some misunderstanding ; and I desire to briefly call attention to the fact that the proposals referred to are those which were first made in the Budget statement of  1906-7.  After that Budget statement, the&#39; Government introduced a Constitution Alteration Bill as , its complement, which passed through this Chamber, but failed to pass in another place, because of the absence of an absolute majority by one vote or so. The effect of that Bill, had it been passed, would have been to enable us before  19 10  to apply certain Customs revenue to any purpose the Commonwealth thought fit, the Government having distinctly stated from the first that its object in introducing the Bill was to enable them to make immediate provision for old-age pensions ; but, owing to the rejection of that Bill, the referendum could not be taken. To deal with these pensions before  1910  was our consistent policy throughout. The next Conference of Premiers took place at Melbourne in October,  1906.  I do not propose to read extracts, but if honorable members who are interested will read page  52  of the official report, they will find that I then laid before the Premiers a proposal to alter, the Constitution in that regard prior to  1910.  A report of a discussion on that proposal will be found on page 53. Our purpose was the same, namely, the dealing with old-age pensions. On page  114  honorable members will find that the proposal was favorably discussed by the representatives of the States,: in fact, the question of old-age pensions occupied more attention at that Conference than any other subject. On page  116  honorable members will see that the relation of this proposal to the taking over of the whole of the debts is also insisted on; and on page  127  it will be seen that, after  a  long debate, and in consequence of my representation on behalf of the Government, the following resolution was carried and added to those which had been submitted by the Treasurer </para>

                            <para>- The Brisbane Conference was held in May,  1907  ; but the Premiers then took up the same set of resolutions that had been considered at Melbourne - taking them up exactly as they had been left at the previous Conference. They did not recommence as fresh conferences do, but continued the deliberations of the previous Conference. That is why I alluded to the proposals having been made with the substantial object of at once dealing with the question of old-age pensions, that is prior to  19 10.  This was an important part of our policy. The right honorable member for Swan, by interjection, stated that his scheme did not contain any such proposition. In a strict sense, perhaps, as to the proposals which he himself tabled, his statement is. perfectly true; but in the sense that I, as head of the Government, asked for and obtained this further resolution from the States Premiers, which was again before the Premiers when he met them in Brisbane, my statement is correct. It is quite true that the proposal did not emanate from my honorable friend, but it did emanate from the Government - it was placed before the States Premiers at the Conference held in Melbourne, at which I was present, and it was again before them in the Conference held at Brisbane while I was  in  London. </para>

                            <para>- My statement was that our proposals were made originally with a view to obtaining the power to deal with old-age pensions before 1910. That was embodied in the resolutions which were put before the Conference at Brisbane. Whilst the right honorable member for . Swan may be technically correct in saying that this one purpose was  not  included in his own proposals, the fact re-  mains that it was attached to his proposals and at my request as head of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to make a few observations by way of personal explanation. Whilst the Prime Minister was speaking yesterday I interjected that in the proposals which I submitted to this House in my Budget Speech on 31st July, 1906, and which were afterwards submitted to the Premiers&#39; Conference in Melbourne, in October, 1906, no mention was made of anticipating the withdrawal of the Braddon section - section 87 of the Constitution. Those proposals, which were indorsed by the Government, would not have taken effect until after the end of 1910. I am well aware that some months after the Budget containing the proposals of the Government had been introduced, the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Government, proposed to submit to a referendum of the electors of the Commonwealth an alteration of. the Constitution by which the Braddon section would have been amended so as to permit of provision being made for old-age pensions before the end of 1910. The. Bill dealing with the matter was approved by this House, but failed to command the necessary majority in the Senate, and, therefore, was not referred to a referendum of the people. </para>

                            <para>- I have no recollection of any proposal being made at Brisbane in reference to it other than that put forward by the States&#39; Premiers themselves. I certainly submitted no such proposal, and had no authority to do so. I did not know whether or not the Prime Minister intended to again ask Parliament to deal with section 87 of the Constitution. Therefore, I was perfectly accurate in the interjection which I made yester day. However, I do not desire to labour the matter. All I wish to say is that the amendment of section 87 of the Constitution prior to the end of the year&#39; 1910, when it becomes alterable, to enable the Commonwealth to impose special duties for the purpose of defraying the cost of a Federal system of old-age pensions, was not included in the scheme introduced by me as Treasurer, on behalf of the Government, in my Budget of 1906. </para>

If the practice of one honorable member questioning another is permitted to continue, I fear that it will open up a very wide field, indeed. </para>

                        <para>- Officially, the Standing Orders cannot be regarded as temporary, having&#39; been adopted seven . years ago in the way- that standing orders intended to remain permanently in force would be adopted. They are the Standing Orders for the time being, and are effective in every sense of the word. In view of the wording of No. 92, I do not think it can be said that they are silent on this question. That standing order does not read exactly as the honorable, member quoted it. He omitted the last few words, which are important in their bearing on the particular point which has been raised. The standing order says - </para>

Had I had the latter part of standing order 92 before me yesterday afternoon, I should not have permitted the honorable member for Werriwa to put his question without notice to the honorable member for Fawkner ; but, having permitted that to be done, I did not exclude the question on notice from to-day&#39;s business-paper, nor shall I refuse to allow it to be put. After it has been put and answered - should the honorable member for Fawkner wish to answer it - the rule to which my attention has been called will be given effect to. </para>

                            <para>- My. reply to the honorable member for Werriwa is that the report is substantially correct, but, being necessarily brief, is perhaps misleading. If the honorable member had heard the whole speech, he would have known that I had no desire to impugn the private honour of members of the Labour Party. What I wished to express was that Labour members were often compelled by the caucus to vote against their judgment. </para>

                            <para>All the colonies in the Empire, including the Australian States, prior to Federation, appear to have had a flag, which was- generally an ensign carrying the Jack. Federation rendered an Australian&#39; flag necessary. The Australian flag selected was also an ensign carrying the Jack, with a large star, and the Southern Cross. This was forwarded to the Imperial authorities, approved by the King in 1902, duly gazetted, and placed in the flag book by the Imperial Government. Subsequently, in 1903, Parliament passed a unanimous resolution that it should be flown. The Commonwealth boats carry the Jack at the bow, and the Australian flag at the stern. With regard to Natal and Canada, which both have their own flags, there is no information to hand <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> to their use. In New Zealand there seems to be no fixed practice. Sometimes&#34; the Jack is flown, and sometimes the flag of the Dominion of New Zealand. </para>

                    <para>.- Last night, I asked the Minister to agree to a reduction of the flash point of kerosene to 100 degrees, or to 97 degrees Fahrenheit, and, having made further inquiries into the matter since, I am now of the opinion that, for the safety of the community, it would be better to fix&#39; the standard at 97 degrees. Will the Minister agree to that? </para>

As honorable members are aware, the methylation of spirit takes place without affecting its burning or other qualities. The only result of&#39; the methylation is to make the spirit offensive to the taste, . so that it cannot go into consumption as an alcoholic drink. </para>

                        <para>- We have an opportunity now to show that we are not to be overridden by it, and every protectionist, whether he be a prohibitionist or a moderate protectionist, should do his utmost to assist the industry in New South Wales. I may say, in passing,- that just as I do not know what a moderate thief is, so I cannot understand a moderate protectionist. An attempt is now being made to insert the thin end of the wedge. I detest combines, and have nothing but loathing for trusts ; but if we are to choose between the two, let us guard ourselves against the most powerful combine in the world. Every protectionist should do his utmost to help the industry in the great State of New South Wales. If any one says that by doing so we are assisting to build up a trust in Australia, we shall be able to reply that we may at any time acquire the local works at a fair valuation, and that, having nationalized them, we shall be able to present a four-square front to the efforts of the American combine. The Standard Oil Company disguises itself here under the name of the Colonial Oil Company. .  1  am informed that it could not be registered in New York, and that it had to be registered in New Jersey, which has been described by one of the greatest of Americans as the place where all frauds -and swindles can be registered. Mo&#39;riey will be spent freely, and it behoves every honorable member to recognise that for the first time we are confronted with the operations of one of the most powerful combines that has ever existed. It may be said on behalf of the Standard Oil Company that its oil to-day is better than it has ever been. I shall not deny such a statement, nor have I the information at my disposal to enable me to deny the assertion that those employed by it receive . a higher average wage than is paid by like corporations. Then again, it may be urged that it is far better that the industry should be controlled by one governing body, so that a good article may be sold cheaply to the consumer. We know, however, that it . has swept 4,000 oil and other companies out of existence, not by fair means of competition, but frequently by underground engineering of the kind that we have experienced in connexion with the operations of the American harvester trust. We all know that some time ago the present Treasurer, when Minister of Trade and Customs, had to take action to prevent the Australian market being flooded with oil by the Standard Oil Company. Honorable members may imagine that  1  am bitter in my opposition to that company. As a matter of fact, I am not. I recognise that it has at its head the most powerful brains that were ever devoted to the work of acquiring power and accumulating capital. But behind this Parliament, elected <inline font-style="italic">on the</inline> freest franchise of which the world knows, we have every man and woman in Australia, and although the Standard Oil Company may swamp or control this Legislature, it cannot control the people at its back. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to refer briefly to some statements made yesterday in reference to this question. I stated last night that I intercepted some shipments of kerosene by the Standard Oil Company, and required the oil to be stamped in a certain, way. That action was taken mainly as the result of the introduction of certain oil in South Australia in tins that were marked &#34; Test.&#34; A professional man, whose name for the moment I forget, was deputed to examine this oil, and he proceeded to treat it on the assumption that it was of a certain flash point, with the result that he narrowly escaped a serious explosion. Thereafter the oil was carefully scrutinized . The shipments of oil, which it was attempted to land here with the object, as far as I could judge, of retarding the progress of the Commonwealth Oil Company, which had just commenced operations, was marked &#34; 1500 test.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- No; I made them stamp the fire test on the consignments. The 150 degrees open test is equal to 105 degrees close test, and I caused the company to brand these consignments with the words &#34; equal to 105 degrees close test.&#34; The company fought the Department for nearly six months, and during all that time was crowding, oil into Australia. I ultimately decided that the kerosene shipped before my decision was announced to the company should be landed, but that thereafter all shipments should comply with that decision. The company complained that it would have to return a lot of this oil <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> America,, but instead of doing so it made the alteration that I required. </para>

                        <para>- It may or may not have been dangerous. There was nothing on the cases to indicate what it was. The honorable member for Boothby said last night that 73 degrees flash point was the standard test nearly all over &#39;the world. I have taken the trouble to ascertain the tests which are fixed in various countries, and a recital of them should be interesting. In New South Wales the test is 83 degrees Fahrenheit close test ; Queensland, 83 degrees close test; Victoria, 73 degrees close test; Western Australia, 83 degrees; New Zealand, 83 degrees; Antigua (South America), 83 degrees; Austria, 73 degrees;  Barbadoes,  83 degrees; Ceylon, 76 degrees; Germany, 69.8 degrees; Great Britain, 73 degrees; Malta, 76 degrees; Montserrat, 83 degrees; Trinidad, 95 degrees; St. Lucia, 95 degrees. </para>

                        <para>- I asked for a return showing tests on the same basis. This return was prepared, not by me, but bv the Department. When the honorable member for Boothby was speaking last night, I interjected that I thought that in  many  places the standard was higher than he mentioned. At that time I did not know in how many ; but I knew the test was 83 degrees in Queensland, and I thought it due to myself and to the Committee to bring forward all the information I could on the subject. </para>

                    <para>.- This discussion has gone beyond the range of an ordinary Tariff question, and has dealt with the various tests of oils, and with the  position and methods of the oil companies, i have no desire to be placed in the position of giving any advantage to one oil company over another, though I suppose that whichever way we vote, so the advantage will go. It is well to remember the position of the three companies - or of two companies particularly - which are- competing to-day. The honorable member for Melbourne referred to the millionaire connexions of the oil companies, and I may say that the Colonial Oil Company, which is the Standard Oil Company under another name, and the British Imperial Company, which is a French-English company, both have associated with them millionaires - in the one case a Rockefeller, and in the other case a Rothschild. But their consumers do not care whether their pennies go to enrich a Rockefeller or a Rothschild. Then we have the Commonwealth Oil Corporation ; and it is remarkable how these astute business people select telling names with a view to effective advertisement. This company is almost as much a millionaire company as are the other two I have mentioned ; but, unlike the latter, it does not produce domestic kerosene, so that there is no competition in this connexion. I should very much like to know whether the Treasurer&#39;s proposal is purely in the interests of public safety, or purely in the interests of protection. Honorable members have been fairly deluged with literature in regard to the various companies interested ; and I have taken the trouble to read the documents supplied, though I do not propose to weary the Committee with extracts. The Colonial Oil Company imports two high-test oils for domestic illuminating purposes at 1.00 degrees and 103 degrees, and two engine oils, flashing at 86 degrees and 87 degrees. The amendment, as originally sent from the Senate, gave an advantage to the British Imperial Company, whereas the amendment before us would give an advantage to the Standard Oil Company. Had I voted for the amendment yesterday, I should have given assistance to the British Imperial Company, and if I vote to-day for the amendment unaltered, I shall be acting distinctly in the interests of the Standard Oil Company. In connexion with the Standard Oil Company, it is alleged, with a good deal of force, that its representative came to this country specifically; to fight the Tariff and anti-trust legislation ; so that it will be seen my remarks have some force. As I said before, I desire to give no advantage to one company more than to another ; my concern is only for those who use the oil for illuminating or industrial purposes. The honorable member for Melbourne spoke about certain persons being &#34;captured &#34; by an oil company ; and 1 desire to know whether the Commonwealth Parliament has been captured. It has been stated that when the Tariff was last before us, members of this House were captured by a certain company ; and it is well that we should go beyond the question immediately before us, in order to satisfy the public that, at any rate, there is no &#34; capturing &#39; &#39; in the present instance. So far, the allegations to which I have referred have not been denied, but there is a body appointed to test their truth. At any rate, it was stated that, on the last occasion, a company did capture certain votes in this House; and that is, perhaps, the. only serious attack ever made on this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- It is not for me to say. That was the statement made ;  &#39; and I am only now urging upon honorable members to show all these oil companies that it is not in their interests, but in the interests of the general public, that we are voting. The British Imperial Company import one illuminating oil for domestic purposes at 103. degrees and one engine oil flashing at 98 degrees. Under the proposal of yesterday, the illuminating oil of both companies would have been admitted without denaturating ; and, in this connexion, there would have been no monopoly to one &#39;or the other. That proposal, however, would have admitted the British Imperial engine-oil without being denaturated, while the Standard Company&#39;s oil would have had to be treated. But to-day the proposal before us will cause the British Imperial oil to be denaturated, while the other oil would be admitted without treatment. The Standard Oil Company first fought the British Imperial Oil Company with a conditional rebate, which this Parliament declared to be illegal, and then the former company imported a cheaper and inferior kerosene, ostensibly for engine use ; but only the cases, and not the tins, were marked. The honorable member for North Sydney pointed out that, under the proposal, we should have power to deal with imported oils, but. not with locally-produced oils,- because the latter, with all the attendant dangers, could be sold retail without any treatment. The suggestion I would make in regard to the local oil is the imposition of an Excise duty, because I think oil is dangerous under a certain flash point- We find, however, that in the States where most illuminating oil is used, &#39; the standard is the highest; and no doubt the officers of the Department took care that the tests were made under equal conditions. The honorable member for North Sydney and the honorable member for Maranoa urged that the denaturating process would prove expensive. I do not see how that could be, because in the country of origin it would not be necessary to denaturate every tin, but simply to denaturate a tank which would be set aside for the Australian trade. </para>

                        <para>- But on the arrival of the tinned oils, the Customs officials would act in the same way as they do in&#39; regard to cotton-seed oil and other commodities, and make a . promiscuous test of a shipment. The honorable members I have just mentioned also asked whether companies would manufacture oils specially for Australia, and my reply is that the tendency throughout the world&#39;s trade to-day is to consider the habits, customs, and tastes of the countries to be supplied. It is neglect of this study that militates against British trade, and it is attention. to it which has raised American trade to its present condition. </para>

If I could answer scientific questions of- the kind, I fancy I should be- occupying a much more lucrative- position than that of a member of Parliament. The Standard Oil Trust operated first by the offer of a rebate, ultimately rendered, illegal by Parliament, and subsequently they introduced inferior kerosene oil ostensibly for use as a motive power for engines, but really that it might be palmed off upon unsuspecting consumers. The company marked, the cases containing this oil &#34; for engine use,&#34; but they did not mark the tins. The retailer was thus able to sell this inferior kerosene for illuminating purposes. </para>

                        <para>- I think that we had better not permit either the Standard Oil Trust  or the British Imperial Oil Company to obtain .a monopoly. If we fix the flash point test at 102 degrees we shall grant a monopoly to the Standard Oil Trust. Both the organizations to which I have referred are of mammoth dimensions, and personally I am not at all concerned whether I do an act of kindness for Rockefeller or for Rothschild. But I am concerned in safeguarding the interests of the Australian consumers. I desire to enable them to obtain kerosene oil of good quality at as low a price as possible. During the course of this debate we have been asked to show that any real danger is to be apprehended from the use of oil having a low flash point. My reply is that if only one person lost his life in ten! years as the result of using low test oils it would be our bounden duty to interfere. </para>

                        <para>- In India and Burmah,  we are informed, the . flash point test is fixed at 73 degrees.. But I would point out that the conditions in Australia are entirely different from those which obtain in the countries I have mentioned. We all know that in our cities kerosene is not used to any material extent as. an  illuminant  But it is used very largely in outlying districts. If we fix the flash point at 97 decrees, I think&#39; that we shall be acting reasonably. The Commonwealth Oil Corporation&#39;, does not produce kerosene oil for illuminating, purposes in any considerable quantity. The .proposal submitted by the Treasurer yesterday would have conferred a benefit on the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, while that which he has presented to-day would benefit the Standard Oil Trust. I see no difficulty whatever in the way of  denaturating  this oil. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to a point of order. Honorable members are slandered enough outside of this House, and they do not want to be slandered inside it. The Treasurer has just stated that he has been informed that the Standard Oil Trust has&#62; a majority of honorable members in its bag, and that it is idle to continue the debate. In making that statement he is giving currency to the infamous slander which &#39; has been .published about honorable members of this Parliament, that they are men who can be bought with money to give corrupt votes in connexion with this Tariff. We cannot deal with these anonymous slanders very easily, but when the- Treasurer of the Commonwealth makes the statement which he has made, I ask whether such a reflection &#39; on honorable members should be made by a Minister of the Crown ? It is the most abominable and the greatest slander which has ever been uttered against a Parliament by a Minister of the Crown. </para>

                        <para>- It is a scandal to see the representative of the Standard Oil Trust buttonholing honorable members as he has done in the precincts of the parliamentary building. i did not cast any imputation upon honorable members. I say again that the representative of that trust has approached nearly every honorable member and has endeavoured to get . them - probably he has been successful in, the case of a large number - to promise to support it. So much has been said about this matter outside that I actually turned the representative of that trust out of my office. It is a scandal that a man should be sent here from America to force this item through in opposition to the interests of the people of this country. I cast no imputation upon honorable members, but we have had quite enough of visits from agents from America, and we do not want any more of them. </para>

                        <para>- I never suggested that. The statement I made was not that honorable members had been bribed. I do not believe that any honorable member of this House has been bribed. But the agent of the Standard Oil Trust has been canvassing to an extent which I say should not be allowed within the precincts, of this building. </para>

                        <para>- I quite realize the serious imputation which the Treasurer has made. He stated that he had just heard that the Standard Oil Trust had honorable members in its bag. That was not the right thing for the Treasurer to say, and, although I have no power to deal with such remarks, I think that it would be better, in the interests of this House, if such statements were not made. </para>

As I initiated the opposition to -the proposal of the Government in regard to this item, I may as well say that, until after I had made my speech, I had had no communication of any kind whatever with&#39; any representative of the Standard Oil Trust ; nor have I been buttonholed by any agent of that trust. But during last week I was persistently buttonholed by the representatives of the rival companies - the British Imperial Company and the Commonwealth Oil Corporation. </para>

The Treasurer has stated that be has been informed that a certain foreign trust has a majority of honorable members in its bag. He has further declared that some person representing that trust has been interviewing honorable members. In reference to both those statements, I wish to say that if there be any such person in Australia he has never approached&#39; me. </para>

                    <para>.- In reference to the Treasurer&#39;s statement, I may add that I have not been interviewed by a representative of any of these rival companies. Throughout the consideration of this Tariff - and of the previous Tariff -I have consistently refused to be buttonholed by the representative of any company. The leader of the Opposition has entered his protest against the statement of the Treasurer, but I do not think that the matter should be allowed to stop there. This is the time when the honour of this Parliament should be absolutely vindicated. I do not doubt that the Treasurer believes his statement. </para>

I am as jealous of the honour of the House and of honorable members as is any one here. No one is -more jealous than I am in this regard. But I have been very much annoyed by the representatives of the Standard Oil Trust in connexion with this item. They have come to me, until I told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Campbell</inline> that I did not want him in my office at all. </para>

                        <para>- Then I withdraw it. I have said enough to show that no offence was intended. I did not wish to hurt the feelings of any honorable member, and although in debate I am at times pretty hot, I never wish to hurt any one&#39;s feelings. Perhaps this discussion will do some good. It may cause the extraordinary canvassing which has been going on to cease. The gentleman to whom I have referred is a good deal to blame for the remark which he made, which has caused a great deal of feeling amongst honorable members, namely, that he had come here to put this matter through Parliament. </para>

I have had to bear the result of a great &#39; deal of the canvassing which has taken place. I have had to fight against it, and on many occasions have felt its effects very keenly. Therefore, perhaps it has been more obvious to me than it has been to other honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- No. I accept the Treasurer&#39;s withdrawal of  his personal statements. But we should know what steps are to be taken to have this charge investigated. Since the inception of the Federal Parliament I have had close intercourse with honorable members of all shades of political opinion, and, with an intimate knowledge of the men who constitute it, I declare that, in my judgment, this is a pure House. It cannot be justly said that it has -been either  directly  or indirectly corruptly influenced, and it is arn outrage that such a charge should be made against it. I am strongly in favour of the proposal that the further consideration of this request be postponed in order that an inquiry may be made as to whether or not an attempt has been made, either directly or indirectly, to influence the vote of any honorable member. I know the representatives of the Standard Oil&#39; Company here as well as the representatives of the other companies, and my desire has always been to ascertain .what is best in the interests, not of any individual, but of the consuming public of Australia. Notwithstanding that the Treasurer, has withdrawn his remark - a withdrawal which I personally accept - I think it would be outrageous to proceed with the consideration of this request until a full investigation has been, made into these allegations. We should determine whether there exists in this House of seventy-five members one&#34; black sheep, but I declare that in my humble judgment there is not one. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; it was at my suggestion: that the Prime Minister agreed that that Committee should have the power to inquire into allegations of the kind now before us that were made against this House in a . section of the press, and we should refuse to deal with this item until that Committee has inquired and reported. I appeal to my honorable friends, whose character, I am convinced, cannot be besmirched in the way suggested by a section of the press, to support the amendment for the postponement of the item, so that this charge may be cleared up at once &#39; and for ever. </para>

The Treasurer may now be acquitted of anything more than having on the impulse of_ the moment circulated a statement which&#34; has a  very  bad appearance. I wish now to leave him out of the question. We have to consider the position not only of the Minister who has been guilty of an indiscretion&#39; for which he has  very  straightforwardly expressed his regret, but of honorable members generally. When the Minister said &#34; I have just been informed,&#34; his words suggested that he had  just  received a message &#39; to <inline font-style="italic">the effect</inline> that, the Standard Oil Company had a  majority  of honorable members in its bag. The person who brought that message is the person  who made the imputation upon the House. </para>

                        <para>- That makes the position even more serious. We must remember that this sort of thing has been hinted at for months outside the House. I have been told that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> this morning published a leading article, in which it referred, in connexion with the Standard Oil Company, to rumours affecting members which had been &#34;crystallized.&#34; I have not seen the article, but I think that that is the expression used. When a leading paper in Australia like the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> gives currency to such a statement, and we have that statement made in the ..House itself, feelings of self-respect should induce us to postpone the item. We ought to say that we are prepared to have the fullest investigation; and that until such an investigation has been made into this imputation, we refuse to deal with the item. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree with what has been said. The way in which men have been permitted to enter this House, to waylay honorable members, to talk to and inflict themselves upon them, is little short of disgraceful. I have never had an opportunity of seeing the representatives of the Standard Oil Company, but I have seen a representative of the Commonwealth Oil Company. The only transaction that I have had in respect of the British Imperial Oil Company is this : that whilst I was away from my home one of its representatives left there a lamp filled with oil, with a request that we should burn it. When I returned I told the man, who called later on, to take the lamp away, and that I regretted that he should have left it. It is very serious to speak, in the terms that have been used, about members of this House in connexion with a great corporation like the Standard Oil Company. The power of that company is so tremendous - its ramifications are so extensive - that any imputation against any man, no matter how absurd, . will find credence with many people. Some honorable members will vote in one way and some in another, and in view of this imputation, a very large number of people will think that some of us have been bought. Any journal that makes such a statement- I say nothing to exempt any man who makes it - should be asked before a responsible Committee of this House to substantiate it, or to withdraw it and apologize. That should be done immediately. I have been in politics for some fourteen or fifteen years, and do not believe that either in this Parliament, or in any of the State Assemblies, there has been any bribery or corruption. </para>

                        <para>- It is against freetraders that this charge is very largely levelled. Not only have I not seen any representatives of oil companies, but I should not even know them if I saw them. I have stedfastly refused to grant interviews with respect to Tariff matters, and have asked that any communication desired to be made to me on Tariff subjects should be addressed to me through the post. It is amusing to hear the Treasurer, of all men, inveighing against the practice Of lobbying, since he has admitted time after time on the floor of the House that he has been in conference with manufacturers and their agents in regard to the effect of the Tariff upon&#39; their manufactures. . It comes ill from the Minister to resent lobbying, when he is acknowledged to be one of the worst offenders in the encouragement of lobbying on occasions when one particular side of the Tariff is concerned. It is only when the other  side of the question is brought to the front that, in his opinion, lobbying becomes an evil. We have seen the galleries absolutely crammed by manufacturers and their agents, and we have seen the Treasurer in conference with some of them. Never a word of protest from the Minister was heard on those occasions, but, because a lady happened to be here the other day - I do not know who she was, but the Treasurer evidently did - he thought it was a great crime, seeing that her desire was to have a reduction of duty. There was no scandal or crime, however, when the galleries were filled with men, who were imploring the Treasurer to give them an opportunity to dip their hands in the public purse in order that they might enrich themselves. </para>

                        <para>- It is, at any rate, a truthful statement. I was merely drawing attention to contrasts in the Treasurer&#39;s actions. An opportunity is now presented for inquiry - for substantiating, if possible, the insinuations which have been thrown broadcast both within and without the Chamber. If we allow the opportunity to pass we shall deserve to remain under a stigma. The first . explanation of the Treasurer was an aggravation of the offence, but, in the second explanation, he climbed down. But he had done the mischief, and thus served his object, which was to feed the flame of unmerited slander outside the House. Honorable members ought to support the motion of the honorable member for Dalley, in order that this matter may be sifted to the bottom. If there is any one in the House who has been guilty of receiving bribes, or who has been amenable to undue influence in the casting of his vote, there is now an opportunity for thorough &#39;inquiry. </para>

I agree with the honorable member for Lang, that, in other respects, there is an opening for reformation. I do not know why honorable members should tolerate it, but it struck me yesterday, when a reflection was made on the political integrity of the honorable member for Boothby, to the effect that his voting was not consistent with his protectionist pledges- </para>

                    <para>- - I hope this item will be postponed. I have taken a .particular interest in the oil duties, and I quite agree that, so far as the local industry is concerned, it would be better if there was an inquiry of the kind suggested, not only because of the imputations which have been cast, and which, of course, must be cleared first, but because the whole question is a very intricate one. Personally, I should like to see the scope of the inquiry extended, so that a better understanding of the situation may be arrived at. Oil corporations have the name of indulging in machinations, and the suspicion has been accentuated by the discussion this afternoon. </para>

                    <para>-  I shall support the motion, because I think it is necessary to emphasize the gravity of the situation which has been produced by the Treasurer&#39;s statement. The Committee ought not to allow themselves to be diverted by a mere apology on the part of the honorable gentleman, who made a statement which he now says is not an exact reproduction of what he was told. The Committee must remember that the Treasurer told us that somebody had told him that this oil company had secured a majority of the members of the House, and if we allow ourselves to be diverted into a fishing inquiry we shall lose the scent of the matter. The Treasurer has given us a thread in saying that he was told by somebody that the state of things described existed; and it is his absolute duty, either to disclose the name of that person, or to place himself in a position to be able to say that that person has unconditionally withdrawn any imputation he cast on the House. If we allow ourselves to be diverted into a sort of fishing excursion to find out whether or not we are honorable men, we shall lose the thread which the Treasurer has given us. It is all very well for the Minister to say that he is sorry, but he has admitted that the worst part of the expression, namely, that the oil companies had honorable members &#34; in the bag,&#34; was not stated to him by the person who gave him the information.. Why did the Treasurer use that expression ? </para>

In addition, I think that the whole question of lobbying, as it is carried on in this House, should. be brought under review. I should prefer such a question to be discussed when the  Speaker  is in the chair, because that gentleman has control of the galleries, which are most frequented by those who desire to place matters connected with their business before honorable members. </para>

We must not forget, however, that, as representatives of the people, we ought not to erect any barrier between the people and ourselves. We should afford every facility for their placing before us, in a proper fashion, their desires in any matters affecting themselves. Unfortunately, however, we have in the galleries of this House persons who subject honorable members to their importunities, and who are not directly affected by the Tariff, but are paid for the services which they render to others. </para>

                        <para>- That is the sort of thing which ought to be stopped once and for ever. The power, however, does not lie in- this Committee, nor even in the House, but rests in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker;</inline> and it is for that reason I believe this question ought to be discussed in the House. The honorable member for Lang mentioned one particular individual, and made it appear that she had been specially singled ()Ut for reference because she advocated a reduction of duties. The honorable member may be astonished to learn that that individual was prepared to work upon the same terms to obtain an increased duty upon another item. That is the sort of thing that we should stop. </para>

                    <para>.- My own opinion is that there has been a great deal pf loose talk indulged in by honorable members upon the question of their honour having been impugned. When Ministers make loose statements regarding the honour of this House, it is high time that serious attention was given to them.  1  do not wish the honorable member for Laanecoorie to misunderstand the position which I take up in reference to this matter. There is no more impropriety in a person becoming the paid advocate of a duty than there is in a professional man being engaged to represent -a particular firm in respect of any matter. If honorable members cannot withstand persuasion on the part of paid servants, they ought not to he here. But my difficulty is not on that score at all. . I have previously stated that I do not believe there is a word of truth in the statements which have been published regarding the corruption of honorable members. But that fact does not justify the Treasurer in throwing out hints of the kind, because the worst of all charges is that which consists of half truth, and which may be made by insinuation in so many different ways. You, sir, will recollect an occasion in the Queensland Parliament upon which a very important matter of this character cropped up, and upon which we took a very definite action. The charge was made that . the votes of certain honorable members in connexion with the construction of syndicate railways had been influenced, and that a document could be produced to show that improper overtures had been made to a person who had weight with honorable members, and that the document would show impropriety between the syndicate interested and honorable member&#39;s who might have been induced not to take a certain course. </para>

                        <para>- The present Premier of Queensland and myself obtained the original document. A proposal was made by the representative of a syndicate to an ex-member of the Queensland Parliament that the latter should benefit considerably if he were able to induce the Labour Party - not to endeavour to pass the Bill, but not to stonewall it. That is the history of the matter. What did we do? Immediately we arrived at that position we said that corruption had been attempted by a party who would have benefited by the passing of the Bill. We therefore asked the Government not to proceed with the measure - to drop it immediately, and to seek a fitting opportunity to deal with the question. </para>

                        <para>- The person who used to haunt Parliament House for the purpose of gaining support for syndicate railways took a first class ticket to another part of the world, and the particular measure in question was withdrawn. I mention this incident to illustrate the danger of making . charges. But in that case we had the incriminating document in our possession. If there be a single member of this Committee who knows of any document which would incriminate or influence any honorable member, his bounden duty is to rise in his place and inform us of it. If the Treasurer has any grounds for his suspicions, he should state them clearly. As being relevant to this question, I may, perhaps, be pardoned for stating a circumstance which happened in connexion with my own family. Not long ago, a kerosene lamp was left at my house. My wife stated that she did not order it, and that she did not require it. The person who delivered it said that similar lamps were to be distributed to members of this Parliament. I had to write to the company concerned upon two occasions before they sent a man to take it away. </para>

                        <para>-I think it was the British Imperial Company. I had to write to them twice before they took the lamp away. One of the agents subsequently came to me and apologized for their action. That case which I have mentioned involved a gross act of impropriety, and if other honorable members have been similarly treated, they ought to say so. But I come now to the main point involved in this discussion. What does the postponement of this item mean ? Will it make any difference to the position? Why not pass the Tariff now? </para>

                        <para>- If the Treasurer has any evidence of bribery, let him produce it. I. have related the only instance, so far as I am personally concerned, in which an act of impropriety was committed. Of course, I do not regard the forwarding to honorable members at this House of small articles such as a plug of tobacco, in  order that they may appreciate its quality, as improper. But to send any article- to an honorable member&#39;s private house is exceeding the bounds of decency. </para>

                        <para>- The interjection of the leader of the Opposition aptly illustrates my point. Nobody would ever accuse him of being likely to be corrupted by the present of a bag of chocolates. But if MacRobertson had sent a ton of chocolates to his private house, it would have been an act of impropriety. What advantage shall we gain by postponing the consideration of this item? </para>

                        <para>- My experience of the public is that it is much more sensible than are ordinary Parliaments. The people are  chiefly concerned in getting the consideration of this Tariff completed. No investigation of the kind suggested can be completed within a month, so that if the proposal of the honorable member for Dalley be carried, the Tariff may not become law this session.  I  appeal to the leader of the Opposition as to whether our honour has been seriously assailed - whether the position cannot be made clear by a vote being taken upon this matter? The only investigation for which I would care two straws would be one conducted by a Justice of the High Court. </para>

                        <para>- No. A Select Committee has been appointed to suggest some procedure which can be applied to similar cases in future. But nothing has been promised by the Prime Minister. No definite statement can be got from him. It is about time that we held him to his responsibility in this connexion. I do not think that this item ought to &#39; be passed until we have had from him a clear declaration that he will take such steps as will secure a full and fair investigation into the allegations and rumours which have been heard from time to time. The Minister appears to have been unwarily led by an article which appeared to-day in a journal which champions him, into making the statements which have given offence. He made yesterday a remark similar to that which was made to-day, and the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> therefore pats him on the back this morning, and calls him an &#34;old general.&#34; It praises him very highly for his courage in making these fierce denunciations of honorable members. I should like to read what the Treasurer&#39;s newspaper said about him this morning. </para>

The Minister gathered courage as he went on; but, luckily for the honorable member and the Committee, he has been pulled up this time. A little later the article continues - &#34; They boasted,&#34; cried the Minister, &#34; that although we had passed the Commerce Act, they would ride through it &#34; ; and he added grimly, &#34; But they didn&#39;t.&#34; A Labour member had interjected a little earlier - &#34; The same company boasted that it would buy the Commonwealth Parliament&#34;; and the Minister said, &#34;Hear, hear ! &#34; There can be no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne&#39;s disclosures - quite apart from certain disquieting rumours that have been rife for some time past, such as the quoted interjection crystallizes - </para>
                <para class="block">The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> writer deliberately associates the Treasurer with these disquieting rumours, and accepts his remarks as cumulative evidence as to the baneful effect of the Standard Oil Trust&#39;s influence upon this Chamber. Its statements go almost as far as those of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> some time ago, though the proprietors of the latter journal were more courageous, and, instead of speaking -about disquieting rumours crystallizing, had the courage to say what they did about honorable members being bribed. All this indicates that an. atmosphere charged with suspicion is being created. As the honorable member for West Sydney very properly said, where the Standard Oil Trust is concerned, it does not take much to arouse suspicion. There is therefore the greater reason why we should be supersensitive rather than allow allegations impugning our honesty in relation to the Trust to pass unnoticed. I do not think that the mere postponing of the item will clear the air; I shall support the motion in order to </para>

                        <para>- How could it have a list, unless its representatives had interviewed honorable members, and knew how they would vote? The Minister can put his own interpretation on his words ; but what he said was that the Trust had honorable- members in its bag. If that was his belief, it was his duty, to consult . the Prime Minister, and not proceed with the item until he had done so. Had he found that there was nothing in the suspicions, he could have gone on without making, them public. The Minister has acted very injudiciously. Although he has apologized, he has not undone the harm that his remarks have created. He &#34;has publicly stated his opinion that the Trust possessed a list of honorable members whose opinions were known, and &#34; had the Committee in its bag.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The statement made by the Minister was most improper. He should have investigated the source of his suspicions, and, having done so, if he still held them, he should have made a full breast of the affair, and shown what influence had been at work, so that we might know how things stood. I think that a great many slanders are current because we do not assert our privileges. The building is infested with dead-beats and the representatives of all sorts of concerns,, and there is no one representing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

                    <para>.- As a new member, I am somewhat surprised at the attitude which has been taken by the Committee. It is proposed to postpone an item merely because of an interjection made by the Treasurer. Interjections, I under-&#39; stand, are at&#39; all times disorderly, and what shall we gain by postponing the item ? Because an honorable member told the Minister that a certain canvass had taken place, and that the numbers were, against &#34;him, and the Minister, by interjection, made that public, is it to be said that a reflection has been cast upon honorable members ? </para>

                        <para>- They know that they need not go to free-trade members to secure the striking off of duties, because they are aware that those members will vote for free-trade. I ask, again, what will be gained  by the proposed postponement? Shall we obtain further information ? In my opinion, none is to be got. All we can be told is that the Minister was informed of the fact which he has made public. I regret that the Treasurer has agreed to the postponement. It will do no good, and&#39; will advertise the Standard Oil Trust. </para>

The Standard Oil Company is on the one side, and, as a matter of fact, its opponent has done just as much lobbying as it has done. It is all very well to beg the question, but we know that lobbying is rife. </para>

                        <para>- I should take such a statement to mean that I was corrupt. But did not my honorable colleague withdraw his remark immediately it was suggested that a certain sinister interpretation could be placed upon it? He withdrew it unreservedly, and said that he desired to impute nothing of the kind. As the honorable member for Maranoa has said, no man has been more maligned in Australia than has the Treasurer. I agree with the honorable member for Wide Bay that nothing is to be gained by indefinitely postponing the request. </para>

                    <para>-If there were any doubt as to how the voting would go I should say that it would be as well for honorable members not to vote immediately after a heated debate like that which has just taken place. It would probably be wise to postpone the further consideration of the request for an hour or two or until to-morrow, so that we might have a clear vote upon it ; but it is a mere political move to suggest that the vote should be held over until we are able to inquire into the question of whether the Standard Oil Company or any other oil corporation has indulged in lobbying. </para>

                        <para>- If I occupied the position of the leader of the Opposition I should perhaps do what he is doing. After all, we have simply had an exhibition of political tactics. I am at one with those who. say that a full investigation should be&#39; made into this charge. During my political life, extending over seventeen years, I have never imputed anything improper to an honorable member, nor have I been offered a bribe. I do not believe any honorable member of this or of any other Parliament of which I have been a member could be charged with corruption. I have inquired into some of these allegations for my own personal information, and that is the conclusion at which I have arrived. At the same time I think it is wise for the press to publish these rumours so that we may have an opportunity to refute them. We have nothing to hide. It is all very well for honorable members opposite to talk of what will be published in the newspapers to-morrow. The newspapers are like these oil companies - they are ranged on opposing sides. When a Minister proposes something of which the Ministerial organs approve they warmly support him, whilst the attitude of the leader of the Opposition in opposing that proposal is supported by the Opposition journals. When I say that the numbers are up, I generally know what I am talking about. I shall again read to the Committee the words that I used to the Treasurer. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. I know of honorable members who will vote on this request in a way that will suit the Standard Oil Company, and I could put my hands on four or five who, if they had their way, would give that company a very short shrift in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I was asked my opinion, and I gave it; and had I been in the place of the leader of the Opposition, I should probably have done what has been suggested. However, this item ought not to be postponed indefinitely,&#39; when it is quite open to make any desired inquiries after the vote has been taken. It seems to me that the Treasurer most handsomely withdrew what he had said ;. and I think it ought to be clear to every one that no imputation rests on honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- It was a private communication, and, as a matter of fact, I really do get fogged as between the two companies, seeing that the company, which is said to be in the interests of the Commonwealth, calls itself a British company, and the company, which is said to be against Australia, calls . itself a colonial company. There is no doubt- that in the House or in public it would have been wrong to use such language ; and I have given the only explanation I can offer. I see nothing to be gained by a postponement of the item; but, if any importance is attached to it, there might be a short adjournment of the discussion. </para>

It is true that&#39;occasionally I say hard, things of honorable members opposite, but I cannot believe that any of them has any sympathy with this Trust; and, at any rate, I have heard five or six honorable members express themselves in regard to it, in language which might be called rather more than indiscreet. </para>

                    <para>. - I had no idea that the Minister of Trade and Customs was going to occupy such a length of time with his personal explanation ; but I think that he has, at any rate, most effectively stated the position. No one is more pleased than I am at the manly way in which the Minister has relieved the Treasurer of any responsibility. When we were dealing with the Tariff during the first session, it will be remembered that a charge was levelled against the present Treasurer by the then honorable member for Werriwa&#39;, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Conroy.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - I am in favour of a postponement in order that we may obtain more information. So far as I can gather, the proposal of the Treasurer is playing right into the hands of the Standard Oil Company, which is the only company that supplies oils equal to  102  degrees test. Russian oils do not usually go above 97 degrees, though in extreme cases they reach too degrees test. Therefore, if we adopt the Treasurer&#39;s proposal, we shall give a monopoly to this company, in the case of all high class oils. </para>

                        <para>- I am merely suggesting that there should be- a postponement in order to obtain expert evidence as to what  Ought  to be the proper flash test. To-day I asked an expert whether kerosene could be denaturated, and he told me that, so far is he knew, it could not, for the purpose of use for oil engines; and, therefore, I think that some gentleman like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hake,</inline> Inspector of Explosives in Victoria, should be invited to give an opinion on the point. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BATCHELOR</inline> (Boothby) &#91;5.36&#93;.- I was strongly in favour of postponement, in view of the fact that the honesty of &#34;honorable members was impugned. However, the Treasurer has unreservedly withdrawn any suggestion of the kind; and the information given to the Minister seems to have been of a perfectly harmless character. Under the circumstances, I do not see that much can be gained by a postponement, except, of course, a vote when the atmosphere is clearer and calmer. The question becomes immaterial now that any suggestion against the honesty of honorable members has been unreservedly withdrawn.. In my opinion, the statement which appeared in the leading columns of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> this morning is much worse than that which gave rise to the discussion this afternoon. We, of course, take no notice of imputations of the kind when they appear in journalistic &#39; &#39; rags, &#39; &#39; but when they are published in a journal which purports to lead public opinion in Victoria, there ought to be some authority or proof for charges which, otherwise, no decent newspaper would print. However, we know that under present conditions, any attempts on the part of the Parliament to deal with newspaper attacks end in absurdity ; and,, in any case, questions of the kind have already been referred to a Select Committee. </para>

                    <para>.- If there be any question upon which honorable members should be supersensitive, it  is  that of the impugnment of their honour. But simply because an unlucky expression was used by the Treasurer, we ought not to have raised such a storm. As bearing upon this question, I may mention that when the Tariff was previously before this Committee, I was offered a wager of  20  to1 that the Standard Oil Trust would get  their  oil in the case as well as in the bulk admitted free. The person who wished to make that wager would undoubtedly have won it. This Committee has previously decided that kerosene shall be admitted free, irrespective of whether it be in the case or in bulk. </para>

                        <para>- No one will deny that the desire of the Standard Oil Trust was that their kerosene should be admitted free. It was known perfectly well that honorable members would vote in that direction. But I should be very sorry to  impugn  their honour upon that account. What need have the Standard Oil Trust to at- tempt to improperly influence honorable members, when they know well enough that they will vote as they wish them to. vote? The position reminds me very forcibly of a celebrated gambler in London, who was reputed to have made , &#163;15,000 a year. When the time came for him to retire from the gambling table, he made the acknowledgment that he did not always cheat. He said, &#34; I am a good player, and why should I cheat when my superior&#39; play would enable me to win? But when I could not win fairly, I won the other way. &#34; Similarly I might ask what need have the Standard Oil Trust to attempt to improperly influence honorable members? If that Trust wished to do so, does anybody imagine that with all their experience in connexion with acts of bribery - according to the authority of the  President  of the United States and Lawson, the author of <inline font-style="italic">Frenzied Finance -</inline> they would leave any trace behind? Certainly not. The same keen brain which has controlled that Trust would control its officers and prevent the slightest trace from being discovered. Personally, I wish to extend the production of kerosene as large a protection as possible. But I do not impugn the honour of honorable members who desire to see it admitted free. We have had one case of bribery or corruption in Victoria. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKenzie,</inline> who at the time was Minister of Lands, w.as accused of corruption. </para>

                        <para>- I was fooled by him. The honorable member and I both had friends whose acquaintance we regret having made. I wish to show why this item should not be postponed to permit of an inquiry being made into the truth or otherwise of the Treasurer&#39;s statement. What happened in the case of the inquiry into the land scandals in New South Wales? Delay occurred, the expenses were piled up, and yet* comparatively little good was achieved. How long would the inquiry suggested by the honorable member for Dalley last? It would occupy many weeks. </para>

But the fact remains that the Treasurer&#39;s accusation will be circulated throughout Australia.&#39;  His  withdrawal cannot recall it. Although the honorable gentleman has unreservedly withdrawn the charge, his champion, the Minister of Trade and Customs, who conveyed the information to him, had the temerity to stand up and declare that honorable members of this House were engaged in a fight on behalf of two companies. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of inside this chamber. I wish now to say a word or two in reference to the question of professional lobbying. I think that some steps might have been taken to suppress this evil early in the consideration of the Tariff. We all know that the Melbourne manufacturers and the representatives of the Sunshine Harvester Company have filled the galleries night after night, and that they have had the ear of honorable members and of Minis-&#39; ters for months past. &#39; Yet we now find the honorable member for Laanecoorie backing up the Treasurer in his animosity to one man who is representing a large firm of piano-makers in opposition to a prominent member of the protectionist party in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- I was alluding to the gentleman to whom the Treasurer directly referred upon one occasion when he was sitting in the gallery. His animosity towards that gentleman is due to the successful way in which&#39; the latter has been able to put before honorable members the case for imported pianos in opposition to the pianos which are locally manufactured. It ill becomes the representatives of Victoria to endeavour to prevent men in Sydney and other parts of Australia from placing their views before honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the right honorable gentleman. B.ut if we finish the discussion now, the complete case will be recorded in one part of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report, whereas if the item be postponed, a flame now practically quenched will be rekindled. In m.y opinion, there need be no further discussion of the item. The charges which have been made have been absolutely withdrawn. I know of nothing corrupt, but should any other honorable member know of anything of the kind, he should state the facts. This is the time to do so. Although mv vote may advantage the Standard Oil Trust, I shall give it, not because attempts have been made to corrupt me, but in fulfilment of a pledge to my constituents. We should do the work which we have been sent here to do, and I appeal to the Committee to proceed with the item. </para>

                <para>Colonel FOXTON.- That, in my opinion, is the only good reason for the postponement of the item, though I regret that, in holding this view, I am not in complete accord with a number of my honorable friends. The Committee does not do itself justice in taking notice of general statements, either made by a Minister or published in newspapers. If charges are not specific, and we take notice of generalities, the Minister or journal concerned, is elevated into a position of undeserved prominence. </para>

                    I have listened carefully to what has taken place. The Minister of Trade and . Customs made a charge which was not in the best of form, supposing that it was intended to be made public, but I understand that it&#39; was really a private communication, not meant to be repeated here or elsewhere, and therefore is not open to discussion. But that statement having been repeated and magnified by the Treasurer-

                    - I think it beneath the dignity of honorable members to take notice of charges made in general terms, though when a Minister or any member makes a charge, he should be challenged, and asked to name his authority. If he fails to do so there and then, the charge must recoil on his own head. The tendency is to pay regard to statements which are beneath notice. If mere general charges are made in the Chamber, or published by newspapers - whether rags or leading journals- they do&#39; public men no harm. I have lived long enough in politics to know that. I have not read the newspaper statement to which reference has been made, though I have heard about it, and I say that unless those managing the publication come forward with facts and names, they stand condemned, and should be treated with the contempt they deserve. In noticing &#39;vague and general charges, the Committee merely draws attention to what otherwise would not be heeded.

                        <para>- Or outside.. But we heed not take notice of statements published outside, unless . they are so distinct that we can take definite action in regard to them. We can afford to stand on our dignity, and not attempt to defend ourselves when vague criticism of our actions is published. . But when remarks imputing dishonour or dishonesty to honorable . members are made in this Chamber, as they too often are, we should take  notice of them. I am glad that notice has been taken of such remarks this afternoon, because it may discourage the making of such statements in the future. The Minister of Trade and Customs, whose statement I heard, said that he had handed over a certain memorandum. </para>

                        <para>- I assure the Minister that I do not look upon the matter in that way.  I thought that the Standard Oil Trust was, if anything, getting an advantage, and said so in my speech, without mentioning its name. I thought that a monopoly of the market was being given to one concern, but 1 did no: allude to that concern by name, because that is always undesirable. In my opinion, the Treasurer&#39;s proposal gave that concern an advantage. But its representatives have never approached me. I had not spoken to the local manager, nor did I know him until last night, when, after I had delivered a speech declaring&#39; my position, he addressed me with a view to correcting misapprehensions which he thought were in my mind. </para>

                        <para>- Of course not. I mention it merely because honorable members have said that canvassing has been going on. This gentleman never spoke to me before in the whole course of our discussions. I admit that there is too much lobbying Business firms have a right to put their cases before members, who cannot possess an intimate acquaintance with all the details affected by every proposal.  But &#39; it is highly undesirable that, instead of&#39; forwarding circulars or letters, their representatives should constantly attend in the lobbies of Parliament House. I hope that we shall not hear again such remarks as those of the Minister of Trade and Customs. </para>

                        <para>- I have often objected before that proposals were being viewed from the stand-point of one private concern or another, and to the bandying of names about the Chamber, as though honorable members were fighting to give an advantage to or to injure private firms. I do not think that any honorable member does that. Very few regard these matters except as their fiscal views dictate. In my opinion, the intention always is to do what is best for Australia. While we need not pay too much attention to remarks made outside, we cannot disregard insinuations of dishonesty in this Chamber without falling to the level of. the criticism brought against us.. </para>

                    <para>.- I believe that honorable members who intend to vote to make kerosene free are actuated only by a desire to benefit the users of oil throughout Australia. That is why we resisted one set of Ministerial proposals, and when another was substituted, I was the first to point out that it tended to give a monopoly to one importing concern at the expense of another - to benefit the Standard Oil Trust, concerning which charges have been made and withdrawn this afternoon. I am of &#39; opinion that every honorable member who will vote for free kerosene will be moved to do so only bv his desire to study the interests of his constituents, and of the people of Australia, and no one who has looked into the facts will have the temerity to offer a contrary suggestion. </para>

                    <para>.- This, I think, is a reasonable proposal. Printers doing a superior class of work require the very best kind of roller available, and my experience is that some rollers in hot climates melt. That is more particularly the case in country offices, and, in the interests of the . country printer, this request should be agreed to. The requested duty of 25 per cent., together with freight, insurance, and other charges levied on the imported article, will mean a protection of about 50 per cent, to the local manufacturers of printing roller composition, and if that is not sufficient for them they had better look around for some improvement in their methods. I hope that the Committee will agree to the request. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member said that during the hot weather rollers made of such composition frequently melted. I have used rollers made of Australian composition, and know that they do not melt. I have been identified with the use of such rollers in a climate such as that of Bourke, and know that it is entirely wrong to assert that they melt during hot weather. The local composi- ton will compare favorably with that &#91;produced abroad. It is made specially to withstand the climate of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am surprised that a protectionist should ask such a question: The duty is necessary to secure the local market. There is, in many cases, a prejudice in favour of an imported article, notwithstanding that the local production is &#34;superior, and unless we beat down that prejudice by making it more profitable to purchase local manufactures, many Australian productions that are superior to those from abroad will not have a fair chance. Many people will pay a little more for an imported article under the mistaken belief that that produced locally is not up to the standard. They take it for granted that an Australian production cannot be so good as is one produced abroad. It is for that reason that I advocate the retention of the duty. Local competition will prevent any undue inflation of prices. This duty is necessary, not to enable local manufacturers to obtain a better price, but to circumvent the prejudice which exists against the local manufacture. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Macquarie is entitled to narrate his experience of the use of locally-made printing roller composition - an experience gained, I believe, in the terribly hot climate of Orange, some 2,500 feet above sea level. When I spoke of rollers melting, I had in mind printing offices in districts in Western Australia where during the summer the temperature is very high: I have no prejudice against the local article; but I have used it in the West, and have known it to melt during hot weather. . </para>

                        <para>- It is sufficient to say that it was made in Australia. As a matter of fact, when spending my own money, I always give a preference to local productions, so that the honorable member&#39;s reference, to a prejudice against Australian manufactures is, so far as I am concerned, quite beside the mark. The manufacture of printing roller composition involves very little labour. Only unskilled labour is required; any one &#34;can make printers&#39; rollers who is able to pour a bucket of molten composition into a mould. In these circumstances, if the local manufacturers cannot carry on with a duty of 25 per cent., plus a natural protection equal to 25 per cent., they must be in a very bad way. </para>

                    <para>.- I am willing to. accept the statement made  by the honorable member for Macquarie, that the quality of the local article is superior to that of the imported, although I cannot overlook the remarks made by the honorable member for Coolgardie. But if this composition can be made so successfully in Australia, why are we not in a position in connexion with this item to give the dear old Motherland a preference of 10 per cent., as requested by the Senate? The honorable member for Macquarie has told us that printing roller composition imported from Great Britain is superior to that coming from foreign countries, and surely in view of that statement we should give some recognition to the product of the Mother Country. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot understand the opposition to this request, in view of the decision on the last item, the object of which was to provide work in the planing of slabs. The Senate, acting in logical sequence, now suggests that the raw material shall be brought in free, and we have the Treasurer opposing the suggestion. </para>

                        <para>- Do I gather from that interjection that this is a question of class ? It started as a question of protection ; but now we are asked to resist any further benefits to the marble worker, on the score that the proposed amendment will help rich people, with whom honorable members opposite have no  sympathy. The motion seems a clear indication &#34;of the fact that the Ministry are prepared to accept any increase of duty apart altogether from the question of protection - even an increase  on the raw material, which, after all, is a freetrade duty, to which free-traders can have no great objection. </para>

                    <para>.- I must oppose the motion proposed by the Treasurer. The retention of this duty will impose a tax upon the raw material of a struggling industry, particularly in Victoria. I admit that marble suitable for certain purposes can be obtained in Australia, but those who are engaged in the finer works of sculpture - in statuary, for example - are compelled to use the finest marble they can get. </para>

                        <para>- the price they get for their work does not seem to indicate that. The demand for that class of work is so limited that they complain of the severity of the times. Yet we are asked to increase that severity by imposing an. unnecessary burden upon them. If these persons followed their own inclinations they would use Australian marble for the finer classes of sculpture. But they point out that the local marble has certain defects. </para>

                        <para>- They not only knock a piece out of the chisel, but cause a defect in the statuary by impairing its beauty. As the sculptors themselves say &#39;that we&#39; have not a sufficiently fine marble for use in the  more delicate classes of sculpture, and no amount of duty will cure this grave defect. It is also pointed out that, after working, the local marble loses its. whiteness and assumes a dirty muddy-like tint. I think that for a little while longer we ought to admit marble free. </para>

If we abolish the duty upon marble we shall detrimentally affect the production of that article in Australia, a course of action which seems to me absolutely unjustifiable. I hope that the Committee will agree to the retention of this duty, in the interests of the marble industry. </para>

Under these circumstances, I think we should retain this duty of 10 per cent. Marble may be the raw material of the sculptor, but it is the finished article of the quarryman, and the latter, needs to be encouraged just as much as does any one else. </para>

Statuary is not a necessary of life. Persons who can afford to have statuary about their places can afford to pay a little duty upon the raw material used in its production. Since this item was previously under consideration, I have paid a visit to Angaston, in South Australia, where some of the finest deposits of marble to be found in the . Commonwealth exist- marble which is suitable for all practical purposes. If anybody desires to use better marble than can be obtained there, he can &#39;certainly afford to pay a duty of 10 per cent, upon it. </para>

In New South Wales, we have a number of extensive quarries, containing the best marble to be found in the world. There is every reason why we should encourage the quarrying of this marble, owing to the cheap transit charges levied upon other marbles which answer the same purpose, but which do not provide our own. people with employment, or enable us to develop our own resources. In this instance, at any rate, there is very little danger of the duty being added to the price of the commodity. </para>

I have received correspondence to that effect from the tin-plate makers, who say that a duty of 15 per cent, is a heavy tax on them. The statement that it is to be made here is rather vague. We do not know that the local article will be satisfactory, or that it will be produced at a price at which persons can afford to buy it. </para>

                    <para>.- Those who are of the opinion that insecticides should be free - which was the decision of this Committee originally - ought not to vote for the motion. The effect of  carrying it would be to remove them from this paragraph, and include them in paragraph b, under which they would be dutiable at 25 per cent. The more consistent course for those who think that disinfectants and insecticides should remain free would be to vote against the Senate&#39;s request. Then, again, those who consider that they&#39; should be taxed, . should vote against the suggested amendment, because, under it, sheep, cattle, and horse washes would be free, whilst articles of infinitely more importance to the health of humanity would remain dutiable. Is there any sense in saying that we can make disinfectants for use in hospitals as well as for general sanitary purposes, but that it is impossible for us to manufacture sheep, cattle, and horse washes? </para>

                        <para>- Why should we strike out insecticides and disinfectants from a paragraph under which they are free in order to make them free under another line? If free wire netting is of importance, surely it is of great importance that the public of Australia shall be able to obtain free of duty the best forms of disinfectants. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. The farmer who does not want to use Cooper&#39;s sheep dip may make a dip from arsenic, although such a dip has not the same effect on- wool. Some men prefer Cooper&#39;s, some favour Quibell&#39;s, and some again favour Thomas&#39; - a local sheep dip. They are all excellent dips ; but their formulae are secret. In no country are sheep dips taxed. The adoption of the Senate&#39;s request will bring about confusion, such as occurred in connexion with the recent revision of the Tariff of New Zealand. &#39; In revising the Tariff, the Parliament of the Dominion first of all made sheep washes and cattle and horse washes free, with the result that it was held that those words referred only, to fluid washes. If the Minister wishes all sheep, cattle, and horse washes to be free, he should propose as a modification the addition of the words, &#39;&#39; in fluid or powdered form.&#34; That amendment was made in the New Zealand Tariff. The principal insecticide used is made abroad from the powdered flowers of the <inline font-style="italic">pyrethrum roseum.</inline> The honorable member for Hindmarsh says that insecticide is made in Melbourne and Adelaide As a matter of fact, the powder is imported, and simply put up in tins here. </para>

                        <para>- The most effective insecticide for destroying flies and fleas is the pure <inline font-style="italic">pyrethrum roseum</inline> powder. That powder is blended in order to secure cheaper forms of insecticides, and those blends are sold under different names. In the interests of cleanliness and public health, insecticides should be free- Many disinfectants are used in hospitals as well as for cleansing drains and for other sanitary purposes. They can be made where-ever there is a chemist ; but there are many patent preparations which are excellent and valuable. I hope that the Committee will disagree with the Senate&#39;s requests. Failing that, the Minister should certainly propose a modification adding to the words &#34;cattle -and horse washes,&#34; the words &#34; in fluid or powdered form.&#34; I move - </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Treasurer will see his way clear to propose a modification providing that the <inline font-style="italic">pyrethrum</inline> flowers which are the base of all insecticides, shall be free. They are grown in Austria, more particularly in  the provinces of the Danube, and my information is that not one ounce of these flowers is produced in Australia. I do not know why they should not be grown here, but it would be better to encourage their cultivation by means of a bounty than by a duty. If the  duty  be charged on the  flower&#39;s, as well as on the packages, we shall injure the tinning, printing, and paper industries. These insecticides are sent in in parcels of 1 oz. to 3 ozs. weight, but, if they are admitted free in 28-lb. parcels, the small &#39;manufacturer may purchase them, and, in manufacturing the insecticides, compete with the largest manufacturers, with benefit to the other industries ! have mentioned. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Melbourne has shown that there is no difficulty in manufacturing insecticides here ; and, as a matter of fact, I hold in my hand a list of twenty-one manufacturers in Victoria alone. I do not know how many more there are in the Commonwealth,; but they are not doing great business, in view of the fact that the value of the importations increased from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;29,611</inline> in 1903 to over ,&#163;52,000 in 1906. I may say that I have been over the establishment of the well-known manufacturing chemists, Messrs. Faulding and Company, of Adelaide, and, in answer to-  inquiries, I was informed that they could undoubtedly produce the articles now under discussion, but that they had to contend against a certain prejudice. </para>

South Australia is doing one-fifth of this trade of the Commonwealth ; and it is possible that in the other States these flowers may be grown. In any case, it has been proved that the Australian manufacturers can do exactly what the British manufacturers do. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to see all these articles placed on the free list. No case has been made out why they should receive protection. The great interests in which these preparations are used demand more attention at our hands than does the question of providing employment for a few&#39; individuals in our cities. As a matter of fact, it would not require many hands to manufacture sufficient disinfectants to sup- ply the needs of the whole Commonwealth. I ask the Committee who will be chiefly affected by this duty? Unquestionably, it will be the poorer classes of the community. The public health demands that we should enable our people to procure disinfectants of the best quality at the lowest possible price.&#39; Further, if we impose a heavy duty upon these articles, we shall &#34; hit &#34; the hospitals. </para>

                <para>It seems to me that we have now reached a stage when we are disposed to forget what we have done previously. We appear to ignore the fact that a Royal Commission was appointed at the cost of many thousands of pounds to investigate the operation of the  first Commonwealth Tariff. The Government, too, in their desire to tax everything that is used by the producers, seem to forget their original proposals. Ever since the Commonwealth was established, insecticides, sheep washes, and disinfectants, have been admitted free. But now, on account of a decision of the Senate - I believe by a very narrow majority - they are prepared to levy a heavy duty upon these articles. It has been clearly shown that the product from which insecticides are manufactured is not grown in Australia. If there is one thing more than another that we must deplore, it is the number of insect pests to be found in the Commonwealth. The man who makes his living from the soil is at constant war with pests of all descriptions, and insecticides are a valuable aid to him in that connexion. Similarly, we ought not to place any embargo upon disinfectants. I hope that the Committee will not do anything adverse to the interests of our producers. I have received a number of letters from my own State, intimating that the imposition of a tax upon any of these articles will have a very injurious effect. I shall not be able to support the Government in departing from the proposal which they originally submitted to this Committee, and from the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. </para>

                    <para>.- It is only in accordance with the fitness of things that honorable members who carried a tax upon tombstones should now support a tax upon hospitals. I desire to&#39; point out that the Tariff Commission recommended that this item should be placed upon the free list, that the Government originally adopted their recommendation, and that this Committee also agreed to it. Yet the Treasurer now exhibits a complete change of front. I need scarcely remind honorable members that locally-made disinfectant is already sold at half the price of the imported article, and consequently there is no need to extend to it any protection whatever. It is, so I am informed by chemical experts, a very inferior article, and, therefore, not nearly as effective as are the imported standard brands. Further, more than two-thirds of the imported disinfectants are put up by local labour in locally-made tins and bottles, and the labels attached to them are printed locally. Consequently, these importations provide a considerable amount of employment. As a matter of fact, I am informed, the cost of the labour thus employed amounts to two-thirds of their entire selling cost. Except as regards sheep dips and cattle washes, which comprise about 80 per cent, of the total importations, the importation of disinfectants has recently declined. The honorable member for Wilmot has already referred to the fact that these disinfectants enjoy a very high measure of natural protection </para>

I hold in my hand a table of bacteriological tests to which various disinfectants were subjected, and I find that the most efficient is cyllin (medical) Jves, which, upon a B. typhosus organism was found to be twenty times stronger than pure carbolic acid. The other disinfectants included perchloride of mercury, cyllin creolin, lysol, Pearson&#39;s antiseptic, zotal, bactox, carbolic acid, lozar formalin,, chinosol, chloride of zinc, lysoform, and listerine.

And I am informed that the cheaper kinds of locally-produced disinfectants are practically useless, because of the adulteration which takes place, and, perhaps, because of the lack of experience of local manufacturers.- It is essential that the disinfectants used in our hospitals and elsewhere shall be of the best quality, and obtainable as cheaply as possible. Therefore, I shall vote for the first proposal of the Government, namely, to- make disinfectants and insecticides free. </para>

I would point out . that inferior lines of both imported and locally-made articles can be obtained. As for the tests&#39; which he has quoted. I am informed that recent tests by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bull,</inline> M.D., B.S., Director of the Bacteriological Laboratory at the Melbourne University, have proved beyond doubt that phenyle of Australian manufacture is quite equal in co-efficiency and quality to the best imported. What better authority than <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bull</inline> can we have? According to the Opposition, no Australian maker is capable of producing anything good, and we must depend on foreigners for everything. </para>

                        <para>- He pointed out that imported disinfectants sell for nearly twice as much as those which are locally made, showing conclusively that the imported article is bought, either because of the prejudice against the locally made, or because it is better, and that there is no need for the proposed protection. Australia should fall into line with the other countries of the world by allowing disinfectants and insecticides to be admitted free. In New South Wales, the Government,, and many municipal councils, distribute disinfectants free to householders, to encourage their use, in the interests of the public health. Therefore, we should make this article as cheap as possible. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt many municipal authorities would distribute insecticide, too, if applied to. The Government proposes to allow 28-lb. packets of insecticides to come in free, and to make dutiable anything imported in smaller quantities. That seems to me an unworthy proposal. The packing into smaller parcels is a mere bagatelle, and gives opportunities for adulteration. I wish also to emphasize the point made by the honorable member for Wentworth, that the; fruit-growers of Australia should be studied. They have all they can do to make ends meet. It is not the pastoralists, but the fruit-growers, who have the greatest struggle, yet sheep dips and cattle dips are free while the insecticides and disinfectants are made dutiable. Every kind of fruit is. attacked by its own particular pest, and most of them by more than one- </para>

Under the Victorian Pure Foods and Drugs Act,  all disinfectants have to be tested, and the results printed on their labels.

                        <para>- The honorable member did not give us tests of Australian-made disinfectants. If* the locally-made article were what the honorable member stated, customers would not be found for it, because the facts would be set out on the labels. Although generalities have been indulged in by members of the Opposition, no evidence has been brought forward to show that Australian-made disinfectants are not equal to those made elsewhere. </para>

                    <para>.- The tests I gave were those of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> S. Ainslie Walker, joint author of the <inline font-style="italic">Standardization of Disinfectants,</inline> and, as such, are worthy of every consideration. I do not know the result of Melbourne tests of Australian disinfectants; the information I gave was merely to show that there are recognised brands, which have gained the highest marks as possessing the. greatest disinfecting power. Like the honorable member for Hindmarsh, I have to rely on the information of experts - medical gentlemen and others - who ought to know more about these things than mere laymen. </para>

                        <para>- I resent the Minister&#39;s language, and shall not allow him to force statements into my mouth. If, in the confusion caused by a bombardment of interjections, I made a slip, I am not going to be pinned down to it. I say that, from information which I have received, &#39;I have reason to believe that the best imported English disinfectants are far and away ahead of the cheaper brands made in Australia. I was quoting the tests of the various disinfectants, whose names I gave. None of us, except medical men or scientists, can profess to be experts, and we have to rely on such information as we are able to gather from the best sources available to us. I have put before the Committee the information that I have been able to obtain, and I am entitled to do that just as the honorable member who interjects is entitled to give what information he obtains from any source. </para>

                    <para>. - I am willing to concede that these disinfectants are of equal value. If they are not effective, they will not find, any buyers. The effect of these proposed duties of  25  and  15  per cent, would be to increase; prices to that extent. The honorable member for Bourke smiles .as if he&#39; were an innocent. Does he not know that the object df protection is to give local manufacturers a margin on which to work upon the ground that the cost of production here is in many cases more than elsewhere? The Government are seeking to increase the prices of these imports by 25 per cent. If the foreigner does not pay the duty-, then the consumer must do so. The prices of local productions will also be in: creased if these duties be imposed. Sheep washes are free. It is proposed to impose heavy duties on disinfectants and insecticides n.e.i. We must not forget that many men make sheep-dips from disinfectants, and that washes so prepared are just as effective as are many that are put up and sold under various names. Undoubtedly, the intention of the Government in supporting this request is to increase the cost to the consumer. Their policy is to tax the producer. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to find that the honorable member disagrees with me. If honorable members desire to improve our staple products, they will make these articles as cheap as possible to the. consumer. Some honorable members think that the item is a comparatively trivial one. As a matter of fact, millions of sheep and cattle are treated with these materials, and the imposition of these duties will mean that the producers will have to pay into the revenue an enormous sum. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Robertson represented a few nights ago that an Adelaide firm had not a foundry, although it has possessed one for thirty years.  His  information in regard to the prices of insecticides, and disinfectants is of precisely the same value. I know that he is sorry for what he said the other night, and he ought to be sorry for what he has said as to what will be the effect of these duties on the poor users of insecticides and disinfectants. Little&#39;s English phenyle is sold to-day in Victoria at 5s. 2d. per dozen, whereas McKellan and Ramsay&#39;s phenyle - a local production - is sold at 3s. 6d. per dozen. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps the honorable member&#39;s bad pronunciation has led to the mistake. However, it is the article from which insecticides are extracted, and it is the smell rather than anything else that that makes it effective. It is not a poison ; those insecticides which are poisonous are composed of poisonous material imported into the country. These can be compounded just as cheaply as they can be imported. </para>

                    <para>. - Apart from the objection which has been raised by the leader of the Opposition, I should like to ask the Treasurer whether he is satisfied that the furniture which we expressly relieved from these high fixed duties will not be brought under the item if the request be agreed to. The proposed new paragraph will cover couches and lounges constructed not wholly of cane. I am satisfied that the Department will so construe it. Austrian cane couches, for instance, are made partly of wood, and the backs of Chinese cane chairs and lounges are supported by wood. The Department of Trade and Customs has power to charge the higher duty where there is any doubt as to the rate that should be imposed. </para>

                        <para>- Many couches and chairs imported from the East are made partly of wood and partly of cane. Austrian couches have cane backs and cane seats, and comparatively little wood is used in their construction. I do not think that these high duties are necessary or desirable, and I ask the Treasurer if he insists upon supporting the- request to agree, at least, to a modification that will make it clear that the item will not cover the class of furniture &#39; which we have already freed from heavy fixed duties? </para>

                        <para>- That is all very well. We have this assurance by the Minister, at the instance of an officer, but we have no assurance that the decision will continue to be observed. .We must take ordinary precautions to se.e that our proposals express exactly what we mean. I submit that duties of 40 per cent, and 30 per cent, are sufficiently high ; but before I vote against the proposal made, I ask the Treasurer to make it clear that the couches and chairs which were specially exempted will not be included. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for North Sydney need have no apprehensions. The articles which this item is intended to cover are those which come from Japan, the Straits Settlements, and China, and the A section of the Tariff Commission had them in their mind when the duties were recommended which were originally introduced by the Government. I have here a piece of imported bamboo, which is riddled by insects, and the honorable member for Melbourne, who has had a trip to the East, knows exactly what the position is there. Some objection has been raised to lobbying ; and I may say that the samples of wood I have in my possession were not supplied by any manufacturer, but by the secretary of the wicker- workers&#39; trades union. Here is a piece of Australian blackwood, covered with pith, which insects will not touch. These insects, imported from the East, get into the furniture already in use in Australia : and I know a gentleman, into whose piano these insects got from some of the imported  chairs or settees. He promptly rushed the instrument into an auction room ; and it was not long before it was in the auction room again. There is hardly an honorable member, I suppose, but who has had an experience of the ravages of these insects in furniture ; and, as has already been pointed out, the willow industry of Tasmania has, from this cause, been absolutely ruined. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. French,</inline> the Government Entomologist of Victoria, who, of course, is unbiased, is very strongly against the Importation of furniture which carries these insects ; and I urge upon honorable members the necessity for imposing a high duty, so as to prevent, as far as possible, these insects from coming in. Those who are in favour of a White Australia ought not to be in favour of the importation of this furniture from the East. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the figures by me, but the evidence of witnesses from every State was in the minds of the A section of the Tariff Commission when the duties were recommended. I do not think that this proposed duty would affect the Austrian bentwood furniture, which is made wholly of wood, with a cane seat ; it is the bamboo and. wicker furniture from the East that we desire to keep out. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to say that there is more than the borer in question. The honorable member for Yarra said that all this wicker and bamboo furniture came from the East, and, when 1 asked- him how much came, he simply repeated that all came. I find from the figures, however, that the total consumption of furniture is valued at about  , &#163;2,000,000  per annum. Of that value we imported from Japan last year , &#163;1,ooo worth, from China  , &#163;1,500  worth, and from the Straits Settlements  . &#163;900  worth. Altogether, we imported . &#163;3,800 worth of this furniture last year. Australia will be ruined if we continue at that rate. The  value  of our importations in this connexion represents a little over one-tenth of  1  per cent, of the total, furniture consumed in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Then it is the statement of the Customs officers, which is a thousand times worse. During the past three months I have had a little experience of the way in which those officers can stretch their imaginations in interpreting this Tariff. I know perfectly well what they will do if- they possibly can. Their idea is to get at the public every time. In reference to one item, I brought under their notice the statement of the Treasurer, as recorded in&#39; <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but they told me that they could take no notice of that, and that they must interpret the Tariff as they found it. Let us embody our desires in this schedule. I intend to move that the words &#34; except Austrian Chairs &#34; be inserted after the word &#34; Cane,&#34; unless the Treasurer agrees to the insertion of the words already suggested. </para>

                    <para>. - The proposal now made is that these goods, shall not &#34;be allowed in at a lower duty than 45 per cent. The cost of such articles as settees and lounges of wicker, . bamboo, or cane, made in the East, is only about&#163;5 5s., for a set of eight pieces. This duty of 10s. each would be equivalent to more than 100 per cent, upon such articles. As the Minister says that he does not desire a duty of more than 45 per cent., I make the suggestion that the amount of 10s. should be reduced to 5s. Will the Treasurer accept that suggestion, or does he wish to clap a duty of 100 per cent, on goods of this description? </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Robertson says that . the duty proposed would amount to 100 per cent. But is he aware of the wages paid in the East? The wages in Japan are higher than those in China ; but even in Japan a man for a day&#39;s work of twelve hours receives only1s. 2&#189;d. In Melbourne, under the Factories Act, a cabinetmaker is paid 8s. for a day&#39;s work of eight hours. So that the wages paid here are 600 per cent, higher than those paid in Japan. The honorable member for Parramatta has alluded to the small quantity of this description of furniture that is imported. It is small if we take the money value of it; but I ask honorable members to remember the destructive character of the . insect which is so frequently introduced in bamboo furniture. </para>

                            the Victorian Entomologist, whose name has attained world-wide fame, says that the insect is a native of Japan. Twenty years ago it was quite unknown in this country, but at the present time it is quite common. If a piece of wicker furniture from Hong Kong or Japan is introduced into a house, within eighteen months or two years the ravages of the insect will be noticed.

                        <para>- But, apart from, the alleged ravages of this insect, what reason is there for a prohibitive duty ? To tell me that 10s. is a fair . duty to put on a wicker chair, is to make an assertion  which I cannot believe. _ The duty is extravagant, and I am surprised and disgusted that such a proposition should be made in regard to articles of such common use: Wicker furniture is very generally in use in the tropical parts of Australia, and is to be found in the homes of people who cannot afford to pay high&#39; prices for wood furniture. It is used on the score of economy&#39; as well as comfort. I suppose that all of us- have bought it in our time. </para>
