I refer to a scheme which would provide for the transmission of cablegrams which would be open to the whole of the British press. As I have said, I do not desire to trench in any way upon the questions which appear on the notice-paper ; I simply ask whether the Government will take that point into consideration in dealing with the matter ? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Kennedy is, . in consequence of his duties as  Chairman  of Committees, confined to the chair for a very long time, as I also am through being in charge of the Tariff. No doubt, the work has become very irksome to him. I hope that we shall be able to finish our work on the Tariff by next Tuesday or Wednesday, and, if it  De  possible, that will be done. Honorable members opposite, judging by their outcries, are extremely anxious about this matter, but they are not going to disturb me in the slightest degree. I shall carry the Tariff through in the ordinary way. </para>

                            <para>- Following up the Minister&#39;s answer to the last question, I desire to&#39; ask him whether he does not think that he has made a misstatement of fact in alleging that honorable members on this side of the Chamber have delayed the Tariff. Is it not a fact within the Treasurer&#39;s own knowledge that several honorable members on this side of the House have refrained from speaking, in order to expedite the passage of the Tariff, whilst honorable members on his own side have continued speaking for the purpose of prolonging the debates? </para>

                                <para>-In reply to the honorable member, I have to state that it is scarcely right to say that any honorable members on this side of the House have endeavoured to prolong the debates. That statement is not correct, so far as I know. I do not say that the whole of the debating has come from the members of the Opposition. What I do say is that a large proportion of it has come from that quarter - from the Opposition corner. As far as the Government are concerned, we shall proceed as expeditiously as is reasonably possible to complete the Tariff, and I hope that we shall be able to do so by Tuesday or Wednesday next. </para>

With reference to another part of the right honorable member&#39;s question, I have to say that, as he is aware, there is a certain case which is now <inline font-style="italic">sub judice</inline> - being under the consideration of the High Court - and the Government are unable to complete the Bill referred to until judgment in that case is delivered. The Prime Minister said the other night, however, that the Government are quite ready to complete their Bill. </para>

                                <para>- Honorable members should know, and, I believe, do know, that the Government desire to dispose of the remaining business as soon as possible. But I must draw attention to this fact, that yesterday we did not sit for a very good reason, and one as to which I am sure no honorable member would offer any objection. Had it not been for the very unforeseen and sad event which prompted that adjournment, the House would have sat yesterday, and would probably have disposed of a great deal of business. I hope to be able to return the Tariff to the Senate on Tuesday next, or, at the  latest, on Wednesday. </para>

We are making inquiries into the matter, and we find that the task is a very difficult one, because no assistance&#34; has been received from those who have complained. But we have asked them to help us in every way that they can, and it is our earnest desire to prevent, if possible, the importation of inferior guns. Immediately I obtain definite information upon the matter, I shall be glad to advise the honorable member. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask the Treasurer whether he is aware that a large number of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic extensions in New South Wales, which have been approved, are &#34; held up &#34;&#39; because the money voted for these purposes has been exhausted, and that in consequence great public inconvenience is being, suffered. If so, what steps does he propose to take to remedy this condition of affairs? </para>

                            <para>- I cannot state exactly how much ; but it must be remembered that all the Treasurer has to work on, until the Additional Estimates are passed, is the Treasurer&#39;s Advance, and that Advance cannot meet every demand until it is recouped by amounts upon the Additional Estimates. I am exceedingly anxious to have those Estimates passed.. They are, no doubt, very large, and the works to which the honorable member refers, and&#39; many other works, have to be carried out; but, as I say, the Treasurer&#39;s Advance cannot meet all such demands. That is the reason for the delay, a.nd the sooner the Additional Estimates are passed- the sooner the money will be available. J have gone to considerable length - indeed, I have gone as far as I possibly can, financially - in&#62;  allowing tenders to be called for works for which the money has not yet been voted, so that no delay shall take place after the Estimates are passed. </para>

Uniforms to the value mentioned were loaned for use at a Military Tournament, Aldershot, England, the display being intended to be representative of all the Forces of the Empire. No Colonial troops were present. I am not quite sure, but I think I am correct in saying that the occasion was in connexion with military charities. These uniforms have since been returned without cost to the Commonwealth. </para>

The Department advises me that the request ought to be rejected, inasmuch as its adoption would lead to great confusion. I shall, therefore, ask honorable members to vote against the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - I trust that the Committee will not reduce the duties further. We have imposed certain duties upon empty bottles under other items. This item includes cut-glass bottles that contain perfumes, &#38;c. Local people who put up perfumes and so on  will have to pay a heavy duty on the empty bottles, while if the duty on this item is unduly reduced the importers who bring in the full bottles will have a distinct advantage. That will be an injustice to those in Australia who put up that class of goods, importing the empty bottles, and having to compete with those who import the full bottles. </para>

                        <para>- I beg the honorable member&#39;s pardon. The Senate proposes that some should be taxed at 5 per cent, and some at 35 per cent. There is only one little sub-item that the Senate proposes should be duty free. If anything in the world should be duty free, surely it is these school requisites? I should like the Minister to say what he proposes to do about it. </para>

                        <para>- Glass thermometers are used very extensively in hospitals. They are very expensive articles. Not only is their initial cost heavy, but they are constantly broken, and have to be replaced. The supply of thermometers is a heavy item of expenditure to nurses, medical men, and hospitals. I am satisfied that we shall do a great injustice if we make dearer these absolutely necessary articles. Every one knows that when a man is sick his temperature has to be taken frequently. </para>

A barometer is necessary nearly everywhere, especially in tropical districts, to give warning of storms, and the thermometer is in daily use by every one.

                    <para>.- I think that I understand why the Treasurer, in common with other strong protectionists, is anxious to remove these articles from an item under which they bear a low duty, so that they will fall under another item which carries a high duty. I think that the explanation is that the protectionist microbe which gets into the blood of some protectionist, and sets up a fever, is considered worthy of special development. It has been suggested by some honorable members that this industry is carried on, not in Collingwood, as we are usually told, but in Sydney and Brisbane. Whether it is carried on in those places or not, I consider that those who are obliged to have recourse to the use of these instruments in hospitals, sick rooms, and elsewhere should be able to procure them at the lowest possible price. So far as I can see, the only effect of raising the duty will be to increase their cost to the users. I shall certainly oppose the motion. </para>

During the debate, another member wished to know what standard we used, was it the Berlin, Paris, or London. Our standard instruments are all certified at the Kew Observatory, England, and each one is accompanied with a certificate of absolute accuracy, and all the instruments made by us correspond exactly with those standards, and standard temperatures, or standard weights, or measurements are the same whether in France, England, Germany, Australia, or any other part of the world. </para>

The grading is everywhere a mechanical process, so that there can be no question as to its accuracy, the graduations being marked on the glass by a machine. I appeal to the Committee for justice to an Australian industry, to assist it in overcoming the prejudice which exists against everything not bearing a British hall-mark. </para>

                    <para>.- In support of the modification proposed bv the honorable member for Hunter, I would re-  mind the Committee that, in the letter quoted by the honorable member for Brisbane, it is claimed that the industry to which the request relates is already established in Brisbane and Sydney, and it also exists, I understand, in Melbourne. Freetraders are invariably told by protectionists that the object of a protective tariff is to encourage the starting of industries and to help them over their infantile stages, and that once fairly started they do not need protection. Since this industry has been started, and .has apparently flourished and developed under free-trade conditions, the argument for protection in this case falls to the ground. Then we have the further naive admission by the manufacturers in Brisbane - an admission that we do not often obtain from our protectionist friends - that they desire an increased duty to enable them to charge a higher price, because they cannot compete against the low prices charged for the superior imported article. Here we have another protectionist &#39; fallacy exposed. Our protectionist friends opposite never fail to assure us that protection cheapens prices. These manufacturers point out that what they object to is cheapness - they object to the public being able to obtain these instruments at a low price. We are asked to impose a duty which will be practically prohibitive in its operation in order that local manufacturers may sell an inferior article at a higher price.&#34; We are here to see that the public are not robbed or unduly fleeced for the gain of any firm or individual, and we should be wanting in our duty if we accepted the request. I support the proposed modification. </para>

I think that honorable members are free to vote against the requested amendment. The honorable member for Brisbane said what was very much to the point, and whilst I do not know that , a case has been made out for taxing barometers, I consider that we have taken the sting out of the requested amendment by the modification providing for the insertion of the words &#34; and clinical thermometers.&#34; </para>

                <para>Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) &#91;4.15&#93;.- I suggested to the Treasurer that he should accept the proposed modification as the controversy ranged chiefly round the question of whether or not clinical thermometers should be subjected to a higher duty. Before that modification was agreed to a number of honorable members who had listened to the previous debate left the chamber, and they will probably return under the impression that clinical thermometers are still affected by the request. I hope that it will be made clear that the Treasurer has gracefully given way in respect of those instruments, and that the motion now relates really to a request in respect of other instruments which were not even mentioned during the debate. </para>

                    <para>.- Apart from clinical thermometers, the articles included in this item to which I attach much importance&#39; are barometers. To levy a heavy tax upon these instruments, which are used by small coastal vessels, would subject that class of shipping to an increased disability. In this connexion, we must recollect that these vessels have to compete with ships which get their barometers free of duty. Seeing that lives at sea might be imperilled as the result of vessels not being equipped with barometers, surely we might place these articles upon the free list. Of course, oversea shipping companies do not care whether we impose an additional &#163;3 upon their barometers or not. But there are many small coastal vessels which, as the result of the operation of such a duty, would purchase a cheaper and less efficient article. </para>

The little yachting that I have done has taught me the extreme value of using a barometer off the coast of New South Wales, where sudden changes from the south are always heralded by a sharp rise in that instrument.

                        <para>- May I point out that these imported kinematographs, bioscopes, and kine to scopes are very valuable aids to the education of the community. They are used to reproduce the general characteristics of foreign countries. They serve to illustrate the habits, dress, and customs of the people of those countries, and also the scenery to be found there. It is the practice &#39; for schoolmasters to take their pupils to- places of amusement where these machines are in use, for the purpose of increasing their geographical knowledge. The children thus become just as familiar with the architecture, the type of people, and the general characteristics of distant&#39; lands as they would be if they actually travelled through them. For a very small sum they can thus enjoy all the advantages incidental to travel, which, under ordinary circumstances, would involve a long voyage, and very considerable cost. Bv the use of kinematographs, bioscopes, and kine to scopes, all the scenes associated with these distant lands are brought vividly to their minds, and they thus derive a considerable educational benefit. I have also seen various processes of manufacture reproduced by means of these mechanical contrivances. For instance, I have seen pictures illustrative of the building of a large battleship, from the laying clown of the vessel to her launching. These pictures must come from abroad, and to impose a tax upon them is really to levy a tax upon education. I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>- - I think that the Treasurer, by this proposal, is making a worse error than if he accepted the whole suggestion of the Senate. My object is to protect those who, like the Kodak Company, are not making films here now, but who are erecting buildings and installing plant for the purpose of making them, if protection! be afforded. We do not desire, however, to have a duty on exposed films which .can be obtained only from other- parts of the world. I quite see the difficulty of making a differentiation between educational films and films for mere amusement, and, under the circumstances, I think it would be advisable to  adopt  the request of the Senate in itSentirety. </para>

                        <para>- Only some of them ; many horns are made in one piece without  seams,  and these, I do not think, are produced in Australia. Then, a difficulty arises from the fact that, when machines are purchased abroad, or imported, they are bought with the horns attached ; and I understand that it is the intention to make the machines free. How will it be possible to separate the horn from the rest of the machine? This is a distinction not worth making, seeing that  only comparatively few horns are made here. </para>

                    <para>. - The information, supplied to me with reference to these goods is that it is known that one importer of gramaphones has placed a contract locally for the supply of 1,800 horns per annum. It is further known that the output of local makers amounts to thousands of horns per annum. I have just received further information that one local contractor has entered into a contract for the supply of 4,000 per annum. Three local manufacturers make horns up to 5 feet in length. So that it is evident that a great number are made in this country. It is for that reason, doubtless, that the Senate has requested that the goods be made dutiable. </para>

                    <para>.- I am aware that one manufacturer in Melbourne alone has made between 5,000 and 6,000 of these horns already. There are twelve or fourteen factories in Sydney making horns for gramaphones. As so many of our people are employed in the industry, it would be a great mistake not to agree to the duty. I have received a letter from an importer, who gave an order to a local firm for 1,800 horns, and who says that owing to the duty being knocked off and the goods being allowed to come in free, imported horns have flooded the market, with the result that the local manufacturer had been unable to carry out his contract. I think it would be a great mistake not to agree&#39; to the request. </para>

                        <para>- The proposal of the Senate is practically that the makers of finished lenses in Australia shall be able to make them on equal terms with the makers of lenses in Great Britain. If we give this preference to the people of Great Britain,&#39; the raw material of lenses can be imported to Great Britain from abroad, made into the finished state, and shipped to Australia to compete with the Australian maker in his own limited market. In the interests of the Australian industry alone we should accept the Senate&#39;s request. In the absence of any information from the Minister we should not do this injury to an Australian industry. I have received a letter from friends in Sydney,&#39; in which they strongly urge that the proposed preference should be given. They say that the best glasses come from England, arid that consequently a general reduction in the duty might be to the detriment of those using spectacles and other glasses in Australia. I do not know whether that is so. Indeed, I fear not. If the &#39; Minister is acting upon, such a supposition, let him tell the Committee so. The Senate has made this request in order to protect an Australian industry in the first place, and, secondly, in order that the users of spectacles in Australia. - those afflicted with short or bad sight - shall be subjected to as little additional burden as this Parliament can impose upon them. </para>

                    <para>.- An industry that clamours for and obtains 30 per cent, protection ought to be the last to ask for free-trade in regard to its raw material, which is the manufactured article of some other trade. Surely Australians do not admit that they cannot produce some of these articles. I shall vote for a duty of 10 per cent., because the least that the fortunate clamourers for a 30 per cent, duty on boots, &#38;c, can do is to grant a protection of 10 per cent, to smaller manufacturers in other walks of life. </para>

                    <para>.- As I propose to vote with the Minister on this solitary occasion, I feel I owe it to the country to make some explanation. I think that the position taken up by the honorable gentleman in this case is a perfectly fair one. Only a low duty is proposed, and we should treat the people interested in this item in the same way as we have treated others. </para>

                    <para>.- I agree that the free-traders in the Committee are looking after the revenue in supporting duties of 10 and 5 per cent, on this item. I congratulate the Treasurer on having relaxed his protectionist principles so far as to be prepared to vote with free-traders on this occasion. One always experiences a certain amount of gratification upon securing recruits for his side, from whatever quarter they are obtained, and, for my part, I warmly welcome the Treasurer into the free-trade fold. </para>

It has since been represented to me very strongly that it would be scarcely advisable to make the requested amendment, and that it would be better to leave the item dutiable at 20 per cent, under the general Tariff as it left this Committee. I am not an expert in the matter, but I understand that the proposed duty of 2d. per square foot would not effect what those who advocate it desire.

                    <para>.- I agree with the Treasurer that the question raised by the Senate&#39;s request is a somewhat difficult one to decide. It should be remembered that the item covers a raw material required by bootmakers. The question is whether we should admit high-class kid worn by the people of the upper classes at a lower rate of duty .than inferior kid. There is a conflict of opinion. </para>

                    <para>. - Glace kid is now being made in Australia, and in my electorate an article is being produced whose quality is such that experts have been unable to distinguish it from imported kid. The boot manufacturers and tanners of New South Wales are agreed that a duty of 20 per cent, is a reasonable compromise, the former recognising that the tanners must receive protection. If a rate of 2d. per square foot were agreed to, it would be equivalent to a duty of i2i per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> on the best leather, and would come to as much as 33^ per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> on inferior leather, which is sometimes sold for as little as 6d. per square foot. </para>

                        <para>- Very little labour is attached to the manufacture of white leather. It is merely a question of passing the skins through a solution of sulphuric acid and salt and rubbing a little oil upon them. The imported white leather is of excellent quality, and sets a standard to local manufacturers. If the  duty were taken off, it would do a lot of good to the trade ; a much better article would be produced locally because a high standard would have to be maintained. If, however, we levy a duty of 15 or 20&#34; per cent., the tendency will be to stop the importation of white leather, and the trade must use whatever is locally produced. It will encourage that slovenliness which has prevailed in the -past. Certainly it is not necessary for the maintenance of the industry. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say in favour , of imposing a duty of 20 per cent, on this article, which is used more largely by the masses than by the upper classes. It is the cheapest and most inferior kind of leather. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Treasurer should address at least a few words to the Committee on this question. He is seeking to impose a duty of 20 per cent, on the manufacture of an article which is very easily and inexpensively produced. But he has given no reason why it should be levied. Evidently honorable members are satisfied, but I, as a member of the Committee, should like to know why I am asked to vote for a duty of 20 per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - Surely a duty of 6d.per lb. is quite sufficient protection to give in respect of these articles ! Such advertisements, when contained in a magazine, are dealt with in paragraph  d  of this item 356, but, of course, it would be out of order to allude to that item now. I do not know the effect of the alteration requested by the Senate in paragraph  a  of the item, but surely the Minister can decline their request for a duty of 35 per cent. I think that it applies to only the higher class of advertisements, and will increase the cost of themyery much. Great care has been taken in other items to insure that all legitimate printing shall be done here and therefore there is no necessity to put on this percentage in addition to, or in conjunction with, a duty of 6d. per lb. on price lists and trade catalogues. There are certain things which, owing to their very nature, must be imported. A duty of 6d. per lb. ought to be enough to prevent the importation of anything which can be printed locally. I cannot vote for a duty of 35 per cent, in addition to the duty of 6d. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- It is an alternative, but it is an addition in this sense : that two duties are proposed, namely, 6d. per lb., or 35per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> if the latter will yield a larger return. That is, I think, going too far. and therefore I shall vote against the motion. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that in making this request, the Senate was guided by the knowledge that there is a very great distinction between the values of a number of the articles included in this paragraph. Some of them are very cheap, in fact, as cheap as dirt, whilst others are of the most valuable character. Some of the advertisements are framed, and some are unframed.  A  duty of 6d. per lb. will, it is believed, operate unequally on the rubbish as compared with the highly valuable articles, and the materials included in the paragraph. The  A  section of the Tariff Commission recommended a&#39; differentiation based upon the consideration as to whether the advertisements were framed or unframed. We suggested a duty of 25 per cent, on the former and a duty of 6d. per lb. on the latter. I think that a duty of 35 per cent, is excessive. I shall be prepared to support an alternative duty of 25 per cent. That would, I consider, operate with greater equality than would an all-round duty of 6d. per lb. It is most unfair that the cheap stuff should bear the same rate of duty as the highly-finished and very valuable articles included in the paragraph. I shall vote against the proposal to fix the duty at 35 per cent., but I would suggest that, as a modification, a duty of 25 per cent., as recommended by the A section of the Tariff Commission, might be accepted. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that it was an oversight not to insert the words &#34; or the value &#34; after the words &#34;the weight&#34; in the phrase &#34;including the weight of the frame.&#34; I wonder how the honorable member for Bendigo can think that a duty of 35 per cent, .is excessive, when he knows the quantity of printed matter which is constantly imported from Germany. At the bottom of the majority of lithographed advertisements he will find some such words as &#34; Made in Bavaria.&#34; It seems to me that it is not a right state of things that printing for Australia should be done in Germany. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Coloured supplements published by newspapers are often printed in Germany. The <inline font-style="italic">Australasian,</inline> for instance, has published a coloured supplement printed in Bavaria. Such printed matter ought to be taxed. It is unreasonable that advertisements in the English language intended for use in this country should be printed in foreign lands. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of agencies such as those established here by chocolate manufacturers and others whose works are abroad, and who employ large staffs in Australia. Confectionery is taxed to the extent of 3d. and 2&#189;d. per lb., and now it is proposed that labels and advertising matter used in connexion with it shall be taxed to the extent of 50 per cent. These duties in many cases will be equal to 50 per cent., and, superimposed on those on manufactures in connexion with which the printed matter is used, they savour of protection run mad. When we raise these objections, we are told that some business men in Australia have their printing done in Japan - that at some time or other during his long business career Anthony Hordern made an importation of printed matter from that country. I do not hesitate to say that he was wrong in doing so, but are we going on the strength of a case like that to penalize the people of all countries where the workers are not sweated? If the honorable member for Corio is satisfied with the logic of his statement, he must be prepared to allow printed matter to come in free from countries where the labour conditions are satisfactory. It is absurd that we should superimpose these duties on others upon imports in connexion with which this printed matter is used. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the Senate&#39;s proposal is very reasonable. It goes without saying that under an item covering a wide range of qualities there should be some difference between the duties imposed on high and low-grade manufactures. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry to hear that. On some of the higher-priced lines the duty collected will . be as much as  2S.  6d. per lb., and I think that they should be so taxed. A great deal has been said in regard to cheap printing obtained from Japan, and I propose to read the evidence of an Australian master printer who visited that country. He states that when in Yokohama he inspected a Japanese printery, managed by a cute American, and found that it was turning out lithographic work in a style which would not be discreditable to any Australian printing office. He states that in the matter of value it would compete with anything turned out by an Australian printer. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to say that he could not find it in his own country. The Australian master printer to whom I have referred states that he discovered that wages paid in the trade in Yokohama were about one-sixth of those received by men doing similar work in Melbourne or Sydney. He gives specific instances in which men were paid 9s. per week. Surely we do not desire to expose our own workers to such competition? </para>

I really  do not know whether he is a protectionist of a free-trader. But this circumstance serves only to evidence the state of demoralization which the Committee has reached. </para>

                    <para>.- In spite of the attempt of the honorable member for Parramatta to discount the importance of the &#34;printed in Japan&#34; idea, I maintain that there is a good deal of truth in the assertion which has been made. When I examined the Christmas calendar issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hordern</inline> - which was printed in Japan - I did not fail to observe that it contained no imprint. That fact in itself is very significant. The calendar in question is a very fine production. It reproduces the Australian waratah and other native flowers, and altogether it is a work which reflects credit upon the printing establishment responsible for it. I have been informed that the contract for die production of this calendar was obtained for a clever American, who let the work out in Japan, where it could be done cheaply. If my information is correct, it evidences a new development of considerable interest to us, because, when the contract was let, it was doubtless assumed that the successful tenderer would have the work done in America, which is recognised as a high wage country, This is a case in which I shall vote for the imposition of a higher duty. I do not think that it matters what rate we impose on this item. The artistic work to which I have alluded can be successfully undertaken in Australia, and there is very widespread competition for it. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Committee will not agree to strike out the duty of 35 per cent. In many cases there is a vast difference between a fixed duty of 6d. and an elastic <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. As honorable members know, a fixed duty of 6d. may bear very heavily on one class of goods and very lightly on another. The suggested amendment was supported by the Government in the Senate, and was agreed to by seventeen votes to nine, showing clearly that the Senate felt very strongly on the point. I do not attach much importance to a vote of the kind, but when we find such a large majority, I think it is as well to agree to the request. </para>

                    <para>.- I trust that the requested amendment will be made. All these advertisements must be to advertise goods sold in Australia, and, in this connexion, the argument used so frequently by honorable members opposite as to the &#34; poor farmer &#34; or the &#34; poor miner &#34; cannot apply. I am not sure whether decorative tin plates come under this item, but, in any case, I think they should. If Australian manufacturers send Home for show cards and any sort of advertising matter, or for decorated tins in which to place their Australian goods, they ought to pay duty, because, in some of these lines, it would pay the foreign manufacturers to keep their machinery going at a loss, in order to supply us at a cheap rate. I feel confident that honorable members opposite cannot &#34; put up a fight &#34; on this item as they have on others, because no other industry can possibly be penalized if this requested amendment be made. </para>

It does seem to me to be an extraordinary thing, but it is stated here definitely that these directories have to be published very rapidly, and that the proprietors have tried over and over again to get tenders for the work to be done in Australia, without success. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is rather a strange thing that these statements should be made so confidently. It is stated in this circular, amongst other things, that they did manage to have the New South Wales work done in New South Wales, but at the end of the contract the printers declined to renew at any price, and the firm had again to transfer the work outside the Commonwealth. At any rate, 4d. per lb. is a very fair duty. I want to point out, however, that the duty of 4d. was agreed to in this Chamber after some debate, and the duty of 6d. was only carried in the Senate by the votes of two Ministers. That is what I am told. </para>

                        <para>- If the two Ministers had gone over to the other side there would have been a tie, and the duty would have remained at 4d. ; so that my statement is substantially correct. It is rather hard that the Government should agree to a rate of duty in this Chamber, and that two members of the same- Ministry should vote the other way to upset the arrangement in the Senate. Ministers may very well say, when the Senate carries a certain duty against them, that they cannot help it. But if an arrangement, made by Ministers in this Chamber is upset by the votes of Ministers in the other branch of the Legislature, it is rather hard. The proprietors of these directories employ a very large&#39; amount of labour. Of course, I cannot vouch for the statement, but they say that they spend &#163;10,000 a year in Australia upon their work. </para>

                        <para>- It is an Australian industry. There is no doubt about that. I am not objecting to its being handicapped, so far as that is done in accordance with the . protectionist policy, but even under that policy some regard might be had to an Australian industry which does employ labour. Is not a duty of 4d. per lb. enough? Surely anything that the Treasurer will accept as a compromise ought to be considered enough. </para>

There is no difficulty, from a printer&#39;s stand-point, in producing those directories here, any more than&#39; there is- in producing the directories issued by John Sands, and Company in Sydney, and Sands and McDougall in Melbourne. I think that &#39; Sands and McDougall&#39;s Directory is published in as short a time as are Wise&#39;s directories. </para>

                        <para>- There are other large printing firms in Sydney and &#34;Melbourne, which are quite capable of producing these volumes. The fact of the matter is that in the past the proprietors of Wise&#39;s directories have &#39;found- it profitable to have their work done in the Old Country, where compositors wages are as low as 28s. or 30s. per week, and proportionate amounts are paid for machining work. Under the free-trade <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> it paid these people to have their printing done abroad, by means of which they made a considerable saving on their typographical and other work in connexion with the production of their volumes. In this country the wages of compositors run from 52s. to 60s. per week. </para>

                        <para>- That is the reason why Wise&#39;s people preferred to import the printed volumes. I am satisfied that within the time that it takes to send the copy from Australia to England and to bring the books back from England to Australia, the volumes could be printed and bound in Australia. At least three months must be consumed in the two voyages, and within that time I am certain that any &#39; of the large printing establishments in Australia could produce the volumes. </para>

                    <para>.- When, this subject was before the Committee on the last occasion, the Treasurer agreed to accept a duty of 4d. per lb. by way of compromise. It is idle to compare the work contained in one of Sands and McDougall&#39;s directories with the work contained in one of Wise&#39;s directories, inasmuch as the number of names in the latter volumes is far greater. In one of Sands and McDougall&#39;s directories there are 36,000 names, whereas in one of Wise&#39;s directories, which can be compared with Sands and McDougall&#39;s, there are 116,000 names. Take a few towns. Wise&#39;s Directory of Bendigo contains 6,500 names, whereas Sands and McDougall&#39;s contains 1,500. In the case of Geelong, Wise&#39;s Directory contains 5,750 names, as against 800 names- in Sands and McDougall&#39;s. A similar comparison might be made with regard to other towns. </para>

                        <para>- I am assured that Wise&#39;s have tried to get their printing done in Australia, and have failed. It is not so much a question of the printing as of the&#39; time within which the work is done. They had one of their directories printed once in New South Wales, and the firm of printers with which they contracted refused to renew the contract. The duty of 4d. per lb. on this printed matter is a. very substantial one. When the Tariff was last before us the Treasurer voluntarily agreed to the duty of 4d. I think that the Government ought to be satisfied with that. </para>

                        <para>- The people of New South Wales will have to pay that extra price for their copies of these directories. Every person who is compelled to buy one of these volumes will be mulcted in a penalty of at least 4s. Surely that is an outrageous impost. A duty of 4d. per lb. will make the price. 2s. 8d. higher. That ought to be sufficient. If it is not sufficient protection for the local printers, I should like to know how much they would like. As the duty of 4d. was agreed to by the Treasurer on the last occasion, some substantial and weighty reason ought to be given for the reversal of our decision. I submit that no reasons have been given for an increase of the duty. </para>

                    <para>.- I was much struck with the remarks of the honorable member for Grey, who has used facts and figures to prove&#39; that this directory is peculiarly worthy of Government support, and not of Government hindrance. I have since been turning over in my mind what cause there could possibly have been for the Minister to ask us to impose the additional duty. I have come to the conclusion that he can have no other object than to benefit certain rich and important firms in Australia, competing with this directory, such as Sands and McDougall, in Melljourne, and other firms producing directories in other parts of the Commonwealth. If the Minister has any other reasons for his extraordinary action I hope he will explain them to the Committee, so that we may be able to appreciate, them at their proper weight. </para>

                        <para>- The 4d. duty was undoubtedly the Minister&#39;s own arrangement. He will always keep any promise or arrangement he makes, unless it is convenient for him to get out of it. This seems to <inline font-style="italic">ha</inline> a case in which, for some reason, it is convenient for him to get out of his compact. Unless he has some valid ground to offer to the Committee, we are forced to the conclusion that he must be seeking to benefit and advantage certain Australian competitors of this great firm. I hope the Committee will accept the facts and figures adduced by the honorable member for Grev. Until contrary information is forthcoming, every honorable member must stand by the compact that the Minister himself made. </para>

                    <para>.- One of the principal objects of the introduction of the Tariff was the removal of anomalies. We have already agreed to a duty of 6d. per lb. without any preference on the item advertisements, show cards, catalogues, &#38;c, on which we divided a few minutes ago, and honorable members on the Opposition side are now trying to create an anomaly by imposing a preferential duty of 4&#39;d. on directories. The honorable member for Wentworth stated that the New South Wales directory weighed about 8 lbs., and that, therefore, the duty on it would be 4s. Why, if he wanted to be fair, did he not take the case of an average, and not the biggest State? The Tasmanian Directory would be only about one-ninth or one-tenth of the size of that for New South Wales. The duty on it would, therefore, be only 6d. </para>

As Tasmania has only about one-tenth of the population of New South Wales, her directory could have only one-tenth of the number of names, and therefore would be only about one-tenth of the size, barring, of course, the advertisements, which we have already decided shall be charged 6d. per lb., if by themselves. </para>

                        <para>- I am surprised to hear it. If the &#34; poor farmer &#34; has a directory he cannot be very poor. I have taken the trouble to look through these directories to ascertain where they are printed. They are . printed, I believe, by the Kelly&#39;s Directories Company, who do not state where their printing is done. I have no doubt that with their usual anxiety to get a cheap article they go outside of London. According to the imprint on the book, they  have, in addition to their office in High Holborn, a place at Kingston-on-Thames. From a list which I hold in my hand of wages in the printing trade in England, Kingston-on-Thames is omitted. I see that some of the wages for compositors are as low as 23s. per week. At Exeter, compositors work 52&#189; hours per week for 23s. per week. I do not suppose there are three towns in Australia bigger than Exeter. Are we to allow directories which are not printed under union conditions to be brought into Australia? We do not know the conditions of labour in the place where this directory is produced. If the printing is done in Victoria or in New South Wales, or some of the other States, Wages Board conditions will apply. . At any rate, we intend to apply the new protection, and we can catch any printer who evades Wages Board conditions, employs an &#39;undue proportion of boy labour, or attempts to cut down wages. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt we shall have the honorable member&#39;s assistance. I believe there is a big majority in this House for the new protection. The A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 6d. per lb., and many honorable members sitting in the Opposition corner have stated that they are prepared to vote for the recommendations of that section. They will, therefore, have to vote for a duty of 6d. per lb. on this item. I trust that they will do so, because then we shall be able to regulate the conditions under which these directories are printed. </para>

                    <para>. - I should not have spoken on this question, but for the remarks of the honorable member for Yarra. They are - I do not say intentionally - very misleading. The honorable member said that as there was a duty of 6d. per lb. on advertising matter, there ought to be a similar duty on directories. But the bulk of the contents of a directory is not advertising matter at all, &#34;and other printed books, even if written by an Australian author and printed in London, are admitted free. In this case exception is being taken to a particular work, and an attempt is being made to put it on a different footing from that of all other printed books. In those circumstances, we ought to have very strong reasons before we agree to the proposal now before . us. The honorable member for Yarra&#39;s contention as to the wages paid in England might, from his point of view, be correct if there was no duty at all. But a duty of 4d., amounting to a considerable sum per volume, and multiplied by the very large number of volumes that have to be issued to pay for the cost of collection and of producing the work, represents so large a sum that, as the setting up has only to be done once, and the printing is all done by machinery, it would probably cover the whole cost of labour, even if the book were printed here. In those circumstances, seeing that the Government previously accepted a duty of 4d., and that an exception is proposed to be made of this particular work, although it is a printed book, while, if there could be competition from foreign countries, that competition will be prevented by a duty of 6d. per lb., we shall surely be doing quite sufficient if we fix a duty of 4d. against Great Britain. I hope the Committee will support the duty that was imposed when the item left this House. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the Committee will indorse the action of the Senate. While other books are free, as the honorable member for North Sydney said, this particular work is composed very largely of advertisements which run right through it. The Tasmania 11 &#39; directory is sold at one guinea. Its weight is under 3 lbs., so that a duty of 6d. per lb. is only 7^ per cent, on the price of the book. That is one of the lowest duties we have passed. We shall, therefore, be perfectly justified in charging 6d. per lb. on the article, which can well be produced in Australia. If the proprietors cannot sell it for a guinea in Tasmania in the future, there . are plenty of people who will be quite willing to pay the extra is. 6d. out of their own pockets., so long as the printing is clone in Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- It is proposed to put a special disability, not upon one class of goods, but upon one particular firm which competes with certain other firms in the Australian directory market. We are asked to penalize one firm only, and to give its competitors an opportunity of shutting it out. I can see no reason for this action on the part of the Minister, other than a desire to benefit certain Australian firms at the expense of that one. If those firms refuse to do the printing for this firm, it will be shut absolutely  out of the Australian market. I wish honorable members to consider that fact before they vote for the higher duty now proposed. </para>

The honorable member for Yarra argued the wrong way. He stated that the British workman is very poorly paid, but in voting for the same duty against Great Britain as against other countries, the honorable member will be offering the work on the same terms to the foreign workman, who is more poorly paid than the Britisher is. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot do that now. If the honorable member is consistent, and wants the highest-paid workmen in the world to do the work, he should vote for a preference to Great Britain, and not give the foreigner the same chalice as the Britisher. No one will contend that British workmen are not paid higher wages than are paid to workmen on the Continent. In this case, the suggestion of the. honorable member for Yarra is that we should offer a premium to people in Australia who require this work done to have it done by the poorly-paid foreign workmen. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt that that is the intention, but under the wording suggested by the Senate, it is possible that the item may not be free, as intended by this Committee. It is possible,, unless we insert the word &#39; 1 free &#39; &#39; after the figures &#34; 1907,&#34; that the printed matter referred to in this item may be brought under some other item, which is dutiable. </para>

                        <para>- The Senate can make a request without being guilty of a trick. I cannot see what the honorable gentleman objects to, because this item includes magazines, which are not specifically included in item 371. I think that the absence of the word &#34;free&#34; is an omission. We can do no harm by inserting the word ; on the contrary, we shall protect ourselves by doing so. Yet, when the omission is pointed out to the Minister, he wants to treat the item differently from every other item that we have made free, and expresses annoyance at the Committee raising an objection.

                    <para>.- From the corner we cannot hear what the Treasurer says at the table. If I correctly understand the few words I heard, he intends magazines to be free. If that is his intention, I cannot understand why he should not agree to the insertion of the word &#34;free&#34; in this item. It is idle cn his part to waste the time ot the Commit- . tee in this way. .  His  attitude seems to be dictated by a spirit of opposition. I hope that the Committee will unanimously decide that the word &#34;free&#34; shall be inserted. </para>

                        <para>- I do not find much knowledge in imported magazines, two-thirds .or three-fourths of the contents of which are advertisements. There is very little that is worth reading in them. If the Committee want to take charge of the Tariff, let it do so. I do not want to get a ridiculous Tariff. I wish to avoid all repetition, and I ask the Committee not to agree to insert the word &#34;free&#34; in this item when that is not necessary, I do not intend to allow this stupid, absurd amendment to be made without entering a protest against it. It is not wanted, and it is only moved because the honorable member for North Sydney has the insane idea that the Senate wanted- to trick him. If there were any reason for inserting the word, I would agree to its insertion. But the provision suggested by the Senate is only required to make it certain that a duty was payable up to a certain date. From that date, the item will be absolutely free,, and that is provided for in a later item.1 The next request of the Senate is worded in exactly the same way. Therefore I want to know why honorable members should seek to put in this item a word which is not required. </para>

                        <para>- They come, I&#39; think, under another item, but item 371 covers all books, n.e.i. It is not treating me quite fairly for honorable members to try to insert in item 356 the word &#34; free &#34; when there can be no possible doubt that all printed matter, n.e.i., is free under item 371. I hope that they will accept my assurance that the insertion of the word &#34;free&#34; will be only a repetition. I desire that there shall be no avoidable repetition. I have just been informed that if my proposal is not carried, there will be two statistical headings in the Tariff, and that it will create confusion. </para>

This item mentions magazines containing advertisements being more than one-fifth of the printed matter contained within the outside covers. Item 371 would therefore cover magazines containing advertisements being less than one-fifth of the printed&#34; contents, that is, if this item remains operative, as it will if we insert the word &#34; free,&#34; and there would, as I have said, be two. statistical headings. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Treasurer will not think that any difference in regard to the wording of the item is due to mistrust of his assurances. The Tariff will be construed, not in accordance with Ministerial assurances, but according to the ordinary rules of construction, and if the printed matter coming within paragraph  D is to be free, the logical thing to do would be to leave out the item. But We know that in a Tariff like this, unless we say specifically that a thing is to be free, it is almost sure to be treated later on as dutiable, under some item within which we did not intend it to come. It is extraordinary, since the Minister has told us that he means printed matter n.e.i. to be free, that he should refuse to allow the word &#34;free&#34; to be added to the item. </para>

                    <para>. - In the Tariff as introduced, item 356 imposed a duty on magazines containing advertisements being more than one-fifth of the printed matter contained within the outer covers, while item 371 made magazines free containing a smaller proportion. The Committee determined that all magazines should be free ; but, to authorize the retention of the duty collected up to the date of its decision, it was necessary to agree to the item as it stood, adding the words &#34; and on and after roth December, 1907, free.&#34; Then, to obviate the necessity of keeping two sets of statistics in regard to the one class of article, it was thought well to- alter this   Molding  in the Senate to &#34; free, up to and including 9th December, 1907.&#34; The effect of this is that all magazines are now dealt with as coming under item &#39;371, and &#34;the statistics regarding their importation are kept under one heading. If the Committee insists on adding the word &#34; free&#34; to the item, it will create confusion in the minds of importers, and make necessary the keeping of two sets of statistics. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer having stated that it is perfectly clear that duty is not. to be charged on magazines, the Committee should accept his assurance that the wording gives effect to its intention. On asking a departmental officer for an explanation, he told me that the effect of adding the word &#34;free&#34; would be to complicate the passing of entries. The wording suggested by the Senate legalizes the charging of duty up to the 9th December last, and makes it clear that from that date magazines must be ad- .mitted free. If the word &#34;free &#34; is added, importers of magazines will not know under what item to bring them, and trouble will be caused in regard to the filling up of the statistical forms required &#39; by the Department. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer knows that I made no accusation of trickery against him or against the Senate. It is idle for any one to tell me that the statement of a Minister in respect of Tariff items can be accepted. I do not mean to suggest that Ministers intentionally say &#39;what they believe to be contrary to facts, but I know of cases in which it has been pointed out to Customs officers, that during a debate in Parliament the Minister then in charge of the Tariff stated that a certain article would not be dutiable. After a lapse of time the Customs Department has charged duty, and replied that the Crown Law authorities advised that duty must be collected in respect of that article, and that it could not be made free merely because of any statement by a Minister. It is, therefore, incumbent upon us to make absolutely clear our determination in respect of the Tariff. The honorary Minister has stated that if the word &#34; free &#34; be allowed to remain, importers will experience difficulty. I would point out that, to importers, a still greater difficulty would arise if the item were allowed to remain without the addition of words providing that after the date named it shall be free. The requested amendment provides for a duty of 6d. up to and including 9th December, 1907, but there is no statement as to whether or not a duty is to be collected in respect of it as from that date. Unless we wish to create confusion, we should provide, as we have done in every other case, that after -the date named the item shall be free. lt is useless for the Minister or the officers of the Department to assert that the addition of the words I suggest would give rise to difficulty in the preparation of statistics, for they certainly would not prevent the printed matter referred to in the item from falling under item 371. </para>

                    <para>- - It is admitted by the Government that whatever -form of words be adopted, this item will be free as from 10th December last. The Honorary  Minister states, however, that the addition of words providing that as from that date it shall be frees would give rise to inconvenience, since we should thus have two items, both being free, in respect of the one class of goods. The Government proposal will &#39; not obviate that result, since the adoption of the Senate&#39;s request would not have the effect of including this item with item 371. </para>

Item 356 will appear in the Customs Act in its present form, and the mere fact that it is free as from 10th December last will not bring magazines, for instance, within item 37i- </para>

                    <para>- - No doubt the arguments used by the honorable member come as readily to him as do others used by him in another place ; but, to my mind, they carry no weight. If the &#39;honorable member&#39;s argument in regard to magazines is sound, it must be equally good in respect of the &#34; printed matter n.e.i. (except newspapers registered for transmission through the post)&#34; covered by the item now under consideration. </para>

                        <para>- I fail &#39;o&#39; appreciate the distinction which the honorable member would draw between the two items. Item 356 and item 371: are both free. This is not a matter on which I feel very strongly, but the officers of the Department have carefully thought it out, and they consider that their proposal will prevent trouble, not only to the Department, but to importers, by obviating the necessity for two sets of registrations. That being so, unless it can be shown that our object will not; be carried out in this way, I think that it would not be fair to act contrary to the desire of the Department. There is no danger whatever to be apprehended. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is very imaginative in regard to this matter. It would be very unwise of the Committee to insert this amendment, which is a double-barrelled one, and one which would produce complications instead of leaving the position as plain to the importers and to the Department as it is at the present time. There is no necessity whatever for the amendment, and I say that we ought not to commence filling up a lot of pages of the Tariff schedule with double-barrelled duties of this character. </para>

                        <para>- Then I shall not auote from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report - I shall speak from memory. Upon the occasion in question, the Treasurer pleaded that he wanted to re-arrange the item of wood screws so as to make the administration of the Department easy. What was the result? Under the first arrangement made these screws were dutiable under the general Tariff at 5 per cent., and were admitted free under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. But, notwithstanding a long debate which took place upon the item - a debate similar to that which is taking place now - we found that wood screws were subjected to a duty for fourteen days. I hold in my hand a complaint which reached me only to-day from the Meadowbank Manufacturing Company in New South Wales - a protectionist firm - pointing out that during those fourteen davs it had had to pay clutv upon ten cases of these wood screws. </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend to do so. I am merely quoting an analogous case to that before us.  The firm points out that on the day upon which it had to pay this duty another order - another, ukase I suppose we may call it - was issued declaring that these screws were not dutiable. But is the Customs Department granting the firm in question a refund? No. It took&#39; this duty from that firm, and, after discovering its mistake, will not grant. a refund. That is why we wish to make the position in reference to the item under consideration perfectly plain in the Tariff. I intended no reflection upon the Treasurer, and if he would bluster a little less- </para>

I want to guard against a repetition of this sort of administration, because, notwithstanding the asseverations of Ministers, after the Tariff has been passed, it will be handed over to the experts of the Customs Department to administer. If the Treasurer be sincere, he will not object to the insertion of words which will place the position beyond the possibility of cavil in the future. </para>

                    <para>. - I am rather glad that the honorable member has instanced the case of wood screws. I think he will find that when the point .was raised, I stated that if the interpretation that had been placed upon that item proved to be wrong, I would see that effect was given to the intention of the Committee. I did not discover till some days later that wood screws were dutiable, and I then asked the Customs authorities- - in consequence of my promise - not to charge the duty. </para>

                    <para>.- The last few words of the Treasurer show that he is getting into a better temper. &#39; Without wishing to be offensive in any way, I may point out that the Treasurer may hot  always be occupying his present position  and, in time to come, the Act may be interpreted in the way to which exception has teen taken. The easiest solution of  the difficulty would be to accept the simple ,- proposal of the honorable member for North Sydney. The explanations offered by the-. . Treasurer, and by the Honorary Minister^, to .transfer cardboard and pasteboard from paragraph  m  to paragraph  n.  I feel satisfied that if there had been any attempt to manufacture the articles here the Senate would not have sent down this request concerning the issue of ,a proclamation. &#91; shall not vote to impose a duty which will only be a revenue one if there is no intention to establish an industry. I do not be&#39;lieve that there is any such intention, and, therefore, I think that the Minister would, be wise tq agree to the transfer I have suggested. </para>

I suppose that he was alluding to the timber duties. I believe that I have touched the spot, sir. Now that I am on it; I wish to point out that the Treasurer is proposing to surrender on a small item, and to make a fight on one more important. It has been proposed in connexion with four or five items that duties should come into operation on proclamation. But we refused, on the honorable gentleman&#39;s own motion, to sanction this in regard to locks, and, later, voted against it in. regard to lubricants, the discussion on both occasions showing that honorable members were opposed to the arrangement. If the Treasurer wishes to obtain a contrary decision from the Committee in regard to timber, there will be a fight about it. </para>

                <para>Colonel FOXTON.- In a letter which I have received he puts the case briefly., stating that where an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty has been levied on the contents of a bottle, duty is also charged on the bottle itself, but that where the duty on the contents is specific, no charge has been made on the bottle. The intention of Parliament has now been put beyond doubt by the making of an amendment requested bv the Senate in regard to the duty on bottles: But what I wish to draw attention to is the fact  that certain persons have been compelled to pay duty  contrary  to the intention of Parliament, and, as a matter of bare justice, should have it refunded. </para>

                    <para>.- This is a very necessary differentiation. If it were not made, all inks would come, under item 358, and be dutiable at a much higher rate. News ink is sold at from 3d. to 6d. per lb. It is a cheap ink, and &#39;if it were not specialized in this item it would be dutiable at the higher rate imposed in respect of jobbing ink&#39;s of much better quality. </para>

                        <para>- If they are imported ; but there is no need to import them, since we have many local manufacturers of printers&#39; inks. Whilst news printing ink is sold at 6d. per lb., as much as 10s. per lb. is charged for the best job printing inks. It is difficult even for an expert to differentiate between good and inferior ink, unless he has an opportunity to test them on a machine, That being so, unless we insert this limitation we shall not be able to effectively regulate the duties. Local competition is sufficient to keep the prices  fairly  even, and I hope that the request will be agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- If they are imported ; but there is no need to import them, since we have many local manufacturers of printers&#39; inks. Whilst news printing ink is sold at 6d. per lb., as much as 10s. per lb. is charged for the best job printing inks. It is difficult even for an expert to differentiate between good and inferior ink, unless he has an opportunity to test them on a machine, That being so, unless we insert this limitation we shall not be able to effectively regulate the duties. Local competition is sufficient to keep the prices  fairly  even, and I hope that the request will be agreed to. </para>

						<para>—Whe n the honorable member brings his colossal intellect to bear upon me all at once, it strikes me dumb. On what ground does the Treasurer propose . to confer this enormous advantage upon the great daily newspapers of Australia? During the' past few weeks, we have learned what tremendous advantages have been granted bv Ministerial ukase— behind the back of Parliament o certain daily and weekly newspapers. Here is a proposal to favour those journals, for which they ask the authority of Parliament. While I commend them for their straightforwardness upon this occasion, I hope that the Committee will oppose the proposal of the. Treasurer, even though the honorable member for Macquarie says that he knows all about all the newspapers of Australia.</para>

						<para>I confess that I find considerable difficulty in understanding all that passes through the honorable member's mind. In that, however, I do not think that I stand alone. I hope that the Treasurer will be able to adduce some reason for his action. ' It will not be palatable for the small newspapers of Australia to learn that he proposes to penalize them to the extent of more than 100 per cent, upon their inks whilst he allows the Age, Argus, Sydney Morning Herald, and the Bulletin to obtain their inks at 25 per cent.</para>

					<para>I clo not think • any danger need be apprehended as to the small newspapers if we accede to the request of the Senate. There was such a danger under the Tariff in its original form, but that was overcome at the instance of the honorable member for Capricornia. The object of the Senate in requesting an amendment of the item is to prevent the more expensive ink being imported under the lower duty. As a matter of fact, nearly all the news ink imported is imported in quantities over 1 cwt. It is made up in the Commonwealth into smaller parcels.</para>
