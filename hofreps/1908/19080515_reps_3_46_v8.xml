                        <para>- Will . the Prime Minister inform the House if the Government has any control over the railways of the Commonwealth by reason of the fact that it pays the Commissioners a large sum annually for the carriage of mails? Through a recent alteration in the running of the Sydney express,Wangaratta has been practically cut out of communication, except on two days of the week. A more monstrous re-arrangement of the railway time-table has never before been made in this country. Is there any possibility of the Government doing anything? I shall not trouble the House with the history of the case, which was published in the newspapers yesterday ; but the borough council is taking action. It is most unfair that the first express should pass Wangaratta. The arrangement may be all very well for Sydney passengers- </para>

                        <para>A remarkable declaration in respect to the future of the British Empire has been made in the course of a press interview at New York by Cardinal Michael Logue, Archbishop of Armagh and Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland. </para>
                        <para>Cardinal Logue declared that he saw signs of the certain dissolution of the British Empire. &#34; The colonies,&#34; he said, &#34; are restive. Australia is to-day practically independent, and the trend every moment is more and more in the direction of absolute rebellion. New Zealand is indifferent. Canada is legislating in a manner showing her desire to conduct her business in her own way. The fires of rebellion are lighted in India, and men and women have been hanged for daring . to advocate the never-dying doctrine of freedom. &#34;When England sits alone as the result of misgovernment,&#34; Cardinal&#39; Logue added, &#34;it will be a day of reckoning for the children of Ireland.&#34; . </para>

If the remarks were made, the assertion that Australia is practically independent is true only in that we enjoy the amplest powers of self-government within the Empire.. To say that our trend is&#39; &#34;more and more in the direction of absolute rebellion &#34; is absolutely incorrect. </para>

In view of these facts, will he help me to establish a national postal banking system of exchange, issue, deposit, and reserve, under which good wages will be paid for honest work, and which will be a haven of rest to which oppressed and down-trodden bank clerks may flee from the. tyrannical combinations of despotic boodliers? </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. One newspaper may be the best medium for reaching a particular class and another more effective for reaching a different class. Those to which the honorable member for Dalley has referred circulate principally in towns. The chief advantage to be gained by advertising in .a city newspaper is that it appeals to financiers and others whom we are principally interested in keeping well informed. </para>

Its agents, Messrs. Gordon and Gotch, came to us and submitted this proposal. As I have said previously, any other newspaper which makes a novel proposal - if it possesses an advertising value to us - will be used. It is a pure matter of business. In the present instance we inquired from our representative in London, Captain Collins, whether this advertisement would be profitable, and we were advised not only that it would be profitable, but that it was absolutely necessary in view of the action which had been taken by Canada and other Dominions. It would never do for Australia to be the only self-governing portion of the Empire not represented in this newspaper. The arrangement made is merely for a three months&#39; advertisement - that and nothing more. It will take a novel shape, and one of the features in connexion with all good advertising is novelty. This particular kind of thing has never been done in London before, and that is why we are using the opportunity - </para>

                            <para>- I think it has been represented to me that under existing circumstances the antimony ore mined in Australia has to be sent to the Continent to be treated, and that subsequently the product of that treatment is brought back to Australia. If a duty had been operative upon this commodity there would have been no necessity to send the ore to the Continent. 1 think that it was a member of the Senate who put me in possession of the facts of the case. No doubt the operation of the duty will do a great deal towards establishing the antimony industry in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - When the honorable member for Moreton last night submitted the amendment on the second note, and I said I would endeavour to obtain further particulars on the point raised, the honorable member stated that duty was charged on four or six surfaces ;but I find that it is charged on not more than two surfaces. In the trade, the term &#34; super face &#34; is applied to the measurement of timbers, dressed or undressed, if less than 1 inch thick. When the Department issued the order in reference to a super, face measurement, the trade was consulted, and expressed the view that&#39; the duty would be properly chargeable on each surface, dressed or partly dressed. The Department, however, did not go so far as that, but limited the order to charging the duty to the superficial measurement of those sides, not including edges, actually dressed or partly dressed, and that has since been the prescribed practice. </para>

                        <para>- I have no definite information on. the point, but  1  believe that such was the case for a. very  short , time. As I have pointed out, however, the Department consulted the trade, which, I understand, was practically  unanimous  in approval of the course adopted. If the timber is only finished on one face, the duty is charged orr one face, but, if finished on two or more faces, then the duty is limited to two, and not charged on the edges. I do not see what other step the Department could have taken, since the trade agreed in what was proposed. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, the dressing can be, and ought to be, &#39;done in any part, of Australia by our own workpeople. The Committee have gone so far as to practically admit undressed timber duty free; and an attempt has been made to take me to task for not adhering to some alleged compact. But what was done in regard to the duties was done by the Committee ; . and I have no doubt that the fact that employment would be given led to the imposition of the lower, duties on the raw material. I hope that the action taken will be a lesson to those who are importing timber, and induce them to bring it to this country as nearly as possible in the raw state, in order that the finishing may be done by our own workmen. </para>

                    <para>-I regard the proposal before us as an example of protection run mad. It is monstrous that attempts should be made by different people to mislead this Committee, when, as a matter of fact, the business this duty is intended to benefit is. scarcely  worth consideration. From actual experience, I can say that one machine can turn out from 8,000 to 10,000 superficial feet a day, and, taking the. production at. the- minimum of 8,000 feet, a duty of 3s. means protection, not to the employe, but to the machine to the extent of. ^12 a day. That is the result of the duty if it be charged on only one side, but if it be charged on both sides, then, of course, it means ah imposition to the extent of ^24 per day. This machine can be worked by one man at a wage of, probably, 10s. a day - if he be lucky - with, perhaps two other men as helpers. The whole labour cost cannot be more than 30s. a day ; and yet we are asked to protect this trivial industry to the tune of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;24</inline> a day. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Grey knows perfectly well that workmen in Australia can handle machinery as effectively and as cheaply as can workmen in any part of the world, and he will agree with me that when six super; faces are charged as two the duty cannot be excessive. The whole question is whether every particle of the work upon timber should be done outside of Australia, or whether is should be done here. That is the only general question. As to the particular contention of the honorable member for Fremantle, I say .again that if his contention is correct the law of competition will bring down the cost of treating the timber, and the consumer will get the benefit. The boards can be brought in undressed, and as the machines are not dear, I assume that ordinary competitive laws will apply, and that every advantage will be given to the consumer, whilst a considerable amount of labour will be employed in dressing the timber in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - A more sophistical argument to bolster up an iniquituous system was never used in this Chamber than that just advanced by the honorable member for &#39;Wide Bay. It seems to me that Ministers and certain honorable members opposite are suffering from protectionist hydrophobia or monomania. They seem to have the fever very badly. When we examine the system which they advocate we find that it is absolutely unjust from beginning to end, and amounts to nothing more nor less than an absolute robbery of the consumer. </para>

                        <para>- Whether fixed by Parliament or not, &#34; superface &#34; means every surface that&#39; is dressed or planed, or partly dressed or planed. The Senate&#39;s proposal is intended to assist the Department in clearing up doubts, and to prevent litigation. Evidence was given before the Tariff Commission by trade representatives in Adelaide, one of whom, <inline font-weight="bold">.Mr. E.</inline> &#93;. Filsell, stated that the expression &#34; superface &#34; simply means the top dressing wherever it occurs. That is to say, if a piece&#39; of timber is dressed or planed on both sides, both sides have to be measured for the purpose of determining the duty. That applies only to box and door timber, and cannot have a general application to all dressed timbers. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the requested definition will not be modified in any .way, because I see a great danger to the Australian door and sash manufacturers. Under the proposal of the honorable member for Moreton, an importer could- bring in doors, &#34; knocked down,&#34; as- they are generally known ia the trade,- or all ready to. be put together, at a duty of 2s. 6d. per 100 superface. On an ordinary door, even - if the duty was charged on both sides the charge would amount only to about is. 3d. . We protect the Australian door-making industry to the extent of 7s. 6d. per door, if the door is put. together. In this case, if the door is. &#34;knocked down,&#34; or not put together, the duty will be only is. 3d. </para>

I am informed that some time ago they charged for six surfaces on dressed timber, and, judging from the amount of duty paid in certain cases, I think my information is correct. The honorable member for Bendigo spoke just now din support? of the &#39; (amendment &#39;requested by the Senate, but I understand that the Treasurer does not propose to agree to it. I wish to say that if the honorable gentleman will accept the suggestion Qf the Senate, in order that we may have some reliable definition of the term &#34; super, face,&#34; I shall be prepared to withdraw my proposal and vote for that which will involve higher duties on dressed timbers. If we have not a proper definition of the words &#34; super, face&#34; we shall not know where we may be landed as a result of different interpretations put upon the term by the Customs authorities. </para>

                    <para>- - I am prepared, in this matter, to be guided by the practical knowledge of the honorable member for Fremantle. When we adjourned last night, there was great confusion as to what would be the effect of the requested amendment. It has been said that it is proposed to impose taxation injurious&#39; to two of our great industries, and, as representing a great pastoral and agricultural community, I am forced to recognise the justice of the contention of the honorable member for Fremantle. It would appear that an inch board may be cut up into sixteen planks each  1-16th  inch in thickness, and that 8,000 feet of these planks- can be put through a machine and smoothed on both sides in a day. As I understand the proposition, it is that each of these sixteen boards should carry the same duty as a single board one inch thick dressed on both sides. </para>

                        <para>- I certainly gathered from the remarks of the honorable member for Fremantle that the proposition involved the imposition of a huge duty out of all  proportion  to the intrinsic value of the- timber on which it would be imposed. It will not be denied that the expansion of Mie butter industry has been the saving of New South Wales and Victoria, and it would be a very serious mistake if, in ignorance of the injury likely to be caused to that industry!, the Committee decided to impose a duty on the packages in which our butter must be put on the market. Under a successful system of irrigation, I hope we shall shortly - be producing ten times as much butter as we have produced in the past, and I trust that the Committee will not consent to load those engaged in this industry with unnecessary cost in connexion with the means which must be adopted to have their produce carried to the markets of the Old Country. I should regard such a thing as a crime, and I would sooner leave Parliament than be a party to it. The Treasurer, and those who are supporting him, have- evinced a determination to get revenue under this Tariff, and it is revenue that is desired in this case. The plea that the worker should be .considered in this matter is a little too thin.  </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Wide Bay is aware that I am accustomed to think for myself upon all matters dealt with in this &#39; Chamber. Something has been said about -leaving the definition of &#34; super, face &#34; to the Customs authorities} but I have a strong objection to permitting the officers of any public Department to interpret the desire of Parliament. The officers of the Customs Department would not be likely to express an opinion in opposition to the views known to be held by a gentleman like the present Treasurer. I&#34; mean that they are bound to follow his instructions, and I venture to say that he will give such instructions as will bring in the greatest amount of. revenue. I know that his object is covered up with this thin guise of a proposal, to help the working man. I recognise the possibility of the cost of labour becoming extreme. I, as a country member, know that, it is absolutely impossible in ordinary circumstances to get that amount of labour which is necessary to improve the country and increase its yield. This proposal means the employment of an additional number of men in the cities, and the withdrawal of labour from the country. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. When we consider that the country must progress, that large estates must be subdivided and settled, and that settlers will require houses and plants, we must recognise that protection cannot benefit them very much, because their products will have to compete in the markets of the world with the products of countries where labour and production are cheaper, and where perhaps production is carried on under circumstances a little less arduous than in Australia at times. I cannot forget that during this season of drought men - not only in my district, but in the surrounding districts - have had to sacrifice cattle which at one time were worth <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> a head for 10s., and, as happened the other day, for even 4s. No man who represents a huge agricultural and pastoral constituency, as I do, can refrain from exerting his utmost efforts to prevent an improper duty from being imposed upon any of the articles which are required by the men on the soil. If it were made clear to me that this proposal to levy &#38; duty of 2s. 6d. means only what appears on the surface I should be satisfied. But if it means what the honorable member for Fremantle has alleged, we shall be faced with a great difficulty,, and in all probability a reopening of the Tariff, which I am sure we do not want. There is plenty of legislation which is needed, and which perhaps would be acceptable to the people, but they certainly do not want a re-opening of the Tariff to the worry of the lives of honorable members and the unsettling of trade. 1 cannot see what good it will do to impose a heavy duty of this character. I have received some memoranda from an expert ; but the matters with which he dealt appeared to me to be so complicated that I decided to trust to the intelligence of the Committee to educate me more fully. On many occasions I have listened to the Treasurer, but I have never vet been able to gather exactly what he meant. Generally he has left me in a bigger fog than I was in when he began to speak. Our friendship is of such long-standing - some thirty-three years - that of course he understands that I would not make any remark for the purpose of harassing him. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to occupy the time of the Committee, but I want &#39; to feel assured that this item, when it is passed, will leave no loop-hole for the Department to take advantage of. Of course, I do not mean that the Customs officers would act in the arbitrary manner which my remarks might almost suggest. I. look upon them as so many pieces of machinery who, out of loyalty to the country, deem it to be their duty to collect revenue to the fullest possible extent. I dread the possibility of more revenue being collected under this item than is intended by the Committee. I should have liked to. deal more fully with the comparisons which have been supplied to me by experts, but I believe that we can very safely accept the opinion of the honorable member &#39; for Fremantle, whose practical knowledge of the subject we all recognise. I venture to think that, in this matter, no one can go wrong in following that honorable gentleman in preference to the Treasurer. With me the dairying and mining industries are&#39; highly  important ones, and I want to feel perfectly satisfied that they are not likely to be unduly or improperly handicapped. </para>

                        <para>- I have already read it. It is signed by James Sutch, secretary to the Federated Sawmill and Timber Yard Employes Association of Australasia. It is a mean thing to introduce a new system of measurement to double the duty on butter-box timber. In no other country is timber charged on both surfaces. One might as well expect to be charged tor flannel on two surfaces. The Government is introducing measurements different from those in vogue in other parts of the world, and I hope that the Committee will not allow this. </para>

                    <para>.- If the duty is to apply to butter-box timber, I shall vote against it. It is a pity that the Treasurer has not fallen in with the suggestion that we should make clear what is to be. regarded as butter-box timber. I have all along been in favour of the free admission of such timber, and shall not withdraw from that position. But, while willing that butter-box timber should be admitted free, I do not wish the free importation, as butter-box timber, of wood to be used for other purposes. Probably the whole ground would be covered if we inserted a provision relating to New Zealand white pine of a certain size for the making of butter-boxes. </para>

                        <para>- I have seen dovetailed boxes made of timber not more than 1-16 inch thick, and very pretty ornamental boxes made of timber not more than 1-32 inch thick. We are not bound to confine our consideration to commercial boxes, eliminating those intended merely for comfort, convenience, or ornament. Our object is to bring about the dressing of timber in Australia ; and, although Queensland is not affected, I contend that it is not unreasonable to say that timber should be dressed here. The competition among planers will make prices reasonably low to the consumer. </para>

                        <para>- I am not so foolish as to swallow the statement made by the honorable member for Fremantle that this definition must necessarily increase the cost of timber to the extent mentioned by him. As pointed out by the honorable member for Wide Bay, keen local competition will keep down prices. A combination would be necessary to enable those concerned to increase their prices in proportion to the duty. Haying regard to the widespread competition in Australia, I am satisfied that even a prohibitive duty would not&#39; affect local prices, and I hope that the Committee will agree to the Government proposal. If timber is dressed on more than, one side it should be charged for accordingly. In the case of certain sizes of timber the dressing of even the edges may be an important matter, but under this proposal duty can be charged in respect of only two surfaces. </para>

                        <para>- It would be most absurd to admit the wooden portion of a penholder free and to charge a duty upon the metal attachment. That, however, did occur under the operation of the first Tariff. Upon that occasion the wooden pen handles were admitted free, but 25 per cent, was charged upon the metal attachments. </para>

                    <para>.- I understand that these high duties have been requested by the Senate with the object of making luxuries pay a fair tax. But there are a number of pencils imported which are extremely useful for school children, and which cannot be regarded in any sense as luxuries. The pencil which I hold in my hand would probably cost less than 6d. But I am informed by the Customs authorities that it would probably be dutiable under this item. Yet it is the sort of pencil that we all wish to have admitted free. During the discussion of the Tariff in the Senate in reply to a suggestion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, the Minister of Home Affairs is reported, <inline font-style="italic">vide</inline> page 9812 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> to have said - </para>

                <para class="block">On the strength of that assurance <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger did not submit an amendment which he had foreshadowed. But in view of the fact that the departmental decision in respect of some pens and pencils which are at present imported is in direct opposition to the desire of this Committee, I suggest that after the word &#34;cases&#34; the words &#34; wholly or partly made of gold, silver, aluminium, or nickel &#34; be inserted. This would have the effect of limiting paragraph g to articles of luxury. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot accept the suggestion of the honorable member, because the cheaper class of pencils - especially those used by school children - have already been made free. Fancy pencils, of course, are to be made dutiable at 30 per cent., and other pencil cases n.e.i. ought to be subject to the same duty. I do not see that there should be any difficulty in regard to school pen and pencil sets, which are to be free. </para>

I was informed that there is extreme difficulty in the Department, in discriminating between the two, and it would be of great assistance if my proposal were adopted. </para>

                    <para>.- There are other kinds of pencil cases than those exhibited by the honorable member for Maranoa, and there seems to be a difficulty on the part of the Customs officers as to how other kinds shall be treated. The officers require the assistance of Parliament to enable them to come to a proper decision. They have to interpret the Tariff as they  find it, and Ministerial assurances will have no effect apart from a distinct provision in the Act. </para>

                <para>I may explain that both licht-pausrohpapier and licht-pauspapier are used for the same purposes. They are used largely in Government Departments and by architects for the reproduction of plans and other drawings. Both are specially prepared papers, but licht-pauspapier is sensitized and lichtpausrohpapier is not. Very little occupation is provided in sensitizing the raw paper, and if any sensitizing is done in this country it must be avery trifling business. There is no reason why duty should be imposed on licht-pauspapier when licht-pausrohpapier is admitted free. </para>

                    <para>. - I direct attention to item 410, which, it seems to me,&#39; makes the unsensitized paper dutiable at 30 and 25 per cent. We cannot interfere with that item, as the Senate has made no request in. regard to it. Therefore, if we were to adopt the modification suggested by the honorable member for North Sydney, we should simply make the same article come under two different items of the Tariff. I believe that there is a man in Sydney who has been giving information to the honorable member, and who wants to get this paper in free. </para>

                    <para>. - May I point out that whenever we have omitted an article from any one of the Senate&#39;s requests the effect has been to bring it under another item. Therefore the same objection could have been taken to every modification that has been made.. The Treasurer&#39;s objection to my proposed modification in this case is, I understand, that duty is charged on lichtpauspapier under item 410, but may I point out that no such paper is mentioned in that item. </para>

                        <para>- Then I intend to press it. But perhaps it would be fair to charge, say, 15 and 10 per cent, on the completely prepared paper, and 5 per cent. and free on the paper which is less completely prepared. As, however, both are specially prepared papers, and one has only to undergo locally a slight additional process of treatment, it is undesirable to make the enormous difference in the duties proposed by the Treasurer. Will the Minister agree to duties of 15 and 10 per cent. on the completely prepared paper? Even from the Minister&#39;s stand-point there would then be a reasonable difference between the duties on the two. Shortly, I ask him to make the licht-pauspapier dutiable at 15 and 10 per cent., and the  lichtpausrohpapier  dutiable at 5 per cent, and free. To charge the former under item 410 would, I think, be declared illegal, because it is not photographic sensitized paper, lt involves merely a light process. </para>

                        <para>- It is used for  reproduction. The printing of a photograph on sensitized paper is a reproduction. So is the printing of a plan on  lichtpauspapier,  which is only licht-pausrohpapier sensitized. No paper sensitized for the purpose  of  reproduction has been made free. We have allowed baryta paper, which is sensitized in Australia, to come in free, and it will not do to allow any paper which can be, and is actually being, sensitized here to come in free, or at rates as low as 15 and 10 per cent. In any case, duties of 15 and 10 per cent, would not insure effective preference, because this paper comes from Germany, and the benefit to the dear old Motherland would be rather illusory than real. We should stand by the decision already arrived at. The result df our action has been to establish, not in Victoria, but in Sydney, an industry - - . </para>

                        <para>- No; but he is competing successfully with the importer. The latter feels it, and is very anxious to check him, and wants us to do so by putting sensitized paper on the free list or making it dutiable &#39;at so low a rate that no protection will be given to the man who is doing the coating here. I am prepared to allow the raw material in free, but we do not desire to destroy the successful industry of the local man. I hope that no protectionist will give a vote to destroy the industry by which this man makes his living: It is certain that if the suggestion of (he honorable member for North Sydney is adopted, that will be its effect. </para>

                        <para>- My information is that he did compete successfully with the importer, and if he was not wiped out before the imposition of these duties;,; how will he be wiped out under the proposal I make? I am not now suggesting that there should be no duty on this paper, but that the difference between the duties on the two classes of paper referred to is unjustifiable. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the modification suggested by the honorable member for North Sydney will not be accepted by the Committee. &#34;The honorable member proposes to take this Licht-pauspapier out of the photographic sensitized papers included in item 410, and dutiable at 30 and 25 per cent., and insert them as a paragraph of- the item at present under consideration, making them dutiable at only 15 and 10 per cent. This is really a case in which two men are lighting on opposite sides. That is absolutely the whole story of the proposal. One man is importing this class of paper finished,, and is trying tei undercut another who is finishing the same paper here. The honorable- member for North Sydney wishes the Committee to reduce the duties in order to injure the local manufacturer. </para>

                        <para>- It is a New South Wales industry. The whole object of the proposal is to knock out the local man. and it is submitted at the instigation of the individual who is importing this paper. He wants the Committee to enable him to destroy the business of his local -competitor. The industry is not at present important, but the principle we have adopted throughout in dealing with&#39; the Tariff is to protect the man doing the work here, rather than to give all the work to  the importer. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman said that I wished to destroy the business of the local manufacturer, and that if I was supporting the importer he was supporting the other man. No such attitude should be adopted by a Minister of the Crown. The imposition of duties should not be regarded in any such light. We should have regard for the character of an industry and the interests of the consumers of the article it produces, as well as the interests of individuals who may be importers or manufacturers. If the course the Minister proposes is to be followed, Parliament will be degraded and become merely a log-rolling institution. These papers with which we are dealing are manufactured chiefly in Germany. They are not manufactured here. The only difference between the two classes of paper referred to is that one, after being im- . ported, is put through a very inexpensive process locally. If one of these papers was actually being manufactured in the Commonwealth. I should be prepared to admit that, from the protectionist standpoint, the difference between the duties proposed might be justified; but it is not justified by the fact that it is merely put through a simple process in the Commonwealth.  This paper is -not used in photography. </para>

                        <para>- The hon- &#39; orable member for Lang has received his information from the officers of the Department, and, while he says one thing, the Minister says another. Although personally I should prefer that both these classes of paper should be admitted free of duty, I am not suggesting that this paper, which is subjected to a simple and inexpensive process in the Commonwealth, shall be admitted, free. It is used for printing by light, and not for photography. I propose that there should be duties of 15 and 10 per cent, on Lichtpauspapier, and 5 per cent, and free on Lichtpausrohpapier that is subjected to a process here. I repeat that both these papers are manufactured abroad. </para>

                        <para>- It is used chiefly for the reproduction of plans, and that is practically the same thing. This paper is at present prepared in Sydney, - and is dutiable now at 30 and 25 per cent. The honorable member for North Sydney has said that,, from the protectionist point of view, if it was wholly manufactured in the Commonwealth, the proposed duties would be justifiable; but we know that the honorable member has voted all through that paper should be admitted free or at a very low duty. </para>

                        <para>- The other man, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Max</inline> Wurcker, is completing the paper here. Both men are established in Sydney, and one is trying to undercut and destroy the other. Whether the paper is made here or not does not enter- into the consideration of the question at all, because very little is made locally. The main point is that the paper is completed by a certain man, and may be obtained from him. It is not fair to take away the protection of 30 and 25 per cent, which he has enjoyed for a very considerable time. </para>

                        <para>- That is a wrong attitude for the Minister to take up, and it is reducing our debates to a very low level indeed. As regards the merits of the matter, the Minister seems to be entirely misinformed. He appears to. have got into his head the idea, and wants the Committee to believe, that this sensitized paper is generally used for photographic purposes. It is not so used. </para>

                        <para>- If anybody wants to produce a peculiar kind of photograph - something out of the ordinary as a curiosity - he can use this paper for the purpose of getting a print, but it is not a photographic paper ordinarily in use in a photographer&#39;s business. When it is exposed to the light, the paper, except in those portions which contain the design, assumes a blue colour. , It is used in . architects&#39; offices for reproducing plans. After the plans have been drawn in the ordinary way, they are stretched on a frame with a piece of sensitized paper underneath and exposed to the light. The action of the light causes all the exposed portions of the paper to become blue, and leaves white lines showing the design. The paper is then handed over to contractors to work from.. Although that is the only general purpose for which the paper is used, yet the Minister would have the Committee to believe that it is used&#34; generally for photographicpurposes. </para>

                    <para>.- I find that the Senate has requested that photographic back-grounds, mounted or unmounted, shall be excluded from the operation of this duty. As a free-trader, I have no fault to find with the request, which should, however, have covered all the other articles mentioned in the item. But, according to the principles of the protectionists, these goods ought to be protected, because they can be produced in this country. Where is the consistency of including things which cannot be made here, and excluding others which undoubtedly can be made in Australia? There is not a scene painter in Australia who cannot paint photographic back-grounds. They may not all be experts, and the work will vary with the skill of the artist, but they can certainly be produced here. There is already a heavy duty on the materials used by painters, and on the top of that the Treasurer proposes to allow photographic back-grounds to come in free. Personally, I have no objection. I suppose that I paint as many of these back-grounds as any one does. But I do not fear competition. I merely draw attention to the anomaly. I can compete against any of the imported backgrounds, and do not require a duty. More than that, I am not one of those freetraders who are only free-traders in regard to things that do not affect them personally. We have protectionists here who are only protectionists when the other fellow has to pay, but they are free-traders in all that touches their own pockets. I am a free-trader all the time; and, notwithstanding that a duty might advantage me, I am quite prepared to let imported back-grounds come in free. My attitude is that I have no right to ask Parliament to limit the choice of the users of photographic back-grounds simply because I happen to be engaged in painting them. People who use them have a right to choose the best they can get, irrespective of where they are produced, and I. shall vote for them coming in free. </para>
