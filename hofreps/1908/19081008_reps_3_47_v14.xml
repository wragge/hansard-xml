                        <para>- A Bill relating to that subject was, I think, laid on the table shortly before the close of last session. My honorable colleague, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, is now acting for the Minister of Trade and Customs, who, unfortunately, is disabled, and I shall ask him to look into the matter and see whether it would not be possible to reintroduce that Bill, as then submitted, or in some amended form. </para>

                            <para>- In reply to the right honorable member.Ihavetoinformthe House that on Friday last eleven nominations were made, one of which, as the right honorable member has mentioned, is that of " Yass-Canberra." On that occasion, after the nominations had' been made, an honorable member applied for permission to  withdraw the nomination of one site. I then said that under the resolution of the House I had no power to permit the withdrawal of any name, and I am afraid that I must give the same answer to the right honorable member. But, as I said on Friday last, no honorable member is compelled to vote for a site because it appears in the list of nominations, and it may be that one or two names may be at once dropped off the list. </para>

                        <para>- In reference to the statement that I made on the spur of the moment last night with regard to the publication of my speech, in December last, on the defence policy, I find on inquiry that my recollection was sound, and that in a subsequent edition of the report of that speech the error to which the honorable member for Flinders called attention was corrected, as instructed by me. The error was the substitution of the figure " 6 " for the figure " 8." In the first edition the figures £1,600,000 appeared, instead of £1,800,000. In the next that error was corrected. I regret, however, that the persons concerned confined themselves very literally to their instructions, and that on the very next page - a few lines after that in which the correction was made - they allowed the same statement as to £1,600,000 to appear, although the instruction given was intended, in the circumstances I have mentioned, to cover the whole report. In reference to the first column to which the honorable member called attention, and in which the sum of £125,000 was deducted, I find that my phrase was "£125,000 has been deducted from the full cost. " That is perfectly correct, because the full cost is that which appears at the foot of the column, £1,400,000, and not as the honorable member supposes the amount which appears in the line above it, £1, 293, 000. The column is therefore perfectly correct, and the statement itself is correct. I have found, also, in the little time at my disposal, that attention was called in the Sydney newspapers to the discrepancy in the figures, and that the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> specifically called attention to the error in the addition of the last column. I hope honorable members understand that the items are all correct, and that the error is in the addition only. It consists in placing a <inline font-style="italic">"6"</inline> where there ought to be an " 8 " - an error of one figure in making a statement to the same effect. </para>

                    <para>- When speaking on the second reading of the Seat of Government Bill, I referred to the fact that the father of my colleague, the Attorney-General, died through the cold weather in Melbourne. One of the Sydney newspapers reports me as having made that reference to the father of the Minister of Trade and Customs. I do not know how my remarks were so construed ; . but I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chapman</inline> was grieved to see such a statement published, and I wish to make this explanation accordingly. </para>

                        <para>- The reply to the honorable gentleman's questions is as follows : -  1, 2, and 3. The " latest land defence proposals " would apparently infer that there has been an alteration of the Government's attitude. It has been explained that such is not the case. The policy having been decided, the question was how best to embody it in a measure for the consideration of Parliament. The Minister has discussed all matters of moment with the members of the Board. The Minister is available at all times to all members of the Board, and they are aware that he is glad to receive their views upon any subject at any time, and the converse is the case with regard to members of the" .Board. No dates are kept of such inter- » views or discussions. The Minister believes that he is justified in obtaining information and assistance from any source that would enable a measure to be satisfactorily prepared for this House. His view of the situation with regard to Boards and military members is that they should advise the Minister, but not control him. Technically, the Board has no responsibility - and under the regulations is not entitled to express any opinion with regard to policy. Matters of policy must remain under the control of Parliament and cannot be relegated to any Board. </para>

I voted in one or two of the ballots because of opportunities afforded by the honorable members for Flinders and Barker, both supporters of the Yass-Canberra site, who refrained from voting, to give me an opportunity to do so. I thought it only right to make this explanation of the reason why their names and mine will not be found in some of the ballots when the records are published. </para>

                <para class="block">The history of the stripper-harvester must lead one to the conclusion that its evolution has been exceptionally slow, seeing that the first trace of such an appliance is found amongst the Gauls in the early part of the Christian era. I refer to this fact, in order to show that no particular person or persons can claim the stripper-harvester of to-day as the result of his own ingenuity, and inventiveness ; because all now in use are more or less copies of machines contrived by man almost since the beginning of history. The Gauls' stripper-harvester was in the shape of a box with a stripper cone, and, instead of being drawn by horses as to-day, it was propelled by an ox between two shafts. This early machine is referred to by several writers, amongst them Arthur Young in his <inline font-style="italic">Annals of Agriculture,</inline> which was published in 1785, and which contained translations from the work of Pliny and  Palladius, another  Roman writer on the subject. About the same time, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Pitt, of England, invented a stripper machine with a stripper-drum instead of a cone; and in 1807, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Plunkett</inline> introduced a machine of a similar character for use in harvesting clover ; but, owing to the dampness of the climate, it was not successful. Before referring to the introduction of similar machines in the United States at an early date, I should like to direct the attention of honorable members to the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopedia of Agriculture,</inline> which was published by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Louden,</inline> in 1807, and which contains a full description of the machine to which I have referred, as being in use amongst the Gauls in the first century. In 1836, a stripper-harvester was invented and patented in the United States, and claimed to be a complete machine, by Hiram Moore and a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Hascall.  Five years later, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> A. Church patented, in the United States, a combined harvester; and in' 1847 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> Foster, of Indiana, obtained a patent for a complete harvester, which, in very many respects resembled the harvester of to-day ; followed forty-two years  later by an invention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roberts,</inline> of New York State. I desire .to point out that the last two machines I have mentioned are proved by the records to have had what is known as the canvas elevator, though <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> of the Sunshine Harvester Works, claims such an appliance as his own invention. In the United States, the success of these machines was not very marked, owing to the climatic conditions ; indeed, up to the present time, neither the harvester nor the stripper which preceded the harvester, is used in the United States. It is only Australian conditions, taken advantage of by Australian ingenuity, that enable the machine to be used , as we have it to-day. The first gentleman who introduced what is known as the stripper-harvester in Australia, was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Ridley, of South Australia, in 1847. My contention that no particular brain, or set of brains, can. claim credit for the invention of the stripper-harvester, is borne out by a letter which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ridley</inline> published some time before his death, and in which he admitted that he got the idea from Louden's <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopedia</inline><inline font-style="italic">of Agriculture,</inline> and the full description there given of the machine' used by the Gauls. It is well known that the stripper introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ridley</inline> made no pretence to do the work that thestripper.harvester of to-day  does; but, in 1857, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Mel for,' of South Australia, improved on the Ridley machine, and obtained patents in both Victoria and South Australia. In the latter Colony, as it then was, the Government offered a reward of ^4,000, and the Victorian Government offered" a reward of ,£100 for a complete stripper-harvester ; and in 1879, a competition took place at Gawler. Three different machines did very good work, but- only a portion of the South Australian reward was given, because, in the opinion of the judges, none warranted the full amount ; and in Victoria the reward was divided between two competing machines. It was about 1874 that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> Robinson, of Victoria, came to the front with his machine; and I may mention that from that day to this the same firm, founded by that gentleman, under different names and combinations has been endeavouring to complete the machine. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> has been working for many years with the same object, and, whether there is any truth in the statement or not I do not know, but it is said that he was never able to complete the machine until the patents of some other Victorian makers had expired; according to the evidence given before the Royal Commission, no doubt was entertained by some Victorian manufacturers that their ideas had been manipulated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay.</inline> There were no further developments until 1900, when there were introduced the International and the Massey-Harris machines. There is no doubt that these machines are to a great extent copies of machines purchased in Australia, just as the machines made in Victoria are to a great extent a copy of machines made in America long ago. In 1904, the price of stripper-harvesters was from £63 to £70 ; Australian makers, including, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martin</inline> of Gawler, advertising them all over Victoria at the former price. Not long afterwards, however, the local makers entered into a combine with the importers of foreign-made machines, and came to an agreement as to the prices to be charged. With the exception of the Sunshine machine, which was £85, the prices ranged, as I have said, from £63 to £70; but, under the agreement, the price was fixed at£81 for all machines except the Sunshine, the latter being fixed at £83. Not long afterwards, a deputation of Victorian manufacturers waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs, and suggested that the imposition of a duty would reduce the price of the machines by at least <inline font-style="italic">£10</inline> in two years; and it is well known to honorable members that that agitation resulted in the breaking up of the Combine. I can find no evidence of a combine - there maybe no written arrangement - but all the facts point to, at least, an understanding, which enabled the importer to compete for a certain amount of the trade, and yet insured to the local maker a very much higher price than he would have obtained with fair and reasonable competition. In the report of the Royal Commission, there is a reference made to the evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander</inline> Picken, representative of the firm of Messrs. Nicholson and Morrow. The report states - </para>

                    <para>In the statement submitted to the Commission by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alex.</inline> Picken, representative of Nicholson and Morrow, he said - " If the increase in the rate of duty be granted, the manufacturers would not penalize the farmer to that extent. They are prepared to give any guarantee desired' by the Commonwealth Parliament not to increase the price of stripper-harvesters beyond the present market value, viz., <inline font-style="italic">£81</inline> . . . And in addition to that they offer to reduce the price by <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> forthefirst year, and another£5 for the second year." " If necessary," said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> " I would put into writing, and hand to the Commission, a promise that the price should not be raised unless there is a large increase in the cost of the raw material or labour." " Under that agreement," he was asked, " would you propose to give a buyer any advantage which might come from a reduction of cost?" "Yes," he replied. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Quite a number of others, all on the same lines, made it clear that their intention, if they got a better control of the home markets, was to reduce the price of the machines. As a matter of fact, the advantage that the Australian maker is getting to-day is considerable. According to the report of the protectionist section of the Commission, it was admitted in evidence that the cost of landing an imported machine amounted in the case of the Massey-Harris to <inline font-style="italic">£14</inline> 16s. 6d. without the duty. When that report was written the duty was <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> 4s. 7d., which is 121/2 per cent on £38 os. 3d., that amount being described as the value of the machine. Subsequently, under a decision of the honorable member for Hume, when he was Minister of Trade and Customs, the duty was collected on the basis of a value of <inline font-style="italic">£60.</inline> The import charges plus the duty represent on that particular machine <inline font-style="italic">£26</inline> 16s. 6d., and on the International Harvester £24 3s. <inline font-style="italic">6d.,</inline> the difference being due to the fact that in the latter case there was less railage to be paid. An interesting statement is given in the Commission's report regarding the relative profits on the Australian as against the foreign machine. The  Commission state - </para>

                <para class="block">It was also enacted that in each of those two years there should be a corresponding reduction in the price of drills. I have asked a number of questions in this House as to whether those reductions have taken place, but unfortunately obtained very little satisfaction out of the answers. We have always been told that the manufacturers were reducing the price of the machines, but, in all my travelling about the country, I have not come across one instance where the provisions of that Act have been complied with. The makers got the duty they wanted, but in selling to the farmers they are absolutely ignoring what they stated on oath before the Commission to be their intention. It is about time that this House made a thorough investigation into the question of the price of harvesters and drills. I deal with those two classes of implement only because they are all that were included in the Act of  1906.  I am satisfied that evidence could be obtained that the prices have increased. I am certain that they have in Western Australia. I was in that State recently, and found that the price there was  £105,  whereas when the Commission was sitting the price quoted to them for a machine, including charges landed in Western Australia, was£87. In South Australia, I believe - I may be wrong - that the price is higher now than it was when we passed that Act. I know that nominally <inline font-style="italic">£81</inline> per machine is charged, but a charge is also made for some of the attachments which were not charged for prior to the introduction of that legislation. Seeing that those gentlemen have obtained the advantage of a duty, and made promises such as I have proved that they made, it is the duty of this House to ascertain whether they are carrying out their part of the contract. I admit that it will be difficult to do so. I find it most difficult to obtain information as to selling prices, and I believe that we shall only arrive at the truth by means of a Committee armed with the necessary powers to obtain evidence from those interested. It is also not forgotten that these men promised, under another Act which was passed at the same time, to pay reasonable wages, based on Wages Boards decisions or Arbitration Court awards. I do not say that all of them have evaded the Act, because, as a matter of fact, a large number of the manufacturers in South Australia paid, and still pay, the wages fixed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor. In Victoria, some firms are doing the same, but others, who gain an equal advantage from our Tariff legislation, are not paying anything like those rates. I shall quote some of the wages paid by one particular firm for skilled labour, which work out at an average of less than the wages of ordinary labour. </para>

Assuming this statement and the inference therefrom as being correct, and adding to the cost of materials and the cost of wages another 10 per cent, to represent general expenses of manufacturing, management, lighting, insurance, &amp;c, the cost of a complete machine in Australia should work out at about <inline font-style="italic">£41.</inline></para>
                <para class="block">The report also sets forth that the actual merchandizing profit is <inline font-style="italic">£18</inline> 2S. 7d. per machine, and the liberal allowance of ^21 17s. 5d. is made for selling expenses. If the information on which the Department instituted proceedings against this firm for the recovery of Excise amounting to £20,000 was correct, the proprietors of the Sunshine Harvester Works in one year must have made a profit of ,£61,410. The duty on stripper-harvesters was increased to <inline font-style="italic">£12</inline> per machine, and manufacturers here were thus placed in a much better position to compete with the importers. As the result of that legislation, the price of the imported machine was increased, and, in the circumstances, I appeal to the House to say whether it is fair that the local manufacturers, notwithstanding the sweated labour employed in the industry, should still be charging the farmer £80 odd for a machine which, on the evidence before the Commission, costs only £41 ? My desire is that there shall be a thorough investigation. The honorable member for Wannon has put to the Minister of Trade and Customs a number of questions on this subject, but has not been able to obtain a direct answer. Last session I also put a number of questions to the Minister, but was invariably put off with the reply that the price had been reduced, or that further inquiries were being made by the Department. The duty on harvesters was increased on the distinct understanding that the price of these machines would be reduced.

                        <para>- That is so. I think that I am putting my case fairly before the House. The manufacturers have beaten us in a Court of law so far as the collection of Excise is concerned, but, save for inquiries made by the Department, nothing has been done, so far as I am aware, to compel them to comply with the Act, which provides for the machines being sold at reduced rates. The matters which I have brought before the House deserve consideration, and the investigation of a Committee, whose report will enable us to judge what steps it would be best to take to make the manufacturers of stripper-harvesters do what they offered to do. The reduction of prices was a voluntary offer by them, evidently made to gull honorable members into the belief that, if the duties were increased, the farmers would benefit. Having got higher duties, they proceeded to treat the farmers, as badly as they have treated their workmen. I hope that the House will agree to the inquiry, which should not take long, and ' should procure information, not otherwise obtainable, which will strengthen the hands of the Minister in giving effect to the law. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall support the proposal for a Select Committee made by the honorable member for Grey. Since the Act was passed, we have heard from the employed that all the manufacturers have not loyally observed the conditions attached to the granting of higher duties, while, on the other hand, some of the manufacturers say that, by reason of competition, and for other causes, they are unable to comply with those conditions. There is no one in this House who would not say that a compact should be kept ; and the honorable member has clearly proved that a virtual compact was entered into by Parliament and the manufacturers of stripper-harvesters. The latter stated repeatedly, when giving evidence before the Tariff Commission, and through members of the House, that they would pay higher wages, and improve the conditions of their workers, if the duties on their manufactures were increased j but, having got higher duties, some of them have not carried out the terms of the bargain. Of course, there are others who are loyally observing the compact, and one of the reasons for the proposed inquiry is the necessity for finding out who are breaking their word, and who are deserving of encouragement for having done what they promised to do. But why has my honorable friend limited the investigation to an inquiry into the prices charged for stripper-harvesters? Why not <inline font-style="italic">have</inline> a full inquiry" into the facts of this industry? </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Let us ascertain whether the industry provides healthy and well-remunerated employment. Parliament, in passing the Act, thought that, while Australian skill and ingenuity should be permitted to compete on fair terms with the world at large, those employed in the manufacture of stripper-harvesters should also receive fair treatment. It is therefore important to ascertain what manufacturers are recalcitrant, and what manufacturers are observing the bond which was entered into. To give greater scope to the inquiry, I move as an amendment - </para>

When the Tariff was under discussion, and it was proposed to further increase the duty on stripper-harvesters, I received a letter from a firm manufacturing these implements in my division, in which it was stated that the writers were severely handicapped by reason of what was being done by manufacturers in other parts of the Commonwealth. That letter showed clearly that, in the interests of the good employers, we should make known who are the bad employers, who are trying to introduce sweating conditions of production, and at the same time endeavouring to take as much as they can from the consumers. </para>

                        <para>- It could take the sworn evidence of these manufacturers, and we should form our own conclusions if they did not choose to produce papers which were asked for. It was alleged, during the investigation conducted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins that the manufacturers cannot successfully carry on their industry if the prescribed rates of wages have to be paid, and that has been repeated by honorable members in this Chamber, who have said that the rates demanded cannot be paid under the existing duties. Parliament has imposed a duty of £12 on every stripper-harvester imported. That is equivalent to 30 per cent, on the cost of manufacturing such a machine in Australia, and to at least 40 or 50 per cent, on the cost of a machine manufactured abroad. It is clear that this duty is passed on to the consumers. The honorable member for Grey produced incontrovertible evidence of  that. </para>

Why, then, should I be. accused of raising the fiscal question, when I am merely stating a fact which he himself must acknowledge?

Having created, by means of the duty, a fund out of which good wages should be paid, we must discover how far such wages are being paid, and how the employes in the industry are being treated. If the manufacturers can demonstrate that they cannot pay the prescribed rate of wages, and observe the conditions which hav"e been laid down, we ought to know it. It has been claimed by honorable members opposite that duties do not increase prices, and, therefore, they should be eager to inquire into the truth of the statement that in this instance duties have increased prices. They ought to be as eager as we are to see whether the theory does, or does not, break down at this point ; because we have statements, supported by voluminous proof, that in this case, at any rate, a duty does raise the price. </para>

                        <para>- Then I shall say we have alleged proof, if that will satisfy the honorable member. It maybe, as alleged, that internal competition has become very keen; and, if protection does not raise prices, and profit is reduced to the lowest margin, then it seems to me that the employers- should court inquiry, particularly in view of the new protection which we have to consider. Both sides should be possessed of all the facts, in order to find out whether there be such internal competition as to bring the price to an unremunerative level, and .whether there is <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> margin, in industries which are properly and skilfully worked, to pay good wages and enable fair conditions to be observed. If there be such a margin, and fair conditions and wages do not prevail, then we ought to review our side of the compact. The duties in question were agreed to on certain conditions, and we have to ascertain whether those conditions have been observed, and, if not, why not. </para>

                        <para>.- I think that the honorable member for Grey will be very willing to accept the addition proposed by the honorable member for Parramatta, because it is entirely in the spirit of his motion. I should like to take advantage of this opportunity, as a freetrader, to express my appreciation of the new departure which is involved in what is called the new protection. The basis of the public support which has been given to the protective policy throughout Australia, has mainly consisted of the belief that it was impossible to maintain Australian conditions and pay good wages in a large number -of manufacturing industries, unless Tariff protection were conceded to those engaged in the industries. The main plea, so far as the great mass of the people are concerned, has not been based on any desire to aggrandize the capitalists, but on a desire to see Australian labour employed under conditions equal to those which prevail in other communities. My own view has been that, in a large continent like this, it would be more to the general advantage if Australian enterprise and labour were devoted mainly to sources of industry which spontaneously yield a large and natural profit, and which produce articles which are sought for by the great buying powers of the world. I have looked on the maximum of advantage to Australian capital and Australian labour, as best sought in developing the veins of natural wealth which Australia so abundantly possesses. In working with nature, instead of against nature - in working with the industrial conditions, which so happily prevail in Australia, instead of against them - the maximum of benefit will be derived by the great capitalistic concerns of this country, and also by the great mass of the Australian workers employed in them. Whilst that has been, and still is, my view, I cannot avoid recognising that it is not the view which is entertained by a majority of the Australian electors. They are prepared to adopt what is called a protectionist policy ; but that policy has been adopted by .the great mass of the people, who believe in it, and those sacrifices which are involved by duties on trade are made by the great mass of the people, with the object of securing fair remuneration for Australian industry. I have appreciated from the first the object which has been kept in view by those who have at last converted the protective policy into a policy of securing to the workers of Australia a fair dividend from the sacrifices which are made by the people of Australia. </para>

I am well aware that a number of gentlemen, who hold the same fiscal views  as myself, do not look on the new protection with any kind of favour. But my view is that, if this, which i believe to be a bad policy, is the law of the land, and if the motive of that policy was that all workers should receive an honest share of its benefits, no honorable man can shrink from making an effort to secure to the workers of Australia a fair share of the sacrifice of the people. </para>

In the United States multi-millionaires are growing up as rapidly as mushrooms, under the shadow of a gigantic Tariff, while the artisans and operatives are crowded in unhealthy tenements, living under conditions which are far beneath the level which ought to prevail in a country blessed so abundantly by nature, and so full of magnificent energy, enterprise, and invention. </para>

                        <para>- If we are to be guided by the experience there, it will not be in the direction of not establishing new protection. Unfortunately, in that great Republic, with its magnificent Tariff, where workmen are in many cases underpaid, and where children of eight and ten years of age are worked like white slaves, we hear no demand for the new protection. It is a scandal and a disgrace that there should be high Tariffs without some attempt to see that the vast benefits conferred on the industries are not extended, in an honest degree, to the people, who, after all, are the backbone of those industries. For once I find myself in a position in which I can cordially co-operate with my protectionist friends, who have invented this entirely new scheme ; and it is indeed wonderful that it has not been invented before now. I wish it to be distinctly understood, however, that I am not going to allow my desire to pass legislation to cany out the object to which I have referred, to be made use of as a mere stalking horse - as a mere pretext - for introducing an amendment of the Constitution to enable the Commonwealth to take over from the States the control of all the industrial conditions of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I mention it only incidentally, because I fear there may be an attempt of the sort ; and I wish to say at once, so that there shall be no misunderstanding, that if there is any attempt, under cover of that which I heartily approve, to alter the Constitution in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> way I have indicated, I shall absolutely oppose it. I hope that no such attempt will be made - that those who believe in the new protection will not allow any such attempt. I am prepared to follow my convictions up. If the Constitution as it stands at present is so drawn that, in a matter peculiarly affecting the Commonwealth and its power of Tariff legislation - if in a matter peculiarly and' solely within its province - the Commonwealth is hampered in carrying out the best features of a protectionist policy, I am thoroughly in favour of the Commonwealth having the power to do that which is its own business, and which no other Parliament can do. No State can operate on the Tariff, which is a matter entirely beyond the States. </para>

What I expect from the Government is some practical scheme. </para>

                        <para>- Something like it. Surely my honorable friend is not very proud of that measure? I should think that any one who believes in that scheme cannot feel very proud of the way in which his position is put before the country. My approval will be given to some rational, sensible scheme of carrying out the principle of the new protection, but I shall not allow the Government to make use of it in a direction which is in no sense justifiable. When manufacturers clamour for  30  per cent, and 5Q per cent, protection on the ground that they require the money in order to pay Australian wages, surely we are entitled to see whether they are paying Australian wages. Surely when we put duties of  50  per cent, upon articles, which the mass of working men of Australia use every day of their lives, for the sake of giving their Australian brethren fair wages in manufacturing industries, it is a matter of common honesty to see that the manufacturers hand over the share to which Australian labour is entitled. My fiscal views do not incline me to look on manufacturers with peculiar affection. I do not think it is a feature of the free- trade theory that manufacturers should be coddled to enable them to keep money that belongs to their workers - money which other workers have paid across the shop counters of Australia in the interests of their fellows employed in manufacturing industries. There are many people to consider when we are dealing with the interests of the big manufacturers. In a sense, those men are trustees for the workers whom they employ. I do not say. that they should not have a fair remuneration for their own capital and industry. I am not a destroyer. I recognise the absolute right of men of enterprise, who have been encouraged by the public policy to engage in Australian industries, to receive fair and liberal treatment. We have no right to encourage them to engage in those industries unless we give them a fair prospect of an honest remuneration for their enterprise and skill. </para>

                        <para>- I always stand by Tasmania. I have the greatest desire to do what is fair by it, especially in those Tariff matters that come up, as the honorable member knows, from time to time. But my point is this : These high duties were put on in order to give our workers a fair share of the benefits of them. Those benefits go at present to the manufacturers out of the pockets of the people of Australia, and the House which gave the manufacturers the duties is entitled to see that the workers get a fair share of the advantage. Surely that is a fair proposition, whether one is a free-trader or protectionist? I think it would be very difficult indeed to carry the principle out. I do not believe that the Government are likely to frame any scheme which will grapple with this difficulty, because they have never studied the subject.

                        <para>- I was beginning to fear, sir, that you were overlooking your duties by not calling those honorable members to order as promptly as was desirable, but I am one of those who are not seriously discomposed by interruptions. I am obliged, however, to you for your ultimate intervention on my behalf. I very much regret the abject failure of the Government to administer their own Act. They obtained an Act conferring upon them absolute power to extort an Excise from the manufacturers, and we were assured that it was constitutional, but the High Court has ruled it to be unconstitutional. Is it not a thousand pities that the Government should obtain the passage of high duties under a promise to apply the new protection and that that promise should be shown by the highest tribunal in the land to be founded upon a wrongful conception of the law? I deeply regret the fashion that is setting in of attacking some of the Justices of the High Court in respect of judgments which they deliver, and praising other Justices when their views seem to be in harmony with those of certain members of the community. I deplore what has happened lately in the shape of attacks upon some members of the High Court, and eulogy of others in connexion with the performance of their judicial duties. </para>

That is the line that has always been drawn in British communities, even in times of the highest excitement. I shall support this motion. We cannot have too much light thrown upon the subject. With regard to the consumers, to whom reference was made, may i suggest, as one of the strongest arguments in favour of the new protection, and one which has influenced my mind very much in support of it, that at last we shall get some daylight thrown on to the real; operation of the Tariff, the real margin of profit that exists, and the real difference between Australian wages and those of other countries ? The more light that is thrown on the inner operations of industries under the Tariff, the better will it be for those who believe in a different system. </para>

                        <para>.- After the lengthy address on States rights and other questions to which we have just listened, I think it well to suggest that we should return to the subject immediately before us. I do not know that any one is proposing to take away from the States the control of industries. It is clear, however, that the Commonwealth Parliament requires, to be vested with additional powers, and it seems to me that the proposed Select Committee would serve a useful purpose in preparing the way for submitting to the people proposals for an amendment of the Constitution which would enable us to carry out certain promises that we have made. Even if the amendment be not carried - and ' I think that we may very well accept it - the question of the wages paid in this industry, as well as the cost of production, is sure to be dealt with by the Committee. The manufacturers have not kept the promise which they made to the users of these machines when they asked for increased protection,, nor have they fulfilled their promise in. regard to the payment of reasonable wages. Their attitude supports the contention of many honorable members that we have in the community a number of people who must be coerced into doing the right thing. The manufacturers asked to be protected from foreign trusts, and we immediately  passed anti-trust legislation. We said to them, " We shall guarantee you the local market provided that you will pay fair wages to your employes, and treat the users of these machines fairly." " That was a reasonable proposition,, and it was agreed to. The Act which was designed to gi've effect tq it now has been declared unconstitutional, and although the honest section of the manufacturers have been paying the wages which a Justice of the High Court declared to be fair and reasonable, others have taken advantage of this technicality, and have not carried out the bargain. Among honest men there should be no question as to the legality or otherwise of such a measure. It does not necessarily follow that the prices of these machines have been increased because of the protective duty. Many men who have things to sell will ask all that they can get for them. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. It is clear that our legislation has given the local manufacturers control of the Australian market. They have secured a certain measure of! power, and hence I think that the proposed inquiry would be exceedingly useful. It would give the manufacturers an opportunity to prove that they are charging reasonable prices for their machines. 1 would remind the House that portion of our legislation in respect of the new protection remains unfinished. We were promised that provision would be made for the appointment of a Board of Trade, whose business &lt; it would be to inquire into prices charged by manufacturers, and to report annually as to the cost of production, so that we might determine whether the measure of protection granted was too high or too low. The appointment of the proposed Select Committee would be a preliminary step in that direction. </para>

                        <para>- I should not imagine that they would oppose it. The Government ought certainly to have in their possession a list of the' factories in which the award of the Court is being observed. If that information is not in the possession of a Government Department, it ought to be ; it ought not to be necessary to have a fishing inquiry to obtain i't. When a manufacturer is called upon to show why he has made certain charges he will doubtless make assertions as to the cost of production, and it will be necessary for the Committee to be empowered to take evidence with respect to that phase of the question. It would be well to publish a list of those employers who decline to do the right thing unless a policeman, so to speak, is sent to their works/ The light of day should be let in upon their actions. Those who seek to take advantage of the workers will undoubtedly take advantage of the users of their machinery. The House cannot afford to .allow this inquiry to stand over until a referendum is taken with respect to an amendment of the Constitution. The Tariff Commission did good work, but that which this Committee will be called upon to do will be very different. The Tariff Commission took the evidence of those who came before it with, a distinct object in view, but this Committee will have power to summon those whom it desires to examine, and will doubtless endeavour to obtain a disclosure of facts from those who are supposed to have something to hide. The whole community feels nowadays that the fabric of society is so interwoven that we are justified in seeking to let the light of day into the management and control of industries. I do not suggest that there should be a . disclosure of trade secrets, but I think we have a right to inquire into the position of the workers and the conditions of industrial life generally. It should not take long or cost much to ascertain the facts relating to this industry. An increasingly large number is interested in the manufacture and sale of harvesters. I represent a very large constituency directly interested in this question, and my constituents very reasonably want to know what efforts we are making to secure for them some of the benefits of protection. They want to know whether we are going to allow dishonest manufacturers to " take them down ' ' after they have been given a monopoly of the market, and so far we have had no answer to give them. The Government should have taken up this matter, and they should be ready at once to agree to the appointment of a Select Committee and to clothe it with all the powers necessary to secure a thorough investigation. Its appointment may have some effect on those manufacturers who are not prepared to do what is a fair thing. It is bad to have in the community men who will be honest only when they are coerced. I was shocked to find that we have in the community even a limited number of men, posing before the public as men of standing, who need to be coerced into acting fairly and reasonably by their workmen. Such men ought -to be exposed. When a man is prosecuted for an offence against the criminal law his name is published broadcast, and since we have dealt fairly with the manufacturers of these machines I fail to see why we should not publish the names of those who are not doing fairly by their employes and those who have to purchase their machinery. Where would some of them be if we said to them, "This bargain is off?" Where would they be if Parliament were to say, " As you have failed to keep your part of the bargain, we shall dissolve it altogether, by taking off the existing duties, and leaving you exposed to the competition of the International Harvester Trust, and other foreign makers"? J do not think that we should do that, because there is a chance that we may be able to exercise wider powers. I regret that the leader of the Opposition has raised the bogey of State rights. It has not been proposed to interfere with the rights of the States. In many matters the powers of the Commonwealth and the States are concurrent, and I think that the Commonwealth can control matters of this kind without interfering with the rights of the. States. The desire of the mover of the motion is to shed daylight on what is believed to be wrong-doing, with a view to having carried out the bargain which has been made between Parliament, the manufacturers, the workers, and the consumers. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not entirely agree with those who wholly condemn insurance companies and their methods. These companies, like individuals, vary in their character, some being good, and some bad. The mover of the motion spoke of the desirability of the proposed inquiry in the interest of the poor. But it is the duty of this Parliament to study the interest of all classes of the community. Companies which impose on the poor doubtless, too, impose on the middle class and on the rich; if they are dishonest, they treat unfairly all with whom they have dealings. In my opinion, the proposed investigation is needed, and will do good, and I agree with the honorable member for Coolgardie that it should be made by a Royal Commission rather than by a Select Committee. </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with the honorable member for Coolgardie that the Commission should be composed of experts, such as accountants. If it is composed of outside persons, very likely those who are chosen will be men who occasionally work for fire, life, or other insurance companies, or similar institutions, and who are consequently prejudiced in their favour. While honorable members in this House from time to time accuse of lack of intelligence those belonging to other parties, I think that there is sufficient intelligence among us to enable a suitable Commission to be formed of members ?&gt;f Parliament. The electors are not such fools as' to send to Parliament men who have not sufficient ability to deal with subjects of this kind. To belittle the intelligence of members of Parliament is to belittle the intelligence of the people. My desire is to have a Royal Commission substituted for a Select Committee, and I wish to know whether I should be in order in moving an amendment to that effect. </para>

If it be determined that the words shall not stand the further question will be whether the words " Royal Commission composed of persons having special knowledge " be inserted. When I put that question it will be competent for any member to move to strike out all the words after the words " Royal Commission." </para>

I think the House will agree with me in appointing members of the House or others to act, because I should not limit the body to honorable members to the exclusion of experts. I think, however, that if the Committee were composed altogether of experts we should not have available that information which is so desirable when we came to deal with the report. </para>

                        <para>- Because a Royal Commission can deal better with witnesses and obtain more information than can any other body ; and this is a question of the greatest importance, affecting every individual in the community. In my ,own city I have always been in favour of municipal fire insurance, because I think that the profits should go into the pockets of the people instead of into the pockets of shareholders, who, by reason of their strong union, are able to charge more than their business is worth. I am in favour of unions generally, but, unfortunately, the business of fire insurance has got into the hands of such a strong combine that great hardship is inflicted on the general public. Such an inquiry as I suggest would, if successfully conducted, benefit the whole of the community. </para>

                    <para>.- I look with a certain amount of doubt on the appointment of either a Select Committee or a Royal Commission. I should like to see an inquiry into the working of insurance companies with a view of letting the public know the advantages of the mutual system as against the proprietary system. I do not desire to go into the merits of the two systems, but I do say that my strong preference would be for the one based on the perfect co-operation realized through the mutual system of insurance when 'properly worked. If we are to have a Select Committee I doubt whether we shall be able to obtain in this House the experience necessary to properly guide the inquiry. I very much doubt also whether, if we appoint a commission of experts, we shall get the dispassionate or unprejudiced judgment on which we ought to rely in any legislation. Insurance is a most technical subject, as I learned twelve or fourteen years ago, when I was instructed by the South Australian Government to draw up a Bill dealing with State Fire Insurance. Prior .to drafting that Bill, it was my duty to prepare a special report on the fire insurance system, and from the knowledge! then picked up, I found it to be an exceedingly technical subject, and one on which we cannot hope for much light by means of a perfunctory inquiry by either a Select Committee or, as often constituted, a Royal Commission. Some years ago some, very able articles on the subject were contributed to the English magazines as a result of a Royal Commission, and these articles - one in, I think, the <inline font-style="italic">Edinburgh Review -</inline> show how great are the difficulties connected with the proportion the premium ought to bear to the benefits given, what the bonuses ought to be, the cost of management, and so. forth. Regular actuarial comparisons have to be made; and, however valuable the general knowledge of honorable members may be, I do not see how they could, by any examination of actuaries, come to a conclusion likely to guide our judgment. I should like to have an inquiry made, not by insurance experts, who may or may not be more or less prejudiced by particular ideas of management, but by fairly competent men, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> and those associated with him, into the working of the principle of insurance. Some years ago, when the South Australian Government desired to know how friendly societies worked in that State - whether their operations were based on proper actuarial calculations and so forth - a report was obtained from the Government Actuary, and that report to some extent guided the Parliament. </para>

At all events, this man was not connected with any company or society, and hence was unprejudiced, and capable, from his education, of coming to a reasonable conclusion. I do not desire to discuss the matter, but I ask the Government to consider whether it would not be possible, instead of appointing a roving Royal Commission, which may think it necessary to journey to New Zealand and cross-examine, with imperfect light, various witnesses on a highly technical subject, or of appointing a Committee of laymen from this House, to have a Board of skilled officers, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> to report on the whole matter for the enlightenment of Parliament? </para>

                        <para>- That is precisely what the Attorney-General did not do; but he promised that he would consult his colleagues, and that we should have a Ministerial statement. It seems impossible, for some reason or other, to get a Ministerial statement on any question to-night. I suppose it is all right. The Government have only to gently and privately make an intimation to their friends in the corner, and then no Ministerial statement is necessary. Everybody in the Labour corner seems satisfied, with the exception, perhaps, of the honorable member for Melbourne, and he never looks satisfied with the Government. </para>

Personally, I think that a small Commission, that will take complete evidence, and be properly equipped with powers to conduct a thorough investigation, is the proper thing, because the law relating to life, marine, and fire insurance has not, so far as the whole public of Australia are concerned, been adequately considered. </para>

                <para class="block">I should like to know whether the Government have yet made up their minds whether there is to be any statement as to their attitude on the motion. There may be small matters which the House may take into its own hands, and on which it may determine to appoint a Select Committee or a Royal Commission in the teeth of the Government, but I venture to say that on a question of this great importance - and there can be no question as to its supreme importance to the industrial life of the country - the Government ought to have a clear and definite mind. I can conceive of no question so profoundly affecting the large body of the population as that now under discussion. I appeal to the Minister to say what the intentions of the Government are, so that we may know precisely what to do in the matter. </para>

                    <para>.- I can only regard it as most unfortunate that a previous motion should have been postponed to make way for that now under discussion. While I admit the importance of the subject-matter of the motion, I think it would be a great mistake to appoint a Royal Commission as the best means of dealing with it. In the world of insurance we have all the statistical and other information, except that relating to allegations made in regard to certain parties in the Commonwealth at the present time. If the Government have made up their minds to appoint a Royal Commission, I hope they will have die courage to say so; but I find that the one way of shelving a question in this Parliament is to have it referred to a Royal Commission. A Select Committee is not so successful in this connexion because it must report before Parliament prorogues. But a Commission can be appointed to keep a subject dangling for two or three years, and when its labours are concluded, not one honorable member out of three reads even the report, to say nothing of the evidence. If this matter is urgent, I hope it will be sent to . a Select Committee, which will deal with it promptly ; but if a Royal Commission is to be appointed, I hope the Government will stand up and say that it is necessary, and not keep the House in a state of uncertainty as to what they intend to do. For my own part, I feel that to keep motions of this kind dragging on can do nothing more nor less than demoralize Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- That Commission was not slipped through. At any rate, I cannot help the past, but I shall do my utmost to safeguard the interests of reform in the future. My objection to remitting the subject to a Royal Commission is that it will delay legislation on the matter for two years or more. When a Government who mean to do business come into power, and try to deal with the matter in the interests of the people, they will not be free to do so, because the exercise of a power of the Crown, separate from Parliament, in the shape of the Royal Commission, will have debarred Parliament from legislating on the subject. Even if at the next election the whole of the people declared in favour of a thorough reform in this matter, that reform could not be made law, because of the fact that certain people had been appointed by the Crown to investigate the subject, and it would be an interference with the rights of the Crown for Parliament to step in before the Commission reported. Such a state of affairs would be a humiliation to a national Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I wish merely to verify my own statement of the facts. I trust the House will not agree to make this body a Royal Commission, but will appoint a Select Committee, and give it all necessary powers. A Select Committee has now every power except that of penalizing witnesses who refuse to answer proper questions. There is a Bill before the House, which the Government could go on with, to give Select Committees full powers to deal with witnesses. That Bill was before the last Parliament. Why do not the Government proceed with it now if Select Committees have not sufficient powers to do their work properly? There would be no difficulty in proceeding with that Bill to-night. I object to tying up important legislation for two or three years with paltry Commissions, that serve no useful public purpose. I am ready and willing <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> allow honorable members an opportunity of serving on a Select Committee if they think they have a good case, and are prepared to give the necessary, time to the work. . </para>

                <para class="block">He went on to point out some of the difficulties regarding industrial, prudential, and other forms of insurance, and, in the same speech, expressed his own personal view that1 a small Royal Commission was the better method of procedure. ' The honorable member for Wide Bay now says that a Select Committee is the more expeditious method, whilst the honorable member for Angas says that we ought to be extremely careful in what we do, and advises us to try to secure the help of some of our statisticians. In the multitude of counsellors on this occasion there is confusion, and not safety. At the time the Attorney-General spoke, he did right to say that he would consult the Government as to what steps should be taken. That consultation has taken place, and I shall inform the House before I sit down what view the Government take on the matter, and what course they intend to pursue. In the meantime, it should be pointed out, in reply to the honorable member for Wide Bay, that if a Select Committee were appointed its functions would cease at the end of this session. As the House will in all probability be out of session very shortly, the Committee would not have long to sit. In ordinary circumstances, and under ordinary conditions, this session will cease possibly a few days before Christmas, and, in the regular course of events, there would be no further meeting of Parliament until probably some time in next June. During the whole of that period there would, consequently,  be no body charged with conducting an inquiry into this subject, unless the Select Committee were turned into a Royal Commission before the prorogation, as was suggested when this motion was previously debated. Therefore, if an inquiry is to be made, it would be better and more expeditious to appoint a Royal Commission at once. </para>

With regard to the subject now under review, a subject which touches practically every household in the community, we require to be very well advised before we proceed with legislation. Inasmuch as the effort of this House would be, in all circumstances, to protect the poorer classes who deal in life or other forms of assurance, we require to be most cautious as to how we move in the matter, lest we do harm.

                        <para>- Possibly they may be. At present, however, I am dealing with the two proposals before the House. The first of these provides for the appointment of a Select Committee, and very little consideration will show that it would not achieve the objects that honorable members have in view. The second, a Royal Commission might take more time to investigate and present a report, but in the absence of any better proposal what are we to do? </para>

On the other hand, unless I misunderstand the temper of this House, what is proposed or about to be proposed is something entirely new with regard to life and fire assurance. </para>

                    <para>.- On the last sitting day of last session, the honorable member for Melbourne put to the Attorney-General certain questions, relating to life assurance business, which were based  on  statements published in a Melbourne journal. . The Attorney-General replied that the managing director of the company referred to had recommended the appointment of a Royal Commission. It would' appear that the Government are now ready to adopt the suggestion or recommendation! made four months ago, by the managing director of the Citizens' Life Assurance Company.  Since the question to which I refer was asked, we have had from a Justice of the Supreme Court of South Australia, comments on the business methods of that company. The Attorney-General, informed the honorable member for Melbourne that he had a rough draft of as Bill to deal with this question, but the Honorary Minister to night, in reply to an interjection I made, would not say whether or not that draft was still in existence. I am anxious that something should be done, and done expeditiously. If the business methods of the company I have named are as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Gordon, then not only this Parliament, but every person likely to assure his life in&gt; Australia, ought to know it. </para>

                        <para>- I am not. I have said that its managing director, according to the information put before us by the Attorney-General, has suggested the appointment of a Royal Commission. The Honorary Minister deliberately evaded a question that I put, by way of interjection, with reference to the existence of ai draft Bill dealing with this question. A similar statement was made about a fortnight ago by the  Attorney-General  when this question came up. If the Government are in 'earnest, I hope that they will see that a Committee or Royal- Commission is appointed to inquire into the methods of these particular insurance com.panies. If they are properly conducted  they  have nothing to fear. </para>

                        <para>- I had no intention of stirring up the Treasurer or any other hon.orable member. According to the answer of the Attorney-General to the honorable member for Melbourne, the manager of a particular company stated on the 5th June that he had no objection to the appointment of a Royal Commission  by  the Government. But no action has been taken, so far as we have been informed. No statement has been made until to-night, when the Honorary Minister has made the statement that the Government consider that a Royal Commission will be the most expeditious method of inquiry. I hope that the matter will not be lost sight of. I feel sure that the honorable member for Darwin will not withdraw his proposal, but will insist that some inquiry shall be made as to the methods of certain insurance companies in Australia. My only hope is that the most expeditious method of inquiry will be adopted. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Yarra, that if an inquiry is to be held it must be by means of a Royal Commission - and not by a Select Committee ; because the present session will be a short one, and the members of a Select Committee could not attend to their parliamentary duties and do Committee work properly at the same time. I do not agree with the second part of the amendment of the honorable member for Coolgardie with regard to experts, because the experts on whom the Government would have to rely would be persons largely dependent upon insurance companies for their living. </para>

                        <para>- A friend of mine, who is looked upon, as one of the leading accountants in one of the States of the Commonwealth, on one . occasion took certain action, a/nd was in consequence refused the  auditorship  of companies, even when the fees did not amount to more than £25 or £30. He was so punished simply because of certain action that he took. We must not expect first-class actuaries and accountants to do the work that will be required of this Royal Commission We ought to do what was done by a Commission of which I was a member in South Australia. It had reference to the Civil Service. One of our duties was to inquire into the Police Superannuation Fund, and place it upon an actuarial basis. Those who have had experience of similar  funds  in the Commonwealth know that they tend to get into a state of disorganization, and to become practically insolvent. In this case we called in the State Government Actuary, and told him that we wanted certain information. We got it. </para>

I do not expect much by way of result from the Government until they have better guidance than they seem to have at present. This is a question as to which expert information is needed.

The honorable member for Wide Bay has said that he never saw any value from the work of a Royal Commission. If that be so, it is his duty to oppose the appointment of a Royal Commission on any subject. But I take a very different view. I agree that very few honorable members take the trouble to read the evidence collected by Royal Commissions. </para>

                        <para>- But my experience tells me that the members of this, and other Parliaments, are familiar with the reports of important Commissions. I do not say that they read all the evidence. I admit that I did not read the whole of the evidence taken by our Tariff Commission. But when I wanted information on a. particular matter I knew where to find it in the report. Whether honorable members make themselves familiar with such evidence or not, it is certain that legislation can be based upon such reports, and I feel sure that those who frame such legislation take the trouble to consider both the evidence and reports. We have an example in the Navigation Bill now before the Senate. It is based upon the report and evidence of 'a Royal Commission, which sat for a considerable time. I make no charge against any particular insurance company, but charges of the most shocking character have been made. It has been shown in the press, in different parts of the Commonwealth, that some of these companies </para>

I should not like to believe that all that has been stated in. this connexion is true. But as legislators it is our duty either to prove that companies are not guilty of what has been charged against them, or to see that the poorest members of the community are protected by law.

                        <para>- I do not think that we are in the habit of anticipating what may happen. Unfortunately our experience is that, after some enormity has <inline font-style="italic">been</inline> committed, we continue to tinker with legislation year after year, and even then do not effectually deal with the evil. The Australian Industries Preservation Act affords us an excellent illustration of this. If we cannot enact legislation to deal effectually with evils which have actually occurred, I do not think that we are likely to achieve much by attempting to anticipate evils. It will be useless to appoint a Select Committee to inquire into the methods adopted by insurance companies unless the Government intend at a later stage to convert it into a Royal Commission. At the same time, I hold that if the services of experts are necessary, it would be far better, in the interests of legislation, to require those experts to give evidence before a Royal Commission. </para>

                        <para>- They would probably be got outside the House. I do not wish to underrate the ability of any honorable member, but I certainly think that an inquiry into certain matters by a Royal Commission calls for the possession of special and technical knowledge on the part of its members. It may be that there are some honorable members who have special knowledge to deal with those matters, but I think that the Commission should be composed of outsiders and not of Parliamentarians. In fact, to be candid, I think it is about time that the House took into its serious consideration the attitude which it is taking up with respect to the appointment of so many Select Committees and Royal Commissions. If the business can be done by a Select Committee while the House is in session, perhaps it would be a wise thing to appoint Select Committees to deal with many matters, but I believe that the appointment of Royal Commissions from time to time will not only lead to endless expense, but will not enhance the reputation of the Federal Parliament in the eyes of the general public. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not consider there is a great deal in the objection raised to the elimination of the words. I certainly think that any Government in appointing a Royal Commission would select some person or persons with a thorough knowledge of the operations of these institutions throughout the Commonwealth. It is a most remarkable  things  to me to hear honorable members protesting against the appointment and work of Royal Commissions, especially when it is remembered that during the last six years they have not objected to the appointment of a Royal Commission to deal with a far less serious matter than the one now under consideration. I should like any one here to try to explain to the House intelligently how a Select Committee, or even a Royal Commission, composed wholly of members of the House, could effectively conduct as inquiry into the subjects of fire insurance, life insurance, and prudential insurance. </para>

                        <para>- Nor did I agree to that aspect of the question. I was originally of the opinion - and I hold it still - that it would have been of advantage to that Commission to appoint one or two persons to it who were not members of Parliament. However, it is our duty to do the best we can to unravel the administration of the Department. As to the proposed Commission, I think' its composition  might  as well be left to the Ministry. I have on the business-paper a notice of motion asking for a Commission to inquire into one phase of this matter, and I framed that notice only after reflection had convinced me that nothing but a Royal Commission would make an effective investigation. The honorable member for Wide Bay has been rather trenchant in his criticism, and has made remarks with regard to the working of Commissions and those who have held positions on them which were unwarranted. 1 ask him, and the honorable member for Kennedy, to say whether they are ready to deal with the momentous questions of fire and life insurance without the assistance of a Commission. Has the Government at its command men with sufficient knowledge of the subject to frame legislation which could satisfactorily deal with this matter? If a Commission is appointed and does its duty thoroughly, going to the root of things, there will be revelations which will paralyze many of the insurance companies, and surprise the general public. Had I time, I could name, not one, but many insurance companies doing business in this country whose operations should be closely investigated by us - -seeing that it is 'our duty to protect the public from institutions which prey on the savings of the poor. Industrial insurance is the most cruel of all forms of preying on the poor. Take the latest statistics- </para>

                        <para>- I am advancing, as a reason why experts should be appointed, the fact that technical records have to be investigated. In New South Wales, for every 100 persons taking out industrial insurance policies there are not three who, after the lapse of ten years, are continuing their payments, the other policies having lapsed. These figures show how the poor are losing their savings, while the proprietary companies with which they insure are becoming rich. These matters call for sympathetic consideration, and I think that the Commission to be appointed will do great public service by preparing the way for effective legislation. It is our duty, as the makers of the laws of the country and the custodians of the rights of the people, to see that justice is done to those whom we have the honour to represent. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is in a great hurry to give his opinion. Obviously, persons with special knowledge should be appointed - that is, persons capable of obtaining by examination the information that is sought. If a Royal Commission is to be appointed, it is not too much to ask the Government to select the best men obtainable. Personally I have the poorest opinion of experts for general work, but what is asked for in this case is the appointment of persons possessing special knowledge, altogether a different thing. Honorable members are doubtless aware of the dictum of the Scotch Judge that there are liars, worse liars, and experts. There is a great deal in that. 1 do not ask for the appointment of experts, but I am in favour of the appointment c..f persons possessing special knowledge. </para>

I should like to know what is meant by " experts." What we need is a searching inquiry into the business methods of a number of institutions. If actuarial calculations are required in connexion with that investigation, they can be easily obtained ; but what we seek to rind out is the methods of doing business which are being followed - whether they are fair and honest. </para>

We should have some one on the Commission who will be able to say whether insurance business is carried on in the Commonwealth in a legitimate way. Men who have a pretty wide experience of the world, and know what business management is, would make a very much better Commission than one composed of actuarial experts who, however clever at actuarial investigations, might be quite unfitted for such an examination as we require. I do not object to the insertion of the words  ' special knowledge ' ' ; but I trust that the Commission will not be formed of men who have been engaged in running insurance businesses. The legal aspect of the question should be attended to by the Attorney-General's Department. We have the right to expect the officers of that Department to know all about the insurance laws of the various States. Evidence as to the failure of those laws might be obtained from persons who have been taken down by insurance companies. I have in mind certain cases which show that there is a very great need for an inquiry into the way in which insurance companies do business. I hope that the Government will consider the insertion of the words, if they are inserted, as an instruction to appoint to the Commission persons who will be best able to protect the interest of the public. </para>

I take it that we do not desire that persons engaged in the insurance business should be asked to report upon and recommend a system of insurance. What we particularly require is that the business shall be inquired into as it affects the public. If wo  look at the second paragraph, we shall find that it is proposed that the work of the Commission shall be to report on and recommend a system of insurance which will guarantee the public against extortion. That will involve a political work, as well as a business inquiry. I hope the words referred to will be struck out. </para>

                        <para>. - It was intended, when the Prime Minister left, to proceed to-morrow with the Marine Insurance Bill, but a strong desire has been expressed to-night by some honorable members to go on with the Defence Bill, for some time, at any rate. I have no doubt that, if one or two honorable members want to speak on the second reading of that measure before the Marine Insurance Bill is taken, the Prime Minister will have no objection. </para>
