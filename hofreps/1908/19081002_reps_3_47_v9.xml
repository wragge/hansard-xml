                        <para>- It will be for honorable members to deal with them immediately after the Budget statement, if they choose. My desire was - though it may not be possible this month - to advance the consideration of the Estimates to such a stage that it would not be necessary to bring in a Supply Bill based on the expenditure of last year. I hope, with the concurrence of the Prime Minister, to make the financial statement not later than next Wednesday week. </para>

                <para class="block">It is hardly necessary to explain the motion, as last night I made a brief statement of the procedure which the House is being asked to adopt. Honorable members will be asked to make nominations of sites immediately the motion is agreed to. Any member may nominate a site, but to be valid the nomination must be supported by at least five honorable members, and the nomination is to be made without debate. The ballot is not to take place until next Wednesday, which should give ample opportunity for the investigation of the matter, and for honorable members to make up their minds. It is proposed to then take an exhaustive ballot without further debate, in accordance with the procedure adopted on the last occasion when we dealt with this matter. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad to see the Government taking steps to bring this matter to a finality. But the method adopted on the last occasion was by no means satisfactory. The Minister proposes now, as then, to proceed by the process of elimination; and that, in my judgment, is not by any means an exhaustive ballot. I should like to see some alteration in the method on this occasion. I would point out the distinction between obtaining a majority of votes by the process of elimination, and obtaining a majority by actual votes cast for any site on its merits. On the last occasion many honorable members voted for Dalgety when they had no other choice, except one which was regarded as worse - in other words their vote for Dalgety was cast on the principle of choosing the less of two evils. I do not think that any vote thus cast can be said to represent the mature and deliberate opinion of the House. My idea is that before a vote can be regarded as decisive, the site which by this process of elimination is found to have a majority ought again to be pitted against every other site, and beat it singly by a deliberate vote - only so can we obtain the opinion of the House. I had at first thought of the preferential vote as applied to a proposal of this kind ; but further consideration has convinced me that the preferential vote can be readily manipulated so as to make it absolutely a plumping vote, and I take it that that is a method we desire to avoid. For instance, suppose we proceed by the preferential method - a member, who believes in Dalgety site, might vote for it as No.1, and for a number of other sites which may have no possible chance. In other words, the member could throw two, three, four, or five votes away, and thus give a plump vote for Dalgety. So that what is regarded as a preferential vote is very often a sham preferential vote, being, in reality, and in its essence and effect, a plump vote for the particular site favoured. I, therefore, think that if we desire to plump for a site, we had better finally have a single vote for or against a particular site. </para>

                        <para>- On the last occasion Lyndhurst secured the highest number of votes on the first ballot ; and if we may judge of a vote as indicating the preference of honorable members, that most nearly represented their preference. But, after the first ballot on that occasion, we found honorable members voting, not on the merits of a site - not because they believed it to be the best possible site, but because they hoped and believed it would beat some other site which they desired to see eliminated. I do not object to that method until we reach the stage we reached on the last occasion. To put a concrete case - if we proceed as before, and Dalgety is finally left in as receiving ostensibly a majority vote of the House, before Dalgety becomes the final choice, it ought to be pitted against Tumut, Lyndhurst, Canberra, and so on, in a single vote and beat each site in turn. </para>

                        <para>-I know there is a danger, but in trying to obtain a fair decision we ought, if need be, to face a danger of the kind. I believe that finally the good sense of the House will extricate us from any difficulty ; at any rate, it will be time to deal with the problem when we are face to face with it, but I think that the House will meet the position fairly and reasonably. That is the only criticism I have to make &#39;on the otherwise admirable proposals of the Government. </para>

                    <para>.-I have read the motion very carefully, and I see no objection to the method proposed. I observe, however, that Wednesday next is fixed as the day on which the vote shall be taken: and I point out that a number of honorable members are already away and have made such arrangements that they cannot be in their places on that day. I suggest, therefore, that Thursday afternoon at 3 o&#39;clock be substituted for Wednesday, so as to meet the convenience of those honorable members and others who have made arrangements which prevent their attending Parliament then. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to do so; I suggest that the Attorney-General should amend his motion on the lines I have indicated. I wish now to refer to the proposal that nominations should be made without debate. Whilst I am as anxious as is any honorable member that the question shall be dealt with without any delay, I think it is absolutely unfair that those who nominate sites should be debarred from explaining their reason for doing so. I would suggest that the nominator of every site be allowed five minutes to explain what he considers to be its advantages. We are not likely to have more than six or seven nominations, so that the adoption of my proposal would not involve any appreciable delay. Some honorable members have not visited any of the sites, and they will have to vote in the dark so far as some are concerned, unless we concede this privilege to the nominators. </para>

                        <para>-No. The debate has been devoted chiefly to the rival claims of Dalgety and Canberra, and I hold that those who wish to nominate other sites should have an opportunity to explain their reasons for doing so. My proposal would not result in any serious delay, and I hope that the Attorney-General will agree to it. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care how it is done, but we do not want to create the anomalous position of causing a blank, and going back to where we were many years ago. If half the members will not vote, how will the honorable member for Robertson obtain a majority of the House for any site ? We must have finality. New South Wales has a right to the Federal Capital, and we should keep faith with its people; that is my chief anxiety. I would suggest, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that the next time any honorable member transgresses the Standing Orders, you should make him read the whole of this debate. That would be sufficient punishment tor any transgression. </para>

My advice to the Government is to go on and get the business finished. The honorable member for Riverina said that many honorable members would not be present, but that will not be the fault of the Government or of the House. Any honorable member who accepts the responsibility of representing a constituency should be faithful to his trust; but that is the business of himself and his constituents. It is not our business, or that of the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the Government will stick to Wednesday, not that I am particularly anxious that we should decide on what is practically to be a perpetual Capital too quickly, but there is a greater chance of obtaining a full attendance on Wednesday than on Thursday or Friday. I am sorry the Government did not propose a system of preferential or alternative voting. That seems to be the only method that would give anything like certainty as to the choice of honorable members. The Government propose to follow the method of voting adopted in 1903, but it is a rather curious reflection upon the perfection of that system that the site which got no votes at first eventually was determined on for the Federal Capital. Dalgety got absolutely no votes on the first ballot in October, r903, and Tumut, which eventually got thirty-six, came out with only fourteen. That is an absolute condemnation of this system. It may happen - and the records prove it - that the site which is actually at the bottom of the list, and which is therefore under this resolution eliminated, may be the second choice of nearly all the members. One member may prefer a particular&#39; site which is not the choice of one-fifth of the members of the House, and under this system he gives his only vote to it; but if he had also to select another to indicate his general choice as against every other site except number one, he might select the very site which, being at the bottom of the list, would be cut out. That is not a proper system by which to test the feeling of the House. Not only is there that possibility as a matter of reasoning, but it has actually occurred in previous balloting. What objection can there be to allowing an honorable member to say, &#34; My first choice is Dalgety, my second Tumut ? By that means we could at once see what the second choice of all the members really was. It may be at once shown, as I believe would have been the case in the previous instance, that Dalgety comes out as the second choice. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. I speak with some knowledge of that subject, because I put forward a motion for six years in succession in the South Australian House of Assembly in favour of proportional representation. I looked carefully into them, but could not see much in the objections urged against it. It is said that the system has worked badly in the West, but any system may work badly if people do not vote. That is no reflection upon the perfection of the system itself. If, in the West, the electors do not exercise their second choice in some cases, it simply means that&#39; they decline  to make use of a good instrument. I believe they have not the best system of proportional representation in that State. What I advocate in this case is the preferential vote, giving an alternative choice. </para>

                        <para>- I shall endeavour to do so. It is doubtful that any of the sites will be supported by an absolute majority of members. The Government proposal is that successive votes shall be taken, and that, after each, the site for which the least number of votes has been cast shall be dropped. After the first vote, the members who supported the site getting the least number of votes will transfer their allegiance to another site, and that procedure will continue throughout the various stages of the ballot. Finally, only two sites will remain to be voted upon, one of which must secure a majority in the last vote. But that site may afterwards be rejected by a majority, who might say that, although they preferred it to some other, they still thought that it was not the site to select. </para>

                        <para>- We should, at all events, try to frame a method of voting which will insure the concurrence of the House in the adoption of one of the sites. Of course, if a majority refuses to accept the result of an exhaustive analysis of the preferences of honorable members, nothing can be done; but it appears to me that the result of the procedure proposed by the Government, and of that of the honorable member for Parramatta, may be to practically cause a blank. </para>

If honorable members favour that procedure, they had better accept the proposition of the honorable member for Parramatta. The preferential <inline font-style="italic">system</inline> is certainly the least objectionable. If six sites are nominated, each member will mark his ballot-paper according to the order of his preferences, and the site getting the lowest number of first preferences will be eliminated. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member&#39;s system would prevent the settlement of the matter until a date long after the time when he will have ceased to take an interest in this question. The Government procedure is condemned by the fact that, although it has already been followed on two occasions, we are now beginning all over again. Under the preferential system, one site ultimately secures an absolute majority of preferences, and the last vote can be accepted as showing the deliberate preference of the House. If we do not adopt that&#39; method, we may go on &#34;settling&#34; this matter without ever settling it at all. That is what has happened up to the present time, so that we now find ourselves faced with a new ballot when we ought to be making preparations to leave for the Federal city. The preferential ballot is not a perfect system, because the site to get the lowest number of preferences on the first vote is immediately dropped. </para>

                        <para>- The preferential system&#39; is not perfect, because the site getting the lowest number of first preferences might be the second choice of every voter; but I know of no means, for remedying that defect. Still, with that serious de-, feet, it is the best known means for analyzing to the last the opinions of those who are voting. I hope that it will be adopted in this case, and that the decision arrived at will be loyally accepted as the deliberate selection of the House. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member ought to know the objection to the selection of a Capital Site by the method of preferential voting, because he and his friends in the corner have taught us the danger in connexion with the Senate elections. Every one knows that instructions are issued at almost every election to vole for one or two Labour candidates, who happen to be selected, and to throw away the other votes on candidates who have not CH the slightest chance. </para>

If we could, by the process of elimination, reduce the sites to two or three, or, at the most, four, I should not have so much objection to the preferential vote; but if we are going to multiply the sites - and the opportunity for nomination is unlimited - then I can only foresee the result I have indicated; those who believe Dalgety should; be the site will put it first, and give their second preference to the site which they believe has the least chance. </para>

                        <para>- That is so;, and it is just possible for a site which we least desire to be placed in a good position. In a. word, the preferential vote means neither more nor less than plumping, if it be manipulated as it ordinarily is. We should, before resorting to the preferential vote, proceed by some process of elimination ; that is, if we reduce the number of sites to three or four, there would be in plumping very considerable danger, which honorable members would desire to avoid. If the honorable member for Angas could suggest some modification in the direction I have indicated, 1 should not have so much objection; but I think that, under the circumstances, the amendment suggested by the honorable member for Robertson is, perhaps, better than any other vet put forward. </para>

                    SALMON (Laanecoorie) &#163;11.29&#93;. - The preferential system should, in my opinion, be introduced at parliamentary elections, but I accept it only as a substitute for the more expensive second ballot. I believe that, in order to secure with absolute certainty the choice of the people, we should have a second ballot where a candidate does not obtain an absolute majority on the first vote. But such a method in parliamentary elections over a vast area like Australia would be terribly expensive ; and, therefore, I am prepared to accept the preferential system. I agree with the honorable member for Parramatta as to the danger of the system, especially when we have such a small body of electors as represented by this House. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has pointed out that, under the preferential system, the site which secured the lowest number of votes on the first &#34;ballot, would drop out ; and it is quite possible to conceive that the second best site might occupy the lowest position.

                        <para>- I am not talking about the merits of a site, as regarded by the House, but of its merits as regarded by the individual voter. It has been found over and over again that, where it is possible to secure combination and concerted action, the preferential system does not give us the best results; and, under these circumstances, I hope we shall adhere to the proposal of the Government to have the ordinary absolute majority method, which has been adopted by many organizations, and found to act remarkably well. Every year the Australian Natives&#39; Associations throughout Australia adopt the method after having tried all other systems ; and they find that in the election of directors and officers generally, it gives the most satisfaction ; it is, in my opinion, just such a system as we should adopt on the present occasion. </para>

                    <para>. - There should be no difficulty in arriving at a decision ; and the Government plan is, I think, all right up to a certain point. After the method suggested by the Government has been exhausted, I think the &#34; winner &#34; ought to meet the &#34; runners up &#39; &#39; ; and though that might take us a little longer, the time would not be wasted. I do not think that we shall have more than four or five nominations, consisting probably of Lyndhurst, Tumut, Tooma, Canberra, and Dalgety ; and I do not think that much time would be occupied in voting on these. If Dalgety were the &#34; winner &#34; of the &#34; first event &#34; it might be able to hold its own against each of the other sites I have mentioned ; and so in regard to all of them. By the process I have suggested we should arrive at absolute finality whether we adopted the Government&#39;s plan, or that suggested by the honorable member for Angas. Personally, I believe that the experience gained by adopting the preferential vote would be most valuable, because it would show by analysis how each man was disposed to vote, and it would help to an absolutely square vote on the plan I suggest. This is what I endeavoured to do the other night in connexion with the amendment I mentioned relating to Tooma. . I point out that sometimes honorable members have important and pressing engagements elsewhere, as we have been told is the case on Wednesday next - and, as a matter of fact, I myself have, unfortunately, such an engagement in the public . interest on that day- and I ask whether the Government could not substitute Thursday in order to meet the convenience of all. Further, I think that if an honorable member finds it impossible to attend here on that day, some  means ought to be&#39; adopted by the Government of providing the privilege of voting by post, because there is no doubt that  ai  full vote of the Chamber ought to be taken. </para>

                        <para>- I notice that the honorable member for Maranoa appeared to be very anxious to have the matter settled to-day. Even if the final settlement were postponed awhile, no harm could result. For something like eight years the question has been before us ; and yet it is now proposed to rush to a decision within forty-eight hours - a decision which may mean inconvenience and annoyance to the citizens of Australia for hundreds of years. Will the Government accept the suggestion to make the day Thursday ? </para>

                        <para>- It is impossible for us, of course, to discuss a method which has not been submitted, but I think that, in the case of a large number of sites, it will be possible, under preferential voting, to have combinations, the result of which would be not a fair, proper, and true choice of the House. The Government method has the advantage that it is practically a series of open ballots. We may take it for granted that on the first vote, honorable members will express their conviction as to what is in their opinion the best site, because if any site does not get a sufficient number of first votes, it drops out. Each honorable member has on each ballot a fair opportunity to express&#34; his honest opinion on the other sites remaining; and so the voting goes on until we have the last two sites, on the relative merits of which the House is capable of expressing its absolute opinion. The Government method does not lend itself to any combinations. </para>

                        <para>- That might happen with, preferential voting. We must adopt some practical method to reach finality. There are various systems of preferential voting and under some the voter indicates all his preferences on the one ballot paper. That course is adopted to get rid of the necessity for the successive ballots that we now propose. I think that that was the idea which the honorable member for Kalgoorlie had in mind when he said that the site securing the least number of primary votes should be thrown out. Other systems differ. I have in mind the system proposed by the honorable member for Corinella when this questi&#39;on was last voted1 upon. </para>

                        <para>- We had, and that is why I do not feel inclined to enter at this stage into a controversy upon the different systems. That which we suggest will enable us to secure a full and frank expression, of the opinion of the House. I certainly ann not in favour of the proposal made by the honorable member for Robertson. We desire to secure finality and when we arrive at a decision by means of a ballot we should stand by it. Under the honorable member&#39;s proposal no one site might be able to command its position against combinations in opposition to it. A site might have to contend with a combination consisting of honorable members who had no better site to propose. We might have a combination <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> opponents of a -certain site and of others who simply desired to postpone the selection of any site for 20. years. With an attendance of 70 honorable members we might have 33 in favour of a particular site and 30 opposed to it. Then we might have joining forces with the latter a certain number of honorable members who were opposed to the House dealing with this question for some time to come, and who would thus be able to block the will of the majority. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. My contention is that we ought to adopt a system that will enable us to secure finality and that when we have arrived at a decision we ought to stand by it and lose no time in sending on the Bill to another place. As to the day on which the ballot should be taken I have no objection personally to its taking place on Thursday next, provided that a time be fixed that would suit the convenience of honorable members generally. </para>

                    <para>. - The Attorney- General might well give further consideration to his proposal that nominations shall be made without debate. So far the debate on this question has been of the broadest possible character, and with one or two exceptions no reference has been made to any particular site. For a considerable time we have been tied down by various amendments, and have not been able to address ourselves to the consideration of the merits of the various sites. I have gone to some trouble to prepare myself to speak on the general question, and have been endeavouring all the week to secure a suitable opportunity to do so. When an opportunity did arise, I found that, owing to a certain amendment having been moved, I was precluded from addressing myself to the matters to which I had desired to give my attention. Consequently, if the motion be agreed to in the form proposed by the Attorney-General, I shall have no opportunity to deal with the wider aspects of this question, or with the claims of any site in which I am interested. That also will be the position of several other honorable members. Why does the Attorney-General propose to apply the closure in this irregular manner? Why should we not proceed on ordinary lines? If the debate on the nominations were unduly protracted it would be open to the Minister to apply the closure, but he ought not to adopt this unusual method of doing so. </para>

                        <para>- The point I am making is that the debate has not centred round the question of the suitability of sites. It is true that the Minister of Trade and Customs dealt with the claims of Dalgety, that the honorable member for New England advocated the selection of Armidale, and that the honorable member for Macquarie dwelt on the merits of Lyndhurst, but with those exceptions the speeches made during this debate have dealt rather with the general question than with any particular site. </para>

                        <para>- One of the principal ways of eliciting information is by means of debate. All I ask is that reasonable opportunity should be given to honorable members to impart to the House the information they possess, and that the closure should not be applied in the way the Attorney-General proposes. The unusual procedure of requiring a certain number of honorable members to rise to support an honorable member who moves for the consideration of a particular site is also suggested. It was never previously adopted. The sites were nominated and considered in their order, and honorable members Bad an  opportunity of voting on them when the ballot was taken. Why should they now be restricted in the new fashion proposed? There will be only four or five sites nominated at the outside. We may rest assured that Dalgety, Tumut, Lyndhurst, Canberra, and Armidale will be put forward. That will be about all. </para>

                        <para>- Tooma may be nominated, but I think Tumut will cover the whole of that area. Why should not a reasonable opportunity be given of considering those sites which have already been before previous Houses, without endeavouring to make nominations more difficult by requiring a certain apparent support for each <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> The honorable member for Angas proposes a new method of preferential voting. Although its advocates claim that it will simplify the procedure, and that we shall arrive more closely at the real mind of the House, I believe that if it is adopted it will make confusion worse confounded. It is objectionable in that it is a departure from the method which honorable members have been accustomed to follow; but that drawback could be overcome if the plan had superior features. My experience of it, however, is that one of its results is the remarkable surprise that it sometimes produces. It often happens that the least eligible site or candidate is selected. </para>

                        <para>- Under the conditions of preferential voting Lyndhurst could not possibly hope to win, because in every vote that took place previously it stood at the head of the primary voting. It often happens, in a preferential ballot, when a strong site like Lyndhurst is put forward, that all those who fear it, but who are at sixes and sevens amongst themselves, consolidate their votes to knock it out. The result often is that in the end the most objectionable site secures the number of secondary votes necessary to put it in the first place, and becomes the choice. The same result has been attained on many other occasions by the preferential system, and <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> do not want to see it repeated here. That system, if adopted, will make confusion worse confounded, and cause greater dissatisfaction than exists at present. The only dissatisfaction arising from the mode previously adopted was that it happened in the previous House that no one site had an absolute majority. If any site had commanded an absolute majority .the matter would have been settled ; but the House has been divided into three battalions, which are numerically fairly equal. That has caused a certain amount of dissatisfaction, as I say; but it has also had the effect of insuring that the three sites that had the greatest number of primary votes, and that, therefore, commanded the largest measure of support, have come up for final consideration at the hands of the House. The system adopted! by the Minister is that of the secondary ballot. He proposes, as was done before-,, that those sites which command the least number of primary votes, and, therefore, are regarded as least likely to meet the requirements of the Capital, should be eliminated in the earlier ballots, and then honorable members come fresh to consider the other sites, not theoretically, but practically, and on their actual merits. The final result is that the two sites left in are pitted against one another. That has. taken place on two previous occasions. On the first occasion the three sites that remained&#39; after a number of ballots were taken were Lyndhurst, Tumut, and Bombala, which is almost equivalent to Dalgety. The result of the secondary ballot was that Bombala was defeated. When Lyndhurst and Tumut came to be pitted against one another, the supporters of Bombala voted for Tumut as against Lyndhurst, and Tumut obtained&#39; a substantial majority. On the second occasion, a similar position was reached. On the final ballot Tumut was struck out, and the Treasurer informed the House that that came about by the unavoidable absence of two members who had previously supported it. </para>

                        <para>- I am now showing how a majority was brought about by the elimination of the site which was last on the list. On the second occasion, when Tumut was struck out. Dalgety remained to be matched against Lyndhurst. The Tumut supporters joined with Dalgety against Lyndhurst, and that settled the matter so far as the balloting was concerned. Later on, however, when the Bill&#39; was in Committee, a proposal was made to create a blank by leaving out the word &#34;Dalgety.&#34; If that had been carried, it would have been open to the Committee to put in any other site that it desired. But those who supported Dalgety wanted to arrive at finality, and they, with others, decided to vote against creating a blank. In the division, the only Lyndhurst supporters who voted for creating a blank were the honorable member for Darling and myself. All the other supporters of Lyndhurst voted against creating a blank, and prior to that the leader of the Opposition stated that he was prepared to abide by the result of the ballot, and consequently to accept Dalgety us being the preference of the House. That is how Dalgety was retained in the Bill that was passed for the purpose of opening up negotiations with the State Government. There is no need to go into the history of that part of the business now, but what I have stated shows the different movements that have taken place with respect to the selection of a site. There is no possibility of avoiding a certain amount of dissatisfaction where the House is almost equally divided on the merits of three sites. That happened previously, and seems likely to happen again. The only way in which something like general satisfaction can be secured is by adopting the Minister&#39;s proposal for a secondary ballot. The amendment of the honorable member for Angas, if adopted, will alter the procedure that we have been used to, create an entirely new position, and probably cause greater dissatisfaction than obtains at present, by bringing about the selection, on secondary votes, of a site that commands the least primary votes. I hope the amendment will be defeated. </para>

                    <para>.- At this stage any system of voting for a site is wrong, and I must protest against it. If a clause had been added by the Minister allowing only sites that have been already considered, and regarding which the House has good information from engineers and surveyors appointed to select suitable sites, to be nominated, the proposal would be all right. But, as it now stands, I take it that any honorable member can nominate a new site on which the House has no information whatever. We shall be the laughing-stock of Australia if, after all the consideration that has been given to the subject for eight years, we throw the door open for the introduction of sites which have never been previously considered, but which by a manipulation of votes may actually be selected. We have been told that the selection of Dalgety was an accident. Such an accident may happen again, and if it does, what we are proposing to do now will have to be done all over again, because of the dissatisfaction which will be created throughout the community. If new sites are to be nominated, the taking of the ballot should be deferred until sufficient information can be obtained regarding them. The mere selection of a site by the House will not. make it a suitable place for the capital; though I give honorable members credit for a desire to select the best site available. My suggestion is that no site which has not been reported on and recommended shall be nominated. </para>

                        <para>- It has been reported on. I fail to see why there should be too much hurry in this matter. We should not be asked to vote next week in regard to sites of which we know nothing. The reason which has been given for holding a fresh ballot is that new members should  have an opportunity to declare their views in regard to the sites; but it will only complicate matters if we are asked to vote in regard to sites about which neither old nor new members know anything. Furthermore, unless my suggestion is adopted, telegrams may be sent from all parts of New South Wales asking honorable members to nominate sites, and those to whom the messages are addressed will feel compelled to nominate the sites named. That will create a long list of sites to be balloted on. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot understand why there has been all this discussion, lt seems to me that some honorable members will muddle the whole business. They are proposing methods which will not attain the end which they have in view. The honorable member for Parramatta has suggested that the site which is chosen by ballot should be subsequently opposed to every other site. If that procedure is adopted, we shall never arrive at finality, because the supporters of the defeated sites will combine against the successful site. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that what is now desired is to reduce the number of sites. It would be open to any member to move in Committee the omission of Dalgety, with a view to the substitution of some other name. I objected to the Attorney-General&#39;s motion being brought on last night, because, had it been carried then, honorable members who wish to nominate sites would not have had a sufficient opportunity of arranging for support for them. Ii is certainly useless to vote upon sites for which six supporters cannot be found, but I have no objection to the nomination of new sites. Honorable members must exercise their intelligence, and I consider that the sooner we have a ballot the better. I hope that it will be taken next Wednesday. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sure that we all desire to adopt a course of procedure which will prevent a site being selected by means of a  catch  vote. I agree with the Government as to the procedure which should be adopted for ascertaining the preference of honorable members, but I think that subsequently a vote should be taken on the question whether the chosen site shall be adopted. That will prevent future adverse criticism, and make it impossible to substantiate the insinuation that our choice was the result of a catch vote. I do not agree with the honorable member for Fremantle that new sites should not be nominated; but, to prevent new members coming to a final determination before they were sufficiently informed, I would place an interval between the taking of the ballot and the final vote. If, for instance, Dalgety were reaffirmed by ballot, I would&#39; defer the final vote for a month or two, so that those honorable members might visit the site and make themselves well acquainted with it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, after a site has been chosen. I have never receded from the position that the whole question should1 be postponed. We cannot meet our responsibilities out of our present revenue, if the policy of my friends in the Labour corner is to be carried out, and if, in addition, effect is to be given to the various projects suggested by the Government. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> am quite in sympathy with any efforts which may be directed to cause delay and&#34; secure further consideration ; but if the feeling of this House is that during the present session we must come to a decision, then the manner of arriving at that decision should be such as cannot be questioned or cavilled at in the future. It is a very laudable object, of course, to&#62; remove any friction or jealousy which there may be between Victoria and New South Wales ; but I believe that honorable members from the latter State will admit that there is no evidence of any feeling on the part of Victoria. The idea isa bogy to be found in New South Wales and chiefly in Sydney; because I&#39; can assure honorable members that the Melbourne and Victorian people are in noway jealous of the position and progress of the neighbouring State. </para>

The honorable member desires that there shall be no undue haste, and hopes that further opportunities will be given for inspecting the various proposed sites. Well!, there has been no undue haste, and there has been a multiplicity of opportunities to visit the sites.

                        <para>- Opportunities have been presented this Parliament if those new members had cared to avail themselves of them, because I am quite sure that the Government would have afforded every facility. We all desire to adopt an honest method of arriving at a conclusion. While some objections can be taken to either of the methods suggested, I think the one proposed by the Government has proved in the past one which will enable us to arrive at an honest and effective decision. There is the one difficulty, I admit, that, when there are only three or four sites left, a site may be selected which does not represent the opinion of the larger number of voters. Let us suppose, for instance, that there, are four sites, and that site A obtains twelve votes, B obtains twenty-two votes,  C  obtains twenty votes, and D obtains twenty votes. According to the method proposed, A drops out, and the twelve votes are divided, four being given, say, to B, three to  C,  and five to D, leaving B with twenty-six votes,  C  with twenty-three votes, and D with twenty-five votes; and, therefore, B wins. But it may be that those who gave the five votes allotted&#39; to D might have desired, had they known D would not be selected, to give their votes to  C;  and if that had been done  C  would have had twenty-eight against twenty-six votes for B. I dare say that, when the number of sites had been reduced to four, the proposal of the honorable member for Angas might operate beneficially ; but there is the other method suggested by the honorable member for Robertson of, with a knowledge of the facts, allowing the five votes, which were given to D, to be distributed; that is to say, B and  C  could be pitted against each other, and then the votes would arrange themselves according to the desire of the voters. To my mind, it would be sufficient to apply the preferential vote to the last four sites left in; and the honorable member for Robertson proposes nothing more than can be done at a later stage under the Bill. I do not object to any method, so long as it cannot be used dishonestly. The danger of the preferential vote is- that at the start second votes may be deliberately thrown away on sites which have no chance. </para>

                        <para>- Iri the Committee stage, a proposal may be made to excise site  A  proposed in the Bill. If, according to the Minister, there is no actual majority for any one site, there may be combination, with the result that a blank is created, and every site that has been proposed - and more, because there is no limit - may be moved in an endeavour to fill the blank. Where is the difference between the methods? The proposal of the honorable member for Robertson may assist to get over the difficulty . The trouble about preferential voting is that sites may be nominated which have no chance, and on which second votes may be thrown away. That cannot be done so easily in a big election throughout a State, although it is done to some extent ; but it is easy where, as in the present case, there is a limited number of sites, and a limited number of voters. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. If the second preferences of others were honestly given, they would obtain a lot of second votes for their site, and secure its selection. If they threw away their second votes on .a site that had no chance, they would not strengthen . the position of a dangerous competitor, whereas the second votes of the supporters of that site, if honestly cast, would assist theirs. </para>

                    <para>.- Although the honorable member for Kooyong has declared that he desires a confirmative vote, I am inclined to think from his remarks that what he really wants is a &#34;put-offitive&#39;&#39; vote. We are beginning now to find out what is the milk in the cocoanut so far as some honorable members are concerned. The honorable member for Kooyong desires the settlement of this question to be deferred for two months, whilst the honorable member for Fremantle and the honorable member for Indi also plead for delay, the honorable member for Fremantle urging that further opportunity should be given for inspecting all the sites. It is worth noting that those- honorable members voted last night for the amendment on the motion for the second reading of the Bill. I do not think that any of them would, visit the suggested sites, even if the further consideration of this question were deferred. They have had ample opportunity to do so, and I am confident that the honorable member for Kooyong would not avail himself of any further opportunity. As to the method of voting, it appears to me that whatever system is selected the ingenuity of honorable members will enable them to devise a way to cast dishonest votes if they wish to do so. The exhaustive ballot, to my mind, is fairer than the preferential system. Preferential voting would enable honorable members to play off one site against another - to vote for a weak site in order to advantage or improve the position of another which they favoured. If honorable members could be relied upon to honestly give their first votes for the site that they desired to be chosen, and their secondary votes for that which they next favoured, the preferential system would work fairly. But my experience of preferential voting satisfies me that the ingenuity of honorable members would enable them to devise a means of bringing about a result that was not intended. The Government proposal is about as fair a one as we could have, and, consequently, I propose to support it. It was adopted after considerable inquiry and debate when this question was last voted upon. </para>

                        <para>- After a lengthy debate as to the fairest method of arriving at a decision. I am forced to draw the conclusion from the fact that such a keen debate has again taken place on the method of voting to be adopted that there must be a desire on the part of some honorable members to find a method by which some site other than that which has a majority behind it will come out on top. The views expressed by the honorable member for Kooyong, the honorable member for Fremantle, and some of the representatives of Victoria satisfy me that they have no real desire to have this question settled. Even if we postponed its further consideration for two or three months, what guarantee should we have that it would be finally dealt with within the next four years? We do not know what will happen within the next six months. The Government proposals have stood the test of debate in this House on two previous occasions, and I think they might fairly be accepted as the most reasonable system to adopt in order that the site which has a majority of honorable members behind it may come out as the choice of Parliament in the final selection. </para>

It is good that there should be some diversity of opinion on subjects coming before us, but sometimes we have rather too great a variety, and business would be expedited if we could secure a greater measure of uniformity. On. a previous occasion we had a very long debate on the subject, and experts were busily engaged in attempting to evolve an almost perfect system of voting. We then had honorable members, some of whom I regret to say are not now with us, expending a great deal of time and energy on an effort to discover the very best method of voting on this question. The debate on that occasion was to me both interesting and instructive, and I followed it very carefully. Honorable members like myself who listened to it will agree that the decision we arrived at, after a very exhaustive discussion, to adopt a method similar to that now proposed by the Government, was in accordance with the evidence then before us. It was found that some of these fancy systems of voting would not operate so well in practice as in theory - a trouble that very frequently afflicts the affairs of humanity. The system now proposed by the Government, while open to objection, seems to me to be the very best by which we can arrive at an honest decision. I admit that there are one or two difficulties, but the objection to the other suggested systems is that they lend themselves to methods that I should not like to designate as trickery, but which amount to a process of overreaching with the object of bringing about a selection contrary to the views of the majority. If honorable members would record their honest preferences, the preferential system would perhaps be the best; but I agree with other honorable members who have pointed out that the system lends itself very peculiarly to an effort to put the most dangerous competitors altogether out of their due relation as a matter of preference. Such a system is liable to misuse. In connexion with a question of this kind, on which honorable members have the strongest opinions - and honest opinions - they will use every legitimate means to achieve the object they have in view. That being so, and whilst I am perfectly willing to give honorable members an opportunity to record their preferences in a fair and aboveboard manner, I think that it would be wise to put beyond them the temptation to record a vote on the second and following choices that would not exactly indicate their true preferences, but would materially assist the cause of the site they have really at heart. I want the vote to be as honest and straightforward as possible, and I see no reason to forsake the Government proposal for anything that, so far as my judgment goes, would be worse. The Government proposal may not be perfect, but I think it is one by which we shall be best able to obtain something like a representative decision. </para>

                    <para>- - One of the candidates in the illustration given by the honorable member for North Sydney dropped out with&#39; twelve primary votes, which were then divided amongst the others. It is, however, quite possible, that that individual would have the whole of the secondary votes of the rest. Of course, in any new electoral system, one must expect defects, but I have always objected to the elimination of the last candidate on the list, because cases have been known where, if secondary votes could have been taken into account, he would have been elected. I am rather inclined to support the preferential system moved by the honorable member for Angas but for the. fact that if six sites were submitted it would be necessary to take twenty-five divisions before the matter was decided. That, with perhaps discussions in between the divisions, would take a very long time. (The honorable member for Parramatta put the case very forcibly and I am rather inclined to agree with him. Supposing Lyndhurst, Canberra, and Dalgety are submitted, while I support Dalgety I do not wish to see Lyndhurst selected in any circumstances. If it came to a vote between Lyndhurst and Dalgety, and Dalgety were beaten, I, failing Dalgety, would support Canberra, and if Canberra could be reintroduced into the ballot it might afterwards beat Lyndhurst. I believe that a system of preferential voting could be devised whereby in one division each honorable member&#39;s preference for every site could be shown. At the least six sites - Lyndhurst, Dalgety, Armidale; Tumut, Canberra, and perhaps Tooma - will probably be nominated. If, in the final ballot under the system proposed by the Attorney -General, Lyndhurst beat Dalgety, then in fairness Lyndhurst ought to stand against Tooma, Armidale, Tumut, and Canberra in turn to see if it could beat them. If, when Lyndhurst was matched against Canberra, Canberra happened to win, then Canberra in its turn ought also to meet every other site. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to put forward a suggestion under which, by one vote alone, we could settle the preference of every site proposed. I assume that the six sites I have already named are nominated. I would put them on the voting paper, numbering them one to six, from top to bottom. I would place the same names at the top so as to make six columns. Each honorable member would indicate by his vote his preference for each site as against each of the others, and that preference could be seen at a glance. </para>

                <para class="block">For instance, as between Armidale and Lyndhurst, I should, when voting, express my preference for Armidale. Then if Armidale knocked Lyndhurst out and the question of Armidale against Dalgety were raised, following down the ballot paper it would be seen that I preferred Dalgety to Armidale. Then if Dalgety were pitted against Tooma my ballot paper would also show that I preferred Dalgety, and similarly with Tumut and Canberra. If Dalgety were knocked out in the counting of the votes by Lyndhurst, I would have my chance again. Lyndhurst would be pitted against Canberra, and my voting paper would show that I preferred Canberra. Therefore, by marking this one preferential voting paper every honorable member could express his true opinion as regarded each site compared with each other. Consequently, if there were six candidates we should take only one vote instead of twenty-five. I do not care for the exhaustive ballot system, because under it a site that might be acceptable to honorable members could easily be knocked out. It is alleged now that the selection of Dalgety on a previous occasion was an accident. We are also told horrible tales about that site, but I think they are misstatements of facts. We are assured that Dalgety was only selected as the less of two evils, and that if, at the final stage, it could have been pitted against Tumut, Tumut might have won. If a preferential ballot paper on the lines of the diagram I have explained had been used, it could have been examined to show which site honorable members preferred as between Tumut and Dalgety. The more sites were submitted the greater would be the necessity for adopting the course which I now advocate. If, say, twelve sites were nominated, it would be necessary to take about  120  divisions under any other system, whereas one vote would suffice under my system. I object to the method proposed by the honorable member for North Sydney, because while &#34;D&#34; in his illustration, which received twenty primary votes, was eliminated, it is quite possible that it might have been the secondary choice of many honorable members in preference to another site. That is not a good system. It means losing one site which meets with misfortune at the start. It is said that Dalgety did not command a vote at the beginning of the ballot on the last occasion, and yet it was eventually selected. Even if the method proposed by the Minister is followed the site which wins ought to beat every other site proposed before it becomes the choice of the House. If it fails to do that, the one that beats it ought also to be called upon to beat all the others in turn. How many divisions would have to be taken to get finality by that method? My proposal is a simple way of arriving at the true preferential choice of honorable members by one vote, no matter how many sites are nominated. </para>

                    <para>.- The Attorney-General proposes that the House should receive nominations without debate. If that is agreed to, it is doubtful whether an amendment will be permissible. Whatever sites may be nominated, I wish to move as an addition thereto the provision contained in section  3  of the Seat of Government Act 1904,&#39; that &#34; the territory to be granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth should contain an area of not less than 900 square miles, and have access to the sea.&#34; I know that those conditions can be put in the Bill, but I would like to have them attached by the House to its choice, so that the Government would have no option in negotiating with the Government of New South Wales but to insist on their observance. </para>

                        <para>- Yes : but with the word Dalgety, in effect, struck out. &#39; Is not that the precise position, putting technicalities and legal equivocations aside? No other meaning can attach to the vote to have another ballot. I should like to know from you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> whether I can move as an amendment the insertion of a provision to the effect that the territory shall comprise not less than 900 square miles, and have access to the sea? </para>

                        <para>- I am obliged to you, sir, for a clear statement of the position. lt enables us to see our limitations now rather than later on, when the opportunity of action shall have passed. At the same time, I am not satisfied with the position. As to the difference between the procedure of the Government and that suggested by the honorable member for Angas, I have only to say that if the House thoroughly understood, as he does, the advantages of the preferential system, it would adopt it. That system has more good points than any other, is least liable to be affected by accident, and furnishes slight opportunity for the adoption of certain expedients bv those who wish to secure particular results. The Government ask us to proceed forthwith to ballot for a site. Last night, however, the plea put forward for a ballot was that there are a large number of new members who have not had an opportunity to express their views on this matter, and therefore it is necessary to review our former decision. If that argument has any validity, we should not proceed to a ballot until they have had an opportunity to inspect the various sites. At present they know of them only by reading, or from conversations with other members who have visited them. It seems to me that the ballot should be deferred for at least six months, to give new members an opportunity to visit, and make themselves acquainted with, the sites. I should like to move an amendment in that direction. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. We ought not to risk the selection of a site which may be wholly unsuitable. Could members who had not visited the sites tell their constituents that they voted to secure the site best in  the interests of all Australia? If it is objected that the adoption of my suggestion would cause delay, I reply that the responsibility for that rests with the representatives of Sydney, who last night voted almost to a man to re-open the question. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask the honorable member for Coolgardie not to press the amendment, which can only result in a further delay of six months, and practically means the shelving of the question. I think that the House, as a whole, desires to have the matter finally determined ; and it would be better to proceed with the work of selection. Such an amendment is unjust to testate of New South Wales, and will practically result in the loss of all the time previously expended on the question. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the amendment because I think that the House would be wise to postpone this question. In the course of the last sitting, we heard many reasons advanced why we should not proceed with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, one being that the Commonwealth is not in a position to find the necessary money, and that before any further steps are taken, a financial statement should be laid before us. We are now asked by the same members who advance these arguments, to proceed at once with the establishment of a bush capital ; but I think the time has arrived when the people should have something to say on the matter. There is, lt appears,, dissatisfaction with the decision of a previous Parliament; and if the question were postponed for a further six months, we should, I think, be in a better position to deal with it. In my opinion there is no hurry, because there is much other important business which has a prior claim for consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Then I withdraw the words, and say that I did not anticipate hearing a particular form of argument from the honorable member for Batman, although \I expected it from the honorable member for Coolgardie, whose views on this question are, it is well known, swayed very largely by his antipathy towards New South Wales. But the honorable member for Batman, if my memory serves me aright, showed by his vote yesterday, an anxiety not only to settle trie question, but to regard it as settled.&#39; He voted that a certain site should be regarded&#39; as the site for all time, and his main  opposition to holding a ballot in order that a fair expression of opinion might be obtained, was that Parliament had already signified its intention. It was for that reason I fell into the error of describing, in the words to which you, sir, object, the speech I regret having had to listen to. I hope that this House will not stultify itself, after declaring that it desired to proceed to the choice of a site, by now declaring that there should be a delay of six months. Therefore, in the interests of the reputation of the House, I urge honorable members to proceed at once, as we agreed last night, to select the best site for the Capital. </para>

                    <para>- It is quite ominous that the honorable member for Batman should, for the first time in his political career, venture to suggest a course which is seemingly in opposition to the course mapped out by the Government. It is the first time, since the honorable member entered the House, that he has reflected the slightest shade of discord on a Ministerial proposition. I say that that is ominous, because, if the honorable member really believed that the Government were sincere in their professed desire to have this matter brought to a conclusion, it is simply inconceivable that he should take up his present position. I feel sure that this honorable and loyal supporter of the political conglomeration on the other side would shrink at the last moment from venturing to make such a speech, if he had not received assurance, either direct or telepathic, from the Administration that postponement is really what they desire to bring about. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Batman is not moved by eccentric impulses of that kind; he is a sort of Ministerial sundial, and I am at a loss to understand what the new development means. I do not at all complain of the amendment moved by the honorable member for Coolgardie, who has, in the most straightforward way, avowed his belief and desire that the question should be shelved for the present, and deserves every credit for so doing. The amendment which he has moved will enable all those who hold the same ideas as himself, either secretly or openly, to give a straightforward vote. I think that the honorable member has a right, and that every honorable member who happens to represent a part of Australia which is not altogether unknown - I mean New South Wales - has a right, to call on honorable members to show their real opinion. Those who are in favour of delaying the matter ought to vote with the honorable member, who has given them a fair and open challenge ; and those, on the other hand, who are opposed to delay, are given an opportunity of showing that they are honestly in favour of progress. Therefore, instead of endeavouring for one moment to criticise the course the honorable member has taken, I hail his proposition as one upon which there ought to be a clear and straightforward division, representing the actual convictions of honorable members on this important question. </para>

In theory, it is a perfect suggestion, but in practice I am afraid it might not prove the best possible course. I really feel that the Government have been a little lax in allowing these debates to be prolonged as they have been; and I am beginning to feel a little uneasy. </para>

                        <para>- On the contrary, some of them are not supporters of the Dalgety site. As to the hour of the day, it was at first suggested to make it8 in the evening ; but, again, with the view to consulting honorable members&#39; convenience, it is thought preferable, Thursday being private members&#39; day, to take the more important business in the earlier part of the day, and give private members an equal amount of time later in the afternoon or evening. That cannot be considered unfair to private members, while it has the additional advantage that those who, for business or other reasons, desire to leave by the afternoon trains, will be able to do so after recording their votes. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. Then, again, the hour of 3 o&#39;clock in the afternoon will be a great convenience to the Minister of Trade and Customs, whose medical adviser will not permit him to be out after nightfall. Though the presence of the honorable gentleman may not be of very great moment, so far as the vote is concerned, the arrangement proposed would, I think, be a personal compliment to him. For all these reasons, I hope the House will agree to the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- One of the honorable members whom the Treasurer has evidently in mind will be away for a week, so that this amendment will not suit his  convenience. I think that we are establishing a dangerous precedent in specially fixing a time for the taking of votes, and that sooner or later it will be abused. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that the honorable member&#39;s criticism of the Government is reasonable. It has been understood from the first that the procedure on this question must be altogether different from that usually adopted. The very fact that a ballot is to be taken shows that the vote must be essentially a personal one, and honorable members should make it their business to be here. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly; but we know that honorable members often have public duties to attend to outside the House, and that we must from time to time endeavour to meet their convenience. We have laid down a definite course of procedure, and have asked honorable members to assist us in arriving at a determination. This morning it was suggested by quite a number of honorable members that the taking of the ballot on Thursday next would suit the convenience of the House. No exception was taken to that suggestion, and we now desire to fix a time on Thursday when the ballot shall be taken, so that honorable members may make arrangements to be present. We propose to make good later in the evening the time usually devoted to private members&#39; business, which is occupied in taking the ballot ; and, so far from treating this matter in the way that has been suggested by the leader of the. Opposition and others, the Government are endeavouring to press it to a decision. </para>

There will be an opportunity in Committee on the Bill to test the successful site against every other site nominated, and we shall then be able to do precisely what we desired to do through the ballot. Our proposal would simply have saved the time of the House. I am anxious that before we get to the Committee stage on the Bill the House shall not have committed itself, as it would do by adopting those words, to an assertion that the ballot indicates fairly the final judgment of the House upon the question of the Capital Site. </para>

The Attorney-General is one of those. The ballot that is about to &#34;be taken will not reflect the deliberate opinion of the House. </para>

                        <para>- There may be such an agreement amongst those who believe in that method of taking the ballot, but there can be no understanding of the kind amongst those who believe that the ballot will not reflect the true opinion of the House. Our contention all through is that the ballot as. proposed to be taken will not select the site by a majority of the votes cast in the House on the merits of the sites themselves. Sites will be pitted one against the other, and the ballot will be ineffective for the purpose for which it is intended. I wish to delete these words so that honorable members who desire to see the final vote of the House taken in the proper way in Committee on the Bill may not consider themselves bound to vote for the Bill as it stands, because they regard the ballot as being final. </para>

The Bill will be before us, we shall be asked to vote for the delimitation of the site in the neighbourhood of Dalgety, and no power of Parliament can prevent honorable members from trying in Committee to insert some other word than &#34; Dalgety.&#34; It therefore seems idle at this stage to leave those words in the motion. . They can mean nothing, except that the House is bound by the vote which it will have just given. Those who favour Dalgety will no doubt feel themselves bound. </para>

                        <para>- Practically they mean nothing, since we&#34; have to face a further discussion of the site in the Bill, but they will mean, if adopted, that some honorable members may feel themselves bound later on to agree with the result of the ballot. My amendment will not interfere with the effectiveness of the ballot as now proposed. I would not object even to a direction being given to the  Speaker  to place the result of the ballot on the records of the House, but I do not want to commit the House to saying that the site selected is to be deemed the site preferred by honorable members, because if the same method is adopted as on a previous occasion I do not think that that site will be the final decisive and deliberate choice of the House. </para>

                <para class="block">Bill in whatever way they desire, I do not agree with the honorable&#34; member&#39;s arguments against their retention. The honorable member asserts that we must proceed to pit the selected site against every other site. To proceed in that way would be to beat the air. If there are five sites, each man will stick to his choice ; the one which has an absolute majority will be selected by exhaustive ballot; .and if we then begin again on the prejudicial system proposed, the supporters of the other four will combine against the successful fifth, and there, will undoubtedly be a majority against it. We are asked like little children to believe that that would be a true, manly, honorable, and straightforward way of selecting the Capita&#93; site. It would be nothing of the kind. There will be no finality at all if the successful site has afterwards to be pitted against all the unsuccessful ones. The same thing would apply if five candidates were nominated, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> for your distinguished and honorable office. If, after one obtained an absolute majority, we proceeded to put the question again before he was&#34; allowed to take the chair, we should simply begin <inline font-style="italic">de novo,</inline> and there would be endless trouble. I hope we shall choose the method by which we previously selected the site that secured an absolute majority. </para>

                        <para>- It would be all right if we could select as many sites as honorable members advocated, but the Constitution, provides that only one site shall be selected, and that in the State of New South Wales. Therefore we must get, if not the site that an absolute majority of members prefer against all other sites in the first instance, at least that site which is preferred by the largest number afterwards. By a combination of the second and third votes, the site which is most satisfactory to the greatest number will ultimately be chosen. To argue the point further would be a work of supererogation. </para>

There will be a large number of sites in competition, and the difficulty is to devise a system for eliminating all but that one which, in the opinion of honorable members, is, on the whole, the best. It is realized that it may be impossible to obtain a site commanding the support of a majority on a straight-out vote, and, therefore, the procedure set out in the motion is proposed. The honorable member for Parramatta wishes us to be free to set 011. one side the result of that procedure. </para>

                        <para>- They will be within their rights in doing so, but the&#39; procedure proposed is an attempt to obtain an expression of opinion as to the site most acceptable to honorable members as a whole. It may be that the site selected on the ballot may be defeated by a combination. It would be possible, in a House of seventy, if thirty-three favoured the selected site, and thirty were opposed&#39; to it, for the remaining seven, who were desirous of preventing any selection being made, to create a blank under the procedure suggested by the honorable member for Parramatta. We must have some method of. getting at finality. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me not to matter much whether the amendment be carried or not. We cannot bind the House by the expression of our individual opinions, but, as the ballot method of ascertaining those opinions could not be followed in Committee, the Government have proposed the procedure set out in the motion. In any case, we should be inconsistent if we agreed to any other site than Dalgety, because, in agreeing to the second reading of the Bill, we should have affirmed the desirability of establishing the Capital at that place. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that if the proposal of the honorable member for Parramatta were adopted, the object he has in view might be defeated. I do not agree with the honorable member for Wide Bay that, although there might be an absolute majority for a site, that site might be lost if subsequently pitted against each of the other sites. But if the result of the ballot were to reaffirm Dalgety, and the matter had to go to a subsequent vote, honorable members, who, likethehonorablememberforCoolgardie, wish to cause delay, might bring about its rejection. If any site has an absolute majority, that will determine the question. </para>

                    <para>: - Nominations may be received until the last moment of the sitting of the House, but, assuming that they are now practically completed, I find that every site previously voted on is, with one exception, included in the list - the exception being Bathurst, Owing to the decision of the Western Leagues. I wish to intimate the order of business next week. The intention is to take to-day&#39;s Orders of the Day on Tuesday, and to proceed with them as they stand on the notice-paper - Manufactures Encouragement Bill. Marine Insurance Bill, and so on - and on Wednesday to resume the debate on the second reading of the Defence Bill. I understand that this arrangement meets the convenience of the leader of the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>.- Taking the last question first, I shall have pleasure in laying a copy of the New Zealand Naval Subsidy Bill on the table as soon as it is received, although I understand it consists only of the proposal to raise the subsidy. As to the memorandum on the new protection, I informed the leader of the Opposition yesterday that it would be laid on the table in a few days. The judgement in the union trade marks case has not yet been received, nor can the Attorney-General finally inform me when it will, though it is being eagerly awaited by his Department The matter referred to by the honorable member for West Sydney is now in the hands of the Crown Law officers, who have been asked to advise on it without delay. </para>
