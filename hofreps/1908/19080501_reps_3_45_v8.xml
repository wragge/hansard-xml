Thursday Island, Thursday. - Nothing further has been ascertained with regard* to the explosion of dynamite at the Green Hill fort on Monday. On that day a packet of dynamite, a box of detonators, and a piece of fuse were found under a 6-in. gun. The fuse had been lit, but had gone out. By some the whole matter is regarded as a joke, but, in view of the fact (hat&#39; a quantity of common shell was stored near where the dynamite was found, the consequence &#39; of an explosion might have been extremely serious. </para>

                        <para> The  medical  profession, chemists, nurses, and others interested in the relief of suffering are complaining bitterly against the duty of. 30s. per lb. .levied upon the opium constituents of morphia. The imposition has been taken advantage of by some chemists to greatly increase the price of the morphia of commerce. The case certainly seems one for reconsideration before the Tariff is finally disposed of by Parliament. We have received several letters from nurses, pointing out that the heavy duty really means that money is raised &#34; at the expense of poor sufferers whose last hours are soothed by the use of morphia.&#34;&#39; </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not quite understand the latter portion of the paragraph, but apparently chemists are charging for morphia more than they charged formerly, and misleading customers by stating that the increase in price is due to the Tariff, whereas morphia, for medical purposes, can be imported duty free. Will the Minister ascertain the facts, and give effect to the highest principles of the protective system which he upholds? </para>

                        <para>- I cannot answer the honorable member&#39;s question definitely now, although I have just been speaking to the Secretary to the Treasury on the subject. I am not sure that the occurrence of the Easter holidays had not an effect om the revenue. However, I shall make further inquiries. I do not think that the figures indicate any permanent decrease, though, no doubt, the revenue returns are not likely to maintain the present standard. I shall give the honorable member - perhaps this afternoon - a detailed and official reply. </para>

                            <para>- I promised the honorable member for Flinders that when I had an opportunity ! would give him a further reply to his question. I have seen the Secretary to the Treasury, who informs me that the Treasury officials think that the decrease or shortage for the month is on account of the slight falling off usual in the winter months. Probably the absence of rain in certain parts of the country may have something to do with it. They think also that another cause is that the winter goods were taken out before last month,. In addition to that, there was1 a large withdrawal of certain goods when the increases were requested in the Senate, for fear, I suppose, of those increases being agreed to by this House. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask a question of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General. Some time ago a request was made for full reports as to the collection of mails by motors in Adelaide. I wish to ask whether the reports have yet been received, and, if so, whether the officers of the Department have acknowledge of what is commonly reported in Adelaide as a fact, that the mails are sometimes collected by the men employed by the contractor for the supply of the motor cars, unaccompanied by . any -officer of the Department? </para>

The smoking of cigarettes in France appeared to have prodigiously increased. In 1872 the value of the cigarettes consumed was ^40,000. In 1882 the value was ^680,000, at which level it remained stationary for several years, but reached to ^2,880,000 in 1907. The general profit accruing to the Government through the manufacture and sale of tobacco in France is 92 per cent, of the amount of the sales. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, a question with reference to the papers connected with the purchase of the <inline font-style="italic">Lone Hand</inline> article, which were laid on the table yesterday. He will forgive me for doing so, because the details there given are really fragmentary. I wish to know whether the article was circulated in England in the <inline font-style="italic">Lone Hand</inline> magazine, or as a separate pamphlet ? </para>

                        <para>- The question is a proper one, and I am glad that it has been asked, because yesterday I omitted to mention one of the chief advantages of the transaction. The Government obtained the free publication of the article in the 50,000 copies of the first issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Lone Hand,</inline> which were sent to every newspaper in the United Kingdom, and to every leading newspaper in the United States of America. Those copies were in addition to the &#93; 0,900 copies of the article purchased and circulated by us throughout the United Kingdom as a separate pamphlet. </para>

At that date, my honorable colleague the Treasurer had already left for the Old Country ^ and I left immediately afterwards, on the 4th or 5th of March. Though I am not sure on the point, I understand that the first number of the magazine was published immediately after that time, and I doubt whether the proprietors would have neglected to make arrangements for advertisements for the magazine &#39;until a date so close to the day of publication.- </para>

I presume that no honorable member would ask a question without a sincere desire to obtain! the information he seeks. It is, therefore, most improper that his attempt to obtain information should be blocked or interrupted by comments. I must again ask that when questions are being put, and the answers to them are being given, there shall be such silence in the chamber as -will enable honorable members generally to have a knowledge of the nature of the question and of the answer to -it. </para>

                            <para>- I saw a letter from our officer in London, Captain Collins, describing the distribution! of the first 6,000 copies of the <inline font-style="italic">Lone Hand</inline> that arrived, and suppose the same course was adopted in dealing with the remaining 4,000 copies. Possibly a certain number of .copies were sent to the United States of America, where a very energetic British Consul in Chicago is good enough to act for us,. I think that .practically the whole issue was absorbed by reading-rooms and other public institutions of the kind in the United Kingdom. I made no inquiry as to the contribution! of articles by other literary persons. &#34;An intimation was simply made- to me that there would be a circulation of 50,000 copies of the article which has been referred to, and, of course, we only paid for the copies we received. </para>

We did not pay  &#163;10  a page, but we paid .&#163;120 for, first of all, 10,000 copies of this illustrated article, published and printed separately and circulated by us, and, next, for the advantage of having the same article included .in the 50,000 copies of the magazine which, being copies of its first number, were circulated to practically the whole of the important press in the English-speaking world. . We also received for this payment the plates and diagrams for our own use afterwards in connexion with advertising Australia. For ^120, therefore, we obtained 60,000 copies of the article, together with the plates and diagrams ; and I am prepared to make as good a bargain with any one else who offers. </para>

                            <para>- May I answer the question ? The arrangement referred to by the honorable member for Laanecoorie included a whole year&#39;s work by one of the leading English correspondents in Australia, who contributed articles to all the important newspapers of the world. Those articles were submitted to the Government before their despatch, and the Government paid the postage expenses for a period of twelve month&#39;s, at the rate of one article a week. That was not at the rate of &#163;10 per page, or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;120</inline> for twelve pages. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members were informed of the transaction, totalling the magnificent sum of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;120,</inline> as soon as they displayed the slightest interest in it. Owing to the circulation of the article, I should imagine that practically every member was, or could easily have made himself, acquainted with the facts ; and I supposed that honorable members knew all about the matter. The articles were not hidden away, but circulated throughout the length and breadth of the United King dom; and English press notices referred to them again and again. Honorable members have only to refer to the English newspapers of that period, to refresh their memory. The Government have always been open to receive from any Australian journalists offers for advertising Australia which appear to be to the pecuniary advantage of the Commonwealth. </para>

I should like to know whether in the future there could be instituted some impartial authority to receive and judge applications of this kind? </para>

                            <para>- I shall ask a question at the conclusion of my explanation. The Prime Minister quite misunderstands me. What I refer to is the undesirable practice of political writers getting into personal touch with Ministers, when those writers are going to receive some personal benefit out of the transaction. I do not say that the practice is more than undesirable. </para>

                        <para>- - From a general acquaintance with the proposal referred &#34;to, I may say that the scheme will be dependent on the obtaining of concessions of land from the States. &#39; So far as I am aware, except in the .case of South Australia, some considerable time ago, no one ever got so far as the making of anything like a (proposal to any State. In regard to the second question, it has been already pointed out that it is not intended after this year to make further grants to the Immigration Leagues. </para>

                    <para>.- In this question of wire netting many honorable members representing agricultural and pastoral constituencies are particularly interested, as are other honorable members representing other interests throughout the Commonwealth. I hope that -the Minister will reconsider his determination to oppose the request. The arguments adduced in this chamber previously should have appealed to every honorable member who desires to see a fair thing done in the interests both of the manufacturers and of those who have to use the article. It was shown that a duty upon wire netting would impose immense disabilities upon settlers, throughout Australia, and would seriously handicap them in their laudable enterprise of opening up the interior - a work in which &#39; we hope that they will succeed. That work is of immense value not only to themselves personally, but to the Commonwealth as a whole. The Committee would do well to view the matter from that standpoint. We should consider the .advantages that will accrue to Australia as a whole from giving to settlers in the rural districts every facility to obtain the materials necessary for their enterprise at as low a rate as possible. That can be done in this case, as was shown previously-, without injuring in any way those engaged in the manufacture of wire netting in Australia. The netting is made chiefly from imported wire, and the industry is only a matter of twisting the wire together. That involves a very small amount of skilled labour. The amount of adult labour employed is infinitesimal, and the industry at best is only a boy industry. </para>

                        <para>- I quoted the figures to the Committee when the item was under consideration previously. Unless the Government is in possession of some information which will show that in the absence of a duty, the industry will suffer very much - and I think he will have some difficulty in showing that in connexion with an industry which, working at high pressure, cannot cope with more than a small proportion of the demand - I think that we ought to accede to the Senate&#39;s request, especially as the cost of importation and other charges in themselves constitute a very high margin of protection. There is a natural protection afforded to the local manufacturers,- not only in the cost of importation, but also in the better price which they are able to command for their manufacture. </para>

                        <para>- Because the users like the locally-made article better than the imported article. The former rolls up, I understand, into a smaller space ; it is packed more conveniently for transport, and generally it is found more advantageous for the purpose for which it is used. Hitherto the trouble has been that the settlers have not been able to get a sufficient quantity, because the local manufacturers were not able to supply the demand. The reason why there has been such a large consumption of the imported wire netting has been simply because the local manufacturers, though working all their machines to their utmost capacity, have been unable to supply the requirements. The consequence has been that, even against their own inclination, many persons who use wire netting in large quantities have been obliged to secure the imported article in order to. avoid the delays which otherwise would have been enforced upon them. I hope that the Minister will not persist in his objection to the Senate&#39;s request, and that even if he should it will be carried. </para>

                        <para>- After I had failed to get the item made free I did. In 1906 the users of wire netting were taxed to the amount of &#163;40,000. To start with, it is a penalty to a producer to be obliged to use wire netting. It is equivalent to an additional rent of from 2d. to 3d. per acre.&#39; It often happens that large areas of unoccupied Government lands are breeding grounds for vermin, and so the unfortunate settler has to bear an additional burden. Wire netting is not necessary for the ordinary keeping of stock. It is used only because of the presence of vermin. Why should the producers be called upon to suffer an additional penalty ? In view of the difficulties with which&#39; the farmers have to contend, there is not a scintilla of justification for maintaining revenue duties of 10 and 5 per cent. In South Australia, there are hundreds of thousands of acres where it would be impossible to grow a crop without the use of wire netting. One might as well throw the seed wheat into the sea as attempt to sow it there, without this safeguard against the raids of vermin. By the use of vermin-proof fences - wire netting with a barbed wire on top - the whole of the western portion and a great deal of the northern portion of the State have been brought into profitable use. Previously, owing to the ravages of dogs, it was impossible to raise lambs. The partition of the Statechiefly the northern portion - into vermin districts, with dog-proof fences, has been of the greatest advantage to the settlers. Where at one time they could not get practically any lambs, under the new method they can get from 80 to 100 per cent. Wire netting is not used in centres of population. The duty is practically a class tax, because wire netting is only used by those who suffer from the inroads of vermin. I do not think that the Committee will agree to tax the producers on their wire netting to the extent of &#163;40.000 a year. I do not know what the Minister&#39;s attitude is. </para>

In those areas where the vermin are not troublesome, the landholders are not subjected to this penalty, because no man would incur the expenditure of wire-netting his holding unless he&#39; were obliged to do so. I should like to hear the reasons which have prompted the Government to insist upon the collection of a purely revenue duty, aggregating about &#163;^40,000 per annum, from, a class of the community who receive no benefit  whatever from the operation of a protective Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care .how I voted upon a previous occasion. I voted to obtain the lowest possible duty. Having ascertained what duty the majority of the House supported,  .1  agreed to it rather than waste the time of the Committee in striving to obtain something which it was impossible to get. The Senate, having requested that wire netting should be placed&#39; upon the free list, there is an additional reason why we should support the adoption of that course. It is an unsound policy to tax commodities which affect the existence of thousands of men in  the interests of those who can be numbered only by the hundred. It has been urged that the existing duty upon wire netting is a revenue tax. It is true that it produces a revenue of about .&#163;30,000 annually. </para>

                        <para>- Between .&#163;30,000 and &#163;40,000. The question now arises :  &#39; Are we going to continue to tax our landholders during a season such as the present - when drought conditions are being experienced over many portions of &#39;the continent - in their efforts to prevent the destruction wrought by the rabbits, with whose depredations the erection of wire-netted fences is particularly designed to cope?&#34; Those who have had anything to do with the development of the interior know that as soon as food becomes scarce the rabbits not only destroy the natural herbage, but actually &#34;burrow down and destroy its roots. To my own knowledge there are places not very far in the interior where, during the drought of 1902, the rabbits wrought such destruction that many years must elapse before the country can recover its stock-carrying capacity. This is the one item in the Tariff in respect of which consideration for the country districts will operate to the benefit of the workers in our cities. The only effective means of coping with the rabbit pest is bv the use of wire netting. Our friends in the Labour corner may exult in the reflection that in Victoria the manufacture of wire netting is being developed upon purely v socialistic lines. It is being produced in Pentridge. </para>

                        <para>- At the present moment _ I have nothing whatever to do with any item save that of wire netting. It appears to me peculiarly fitting that another branch of the Legislature should take a wider view of this matter than did this Committee. I think that this particular item is one as to which we can safely comply with the wishes of another &#39;place. Honorable members should consider that this duty will heavily penalize the small settlers - those men who are opening up this country and helping <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> build the grand Empire to which we belong. We should surely hesitate before doing anything to add to the burdens which they already have to bear. It has been represented that the large land-holder and the pastoralist are the&#39; persons who buy wire netting. But it must not be forgotten that the small holder also is compelled to use this commodity. His -interests are paramount. In order to prove that statement  1  wall quote some telling figures. In New South Wales, out of 72,000 holdings, 7,000 are under 5,000&#39; acres in extent. That fact goes to show that the majority of the holdings in that State are those of small settlers and not of large landowners. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member can make his own calculation as to the area. If he is not satisfied with those figures, I may inform him that out of 72,000 holdings in New South Wales no less than 65,000 are under 1,000 acres in extent. All these holdings must be netted owing to the inroads of the rabbits. In Western Australia, a few years ago, a rabbit was never seen. To-day you cannot drive on the plains there without seeing quantities of rabbits and witnessing their ravages. In South Australia, out of 20,000 holdings 19,000 are under 5,000 acres in extent. It is, therefore, upon the small settler that the chief burden of this tax will fall.- I appeal to those honorable members who sit in the Ministerial corner, and who call themselves the rep&#39;re- &#34; sentatives pf the workers, to consider the man who lives upon the land rather than the man who works in the city. What comparison is there between the interests of 400 workers, who it is said are affected bv this duty, and the thousands of people  who live upon the lands of Australia, and who must use wire netting? So unenterprising is the firm in Sydney, which undertakes the manufacture of this article, that it is unable to import the machinery to run its. business in such a way as to supply more than half the quantity of wire netting required in Australia. It can supply 500,000 tons per annum, which, as I have said, is only half the quantity used in this country. I remind the members of the Labour Party that they especially appeal to the very class of people whom they are now endeavouring to tax. Is it not  a fact that they make their appeal to the small land-holder as against the squatter? Do they not constantly say that if they were enabled to impose a progressive land tax, small holders would escape scot free? Yet they do not hesitate to vote in favour of a tax&#39; which will heavily oppress the small holder upon whom they rely. </para>

I point to the honorable member for West Sydney, for instance. Can honorable members opposite challenge any of his votes? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Echuca has spoken about our socialistic principles. Does- he forget that the Premier of Victoria, who is anything but a Socialist, has established the wire-netting industry in the gaol at Pentridge? If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent</inline> could see any opportunity of condemning socialistic principles he would be the first to do so ; and yet he is the man who has taken steps to have this article manufactured by the cheapest labour obtainable, and in a State institution.; for Heaven knows there is no cheaper labour&#39; in the world than prison labour. I wish to say a word as to my own attitude on this question. I spoke upon wire netting when the matter was last before the . Committee, and indicated that I- intended to vote for the highest duty that the Government asked for. I was consistent in so- doing, because I believed, and still believe, that the duty proposed would be protective, and that the industry is one that might very advantageously be established in the Commonwealth. I went away from Parliament House on that occasion under the impression that the Treasurer - from a statement which he made to me - was going to make a determined stand in&#39; defence of the Government proposal, and would fight vigorously for the imposition of the full duties proposed. To my astonishment and disgust, I learned next morning that the honorable member had consented to the duties being reduced to 10 per cent. and 5 per cent. I was no party to that reduction, and would be no party to it. When I arrived at the House next day, I taxed the Minister with having thrown over those who supported the protectionist policy of the Government, and told him that if the opportunity offered I should rather vote for the item to be placed on the free list than for the retention of these duties of 10 per cent. and 5 per cent. I intend to vote to-day for the Senate&#39;s request, believing that the item should be free, rather than that it should be subject to mere revenue duties. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Minister will recognise the advisableness of accepting the Senate&#39;s request. The honorable member for Hunter has referred to the number of small holdings in his electorate which must be enclosed with wire netting, and there are thousands of farms in Victoria in the same position. Many millions of tons of wire netting will be necessary to enclose agricultural and pastoral holdings, . and having regard to the enormous demand and the enlarged market now open to them, the manufacturers of wire netting in New South Wales, who commenced operations under a free-trade Tariff, should be able without difficulty to carry on operations. If wire netting were a light material, that could be brought out in tanks,&#34; just as many goods are imported, the position would be different ; but the cost of its carriage from other countries is in itself equal to a protective duty. I know that the removal of the duties from this item will involve an annual loss of&#163;30,000, but we must remember that but for the men on the land we should have no Melbourne or&#39; Sydney. When at Seymour the other day, I was informed by the licensee of the railway refreshment rooms that he could not obtain sufficient milk to supply the needs of passengers. What is the cause? </para>

                        <para>- We should not have felt the drought so severely but for the hordes of rabbits that have been allowed to overrun the land. I have no desire to prolong the discussion. There can be no question as to the desirableness of placing wire netting on the free list. Whilst I am in favour of reasonable protection, I agree with the honorable member who said the other day that &#34;there is protection and protection,&#34; and that we should not place a duty on this item. I have made a personal appeal to the Minister, and I recognise that, having regard to the loss of revenue which the removal of. these duties will involve, he is in a delicate position, more especially in view of the information which the honorable member for Flinders has given us as to the heavy drain upon our finances. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members will agree with me that there must have been some reason far the absence of any protest on the part of manufacturers in this State against the action of the Premier of Victoria in starting wire-netting works in the Pentridge Stockade. We have not far to look for it. It seems to me that business people, as intelligent men anxious to invest their capital to advantage, have recognised that the demand for wire netting is not likely to be continuous, and that the industry, therefore, is not one in which they would care to embark. I am satisfied that had some more enduring industry been established in the Stockade by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent,</inline> there would have been a wild outcry against his interference with private enterprise. If the wire-netting industry were worth building up - if it had a future before it - the imposition of a protective duty to encourage it would be in keeping with the policy of the Government. The duties now imposed on wire netting, however, are not protective, but merely revenue producing, and it is remarkable that a protectionist Government should be prepared to support them. The argument advanced by the honorable  member for Grey is unanswerable. The cutting up of large estates in good agricultural country, and the gradual bringing about of closer settlement, will reduce the necessity to use, and, consequently, the demand for, wire netting. But, nevertheless, there is a very large area which must be enclosed by netting to keep out rabbits and wild dogs. Our aim should be to rive those who hold land in such areas an opportunity to procure wire netting as cheaply as possible. This industry . should be separated from others that we desire to build up in Australia, since it is not  likely  to be enduring. The demand for &#39; wire netting is likely to decrease as our agricultural areas are more closely settled. From the  point  of view of the protectionist, these duties are absurd..  They  will afford no protection to the industry, and I think that .the Minister should be prepared to accept the request. I am on principle opposed to revenue duties, and do not wish to. vote for rates Raving no protective incidence. What we should aim at is to help those on the land who are so heavily handicapped, by enabling them to get wire netting as cheaply as possible. A large part of the district which I represent is subject to frequent droughts, while a great deal of it contains fine agricultural land, where much farming is clone. But on the borders of the drier country the farmers have to wire-net their holdings to preserve their crops from the rabbits. We should do what we can for every industry, and extend such help as we can proffer to those in need of assistance. No absolutely effective means of combating the rabbit pest has yet been discovered, and we ought to recognise the difficulties of those who are fighting this scourge, by taking off the proposed miserable duties and making wire netting free. </para>

                    <para>.- The speeches which we have heard so far on this item have been&#39; monotonous, every  speaker  advocating the removal of the duties on wire netting. No one could refer to the remarks made during the Tariff  discussion as oratorical outbursts ; there is simply so much yabber as to the effect of each .item on the interests concerned, and I may as well take part in this debate  as sit quietly and hear others express their views. But before going further, I should like to know if the Government intend to press the motion that the Senate&#39;s requested amendment be not made. I do not wish to support the motion, and see it dropped later on. I do not believe that the wire-netting industry, though  a pet one with the Treasurer, is similarly regarded by the Minister of Trade and Customs, and I am shrewd enough to suspect some change of front, seeing that the Treasurer is not here now to take charge of the Tariff. The making of wire netting is not a Victorian industry. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but the industry is a New South Wales one, and therefore we do not hear any cry about the need for protecting it. It does not, like the wire-nail industry of Victoria - a cognate industry - employ about six men and a couple of boys; it gives work to about 400. But the firm chiefly concerned has never asked me to advocate its claims to protection, and, indeed, the absence of lobbying in the interests of the engineering trade of Australia reflects the greatest credit on those associated with them. </para>

                    They have not. A great deal has been said about the effect .of the duties on wire netting on small pastoralists f.nd farmers. But the same arguments could have been used with equal force against the duties on wire nails, and similar protective imposts.  My  attitude  . in  regard to the item is. due &#39; largely to the votes which have been given on similar items. Some of the men employed, in making wire netting in New South Wales may live  in my electorate ; but the industry is in another electorate, and those connected with it have not approached me for assistance. It is in a healthy and robust condition, paying from &#163;12,000 to &#163;14,000 a year in wages;, and, if it were situated on&#39; the banks of the Yarra, the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>
                    would not have sufficient room in its columns to publish all that would be&#39; said in favour of protecting it. As there .has been so much yelling for the (protection of industries situated on the Yarra, why should not one yell for an industry situated on the banks of the Parramatta? I supported the Treasurer&#39;s original -proposal to place duties of 30 and 25 per cent, on wire netting, although preferring rates of 15 and 10 per cent., as  giving  sufficient protection. I, however, voted against rates of 10 and 5 per cent., as being  merely  revenue duties. I thought it better to make the item &#39; free than to impose such low rates. Now, however, the Minister asks us to vote for 10 and 5 per cent. If I get an assurance that those rates will protect the industry, I shall vote for them ; but&#39; if they will not protect the industry there will be no- good reason for imposing them. Apparently Ministers are not serious in proposing to reject the Senate&#39;s request.

                        <para>- I have my doubts about it ; but I throw the responsibility on the Minister and the protectionists, and will vote for the proposed duties. The statement that users of wire netting are willing to pay more for the Australian-made article shows that the industry is likely to be a permanent one. Of course, .1 appreciate the plea on behalf of the small pastoralists and farmers ; but, if wire netting is made free, not only they, but also the big pas- toralists and big associations with, paid-up capitals amounting to nearly ,&#163;2,000,000 will benefit. The honorable member for Maranoa said the other night that he would give to one &#34; bloke &#34; what he would give to another, and as he has voted to tax the community generally to protect industries on the banks of the Yarra, I ask him to vote for the proposed duties for the protection of an industry on the banks of the Parramatta. If I go on like this, I shall soon be able to make as good a protectionist address -as some of the life-long protectionists. </para>

                        <para>- I am learning how to put up the umbrella. There has been a fiscal  corrobboree,  and I do not see why I should not be in it as much as those who are in it, but who will not .admit the fact. Besides, under the new protection the workers .will get fair wages, and I am very desirous of bringing that about. The Government having declared the proposed duties to be protective, I shall vote for them in the interests of the wire weavers of New South Wales. I am sorry, however, that the firm for which we are voting duties of 10 and 5 per cent, is a big importer of black wire. An industry which asks for  assistance should support other Australian industries. </para>

                    <para>. - I did not expect to hear in any Parliament in Australia a voice raised in favour of a duty on. wire netting. All who are  interested  in land in Australia must know that there are millions of acres which  could not be occupied if they were not fenced with wire netting. That is  especially  the case in districts like those of the honorable member for Grey. In  South  Australia wire netting is regarded as so necessary for the occupation of land that, the Government is buying it and distributing it among those who cannot afford .to get it themselves, and giving long terms for  repayments.  In times of drought the rabbit pest  is felt more than at others, because then the rabbits are driven oft  the  unoccupied country, and destroy everything in the way of edible plants. Par- &#39; liament should do everything possible to check their ravages. Instead of imposing a duty on wire netting, it would be better to give a bounty on its production, to induce more persons to manufacture it. There are hundreds of people who would use wire netting, and are unable to do so because they cannot afford to purchase it. We have been told that this is a revenue, duty, but I might remind honorable members that if it were not for the erection of wire-netting fences there are millions of acres in Australia which to-day would be producing no revenue at all. I trust that the amendment requested by the &#39; Senate will be made. </para>

                    <para>.----I am at  a loss to understand the attitude taken- up by the honorable member for Dalley in this matter. No one has pleaded more loudly or at greater length for the primary industries. We know the &#34;stonewalls&#34; which the honorable member assisted to erect, in the interests of the primary industries, when we were considering the first Federal Tariff. I agree entirely with what, has been said by the honorable member for Barker. I would not only give a bonus for the manufacture of wire netting, but I would give the ; settler the wire netting free. The Queensland Government offer &#163;50,000 to any man who can discover an effective means . for the eradication of the rabbit pest. Time after &#39; time it has been proved that the most effective way of dealing with the pest so&#39; far  known is the subdivision of large areas into small paddocks by effective rabbit-proof fencing. I appeal to the Minister of Trade and Customs, as a country representative, to make a name for. himself in the country by climbing down and adopting the Senate&#39;s suggestion. The Senate has, in this matter, exhibited more wisdom than Ave did. </para>

                        <para>- I mean collectively. .The Senate decided that. the right thing to do was to remove the duty. I hope that the Minister will take the same view. I can tell him that the numbers are up, and that we are going to make wire netting free of duty, whether he likes it or not. He has, therefore, one more chance to make a name for himself, by saying that the Government are prepared to accept the Senate&#39;s suggestion. Perhaps the Treasurer has said that the. Minister of Trade and Customs must not accept the requested amendment, unless over his political dead body I have no doubt that if the honorable gentleman has received such instructions he will carry them out to the letter. Vo one knows better than the honorable gentleman the expense which small settlers have to bear in protecting their holdings from destruction by rabbits and marsupials. &#39; I understand that the most prolific constituents of Eden-Monaro are the rabbits, but surely the- Minister of Trade and Customs would prefer to represent human beings. I look upon every head of stock in Australia as a national asset, and I regard the pastoral industry as a national industry, which every member of this Parliament should be prepared to protect in- every way. I &#39;am quite at a loss to understand why any tax should be imposed on wire netting. </para>

In the first instance, the Treasurer intimated that he was prepared to agree to a reduction of the duties at first submitted in the Tariff, and to accept duties of  15  and  10  per cent. In accordance with that intimation the honorable member for River- inn - notwithstanding what the honorable member for Grey has said - moved that the duties should be  15  and  10  per cent. There was a very warm discussion on the subject, which lasted until late at night, when a compromise was arrived at, and the Government agreed to accept duties of  10  per cent, and  5  per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Only a few minutes, ago, the honorable member for Grey denied that the honorable member for Riverina moved for duties of  15  and  10  per cent., and now he says that the Government threw the honorable member over. Some honorable members have stated to-day,, and the honorable member for Echuca for one, that they voted for duties of  10  and  5  per cent., because they could get nothing lower. The honorable member for Echuca, on the occasion to which I refer, voted in the negative in two divisions on motions proposing a  5  per cent. duty. The honorable member never tried to get a  5  per cent, duty on any occasion. The first duty he voted for was  10  per cent., so that the honorable member did not vote for  to  per cent, because he could not secure a lower duty. The honorable member for Indi voted for the  5  per cent, throughout, and accepted  10  per cent, because that was the lowest duty he could secure. I was one of those who were not satisfied with the compromise agreed to on that occasion, but I accepted it, and voted for it as a, compromise. I do not intend to add to the mass of inconsistency which has been exhibited in this Chamber already in connexion with votes on the Tariff, and I therefore intend to adhere to the compromise T supported on the occasion to which I have referred. </para>

                    <para>-IS]- - I* seems to me that in this matter we are being left to decide as between a primary and secondary industry, which shall receive the benefit of the course we adopt. It is contended by one honorable member, who sits on this side, and votes with honorable members on the other side, that the retention of the duties will mean an advantage of an extra  5  or  10  per cent, to manufacturers of wire netting, whose employes live in his electorate. On the other hand, the Minister says that to accept the requested amendment of the Senate would involve a loss of revenue.  It should not be forgotten that we are dealing in this matter with a staple industry, the success of which means everything to Australia. All our industries depend upon the land, and we know that rabbits can only be kept under by the use of wire netting. In some parts of the State of New South Wales settlers, who some time ago were impoverished by losses of stock, due to the fact that their pastures were denuded by successive years of drought, are to.-day experiencing the benefit of a good season. They now have plenty of grass on their pastures, and though they know that while rabbits can obtain young grass they will not take poison baits they have very little money wherewith to erect wire-netting fencing to keep them out of their pastures. The Minister contends that a certain amount of revenue will be derived from these duties, and admits that their imposition means that settlers will have to pay an increased price for the wire netting they require. Are we going to tax people who have so little, and who have lost so much, now that they have an opportunity of conserving grass by erecting wire-netting fences? The honorable member for- Gippsland regards these duties as protective duties, and proposes to vote against the amendment requested by the Senate, in order that the secondary industry for the manufacture of wire netting may be kept going. The honorable member&#39;s contention is that that will lead to a reduction in the price of wire netting, but the Minister has told us that a revenue of  &#163;20,000,  and in some quarters it has been said that a revenue of  .&#163;40,000,  is at stake in this matter. We should bring commonsense to bear upon our consideration of the question, and I should like to remind Victorian representatives that at the present time stock are starving in Victoria, and that thousands of Victorian stock are being sent to other States where grass is to be found. Victorian pastoralists are at present going through a very severe experience, and yet Victorian representatives are supporting the imposition of a duty on wire netting, which must lead to a higher price being charged for the grass which they require for their stock than would be charged if wire netting were admitted free of duty. Victorian representatives are so wedded to high protective duties that they are prepared to impose them even if, in doing so, they should penalize the&#39; man on the land, and all that makes for the progress and wealth of the State. This is a matter which should come home to every Victorian representative, because Victorian settlers on the land are feeling the pinch more at the present time than are the settlers in any other State. If wire netting is made more costly, those who require to put. their cattle out to grass on other people&#39;s land in more favoured districts will have to pay more for the privilege; and I hope a common-sense view will prevail, and that this necessary&#39; will be placed within the reach of men of small means. Those of large means were able to get their wire netting in the past at a much cheaper rate, but now&#34; a higher price is demanded from the small settler, who is not able to afford it. This is truly a national question ; and I appeal to the Minister of Trade and Customs, as a reasonable being, to have regard for the staple industries of Australia, and, particularly, to the interests of the small settlers. </para>

                    <para>. - The original proposal of the  Government was a duty of  30  per cent, under the general Tariff, and  25  . per cent, on wire netting from the United Kingdom, and after a lengthy debate it was decided to impose duties of 5 and  to  per cent. The Senate considered the&#39; item from- all its various points of view, and in the interests of the industries affected, requested that the commodity should be placed on the free list. When the first Tariff was under consideration there was a proposal to impose a duty on wire .netting, but the Senate, on &#39; that occasion, also decided to place it on the free list; and I trust that the request of the Senate now before us will be adopted. When the item was under consideration in October last, I dealt with it fairly exhaustively, and I do- not propose to cover the ground to-day : but I emphasize the fact that at that time the selling price of imported wire netting in New South Wales was from  &#163;40  to  &#163;45  per mile, and the best quality of locally-made netting of standard measurement was  &#163;45  per -mile. So serious had the position then become, due to the high prices and the increasing need on the part of small holders to protect, not only their grass area, but their cultivated areas, that the State Government of New South Wales decided to come to their assistance, and entered into large contracts, so as to place wire netting at their disposal at a cheaper rate. The local manufacturing; firm of Lysaght Brothers had the option of tendering, and their first tender for  4,000  miles&#39; of netting,  42  inches by 1¼ cinch, was at the rate of  &#163;31  per mile, while the accepted tender from abroad, for the same class of netting, was at the rate of  &#163;26  per mile, landed in Sydney. This wire netting was retailed at  &#163;26 5s.,  showing a difference of  &#163;4 1:5s.,  as compared with the price of the local article. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Since then., with a fall in the price of metals, the price of . locally-made wire netting has been reduced, though it still stands at over  &#163;30,  whereas I am informed&#39;, that the last tender from abroad, for the same class of netting was  &#163;22  per mile. Here we have&#39; a difference of something like  &#163;9  &#39;per mile. In  1906  about  &#163;500,000  worth of wire netting was imported, and the local production is estimated at about the same value, showing a consumption! of about  &#163;1,000,000  worth. Arid the consumption . is increasing, for the reason that rabbits are gradually spreading over the agricultural areas, and rendering precautions increasingly imperative. Assuming, that the present consumption of imported wire netting is represented bv  &#163;500,000  worth - and the greater portion of it is from Germany, America., and France; - and that the local production is another  &#163;500.000  worth, we .see&#34; that a- duty of  10  per cent, means that the farmers and graziers will be taxed to the extent of  &#163;100.000.  The honorable member for Dalley was elected as a free-trader, and is politically known in New South Wales as the champion of champions of the free-trade cause; but he has decided, in the interests of the manufacturers within his electorate, to cast a vote in favour of the duties. From the statement of the manager of Lysaght Brothers I find that the highest pay-sheet for one week is  &#163;700,  an|d, assuming the wages to be at the standard rate, we find that trie cost, in this connexion, of conducting the wire-netting industry is about  &#163;36,000  per annum, or  &#163;64.000  short of the revenue from the duties. There are only from 300 to 400 hands employed ; and, under the circumstances, the farmers and settlers would find themselves about &#163;60,0000 in pocket &#171;if they were to pay the wages of those at present employed, and have wire netting duty free. Throughout the settled districts of New South Wales the .rabbit pest is an increasing menace to the very existence of &#39; agricultural industries. <inline font-style="italic">In</inline> New South Wales there are about 74,000 separate holdings, 69,000 of which are of 1,000 acres and .under, representing a total of about 11,000,000 acres; there are 5.500 holdings under  3.0,000  acres, totalling 13,000,000 acres, and there are 722 holdings, totalling 22,000,000 acres. When the Tariff- of 1902 was under consideration, wire netting was placed on the free list, in furtherance of the large pastoral interests; but to-day the rabbit wave has reached the agricultural areas! and the small holders are affected. No protectionists will claim that the proposed duties can have any protective effect. Protective duties range from 25 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> 50 per cent., and even to  3  50 per cent. ; and I ask&#39; whether it is reasonable to burden the farming and grazing industries with a purely revenue  duty ? I trust the Committee will accept the recommendation of the Senate. The number of free-traders is very small compared with the - total membership of that Chamber ; and yet it . was considered only just and fair that wire netting should be placed on the free list. I. trust that the Committee will decide to bring the Tariff, so far as regards this item, into line&#39; with the previous one. In that case, the question was purely a grazing or squatters&#39; question. I hope that under this Tariff the farmers, settlers, and small land-holders generally will receive the same treatment as was given then to the larger land-holders. </para>

                    <para>.- To listen to honorable members opposite, one would think there was no wire netting being made in Australia, because people who prefer to use imported wire netting are charged a duty on it. Wire netting is being made in New South Wales, at an establishment where some 400 men are employed. Last year they turned out about  &#163;500,000 worth, and if they are given sufficient protection they can produce the whole of the wire netting required in Australia. In 1902 we imported of wire netting &#163;&#91;130,000 worth ; in 1903, &#163;&#91;95,000 worth; in 1904, &#163;&#91;129,000 worth; in, *9&#176;5&#62; ,&#163;335&#60;000 wor.th <inline font-style="italic">&#62;</inline> in 1906, &#163;&#91;521,000&#39; worth; and in 1907, &#163;&#91;581,000 worth. . That shows how the imports are increasing. The leader of the Opposition, at the beginning of the consideration of the Tariff, expressed the hope that the industries of New South Wales would receive some protection. This is a New South Wales industry asking for protection. </para>

                        <para>- It is not protection in the true sense of the word, but it is all that we can get. . We endeavoured to give 20 or 30 per cent. The protection being asked for in connexion with this industry in Great Britain against German competition is 7! per cent. Why should not the workmen of New South Wales get some protection ? Why should they not receive the same protection as the hat-makers of Victoria have been given? Over 250 of the wire-workers of New South Wales presented to this House a petition asking for protection for their industry, yet New South Wales members who were sent here to represent the working classes say, &#34; We shall not give them protection at all. We shall allow the imported article to come iri free.&#34; I hope the Committee will not decide to make the item free, because it has been proved times out of number that if we have local competition the struggling farmers, about whom . the honorable member for- Maranoa spoke, will get their wire netting cheaper. </para>

                        <para>- They can get as much as they want of it, but some people prefer the imported article. If they do, let them pay the duty. If we were not making wire netting in Australia, it would be a different thing..&#39; The honorable member for Calare stated that duties of 10 and 5 per cent, were not protective in the true sense of the word. If the honorable member is voting against those duties because they are not protective, would he vote for a duty of 20 per cent, if it was proposed as a protective duty? </para>

If the importers gain control of the market they will flood the Commonwealth with foreign netting, form a ring; and put the prices up again. That has been proved in the past.

So far as I am able to gather, he is inclined to slip on wire netting. I want to put in  a block in order to keep him up if I can ; I do not know whether I shall succeed or not. This petition was presented by the workers, and not a word has yet been said by a representative of New South Wales on their behalf . </para>

                        <para>- No; the honorable gentleman believes in restrictions being placed upon the labour of the men who work. If he is not in a position to impose those restrictions, how can he say that he is in favour of the new protection? If he is not in a position to control an industry, how can he put down sweating? I am sure that he is not in favour of sweating. He &#34;would, not like- to see the wire-netting workers of New South Wales sweated in the same way as are such: workers in other parts of. the world. He would not like to see the workers of New South Wales, working twelve hours a day on seven days for about a <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1.</inline> He has no sympathy with that kind of treatment. On the contrary, he is in favour of the factory worker getting a standard rate of wages, and also the new protection. If this duty oh wire netting be imposed, he will have an opportunity of seeing that the workers of New South Wales get a share of the protection. </para>

No honorable member sitting in the corner - I will go so far as to say that no honorable member sitting, on the front Opposition bench at the present time - is in favour of sweating. Times out of number we have heard that these honorable gentlemen are in favour of the new protection ; that is, of controlling legislation. Has it been shown in this debate that the wire netting produced in New South Wales is not equal to the imported article? That has not yet been shown. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable &#39; members on the other side admit that the locally-made, article is equal to the imported article. If that is so, why. do they object to the imposition of a duty ? We have been told that if the duty had been in force last year it would have yielded a revenue of &#163;30,000. The duty will only be paid by the man who will not buy the locally-made article. If a man prefers to patronize the sweated labour of other countries, let him pay an extra price for his .wire netting. But do not let us have this foreign competition inside the country, where we can regulate the wages and working conditions. If the duty be imposed it will be the means of increasing employment but if it be not imposed it will be the means of blotting out the industry. Are honorable members prepared to take the responsibility of voting in the latter direction ? Are the representatives of New South Wales who are now in the Chamber prepared to tell the wire netting workers of that State that they intend to blot out the industry by withholding any protection? Some of them have seen fit to vote for a protection of 10 or 15 per cent, to other industries, and why should they not consider the interests of the wire workers? I repeat most emphatically that this industry should be protected. I,  as a Victorian, intend to vote in that direction. I am not one of those .who believe in protecting an industry because it is located in one part of the Commonwealth. I am in favour of a policy of national protection. I am in favour of all portions of the Commonwealth&#39; receiving equal  protection.  But I am at a loss to understand why the wire netting industry should be compelled to close down, when other industries are protected. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. At any rate, &#39;it has not had that effect up  to the present time. I know that in. New South Wales a factory has been established for the manufacture of wire netting, and that its operations act as a very wholesome check upon importers. I think that duties of 10 per cent, under the general Tariff, and s per cent, under the United Kingdom Tariff are very legitimate charges to levy upon this article. Substantially they represent a duty of only 5 per cent., inasmuch as the quantity, of wire netting imported from Germany is relatively very small. I therefore intend to adhere to the vote which I cast when this item was previously under consideration. </para>

                    <para>. - The statement that the duty upon this article has had the effect of increasing its price is absolutely incorrect. As a. matter of fact, since the duty has been operative the price&#39; of wire netting has been continuously reduced. I have just sent for a letter which L received from Messrs. Lysaght Brothers a few days ago, in which I am informed that during this week they have still further reduced the price of their netting. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member knows nothing about the question. Wire netting is scarcely used in his- electorate. In my own constituency I do not think there is a single individual who purchases anything but Messrs. Lysaght Brothers netting, <inline font-style="italic">as the</inline> result of bitter experience of the netting purchased from the Government. The farmers imagined - when they dealt with the New South Wales Government - that they would secure wire netting which would keep out rabbits from their holdings, but they were soon disillusionized, and they .have since had to buy wire netting from Messrs. Lysaght Brothers to duplicate their fences. </para>

                        <para>- I never believed in the action of the New South Wales Government in supplying inferior netting. When they first proposed to purchase netting for land-holders the conditions imposed were similar to those which obtained in Queensland. In other words/ the wire was supplied to the farmers and was to be paid for at the rate of 5 per cent, over a period of twenty years. But subsequently the term was reduced to ten years, and conditions were imposed which caused many land-holders to become perfectly disgusted. These conditions required them to mortgage their properties, and to send in a report as to the condition of the netting every twelve months. As a result, a great many persons in the Albury and Wagga districts would have nothing more to do .with the New South Wales Government. The conditions were so positively ridiculous. It is imperative that our farmers should be supplied with an article with which they are satisfied, and one which will keep out the rabbits,, which the&#39; imported netting will not do - especially the netting imported by. the. New South Wales Government. </para>

                        <para>- I may tell the honorable member that my own son applied for wire netting introduced bv the Government of New South Wales because he thought that it would be of good quality and that he would be able to secure it upon easy terms. &#39; But when the conditions to which I have referred were imposed he refused to have anything to do with the Government of that State, and purchased his supplies from Messrs. Lysaght Brothers.  His-  case is .typical of nearly every land-holder in the electorate which I represent.&#34; They would rather pay an increased price for the netting manufactured by Messrs. Lysaght Brothers than purchase the imported article. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Barrier is responsible for the introduction of the question of patent medicines. I am heartily in accord with him in that connexion. I merely wish, in a judicious way, to see the wire netting industry not only maintained, but expanded to the fullest possible extent, so that our own people may be supplied with a better class of netting than they are getting at the present time. I regret very much that we are not in a position to-day to produce all the wire that is used in this country. It is time we were in that position. When I was in Sheffield I saw the wire-making industry in progress at Hatfield&#39;s, one of the best firms in England. There would be no difficulty whatever in manufacturing all the wire we require, both for wire netting and. for other purposes. The process is a very simple one indeed, and not much machinery is required. At Lithgow, or some other steel works, we ought to be able to manu facture not merely wire netting from imported wire, but the wire itself. I hope that the Committee will not agree to make this item free. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that the honorable member does not wish to misrepresent me.  The honorable member for Riverina knows perfectly well what took place. As I introduced the Tariff the duties were 30 and 25 per cent. Those duties were submitted not because I thought they were the highest that we should impose, but largely because they were recommended by the Tariff Commission. When the question was discussed in Committee I found that I could not maintain them, but I fought for higher duties than were agreed to. If I could get higher duties I would, but I do not want to have a Tariff that might for a little while result in an increase in price, although I do not think that that would be the effect. In. the interests of our manufacturers and of those who use wire netting, I appeal to the Committee not to reduce these duties below what they were when the Tariff left this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer states that some of my constituents told him that they are disappointed with my votes. Seeing that he has been in Tasmania since I was last there myself, it is possible that certain of my constituents told him what he has stated. But I do not think that the electors of Wilmot, as a whole, are adverse to the views which I have expressed, and to the votes which I have given. At any rate, I am perfectly willing to put the matter to the proof. I only wish that the Treasurer would contest the electorate a.gainst me at the next election. </para>

                    <para>. - Several honorable members opposite have admitted that) they voted for duties of  10 and 5 per cent, because they could not secure the admission of wire netting duty free. The honorable member for Calare has interjected that honorable members on this side of the Chamber ought to be opposed to a 10 per cent, duty, because it is a revenue duty. Well, I am against 10 per cent, duties, but I voted for 10 and 5 per cent, in this instance, precisely because those&#39; were the highest duties I could get. I declined to vote for lower duties for several reasons. In the first place, I desire our settlers to be able to get cheap wire netting, and, in the second place, I wish to protect those who are manufacturing wire netting in Australia at present. What guarantee has been given us that if we were to make wire netting duty free the settlers would get it cheaper? When there was no duty our experience was that the purchasers were very badly treated by the importers. In South Australia we use an enormous quantity of wire netting in proportion to population. I suppose that we use more than any State in the Commonwealth. When there was no duty the price charged was so enormous that the Government .of the State had to step in and import wire netting themselves, selling it to the settlers at cost price. It is a curious thing that the moment something is proposed to be done to benefit the- farmers we find certain honorable members opposite saying, &#34; Oh, we must not- touch the farming community.&#34; Chemical manures could not be sold at the price at which they are sold to-day had it not been for the local manufactures. It is precisely the same with wire netting-. If honorable members make the item free, and wipe out the local industry. 7 am quite satisfied that wire netting will become very much dearer. The result will simply be to leave the whole field open to a ring of importers, and the settlers will consequently have to pay much more than they are now doing. Even if the local manufacturers were to come to an arrangement with the importers - which I do not think they will do - there is nothing to prevent any State in the Commonwealth doing what was done by South Australia; namely, purchasing wire netting at the cheapest &#39;market price, and selling it to the settlers at that price. </para>

                        <para>- What is the difference between purchasing wire netting at the cheapest price in. any part of the world when there is no duty, and doing the same thing when there is a duty ? There is no difference whatever. In fact, I should like to see the whole of the States doing what Victoria is now doing. I should like to see wire netting made in all the gaols of the Commonwealth, so that the settlers might get it at the cheapest possible price. Wire netting is not an article. that comes into competition with the produce of workers in .the same sense as do boots and shoes and other commodities. </para>

                        <para>- That remark suggests a reason why the honorable member should support me in this case ; because if there is a strike and wire netting is not being made in the gaols, the farmers will be at the mercy of the importers, who will charge whatever price they like. They will say that the increase is due to. the strike, and will charge .&#163;5 or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> per ton more than is justifiable. While the proposed duties are not as high as .they ought to be, I shall vote for their retention, because they are the highest I Can secure. The local manufacture affords the best safeguard to the settlers against being penalized by importers. Some honorable members expressed their determination not to vote for the duties, because of the low wages paid in the industry. But if the wages are not fair, I take it that that is the fault of this Parliament and of the States Parliaments. </para>

                        <para>- If there is any worker &#39; in the Commonwealth who is not receiving a fair wage to-day, it is not the fault of the workers, but of our Parliaments in not seeing that justice is done to&#39; them. There has never been any difficulty in getting justice done to the manufacturers, who have been far more strongly represented! in our Parliaments than the workers have been. </para>

                        <para>- This is only a young Parliament as yet, and it is the only Parliament in the world, so far as my knowledge goes, that is elected by  adult suffrage. Therefore, the workers have not had proper representation in the other Parliaments of Australia. Some honorable members .say that they are not going to vote for higher duties because it is not worth while to preserve an industry in which the wages are so low. </para>

                        <para>- It is the reason given by more &#39;than one honorable member. I have a better opinion of the farmers of this country than to believe that if they had to pay a trifle more for their wire netting in order that- a fair wage might be paid in the industry, they would not be willing to do it.  In my opinion, it is the duty of this Committee to encourage the manufacture of wire netting in the Commonwealth. I hope to see the industry established not only in New South Wales, but in the other States also. Since the .Tariff has been laid on the table we have been manufacturing barbed wire in South Australia, and it&#39; is just as easy to manufacture wire netting. </para>

These industries may be small individually, but collectively, they lead to the employment of a large number of hands. In addition&#39; to that, mechanics are employed in the manufacture of the machinery! These industries&#39; will grow, and afford more&#39; and more employment according as we give them protection against the outside world. </para>

                    <para>.- On general principles, I am opposed to 10 per cent, duties as being absolutely revenue duties. Wire netting is not only heavy but extremely bulky, and freightage is an extremely important factor in the total cost. That being so,&#39; a duty of 10 per cent, iri respect of it is equal to a duty of 15 per cent, in the esse of many other articles. Evidence such as that given by the honorable member, for Hindmarsh as well as the facts within my own knowledge convinces me that we shall secure cheap wire netting for Australian users only by means of local competition. The quality of the Australian-made netting &#39; is infinitely superior to that obtained, from abroad. Many men have to mortgage their holdings to obtain the wherewithal to purchase wire netting to enclose them, and we can .well imagine their dismay, on finding that the imported netting which they have used for that purpose is rapidly falling to pieces. </para>

                        <para>- The interjection made by the honorable member for Grey was scarcely fair. I am well aware that farmers use wire netting. Those engaged in mixed farming in many parts of New South Wales use it ; but I was not aware until&#39;- to-day that very small holdings in closely-settled districts in South Australia are enclosed in this way. In the circumstances, I think thai I am justified in claiming the vote of the honorable member for Grey., in favour of these duties in order that his constituents may secure an effective netting at a cheap rate. </para>

                    <para>.- This is the first instance in which we have been asked to consider a request for duties to be brought into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation. What is proposed is virtually a reopening of the Tariff from time to time for the benefit of certain industries. But why should some industries be treated differently from others? In one State industries get duties of 30 and 40 per cent., and why should industries in other States be treated differently? I am tired of the geographical protection which is being voted. If locks can be made in Tasmania, and the proposed duties will protect and encourage the industry, why should the duties not be brought into force at the earliest possible moment ? </para>

                        <para>- Were I a protectionist,  1  should encourage by duties the manufacture of locks. I should not .ask the lock-makers to fight their battle on free-trade lines, offering them duties when they no longer needed them. Duties axe generally proposed for the encouragement and protection of industries not properly established. Probably the reason for this proposal .is that locks are not made here, or that&#39; only a few are made, and that they are looked upon as necessaries in other industries, which therefore should be allowed to come in free. If the Treasurer is prepared to make the requested amendment, I have no reason for opposing it. </para>

                        <para>- I remind the Treasurer that it is part of the Government proposal to establish the iron industry by means of bounties, and that that makes all the difference in the world. If he will say that the Government intend to propose a bounty in connexion with the industry now under consideration, he will have some justification for asking protectionists .to vote for this proposal. No parallel can be drawn between this industry and the iron industry. What is proposed here is that this industry should be allowed to get along as best it can and without any protection until it is established, and then after it has been established we are to impose protective duties to assist it. </para>

                    <para>. - It has been suggested by the Treasurer that there is some analogy between this extraordinary proposal and that set out at the commencement of Division  VIa.  I submit that there is no such analogy, and no connexion of any kind between them. The proposal made in connexion with Division  VIa.  is due to the fact that there was some uncertainty as to whether we should adopt a policy of bounties for the encouragement of the manufacture of iron or impose protective duties. The proposal of the Government in the matter - and whether it is logical or not, I .am not at present concerned to inquire - was that we should first of all encourage the industry by means of substantial bounties, and that when with that encouragement it reached certain proportions we should abolish the bounties, and impose protective duties. In any circumstances, it is an unfortunate thing to have to resort to this particular mode of legislation, and  such a course could only be justified by some such condition of affairs as exists in connexion with the manufacture of iron, because of the difficulty we have in deciding whether we should encourage its manufacture by means of bounties or. by protective .duties. I think that a great many honorable members on both sides are dissatisfied with the proposal, even in those circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- I shall refer to them in a moment. .1 wish to say that to deal with a single item in the way here proposed is to keep the Tariff open. By the course proposed, although we are supposed to have settled .the whole question of the Tariff, an invitation would be offered for a renewed discussion of this particular item, and it would be left to the Government to reopen the consideration&#39; of this portion of the Tariff, and throw the House into the turmoil of a Tariff debate at any time they might feel disposed to do so. Such a proposal should not be accepted without the gravest reasons being advanced in support of it. We have heard a good deal of talk from the Treasurer, and from&#39; some, honorable members supporting him, about the character of the votes we have given, and about changing our views in respect to votes we gave on some of these items when they were previously before the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- What did the Government themselves do in this matter ? Here we have . an industry in such a struggling condition as not to be entitled &#39; to protection yet, but which we are invited to believe will be entitled to protection at some time when the Minister chooses to take the necessary action. After going fully into the whole &#39; matter of the Tariff with the report of the Tariff Commission before them, Ministers deliberately brought down to this House a Tariff in which they proposed &#39; locks, including knobs, keys, .escutcheons, and staples should be dutiable at only 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, and free if imported from the United Kingdom. </para>

                <para>Mr..W. H. IRVINE.- The right of the Senate to make requests or suggestions is deliberately embodied in our Constitution, and yet the honorable member would contend that it is our duty as members of the House of Representatives to flout the requests of the Senate. Is that the honorable member&#39;s idea of the relation which- should exist between the two Houses ? </para>

The Senate has not &#34;the power of amendment, but only the power of suggesting amendments, though, personally, I think there is very little difference in substance between the two; and I make the honorable member a present of that admission. But whatever the power means, it is part of the constitutional right of the Senate ; and surely it is our duty to at least give a courteous consideration to the suggestions made? </para>

                    <para>- If the honorable member means to infer that honorable members are governed bv considerations as between New South Wales and Victoria, and so on, I have no answer ; all I can do is to assure him that I am not governed bv any considerations of the kind. When we find the- Treasurer, having originally introduced this item to be subject to a duty of 5 per cent, -and free,&#39; deliberately threatening honorable members on both sides with all the terrors of his displeasure if  they do not at once vote for his proposal there is only one of two views open to us - either that the Minister did not go into this item as he said he had done, or that he has discovered, since he introduced, the Tariff, that this is a struggling industry which requires protection. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer ought, &#91; think, to listen to those who take exception to this kind of legislation. It is most objectionable to have conditional protection, leaving it within the power of the Ministry, at any particular juncture, to ask Parliament to declare that a manufacture is sufficiently established to justify a duty. The honorable member for Boothby was perfectly right when he said that if an industry can be brought into existence without a duty, it is a strange proposal to afford protection at a time when protection is not needed. Personally, I cannot conceive a better way of preventing an industry being established than  such a condition as that suggested ; because no&#39; one will enter into an industry with the prospect of facing a battle in two House of Parliament, in order to show .that it is sufficiently established to justify a duty. I suggest to the Treasurer that he ought to make up his mind to accept a duty of 20 per cent, or, perhaps, some lower figure, and to abandon this excrescence on the Tariff. The proposed conditions .are a new departure, and, quite apart from other considerations, I think honorable members ought to set their faces against it. There should be a protective duty or there should not be; and we ought to decide the question on its merits. The request of the Senate introduces: a most insidious and dangerous principle. As a protectionist, I am prepared to vote for a duty. </para>

The circumstances are now quite different ; and to insist on such a course, would be carrying the claim for consistency rather too far. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to point out the part which the Treasurer is playing in this Tariff. He would lead people outside to believe that he had proposed a stiff protective duty on locks in his Tariff, and that the Senate had played tricks with his original proposition, and brought about this disaster to the cause of protection. The fact is that the Government in the Tariff as introduced by themselves, proposed not one shred of protection for the lock industry of Australia. They proposed a revenue duty of 5 per cent, on locks made outside the Mother Country, and absolute free-trade in locks made in the Mother Country. They could not have proposed a lower revenue duty than they did. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member always speaks by way of interjection. If the honorable member will allow me, I wish to speak for myself. From a. protectionist point of view, it is ridiculous to ask an Australian industry to establish itself under free-trade conditions in the hope of getting protection after it has clone without it. Look at the position it puts industries in. They come to the House for a joint address that they are sufficiently established.  Then, from my point of view, I should be fairly entitled to say : &#34; They have established themselves under the terms of the Tariff without a duty. What is (he need of giving them a duty now?&#34; It would, therefore, not be fair from any point of view, and certainly not from a protectionist point of view, to adopt the Senate&#39;s suggestion. Why should the lock manufacturers have to vindicate themselves and establish themselves before they get any help? </para>

                        <para>- That is a Mother Gamp sort of interruption.  The Treasurer is playing the old woman, this afternoon. What is the matter with him? Will not some of the supporters of the Government agree to follow him ? Are they standing out? It seems to be a case of political lockjaw which is disagreeing with the honorable member. From a protectionist point of view this is a ridiculous proposition. That is a matter more for other honorable members than myself, but on a general ground, upon which protectionists and free-traders alike ought to meet, it is a pernicious principle that the Tariff should be liable to be re-opened at any time, and that there should be a struggle over an industry which comes to Parliament for assistance.  That is the sort of thing that leads to lobbying. </para>

                    <para>- Since locks can be made very easily without the expenditure of &#39; much capital;, it seems to me that if we agree to the request as it stands, we practically say to a man : &#34; You start the industry, and when you have started it we will give you a protection of 20 and 15  per  cent.&#34; Within three months any man with from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;150</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;200</inline> could come back to this Chamber, and say : &#34; I am in a position to demand the protection . that you promised.&#34; What was in the mind of the Senate was that the industry should be placed in such a position as tq be worthy of some sort of support. Their proposition is not so ridiculous as it appears at first sight, because no industry does receive protection in Australia unless it is struggling on to its feet. When it is said that an industry ought to receive protection, what is the objection that is urged against it from the stand-point of the free-trader? It is that there is no such industry. On another occasion it will be said &#34; There are only twenty men, or three men and a boy, employed in the industry ; it is one which should not be protected, because it employs so few persons.&#34; But directly a man comes forward with a  statement to the effect that he employs 50, 60, 100, or 500 men in an industry, then, from the protectionist stand-point, a case is made out for the grant of some protection. The mere fact that the&#39; industry is on its feet does not take away the right of the manufacturer to be protected. Therefore, I do not see anything very absurd in the .proposition. I apprehend that there is absolutely nothing to prevent a man from competing as readily with cheap locks as with cheap boots. I shall not vote for the proposition, because, from my standpoint, it is perfectly absurd. If this request be acceded to,&#39; it will be inviting a man to invest- <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,000</inline> in an industry, and at the end of three months to come to Parliament for some protection. If a protectionist Ministry be then in office with a majority at its back, the promise will have to be kept. We shall be called upon to grant to that man a protection which we are not. prepared to concede at the present time. If we are prepared to agree to duties of 20 and 15 per cent.,&#39; or 5 per cent, and free, let us do so at once. A duty of 5 per cent, is no protection to an industry. If the leader of the Opposition had been in office, 1 have no doubt that he would have agreed to give duties of 10 and 5 per cent. Those would be fair revenue duties. I suggest to the Treasurer that, instead of asking for duties of 20 an&#39;d 15 per cent, with an absurd proviso, he should be prepared to take duties of 10 and 5 per cent, if he will agree to adopt that .suggestion, he will get revenue., and also give a little protection to the industry. </para>

                    <para>-- I should not object to the Treasurer being granted leave to withdraw his motion only that a similar proviso is attached to the items dealing with oils, timber, and paper. In my opinion, it is quite right to fight the proposition now. I &#39; am not at all concerned with the fiscal side of it. When the Treasurer says that he wants to get his Tariff put through in a proper way, I ask him at what expense -does he intend to achieve that object? It is at the expense of surrendering our taxing power to the Senate. By a very acute device, it is &#34;trying to acquire greater power than it possesses under the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. What is the necessity for making this innovation ? I remind honorable members who grumble about other members changing their votes that time, after all, is the greatest innovator. Nothing has happened to warrant the Treasurer in asking honorable members to agree to the grant of this additional power to the Senate. Why should I willingly surrender our right in this regard.? The commercial aspect of this proposition was put very clearly by the honorable member for Mernda. He pointed out that the main&#39; justification! for the grant of a duty was to help an infant industry ; but now it is suggested by the Treasurer that an industry must be full grown before it can ask for such assistance. It must be well established before it is entitled to take advantage of this devious provision, and ask the two Houses for a protective duty. There will be no waste  of time in discussing this request. The Treasurer says that he wants to withdraw his motion in order to propose the insertion of something else ; but if his suggestion were &#39; adopted that would only get over the present difficulty. I want to know whether the withdrawal of the motion, is to cover similar requests in connexion with the items relating to oils,&#39; timber, and paper. Otherwise -it will only be wasting time to withdraw the motion in order to get over a difficulty in regard to locks. I trust that if he is not willing to uphold the constitutional rights of this House he, as a protectionist, Will put up a fight, and be prepared to go down if he is not able to win a duty on behalf of an industry in which he believes. </para>

                        <para>. - The  honorable member is quite right when he says that &#38; promise was made in that connexion. The promise was not that the -scheme should be discussed by this House before being presented to the Premiers&#39; Conference, but merely that it should be laid upon the table. I think I am safe in saying that it will be laid upon the table on Tuesday next. </para>
