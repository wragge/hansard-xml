                        <para>The amount represents the balance on 30th May of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Three-fourths of net Customs and Excise revenue, &#163;583,000. Paid to States out of the Commonwealth&#39;s one-fourth,&#163;117,000. </para>

                    <para class="block">Coming to question No. 3, I have to state that the Commonwealth fourth will not be sufficient to meet the actual expenditure for June, not including moneys to be transferred to trust fund under the Surplus Revenue Bill. That is to say, even if the Surplus Revenue Bill does not pass, the Commonwealth cannot pay three-fourths&#39; for June. The intention is to hold the whole balance for June, so that there may be transferred to trust funds the following sums :  - &#163;250,000 for naval defence, and for old-age pensions &#163;222,000. Total, &#163;472,000. During the eleven months ended 31st May, the States have received about &#163;992,000 more than three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue. As three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue for June will be about &#163;731,000, the result for the whole year will be that the States will have received &#163;261,000 more than the three-fourths to which they are entitled. </para>

                            <para>- I am giving the information because, without it, the  answer to the questions would be absolutely incomplete. The total revenue for the last month is &#163;802,000. During the last two months there has been such a falling off in revenue that the increase over that of 1907, in the corresponding month, is only about &#163;13,000 per month. The right honorable member for Swan can make a calculation, and see how much that is below my estimate. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I shall confine myself to the figures. The revenue for the last month is only &#163;802,000, but I have estimated the total receipts in June at&#163;1,000,000, because there is a sum of &#163;160,000 held by the Government in a trust fund. That sum of &#163;160,000 will, I think, be paid over ; and, but for that, the revenue would not stand as well as I have indicated. It will be seen that, even if the Surplus Revenue Bill be passed, we shall have but &#163;222,000 to put aside for old-age pensions. </para>

It always has been customary, in the last month, to adjust the over payments that have been made to the States during the previous eleven months, but the &#163;1,078,000 does not contain any special amount other than that which I have stated.I asked the Acting Secretary to the Treasury to be sure to give me the amounts in the ordinary way; and the result is the information I have afforded the House. </para>

                            <para>- I am reluctant to interpose again ; and I am sure that both myself and honorable members are much obliged to the Treasurer for the information he has given. However, I did not gather - although I have an idea what the Treasurer intended - that the reply he gave was really one to my question. Do I understand the Treasurer&#39;s reply to mean that he does intend to deduct from the due three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, sums in excess of the three-fourths paid to the States in the previous eleven months, either wholly or in some proportion? Do I understand that the Treasurer does not intend to return to the States any revenue at all from Customs and Excise for the month of June? </para>

                        <para>- I thought I had made that point abundantly clear just now when replying to the question of the right honorable member for Swan. As to the charge of &#34; burglary,&#34; I can afford to let it pass as a piece of political hysteria, of which it is not worth while to take notice. Instead of the Commonwealth or the Treasurer committing &#34;burglary,&#34; I may say that all the States have received three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue for May, in addition to &#163;117,000 cut of the Commonwealth one-fourth - that is, they have received moneys which the Commonwealth was entitled to spend. All the moneys due have been paid to New South Wales,. Victoria, and, indeed, also in the cases of the other States; but, as to the amounts in connexion with the latter, we have no knowledge until we. hear by telegram. However, all the moneys to which the States are entitled have been paid, and all the money which the Commonwealth Treasurer had on Saturday morning is gone. We are without, any money today, except what comes in hour by hour. Under the circumstances, I think. that the Commonwealth has adopted a fatherly attitude towards the States, and has given them a great deal to help them along. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurers of the States knew perfectly well what was intended to be done under the Surplus Revenue Bill. The Prime Minister answered questions relating to it which they put to him at the recent Premiers&#39; Conference. I was present and heard him, and it was impossible for them to be mistaken as to what was intended. I am merely following the usual custom of adjusting the totals each year, with a view to seeing that we have sufficient money with which to cover payments due in connexion with the month of June, the States receiving the balance. The object of the Secretary to the Treasury in transmitting the telegram which he did was not to withhold the whole of the three-fourths of the Customs Revenue from the States, though previous Treasurers at the end of the financial year have withheld amounts to meet payments which had to be made after the end of June. The honorable member for Swan,, himself, has done that to a limited extent. He has done more than that - he has held large sums of money in London. The honorable member for South Sydney and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner also did the same thing as the Secretary of the Treasury thought he was justified in doing on Saturday. </para>

They adopted this course for the purpose of enabling them to meet payments falling due immediately before the close of the financial year. Technically, it is a breach of the law. </para>

This is the last month of the financial year, and the month in which the adjustments take place, and when the expenditure is larger than in any other month. In this month, it has always been the custom to adjust the accounts for the whole year. That is what has been done in the past&#39;; but if the probable June expenditure comes to a large amount and the Commonwealth has not sufficient to adjust the accounts for the whole of the year, it has been the practice in this second last month of the financial year to reduce the amounts returned to the States. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to point, out that the last few questions, and certain 1.r the last reply by the Treasurer, involve a practical discussion in the form of questions and answers of a matter which is covered by the Surplus Revenue Bill, and, therefore, what is taking place is, to a- large extent, an anticipation of what  would be legitimate debate upon that Bill. That I am precluded, by the Standing Orders, from allowing. I therefore desire to say that further questions must distinctly avoid reference to any matter which would open up a discussion proper to the Surplus Revenue Bill, or I cannot permit them to be put, or if put, to be answered. </para>

                            <para>The matter involved was so simple and clear that it was unfortunate that it should have been distorted in such a fashion.

My reason for asking the question is that if the Prime Minister knew that what the Treasurer stated was the meaning it might have been expected that he would make his remarks in a clear and definite way, so that we could all understand what he meant. But I think that we all went away home on Friday with a different idea in our minds from that which the honorable gentleman intended. </para>

                            <para>- I quite admit that the right honorable member for Swan is entitled to ask the question which he has put to me, because, I notice, on reading the report to which he has referred - which, in itself, is not correct - that my references in such a brief fashion to two distinct matters, have led to some confusion. I made reference in the first place to the fact that it was a pity that the meaning of the telegram from the Premier of Western Australia had been distorted, because the telegram, as I heard it read, and as I had read a copy of it before, clearly stated that it had reference only to the amount paid and to be paid in May and in the month following - that is, to last month and this month. I then proceeded to refer to a totally different question, which has been, and I find now was, taken to refer to the same matter. I was not continuing to refer to the same subject. I quoted a statement made by myself in response to questions at the recent Premiers&#39; Conference. The Premiers had inquired whether, under the proposed Surplus Revenue Bill, we intended to require them to pay back to the Commonwealth all that they had received over and above the three-fourths to which they were entitled under the Constitution j and I had answered them distinctly that no such visionary attempt as that was in my mind. I said that when the Surplus Revenue Bill came on for discussion it would be found that the surpluses with which it proposed to deal were those which had not then been paid to the&#39; States. </para>

                            <para>- But, as the right honorable member will see, that second answer of mine related to a different question, which had little or no bearing upon the matter, to which I referred in the first part of my answer, namely, that relating to the telegram from the Premier of Western Australia. His telegram, related only, as I have said, to the months of May and June ; but the other part of my answer related to back moneys paid to the States months, before. This, fortunately or unfortunately,  was recalled to my mind at the time when I was asked a question with regard to the Surplus Revenue Bill. Some of the confusion is no doubt owing to the concise way in which - the proceedings of the House being about to close - I alluded to two different questions. </para>

                            <para>- The publishing of the lists in the newspapers was a step taken upon advice with a view to conveniencing subscribers, and until the publication of the telephone directory it will be cheaper to issue supplementary lists in that form. But the question of whether ultimately supplementary lists shall not be published as hitherto, has not yet been decided. </para>

                        <para>- Probably the right honorable member for Swan, did not hear what I said a few minutes ago in reference to questions bearing upon the same subject as is covered by the motion that he desires to move. I ruled then, as I must rule now, that the debate which must take place upon the Surplus Revenue Bill must not be anticipated. As I understood the motion read out by the right honorable member, it had reference to the announcement of the Treasurer, in reference to what he proposed to do in view of the passing of the Surplus Revenue Bill. Therefore, the matter is linked so closely with the Surplus Revenue Bill, that I could not allow the right honorable member to submit his motion. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill relates to something which it is proposed to do, but which cannot be done unless the Bill becomes law. I say that to anticipate action upon a Bill that has not been passed,, and which is only being discussed, is improper. I submit that the action of the Treasurer is in anticipation of the passing, of a new Act of Parliament which is only being now discussed in the form of a Bill ; and, therefore, that I should be perfectly in order in calling attention to the action of, and to the statement of, the Treasurer that he is going to do something now which he has no legal authority to do. </para>

But the motion which I heard the right honorable gentleman read, and of which I have now obtained a copy from him, is such that I am bound to rule that debate upon it cannot take place at this time. I rule so on. account of a remark which I believe I correctly understood the Treasurer to make, to the effect that his contemplated action depended entirely on the passage by Parliament of the Surplus Revenue Bill. That so links the questions together that I am reluctantly obliged to take the course I have stated. </para>

                    <para>.- As I understand the Bill, the object of the Government is to secure for Commonwealth purposes that unexpended portion of the one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue which at present goes to the States under section 87 of the Constitution. The question is whether .it is constitutional for the Government to do so. Seeing that such authorities as the honorable member for Flinders and the Attorney-General have declared that the . course proposed is constitutional, I am not . prepared to say outright that it is not. But . I think it is open to very grave doubt, and there will be no settlement of the question until it goes to the High Court. The Government in this Bill aim at bringing the balance that usually goes to the States under what is meant by &#34; expenditure &#34; in section 89 of the Constitution. It is doubtful whether they can rightly do so. Section 81 of the Constitution requires all moneys raised to be put to a Consolidated Revenue Fund -   to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The word &#34; liabilities &#34; seems to require the payment to the States monthly of the money that they have been in the habit of receiving. If that is so, how is the Treasurer going to estimate month by month how much he is to place to his surplus revenue fund, because section 83 of the Constitution, says that &#34; no money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth, except under appropriation made by law&#34;? Is. there to be a special, appropriation of this money month by month ? If there is, that will be a very cumbrous and awkward procedure, and it will be extremely hard foc the Treasurer to estimate what amount he should ask Parliament to appropriate. Seeing that the Government have to pay this money back to the States monthly, &#34;the word &#34; liabilities &#34; insertion 8 1 seems to create a special appropriation - an appropriation which is fixed and permanent, and not one that requires to be annually dealt with under the Estimates, as the bulk of our appropriation is. Therefore, the Government must show that the mere fact of- taking this money, and putting it into a fund, is equivalent&#39; to expenditure for Commonwealth purposes. If they cannot do that, they fail in their object. The Constitution should, it seems to me, be broadly construed in this way : That <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> money should be taken, and appropriated yearly, and such money as is not spent during the course of the year should lapse, and go to the States. That certainly was the intention of the framers of the Constitution. The debates that took place. at the various meetings of the Convention prior to the inauguration- of Federation show that the framers of the Constitution had in view nothing that is contemplated by this particular Bill, which, in effect, says that if the Treasurer of the day likes to appropriate so much money to the Surplus Revenue Fund, that appropriation is to be expenditure. That appears to be rather straining the meaning of the word &#34; expenditure,&#34; because the money is not spent; and may not be spent for years. </para>
                <para>Such a proposal is altogether contrary to the intention of the Convention. It is altogether different from the appropriation sanctioned by the Audit Act. Under that Act trust funds can be established, but the money is taken for special and usually specific purposes, and not just taken generally, and kept until some particular business arises for which the Treasurer may use it. I therefore submit that it is open to the greatest doubt whether the Treasurer has power to make an  appropria-tion  in this way, to hold the money as long as he chooses, and to re-appropriate it if necessary at some future date for no purpose that&#39; was definitely stated when the money was actually taken and put into the fund. Such a proceeding is altogether contrary to the purpose of the trust funds created under the Audit Act&#39;. If the Treasurer could do. this, it would be open to him to take any large sum&#39; he liked, and simply to say that  he wanted it to be placed in the trust fund to be formed under this Bill. He could thus cut down the allowance that goes to the States every time, even&#39; though when he took the money he had in view no particular object upon which he proposed to spend it&#39;. That seems to be altogether contrary to the spirit of the Constitution, and should be opposed. Another question is the use of the word &#34; annually &#34; in section 87 of the Constitution. That&#39; section requires that - of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of Excise, not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. </para>
                <para class="block">I take it that the word &#34; annually &#34; means that the Commonwealth shall not have power to expend more than one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue in any one year. The Commonwealth may spend it day by day, or by monthly appropriations, or in any way it likes, but in any year the Commonwealth will not have power to expend more than its one-fourth of the net revenue of that year. </para>

                    <para>The net customs and excise revenue raised in the six federating colonies&#39; for the year 1899 was ^7,402,333. It may be taken for granted - without any guarantee- -7that the federal tariff will be framed .to bring in not less than this amount. Of this the Commonwealth would be able under this section to spend, for federal purposes, one-fourth, <inline font-style="italic">or &#163;1,850,000;</inline> an amount which exceeds the most lavish estimates of what will be required. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That passage shows that it was not anticipated that the Commonwealth would spend the whole of the one-fourth unless it was reasonably needed for Federal expenditure during the currency of the particular year. What was strongly in the minds of the framers of the Constitution was that the Commonwealth should raise enough revenue to meet the wants and necessities of the States, and not to raise more than was necessary for that, and to carry on the Commonwealth.  </para>

                        <para>- No. I am only arguing now as to what was the intention of the framers of the Constitution, and trying to draw the conclusion that it does not give the power which the Government is claiming under this Bill - that is, to place in a trust fund the unexpended balance of the one-fourth, to be used at an indefinite period, though no special, purpose is assigned at the time of appropriation. There is another feature - to my mind an objectionable feature - which is not apparent on the face of the Bill. I draw the conclusion that its operation is intended to be retrospective from the peculiar proceedings.-which have been taking place during the last few days with respect to the return to the States of the unexpended revenue for the month of May. It seems to me that the Government intended to take that money, and apply it as money owing to them for balances which have been returned during the last ten months to the States. That is, I think, altogether out of reason, and a monstrous proceeding. It is not to be wondered at that the feeling in the States on this subject is particularly acute. From anything which the Treasurer said when he introduced the Bill, could any one think that it would operate retrospectively? Whether the Constitution confers the power or not is not the only point to be considered here. The Bill will have a most important effect, especially indirectly, as I hope to show presently. </para>

                <para class="block">Whether it is constitutional or not the objections to its enactment on other grounds are so many and so weighty that I feel that it should be opposed with all&#39; our might. One objection is that a Bill like this, which is introduced at a time when the States and the Commonwealth ought to be acting harmoniously, with a view to settling the very important question of their finances, such as the taking over of the State debts, is likely to create undue friction, to instil into the minds of the State Governments a feeling of great distrust and want of confidence in the Federal Parliament, and, altogether, to do more harm than it can possibly do good. The Bill deals with such a limited sum that it cannot achieve any useful purpose, much less achieve any of its real objects. In my opinion, it has been introduced at a most inopportune time, and on that ground alone, I think that it would be a wise course to reject it. That is only one objection to it. Another point that I wish to take is revealed, when one glances at the history of the measure. It was on the 31st March last that it was introduced by the Treasurer. It is remarkable that in ever so many places in his .speech, he said that the money was required for Commonwealth purposes, such as new works in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department, harbor defence, and all that sort of thing. He did not, in any way, hint that it was wanted to pay old-age pensions. On the 20th May, when he spoke on the Additional Estimates, he stated that unless the Bill were .passed, he did not know how he was going to pay old-age pensions. On the date I mentioned, he said - </para>

                <para class="block">How is it &#34;that, in his speech on the 31st March last, he never expressed, any intention of applying this particular money to the payment of old-age pensions, and that about six weeks later, he discovered that it was the only way in which to pay them? I think that the solution of that is to be found in the fact that a few days after the Bill was introduced, and the debate on its second reading adjourned, the Labour Party held a caucus, at which they passed a resolution declaring this to be the fund out of which old-age pensions should be paid. </para>

                        <para>- I shall show that it is impossible. This change of front on the part of the honorable gentleman is not creditable to him, nor is it creditable to the Labour Party .to hold out to the people the promise of old-age pensions from this source. The people are being told that old-age pensions will be paid out of a fund in which there is no money to meet them. In the first place, we know that a sum of &#163;1,500,000 per annum will be necessary to provide a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions, and that it is estimated that at least &#163;2,000,000 will be necessary to put the Post and Telegraph Department into proper working order.  This Bill is not likely to operate after 1910, and even if, until then, &#163;500,000 per annum be paid under it into a trust fund, we shall not have sufficient to provide for the increased expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department, to say nothing of the cost of old-age pensions or naval defence. The Labour Party must be aware of this. Why should they be so eager to pass this Bill ? Is it that they require to have something special to put before the Labour Conference, which is to meet shortly at Brisbane? If it is, I am sure that the members of that Conference will quickly recognise the hollowness of their claims. It seems to me that if an Old-age Pensions Bill be passed, and there is no money in this surplus fund to pay the pensions, Parliament will have to provide the money, and, in this way, this Bill would have the result of assisting the Labour Party towards the goal of direct taxation. </para>

                        <para>- The surplus revenue will not be sufficient for that purpose. It is mere hypocrisy to tell the people that they will be paid old-age pensions out of a fund which cannot possibly be sufficient to provide for them. The cry of &#34; old-age pensions &#34; has been to the Labour Party as good  a cry as &#34;the Tariff&#34; has been to the Government. It is assumed that this Bill is not likely to operate after  1910,  when the Commonwealth will have an opportunity to adjust its finances. If the Government desire to adopt a statesmanlike attitude, they will allow this matter to stand over until that year, when the whole of our financial relations with the States- may be re-adjusted. I am sure that the adoption of that course would be favoured by the people generally, and would ultimately prove to have been in their best interests. I think that we ought to agree to the amendment moved by the honorable member for Parramatta, and determine that this Bill shall stand aside until the financial dilations of the Commonwealth and the States can be dealt with as a whole. The necessity for it is in no wise apparent, and we ought not to pass legislation merely for. the fun of the thing. I would remind the House that the Commonwealth expenditure is steadily increasing. Last year we expended  &#163;4,987,30.1,  and it is estimated that the expenditure this year will amount to  &#163;6,115,374.  Until we are able to deal at the one operation with our financial relations, with the States as a whole, we ought not to appropriate more in any one year than we actually require to expend during that year. It is far better to do that than to make inroads upon moneys that, until at least  1910,  should be returned to the States. I hope that the good sense of the House will prevail, and that the amendment will be agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- I want to take this early opportunity to repudiate that insinuation. It is an aspersion upon the  Opposition  of which the leader of the Labour Party appears to approve, although he knows, and has more than once acknowledged, that there are members on this side just as eager as he is for the adoption of a&#39; Commonwealth scheme. The question qf old-age pensions is not a party one. It is one upon which honorable members belonging&#39; to all sections of the House are  In  agreement, and, therefore, any attempt to make political capital out of this &#39; question by misrepresenting the attitude of &#34;honorable members is not going to be allowed to pass without being challenged ; and I take this early opportunity of calling attention to the grossly unfair imputations levelled at members on this side by those who well know there is no shadow of foundation for them. </para>

                        <para>- I am not at liberty to discuss that question on this Bill. The Bill itself does not propose anything in the nature of old-age pensions, and if the honorable member supports it in the belief that it does he will be mistaken. There is not a word in the Bill which relates to old-age pensions, and we have only a mere unauthoritative suggestion that any portion of the funds to be appropriated and paid into a trust account under it will be available for old-age pensions or will be appropriated for that purpose. The mere appropriation of revenue for the purpose of paying it into a trust fund will not enable even this Parliament to- pay out that money for any specific purpose without the passing of a special Act defining that purpose. Without attempting to pose as a legal authority, I doubt whether we have the power to make these appropriations unless they are to be devoted to some specified purpose. I do not think that we can say, &#34; We intend to keep all the surplus revenue, that is, the unexpended revenue, and to pay it into a trust account, to be drawn on later for some purpose not specified.&#34; Some honorable members take the view that it is necessary only to say that the money is to be applied to &#34; Commonwealth purposes,&#34; to enable it to be placed to a trust account; I think it necessary to specify those purposes, and to appropriate amounts for them, though the expenditure may not take place during the year in which the appropriation is made. Then a Bill of this kind would be useful to prevent the &#34;vote lapsing, as it would otherwise do under the Constitution. If that view be correct, the Bill will be abortive, because it will be necessary to bring down an Old-age Pensions Bill, and to appropriate the money necessary to give effect to it, before we can place to &#39;a trust account money intended to be used later on for the payment of old-age pensions. Something of that kind must have been in the mind of the Prime Minister when he gave notice of his intention to ask leave to introduce an Old-age Pensions Bill to-morrow. We are putting the cart before the horse in proposing to take money before saying what we are going to. use it for. Lay members, as well as members who have had a legal training, must do their best to understand the Constitution, and my reading of it is that Bills for specific appropriations must be passed before any part of the one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue which it is within the power of the Commonwealth to spend, can be spent, unexpended balances having to be paid month by month to the States. Section 83 of the Constitution Act provides, that &#34; no money shall be drawn from the Commonwealth except under appropriation made bv law.&#34; So it seems to me that we have no power to pay moneys into a trust account until a legal appropriation of such moneys has been made. Sections 87 and 94 seem to intend that no balance shall remain at the end of any month, moneys unexpended having to be paid to the States in addition to the three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled. That has been recognised by the practice hitherto adopted. I admit that in the very near future we shall be face to face with national responsibilities involving large expenditure, and that it is necessary to make suitable provision for these undertakings. &#34;But, since the inception of Federation, this Parliament, and the various Governments which have administered the Commonwealth Departments, have been aware that, sooner or later, additional expenditure would be necessary, and no attempt has yet been made to lay aside funds for these national schemes. The Audit Act provides for the creation of trust funds to which may be placed money appropriated for specific purposes. But whether it covers the powers now sought under this Bill or not is a point upon which there is some divergence &#39;of opinion in legal minds. If that provision was made to meet exigences of the kind which we are discussing, no- Government has taken advantage of it. No attempt has been made to provide for increased defence expenditure, old-age pensions, the payment of interest on transferred properties, or the meeting of other liabilities by the establishment of a reserve, fund under the Audit Act. What has been done is that, after the administrative needs of the Commonwealth and other authorized &#39; expenditure has been met, the unexpended balance has been paid to the States, whose administrators have come to look upon this as almost a permanent arrangement. This being so, the States Treasurers should be given due notice of any proposed alteration of the procedure. They might have been told that, after the expiration of a certain period, a different financial . arrangement must be determined on, because of the large expenditure which the Commonwealth will be called upon to make in regard to projects of a national character. They ought not to be suddenly deprived of revenue which they have been accustomed to receive. In some of the States the money paid by the Commonwealth has created large surpluses. In New South Wales the surplus last year was so large that the State Treasurer introduced legislation for the remission of taxation. Some of the stamp duties have been remitted, together with a certain proportion of income taxation, and the land tax has been transferred to the control of the municipalities and shires. &#39; The State Governments have thus voluntarily deprived themselves of certain sources of revenue, in view of the surpluses which they have been able to accumulate. Now, however, it is proposed, without any proper notice, to make a change. No doubt the change would have to be made at some time or other, but the Treasury and the Government were aware of that fact years ago; and, so far as I have been able to find out, no hint was given, until quite recently, that the States Treasurers might look forward to an  alteration in their financial relations with the Commonwealth. The Treasurer&#39;s action can result only in accentuating the friction which has arisen, mainly because of the actions of the present Government; and methods which, in the beginning, were regarded with a certain amount of amused toleration, assumed more serious aspects, and this last act has brought matters to an acute stage. There is no reason why the Commonwealth should not work amicably with the States ; and; where interests appear likely to conflict, there should be some friendly conference and an amicable understanding arrived at. We have to remember that, sooner or later, provision must be made for defence, old-age pensions, the transferred properties, Federal Capital, lights, beacons,&#39; and buoys, the Northern Territory, transcontinental railways to the West and to Port Darwin, a High. Commissioner, and Commonwealth offices in London. From a rough estimate, I &#39;gather that for these purposes there will be required at least &#163;20,000,000, but, so far, we have been asked to make provision for merely a naval expenditure under a defence policy, which, up to the present, has only been hinted at, and, later, for a scheme of old-age pensions, which it is not proposed to bring into existence for the next fourteen months. According to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, there was paid to the States, in 1906-7, a sum of &#163;7,844,840, while this year&#39;s balance represents an increase of &#163;1, 354, 986. The three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue returnable to the States will be &#163;8,722,762, and the balance in excess of the three-fourths will be &#163;427,067. This afternoon, however, the Treasurer, in reply to the right honorable member for Swan, said that the balance in excess will be &#163;472,000 - so that there is a discrepancy somewhere - and out of this balance, it is proposed, not under this but under other Bills not yet even introduced, to appropriate &#163;250,000 for defence&#39;,&#39; and&#39; &#163;222,000 for old-age pensions. How does the Treasurer propose to get the necessary money, in view of his statement this afternoon that, after the payments to the States, the Treasury was on Saturday last left empty? Old-age pensions alone will require 500,000, and &#163;222, 000 is less than a sixth of the amount required, while no account is taken of the interest on transferred properties, which will amount to, at least, &#163;350,000 and probably more. I cannot see how the Treasurer can raise this money unless he proposes to take the whole of the revenue for June from the States. That revenue is estimated at something like &#163;900,000, while the expenditure is estimated at &#163;1,078,000; so that, clearly, the Treasurer intends to make this Bill retrospective, and deprive the States of the whole of the surplus over and above the three-fourths. </para>

His  estimated revenue for June is only &#163;000,000, and his estimated expenditure &#163;1,078,000, so that on his June estimates he shows a deficit of &#163;178,000, instead of a surplus of &#163;472,000. But of course his estimated expenditure is fictitious as regards nearly half the amount. It puzzles me to know where the Treasurer proposes to get the surplus, unless it is his intention to deprive the States of the whole of the surplus revenue, to which they are entitled under the Constitution. I am sorry the Treasurer is not present, because I should have liked some information on the point. I had intended asking the question in the earlier part of the day, but, under your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I regarded myself as precluded from doing so. </para>

However, I shall not go into further details, although the honorable member for Wide Bay did so to a considerable extent in relation both to defence and old-age pensions. I did think at the time of raising a point of order, and asking whether the honorable member was entitled to traverse those proposals when addressing  himself to such a question as that now before us j but, as no notice was taken by you, sir,  1  thought that probably he was entitled to deal &#39;with these matters, and that similar latitude would be extended to other honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- I would point out to the honorable member that what is allowable is a reference to the provisions of, and probable results that would flow from the enactment of, the Surplus Revenue Bill. The question, of whether that measure, if carried, will permit of the inauguration of a scheme of Federal old-age pensions, or of the setting apart of funds for defence purposes, is well within the scope of this debate, and, therefore, I permitted the honorable member for Wide Bay to proceed. But the point to which the honorable member was addressing himself when I interposed did not relate to the Surplus Revenue Bill. It was practically a portion of the financial discussion. The honorable member was proceeding to debate how much the surplus revenue - if any   - would amount to, and how it would be divisible. That question has no connexion whatever with the Bill under consideration. </para>

                        <para>- My reason for referring to these matters was that under this Bill it is proposed to deal with something which does not exist. I referred to the divisibility of the. surplus, because the Treasurer himself had done so as his reason for introducing this measure to retain it, and what was permissible for the Treasurer to do in debate, should be equally permissible for other members who have &#39; equal right with him in this House. I desire to. show that there will be no surplus available at the end of the financial year, unless the Treasurer proposes to make the Bill retrospective, and to take &#39;back from the States the moneys which have been paid to them in excess of the three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue to which they are constitutionally entitled. That would be a most extraordinary course for him to take, and, no doubt, its constitutionality would be contested by the States in the High Court. But, assuming that he will have a surplus of ,&#163;472,000, I contend that he will not be able&#39; to use it for the purposes which he has indicated. Assuming that the value of the transferred properties is, approximately, &#163;10,000,000, the amount which would be payable to the States by way of interest at 3 J per cent., would be about &#163;350,000, and this sum would have to be paid out of the &#163;472,000 to which I have alluded. I utterly fail to see where the Treasurer will get the money with which to provide for old-age pensions and for naval defence if this obligation is to be met. From the figures I have quoted, it is obvious that, after the Commonwealth has paid interest upon the value of the transferred properties, the balance available will be so small as to be scarcely worth consideration. Indeed, when considered in relation to old-age pensions, it would be ludicrous.  It would be interesting to know how the Treasurer proposes to deal with this money. Is he empowered under the trust provisions of the Audit Act to appropriate any moneys without first obtaining parliamentary authority as to the destination of such moneys? I think not. And that is why he wants the present Bill. I can understand that these  trust moneys may have to be paid into the Treasury to meet expenditure on account of special appropriation. </para>

                        <para>- But legal men differ upon this question. When members of the legal profession are unable to give an authoritative pronouncement upon the constitutionality of this Bill, honorable members must exercise their own- judgment. If the Treasurer attempts to do what he contemplates doing, he will very probably raise some serious issues between the States and the Commonwealth. He will probably involve the Commonwealth in litigation with the &#34;States, which may lead to all kinds of unforeseen consequences. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to- me that the purpose is right, but that the method proposed to give effect to if is wrong. The proper course for the Government to have pursued would have been to bring down in a straightforward way a .Bill authorizing the payment of old-age pensions, and another to cover the requirements in connexion with naval defence. The necessary appropriation might then have been authorized by Parliament, and if. the Treasurer were advised that he had not power to pay certain money into a trust account for these purposes under the trust provisions of the Audit Act - though I think the honorable gentleman has that power under the Act - he might then&#39; have introduced this Surplus Revenue Bill, in order t&#39;o cover the payment of amounts into trust accounts for the specific purposes for which the money had been appropriated by Parliament, and in order to prevent the automatic lapsing of the unexpended votes. The Treasurer has not adopted that course, but a course which in my opinion is not&#39; a wise one. There is no mention in this Bill of any purpose to which any of these trust funds are to be applied. The Bill is a general measure dealing with funds which may be paid into trust account without mentioning specifically the purposes for which the various amounts are to be appropriated. Sub-clause 3 of clause 4 provides that - &#39; </para>

                <para class="block">I do not quite understand what is meant by the words &#34; balance of revenue over expenditure.&#34; Such a balance may not necessarily be a surplus. For instance, we may vote &#163;1,000,000 to cover the estimate of the cost of some specific work. At the end of a month, the proportion of the vote which ordinarily would have been expended, might not have been expended, as the result of some hitch in the proceedings, or from some cause or another. Apparently, under the sub-clause to which I have referred, the amount unexpended will be treated as a balance of revenue over expenditure, when, as a matter of fact, it will not be anything of the kind, but an actual liability unpaid owing to an accidental reduction in the anticipated expenditure for the month.

Under such a scheme, it is hard to say where our financial troubles will begin or end. It seems to me that the money should first be voted by Parliament before it can be appropriated to any purpose. After it has been voted and appropriated, even though it should not actually be expended, it  would be permissible, under the provisions of the Surplus Revenue Bill, to place it to the credit of a trust account for expenditure at a future time; but only for the specific purpose for which it was originally voted and appropriated. Perhaps what I. have stated as the proper course &#34;to be followed is in keeping with the intention of the Bill, although it is not made clear ; but we can thresh all these matters out more fully in Committee, if the Bill reaches that stage, when we may arrive at some better understanding of the effect of its provisions than it is possible to do from an ordinary perusal of the measure. I think that it would be wise, however, for the Treasurer to postpone the further consideration of this matter, in accordance with the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Parramatta. There is no need to proceed with it hurriedly. After al&#39; legitimate claims for the month of June have been met, we shall have no surplus with which to deal. I think that we ought to- consider the requirements of the States, and let the States Treasurers have the benefit of three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue as before, and also their proportion of- the unexpended balance after the ordinary Commonwealth requirements&#34; have been provided for out. of the remaining one-fourth of the  Customs and Excise revenue. There is no . need, in my opinion, to load up the anticipated expenditure for the month of June .by including in it the - amounts of &#163;250,000 for naval defence and &#163;222,000 for old-age pensions when that money is not intended to be expended and cannot be expended within - the month. In the circumstances, I think it is a very unfair thing to take advantage of a measure of this kind to saddle the month of June with this extraordinary expenditure. As a matter . of fact, the estimated revenue for the month is only &#163;900,000, and by including the amounts referred to, aggregating &#163;472,000, the Treasurer is enabled to make an increased estimate of expenditure for the month to the amount of &#163;1,078,000. As the &#163;472,000 is not intended to be spent during the month of June, it should not be debited , to that month. The Treasurer knows probably better than any member of the House that that money will not be spent in June, and that as a matter-of fact it will  represent an actual surplus of revenue over expenditure by the Commonwealth which in the ordinary course should be handed over to the States. If it is not a surplus made up in the way I have suggested, by taking from the States part of the three-fourths of the ordinary revenue from Customs and Excise for the month of June and retaining certain sums for the Commonwealth for alleged over-payments in connexion with monthly balances - a course of procedure which&#34; the Treasurer now describes as a simple financial adjustment - I cannot see how the Treasurer can get a surplus at all, as- the figures show none for June. I think that the present is an inopportune time for the introduction of this measure. We should wait until the States and the Commonwealth have come to some understanding concerning their financial relations. I understand that some arrangement is in progress to that end, and that something of the kind will be brought about in the near future. I think that, merely to avoid a delay df a couple of months in dealing with this matter, it is not well that we should embarrass the States and cripple their finances without warning, by leaving them in a position wholly unanticipated, either at the .beginning, or even towards the close of the financial year. They will reach the end of their financial year on the 30th June, and in my opinion it is grossly unfair, by means of a Bill of this kind, to bring about a sudden contraction of the revenue which hitherto has been -handed over to them, when in the case of some of them, at all events, the adoption of such a course will leave them in a very embarrassed position. I do not think that that :s the wish of this Parliament, and. in view of the fact that no money is going to be paid, or is provided on account of old-age pensions for the current year, nor for at least thirteen months after the present date, there can be no plea of urgency in  regard  to this proposal. Consequently, the amendment of the honorable member for Parramatta to defer the consideration of the Bill until some understanding has been arrived at by the States Treasurers in regard to their financial relations with the Commonwealth is one that ought to commend itself to the good sense of the House. </para>

                    <para>. - I quite agree with the general principles of this Bill. It seems to me that it is absolutely necessary for us to take some step to equip the Commonwealth Treasury with more funds than it has at present under, its command for national purposes. But, at. the same&#39; time, I must confess that I am disposed to indorse some of the remarks of the honorable member for Lang in regard to concentrating the re-adjustment of our finances into the final month of the financial year. I shall proceed to defend the Bill on its general principles, because I think it neither  unconstitutional  nor unfair to the States. It appears to me that those who framed the Constitution were, if anything, more concerned than we are to safeguard the interests of the several States. They came together as the representatives of the States, and were naturally imbued with ordinary business instincts iri endeavouring to secure for each State the best possible deal. We can only assume that they did secure for the States as against the Commonwealth the best possible consideration. The fact that to-day even lawyers differ as to whether the proposals now made by the Government are constitutional, goes to show that we cannot be far away from the wording of the Constitution, to say nothing of its  spirit,  in adopting such legislation. In any case, the constitutionality of the measure is a matter for determination by the High Court. This House need not concern itself to any. great extent with that phase of the  question,  seeing that the High Court is the final arbiter in matters of the kind. As to the fairness of the Bill, I do not think that we have to deal with a question which requires the exercise of that intuitive sense of right and wrong which we all possess. The fairness of the policy of the Bill is obvious on the face of it. We, as a Commonwealth Parliament, are instructed to carry out certain large undertakings. To do that, it is obviously necessary that we should have the means  wherewith to give effect to the national will. The Constitution provides that we shall have &#34;one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue to carry out Commonwealth works. There must, however, be a flaw in the wording of the Constitution as it stands, since it lays it down that if we do not spend the one-fourth, we must return the balance to the States. In other words, the Constitution provides that we can have the use of this money so long as we spend it at once. That savours, to my mind, of something in the nature of the plot of <inline font-style="italic">Brewster&#39;s Millions.</inline> It means : &#34; You can have this money so long as VOl spend it, but you cannot have it unless  you  spend the whole amount.&#34; That is quite a paradox. Some provision will, either now <inline font-style="italic">ox</inline> at a later date, have to be made, which will obviate this compulsory expenditure of the quarter of the Customs and Excise revenue retainable by the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- No matter whether the section operates, until  1910  or for a longer period, the fact remains that there are certain important undertakings involving expenditure upon which it would be, apparently, foolish for the Commonwealth to start without having more money at its disposal. To commence such undertakings requiring a large sum of money, on such a footing as the Commonwealth- is now on, would be. equivalent to starting to build a house, which was to cost  &#163;1,000,  when you had only a couple of hundred pounds to spend. We require to be equipped with the necessary capital before we undertake the larger schemes that lie ahead of us. Therefore, a provision to enable the Commonwealth to accumulate funds is imperative ; and, as I understand the position, the only way to do that is to pass a Bill which, if not exactly identical with that before us, will at least be similar to it in its main aspects. There is- a feature of this measure of which I do not quite approve, and with which I will deal directly. &#34; It seems to me that, in view of the Constitution making it illegal for us to do what it is obviously necessary, for us to do until we comply with section  93  of the Constitution - which lays it down that certain things shall be done &#34; until the Parliament otherwise provides &#39; &#39; - this Bill is necessary for the purpose of &#34; otherwise providing.&#34; In other words, it is intended to make possible the accumulation of funds in order that we may be in a .position to spend the. money which will undoubtedly have to be spent if we are to justify our -existence as a Commonwealth Parliament. So far, so good. I deprecate the attitude of many of the States in regard to our undertakings in this direction. It appears to me that the State administrators to whom I refer have not risen to the level of a national sentiment. They are more concerned about their own status and the conservation of their own dignity than they are for the accomplishment of that national policy but for which we should never have had Federation at all, and to which we must look for the justification of Federation.- I should like to point out that we, as well as the representatives of the States, are beholden to just the same public opinion. Therefore, if we fail to interpret that public opinion aright we shall have to pay for it. But by all the canons of logic it seems to me that we were sent here to conduct the affairs of the Commonwealth on certain lines, which have been indicated. I have referred to the larger questions that are awaiting settlement. I may instance an old-age pensions system, the defence system, and the formation of the nucleus of an Australian navy. If we are ever to undertake those large measures of policy, it is clear that we must&#39; provide ways and means. Some such Bill- as this, therefore, becomes a necessity. But; as I have indicated, I am opposed to certain features of it. Although section  87  of the Constitution provides that not more than one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue shall be applied to Commonwealth purposes .&#34; annually,&#34; it seems to me that the Government should not take advantage of this &#34; annual &#34; provision by now passing a Bill which will entitle them to recover - in one payment - all that they returned to the States over their three-fourths during the year - under section  93  of the Constitution - because it was not spent at the end of each month. It does not seem fair, under the proposed change, to adjust the whole of the finances for the past year in the one month of June. The Treasurer states that the amount in excess of the three-fourths that has been paid to the States totals  &#163;992,000.  The proposal of this Bill is to deduct that amount from the sum returnable in the current month. </para>

                        <para>- If the Treasurer will state how much he proposes to deduct, and whether he will distribute that reduction over a number of months, it would alter the complexion of affairs. But it is rather unfair to the States at the eleventh hour - or, to be literally correct, in the eleventh month - to say that we have paid them considerably over their three-fourths for the year, and will&#39; now adjust&#39; the year&#39;s excess by deducting from the payment for the month of June, all, or the greater portion, of the- excess which has been paid. To do so would be to make a material difference to the States, in view of the fact that they have not had sufficient intimation of the intention of the Commonwealth Government. </para>

When we analyze all that has been stated in regard to this matter, it appears to be rather ambiguous and indefinite as to whether the Bill is to be retrospective or not. Technically speaking, it is not retrospective, and the Government have stood upon that technicality. But, for all practical purposes, it is retrospective, because the States have had the excess revenue paid to them. </para>

If it has been the custom to recover in the last month of the year from the amounts due to the States the excess over the three-fourths paid to the States during the year - then there is no necessity- </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member misunderstands me. What is done is this : The money is paid over each month, but in the eleventh month it is found that we have paid a great deal too much, and that we have only a- little or perhaps none to pay over in June. Then there is a re-adjustment for the whole year. That has always taken place. </para>

                <para class="block">Bill, I want to see this nucleus formed, and I realize that without the money we cannot accomplish the work that we have been elected to do; but I wish to see that nucleus established in a legitimate, fair, open, and above-board way - a way that we can all subscribe to without hesitation. So far as I can see, in view of the fact that this has been a flourishing&#39; year, that funds have been high all round, and that the States, not expecting this termination of their revelling in wealth, have anticipated the income each month, and have spent it, we should consider them a little in regard to setting apart now our full quarter for the year. I- have no objection to the Government&#39; taking the full quarter for the past year. If they have paid some of it away, and want to recover it, they might temper that recovery somewhat to the States by distributing it over a certain&#39; number&#39; of months. I merely make- that as a suggestion. I regret that the Treasurer endeavoured to affect my attitude by indicating the loss of old-age pensions if this Bill were not&#39; carried. The Government are not so resourceless as that statement would imply. My only objection to the Bill is that it appears to be hitting the States too hard in one particular month. Surely some compromise could be effected to remove that objection, which is only a slight one in any case. </para>

That was a drastic course to take, and the reason given by the Treasurer was that he anticipated that the Bill would be passed. Even if the Bill is passed the question still remains whether it is constitutional. The Treasurer was a little previous in his action in stopping the money due to the States. Section 105 of the Constitution clearly defines the purpose to which surplus revenue is to be applied. It does not: say that it is revenue received from doubtful sources. I was wondering whether this Parliament had not already passed a Bill to deal with people who acknowledge that they have received secret rebates. Yet we find the Commonwealth Government acknowledging in this memorandum that they have been receiving rebates from steamship companies. If any private individual had made such an admission half the legal talent of Australia would have been put oh to hunt him. Tn any case, all surplus revenue up to this date has belonged to the States, and so any rebates that the &#39; Commonwealth received must have belonged to the States. Yet the Government say that one of the objects of this Bill is to annex those rebates. The rebates in this case must have been secret, because the Government acknowledge that they do not know to whom they&#39; belong. They have been returning some of them to the States on a population basis, but the very fact of receiving them appears to me to be wrong, especially for a Government who make laws forbidding other people to receive them. Section 105 of the Constitution clearly enacts that if the surplus re-  venue is not returned to the States it shall be applied to only one object - to pay interest on the States&#39; debt&#39;s. How can we take this money by Act of Parliament?  The Constitution appear? to ha.ve been specially framed to protect the States from such Bills as this. The honorable member for North Sydney was quite right on Friday in asking -  &#34; If it is constitutional to use the money, why is the Bill required?&#34; Section 87 of the Constitution clearly &#39;states that during ten years not more than . one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth. The Constitution provides that any unexpended balance is to be paid to the States every month. We have to square up every month, just as if we employed a man at &#163;1,000 a year and engaged to pay him his&#34; salary monthly. For ten years the arrangement of paying the unexpended balance to the States must continue. Section 105 provides that the surplus revenue may be applied in respect of the debts taken over -  and thereafter the interest payable in respect of the debts shall be deducted and retained from the. portions of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth  payable to the several States. </para>

It says that it can be taken to pay the interest due on the debts of the States; but, as provided in section 51, everything we do is done &#34; subject to the Constitution.&#34; That phrase seems to be the key-note of the Constitution.

                        <para>- The other day the Treasurer sent a telegram to Federal officers, telling them to stop the payment of all moneys due to the States. After he had stopped the payment of the money, he went back on his tracks, and paid it. That is not a. proper position for him to be in. A man should be sure of his ground before he says to another man, &#34;I will not pay you.&#34; That course was taken by the Treasurer in anticipation of this little Bill, which we were assured meant nothing, lt is worded so cunningly as to probably suggest nothing until an act, .such as the Treasurer performed on Friday last, gives one an inkling as to what it does mean. It is generally acknowledged, I think, that the Commonwealth is under an obligation to return to the States three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue.

                        <para>- It is neither the Danish nor the German system. The former is, I think, a very fine system. In Denmark, it is recognised that a man who has probably spent most of his life in gaol, should be specially treated when he attains the age which will entitle him to receive an old-age pension. A burglar, . for instance, is not treated so well as is a man who had led an honest life. A man who has lived a proper life, is provided with a little cottage, or home, and receives good treatment, while a man who has not led a straight life is provided for, though not in so comfortable a manner as the other. In my opinion, it is quite a simple matter to deal with this question of old-age pensions. In Australia we have from 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 persons who are earning wages. If we were to collect from the former number the small amount of 3d. per week, and supplement it with a like payment from all employers, about &#163;2,000,000 per annum would be collected. The weekly contribution would be so small that it could not hurt any one. There are many men who think nothing of slinging away a shilling or. eighteen-pence or two shillings or more on drink. If that money were properly applied to a fund such as I have suggested there would be more money available for old-age pensions than would be required, and much good would be done to humanity. In Western Australia there is a Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act, and its operation has shown to a considerable extent how we could institute a system of old-age pensions without passing this Bill. What I suggest is that an old-age pensions fund should be established and the money collected in the same manner as money is now collected in Western Australia for the workmen&#39;s compensation fund, and not by means of this Bill. I fail to see why a fund should not be created here as in Germany, Denmark, and other countries, and why all persons should not contribute thereto. One great merit it possesses is that the recipients - many of whom, perhaps, would have known better circumstances during parts of their lives - would receive the pension, not as a charity but as a right. They would realize as they contributed to the fund that by-and-by they would not receive the pension as a charity. On reference to paragraph xxiii. of section 51 it will be seen that we cannot deal legislatively with old-age pensions without also dealing with invalid pensions. The phrase in which the legislative power is couched is &#34; Invalid and old-age pensions.&#34; Any person who is incapacitated from work, no matter at what age, is just as much entitled to be looked after by the State as is any person who works until he attains the age of 60 or 70 years. I claim that the very use of the word &#34; invalid &#34; in the legislative power means that whenever we provide for old-age we must also provide for invalids. That has never been mentioned here to my knowledge. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but it would be very ridiculous. Paragraph xxm. of the section means that we are to deal in one measure with invalid and old-age pensions. It would be a cruel thing to say that any person who was incapacitated from work at 50 years of age should not receive from the Government the assistance which, if he could struggle on for ten or twenty years, he would be entitled to get. Why should not a man or a women who has been incapacitated from work at an age -earlier than that which would be fixed for the receipt of a pension be entitled to receive a benefit from this fund equally with any, person who had retained his capacity to a later age? The contributions to this fund could be collected very easily through the . medium of the Postal Department. All wages sheets, whether they covered one employe&#39; or twenty, should be stamped with a stamp. The value of the stamp could be determined by regulation, and, of course, it could be obtained at any post office. If the wages sheets were not stamped, then let the punishment fit the crime; let the punishment be such that persons would be only too glad to stamp the sheets. In a very short time the stamping of the sheets would become as easy a matter as the stamping of a letter. The money would be collected in a way which would not injure any person, and in a very brief period people would become quite accustomed to making the contribution. Practically it would be self-col leering through the agency of the Postal Department, and the sale of a few extra stamps at a post office would make no difference to its working expenses. Take a place such as Kalgoorlie, in Western Australia, where big industries are run and the bone&#39; and sinew of Australia are employed. At Kalgoorlie - there are employed at the&#39; mines thousands of men, and the time for such men to provide for their old age is when they are in their prime. I believe that the mining companies whose shares .are  largely  held in England and other places would be only too pleased to contribute to the fund if the men also contributed. In that way a fund would be created while men could spare a very few pence per week for the purpose. No one knows what . is the actual sum to be appropriated under this Bill. It seems to me to be wholly, unnecessary. The honorable member for Wide Bay has informed us, as I have said, that it is designed chiefly to provide for old-age pensions ; but I do not think that a pension fund should be provided in such a way. The system I have outlined is preferable. I advocate it more especially for the reason that, even when a workman receives compensation for injuries, the State is not relieved of the burden of supporting him should he be permanently invalided or incapacitated. We are given power to pass laws relating to &#34; invalid and old-age- pensions.&#34; The word &#34;invalid&#34; is used in the Constitution, and we must not forget that as soon as a man who has been permanently invalided has expended the amount received by him bv way of compensation, he becomes a charge upon the State. </para>

                    If we had an. Australian Provident Fund no stigma would attach to the receiving of an allowance from it. Many men who, perhaps, have worked hard, but have been unfortunate, are entitled to old-age pensions, and they would have no hesitation in drawing an allowance from a fund towards which they had contributed. The adoption of the system I have advocated would insure contributions to the fund by every man in work. A man could not be expected to contribute to it while unemployed, because he might&#39; have no means ; but if he &#39;were in work he and his employer would necessarily do so. If the fund so raised were not sufficient to meet the demands upon it, the balance would have to be made good out of the general revenue. I fail to see why every one who is earning a living should not contribute to such a fund. I doubt whether this Bill is constitutional, and certainly fail to understand why the Government are not content to exercise some&#39; of the. constitutional powers which they undoubtedly possess. For instance, we are empowered bv the Constitution to take over the control of lighthouses, lightships, beacons, and buoys.

                        <para>- Only for the construction of reproductive works. In those days, Western Australia had a very large revenue, and she should be receiving from the Commonwealth to-day interest upon transferred properties constructed, not only out of loan moneys, but with revenue.- &#39; If the Commonwealth had assumed control of lighthouses, lightships, and beacons and buoys, as well as other services which we are undoubtedly empowered to take over, and were also paying interest on the transferred properties, we should have no surplus revenue. Some of the States are expending large sums on lighthouses, and if the Government &#39;had asked us to provide for the taking over of such services, I am sure we should not have refused to grant the  neces-sary  supplies. The money to be dealt with under this Bill could well be expended on improving the lighting of our coast which, for thousands of miles, is practically unlighted. The northern part of the Australian coast is very poorly surveyed, and a great deal needs to be done in that direction. We are told that under this. Bill, an appropriation is to be made for coastal and harbor defences.; and if submarines are to be employed in the defence of Australia, elaborate coastal surveys will be necessary. .Such vessels, if intended for use in Hobson&#39;s Bay and other ports, ought to be fitted, like traction engines, with broad wheels, so that they might run along the sea-bed. They would be safer there than when only a few feet under water, for . I doubt very much whether our harbors are surveyed below. the depth required to provide a clear way for ordinary trading vessels. Only last year, in one of the channels near Queenscliff, a discovery was made of a wreck, no record of which could be found ; and it seems to me that further coastal surveys will be necessary before submarines can be safely utilized in our defence. That belief is strengthened when I recall to mind the accidents that have occurred to submarines in the more fully explored waters of France and England.  The cost of &#34;making such surveys would be more than the cost of the submarines to be constructed. </para>

                        <para>- Before expenditure is entered upon, it is necessary, first, to make up one&#39;s mind as to what is wanted, and then to obtain an estimate of what it will cost. But we are asked to appropriate an unknown amount for an unknown purpose. More information should be put before us in connexion with the Bill. At present, it would seem that if the people&#39;s money has to be spent, it can be better spent under States Administration that under that of the Commonwealth. Has there ever been in a State Department such a hopeless muddle &#39; as, according to the Cabinet Committee&#39;s  report, and the speech of the Prime Minister, has been brought about by the Postal administration of the Commonwealth? If other Commonwealth Departments are not better managed than the Department of the Postmaster-General has been, we had better improve our administration before entering upon additional responsibilities. Any fool can spend money ; but what is needed is wise expenditure. The introduction of the Surplus Revenue Bill at this stage is inopportune. The relations between the Commonwealth and the States were already strained ; when the members of the recent Premiers&#39; Conference left Melbourne, they were by no means satisfied. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, some other scheme must be evolved. The adoption of some such arrangement as I have, on former occasions, suggested, would provide a fund for the payment of old-age pensions without interfering with our present financial arrangements with the States. We should do what we can to conciliate the States. But the introduction of the Bill will make the breach wider, and it will require much more tact than the Treasurer possesses to bring the two parties, together again. The telegrams which have been recently sent to the States Treasurers have done considerable harm. </para>

                        <para>- According to official statistics, there are about 1,600,000 workers in Australia, and a contribution of a few pence per head would result in the collection of a large sum of money. The enforcement of such a contribution would provide a fund for the payment of old-age pensions without sapping the self-reliance of the community. I do not believe in taking away from people the sense of responsibility. Every worker should feel that it devolves upon him to make the best provision for the future. Great harm would be done if our people began to think, &#34; What does it matter what I do, or how I spend my money. My old age will be provided_ for by the Government.&#34; We should have&#39; an invalid and old-age pensions system - to use the words of the Constitution - but it should be on proper lines. In this matter, we might well take example from what Denmark and Germany have done. </para>

                        <para>- I am in favour of what I advocated earlier, namely, that all should contribute to an old-age pensions fund. This Bill has really been sprung upon us because of the pressure brought to bear on the Government - and very rightly, perhaps - t.o establish old-age pensions ; and I desire it to be clearly understood that I am not against any scheme &#34;to that end. I may point out that, when the question was introduced by the honorable member for Wide Bay, I was found voting with him, and, further, that, when the Budget- was under discussion, I spoke in favour of such a scheme, and suggested a means by which the necessary money could be procured. Although I believe in old-age pensions, I do not believe in this Surplus Revenue Bill as a means to that end. </para>

                    <para>.- To some extent I have been in doubt respecting this Bill, on account &#39;of the various arguments advanced against its constitutionality. So far as I understand the Constitution, the Commonwealth. Parliament, under section 81, has the ordinary general power of appropriating money, while, under section 87, it is allowed to apply only one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue to its expenditure. A system of bookkeeping was introduced for a period of seven years, and, thereafter, Parliament, under section 94 of the Constitution, is at liberty to arrange its own method for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue. There seems .to be a doubt as to the meaning of section 87, and the whole question seems to hang on the interpretation of the words &#34; applied towards &#34; - whether they mean the appropriation of the money, or the actual using of the money. </para>

                        <para>- That is the question - whether the word &#34; applied &#34; shall be accepted in the narrow sense of &#34; used &#39; &#39; or &#34; spent,&#34; or have the broader meaning of &#34; appropriated.&#34; I have been looking up the dictionary, as I notice some great constitutional lawyers are in the habit of doing on such points ; and I fail to see that there is any great&#39; difference between &#34; applied &#34; and &#34;appropriated.&#34; In the present exigencies of the Commonwealth Parliament I prefer to accept the broader interpretation, and I feel satisfied .that the Bill, under the circumstances, is constitutional. We all, of course, unanimously approve of the principle of old-age pensions, and, in my opinion, we should aim, not only at giving as full a measure of old-age pensions as we possibly can, but at divorcing such pensions altogether from charity. If. we constitutionally have the right to apply one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue towards the expenditure of the Commonwealth, then it is the duty of the Commonwealth to make use of its power in the case of it requiring money for ordinary expenditure. While we afl feel desirous to conserve the interests of the States, we must not forget that we, as the Commonwealth Parliament, have large and important duties to perform ; and one of the duties is to inaugurate a system of old-age pensions. There are other important duties, which the Commonwealth must undertake iri the immediate future ; and we must not forget that the functions of the Commonwealth Parliament are expanding and becoming more important every day. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly ; and on the other hand, the functions of the States can scarcely be regarded as expanding to a greater extent than are those of the Commonwealth. In the multiplicity of the financial schemes put forward, it is somewhat difficult, except for Ministers, to arrive at any accuracy; but, after all, the figures, as indicating the position of the Commonwealth, are merely approximations, and we are able to give only a very tentative idea of what the actual revenue and expenditure are likely to be. Assuming that the Commonwealth Customs revenue remains at about &#163;12,000,000 - although it is possible there may be a shrinkage - I see no reason why, with an increasing population,&#34; such as we may expect from a series of good seasons, and with the inauguration of large public works, such as will be involved in the taking over of the Northern Territory, and the locking of the great rivers, we should not look&#39; forward with great  hopefulness. We may also open . up large avenues of employment, by building a navy, in addition to which our ironworks have to be developed. There are various other undertakings upon which we shall have to embark, and which will provide a large measure of employment. I hope, too, that an arrangement will be arrived at between this Parliament and the various States which will permit of a large number of settlers being brought&#39; from the Old Country, and placed upon the land. If these hopes are realized - and we possess a magnificent country, an abundance of good land, plenty of water, and a climate unsurpassed in the world - we ought to have in the near future an increasing population and an expanding revenue which will provide us with the means necessary to carry out important public works of urgency. Assuming that our revenue remains at about &#163;12,000,000 per annum, and that a sum of &#163;6,500,000 - 01&#34;. &#163;500&#62;000 in excess of the amount provided under the Treasurer&#39;s scheme - is returned to the States, and that we expend &#163;1,500,000 under an old-age pensions scheme, &#39; we shall then have expended &#163;8,000,000, which will leave us with a balance of &#163;4,000,000 to be spent upon ordinary public works. </para>

I merely wish to point out. that assuming we have &#163;4,000,000 left after paying old-age pensions, and returning to the States a fixed sum of &#163;6,500,000 annually, we shall, after deducting our present expenditure based upon the Estimates for the current year, have a balance of &#163;1,703,000. As against that, we have to face a prospective expenditure of about &#163;250,000 per annum upon the Northern Territory, of &#163;50,000 upon immigration, of &#163;450,000 by way of interest and sinking fund in connexion with transferred properties ; of &#163;500,000 upon additional defence, and of &#163;30,000 upon the High Commissioner,&#39; or a total additional annual expenditure of &#163;1,280,000. </para>

                        <para>- That would leave us with about  &#163;500,000  with which to meet contingencies. It will thus be seen that if we took over the whole of the indebtedness of the States, viz.,  &#163;240,000,000  odd, we should have a deficiency of something like  &#163;2,000,000  per annum, which represents the balance over the  &#163;6,000,006,  which it would be necessary for the States t&#39;o contribute annually during the first few years after the transfer. I do not see how we can possibly carry on unless we devise some new method of paying for new buildings and of covering extra defence expenditure. At the present time we are spending over  &#163;1,000,000  annually in works and buildings, and I fail to see how we can continue to provide that amount out&#39; of revenue. We shall have to find some other means of providing it. Most nations have had to construct their defence works and build their navies out of borrowed money. I do not say that we should aim at a complete system of borrowing for defence purposes, but I certainly think that a large portion of the expenditure in that connexion will have to be raised by that means. We cannot starve the necessary developmental works of this country simply because we wish to erect buildings and construct public works out of revenue. </para>

                        <para>- There is no reason why Australia, which produces more per head than does any other country in the world, should shirk the obligation of maintaining a defence force which will protect our own shores, and also contribute to the strength of the Imperial Navy, Of course, we are as yet a young nation. We have experienced no wars calculated &#39;to inspire an intense patriotism, such as America experienced. Under the strength and benignant protection of Great Britain we have had a very easy time. We possess a magnificent heritage in the shape of a huge and fertile territory, which enjoys a splendid climate. This heritage has been bestowed upon us bv Great Britain, which has also protected us. As yet we have really done nothing to show that we, as descendants of the grand old British stock, are prepared to share in the tremendous cost of defence, which is now such a heavy burden on th British taxpayer. The time must necessarily come when we ought to bear the cost of defending ourselves, and portion of the cost of defending the Empire. The sooner we recognise that responsibility, the sooner we shall prove ourselves worthy of the stock from which we came. Under the circumstances, I shall vote for the second reading of the Bill. </para>

Section  87  provides that the Commonwealth shall return to the States three-fourths of the revenue derived from Customs and Excise, and shall retain one-fourth for the purposes of its own expenditure. Sub-section  3  of section  89  enacts that the Commonwealth shall return to each State, month by month, the balance, if any, in favour of that State, and sub-section  2  of section  93  declares - </para>

                <para class="block">That provision empowers the Government to move in the direction that is now proposed, provided that it recognises that there is sufficient reason for- so doing. I, think that this House would be unwise if it continued for a much longer period the practice which has hitherto obtained under the Constitution. The question of how the surplus is to be distributed does not arise in connexion with this Bill. That can be considered when Bills appropriating it are before honorable members. It may be used to meet innumerable charges. For instance, very few will deny that there is urgent need for a more effective defence system than that which at present obtains in respect of both inland and naval defence. More particularly is there need ford the proper equipment of our Military Forces. We occupy a very unfortunate position, in that whilst we may have men trained to the highest degree of perfection, if we were suddenly faced with any serious trouble, our equipment is so limited that we should be able to make but a very feeble and ineffective resistance. Australian defence cannot be said to be &#39;on a proper footing until we can obtain this equipment within our own borders. We want* to establish a small-arms and a cordite factory. At the present time we have to depend upon the Motherland, for our equipment and ammunition, and in times of stress  and danger that source of supply might be cut off. If so, we should occupy a very unenviable position indeed. There are other matters involving expenditure which call for attention at the hands of the . Commonwealth Parliament, and for which funds must be provided at an early date. One is the establishment of a Commonwealth system, of old-age pensions. However honorable members may differ politically, they appear to be fairly agreed that a Commonwealth system of&#39; old-age pensions is desirable, and that its establishment is a matter which this Parliament should take in hand. If there are any differences of opinion in this House on the matter, they relate to the means to be adopted for. providing the necessary funds. </para>

                        <para>- The amount referred to is worth considering in connexion with the proposals which we have in hand. One of the weaknesses of the existing system is that, should the Federal Government undertake to carry out&#39; the establishment of a small-arms factory or any&#39; work involving the expenditure of a&#34; considerable sum of money, any unexpended balance of the one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue for a particular month under the control of the Commonwealth authorities must be handed back to the States. As a result, no provision can be made from month to month to cover more than the actual amount expended in the carrying out of the Commonwealth work. I take it that this Surplus Revenue Bill is intended, not to take from the States any portion of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled under the Constitution, but to conserve for the use of the Commonwealth the full one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue, which is allotted to it under the Constitution. I do not think that any injustice to the States is proposed by the provisions of this Bill, provided that the States authorities are informed, within reasonable time,&#39; that they can no longer rely upon the return of any amount .in excess of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled under the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- I do not. Honorable members should exercise commonsense, and1 it&#39; would be most unwise for them to take any legislative step which they believed would trench upon the rights of the States under the Constitution. It is the duty of the High Court, and not of this House, to interpret the Constitution. If any person, or the authorities of any State, consider themselves aggrieved by the action of the Commonwealth Parliament in this matter, the High&#39; Court can be appealed to. We have, on the High Court Bench, the best legal and constitutional talent to be found in the Commonwealth ; and the Justices of the High Court are removed from the arena of party politics. They are charged with the duty of interpreting the Constitution in the interests of Commonwealth and States alike. But, if we had to hold our hands in the passing of legislation, because of some doubt as to our constitutional rights, where should we have been with respect to big questions which have recently been decided on appeal to the tribunal I have referred to? Recently, in my own State, in connexion with deductions made on allowances accruing to public servants of the Commonwealth, the State authorities objected to the allowances proposed, and an appeal was made to the High Court to discover the constitutional rights of the parties on the question involved.

                        <para>- This Parliament took certain action empowering the Commonwealth Treasurer to levy duties on wire netting imported by the States Governments. The State Government of New South Wales considered that they had a claim against the Commonwealth, on the ground that this Parliament had exceeded its rights in imposing the taxation complained of. Certain members of this House were prepared to support the action taken bv the State Government of New South Wales in the matter, and to make excuses for, and justify the course pursued by the State Premier. If, when that matter was before this House, we had held our hands, because of some doubt as to whether we had the right under the Constitution to impose the taxation referred to, where should we have been  to-day  ? We must take some risk in connexion with these &#39; matters. Whilst I agree with the honorable member for Wimmera that we have no right to run contrary to what is obviously the law, it seems to me that, in the particular matter now under consideration, we are entitled, under  section  94 of the Constitution, to deal in the way proposed with surplus Commonwealth revenue. We are at liberty under the .Constitution to propose other means, and a different basis from that laid down in the Constitution, for the disposal qf these monthly surpluses. I believe that the provision in this regard to be found in the Constitution was intended by the framers of the Constitution to be only a temporary provision to meet the extraordinary conditions which it was anticipated would arise at the initiation of Federation, and during the time Parliament was engaged in &#39; providing the machinery necessary for the imposition of a Tariff. It was intended that during that time surplus Commonwealth revenue should be allocated to the States in accordance with the temporary arrangement provided, by what is known as the bookkeeping system. That system has so far been followed, but we are now in a position, if we think fit, to provide other means of disposing of surplus revenue, and I do not think that the proposal submitted by the Government in this Bill is beyond the power of this Parliament under the  Constitution. </para>

                <para class="block">If I thought that this Bill went beyond our powers under that section, and trenched in any way upon the rights of the States, I should not be found supporting it. After careful consideration of the matter, I do not think that this measure is beyond the power of this Parliament to pass, and I see great reason why some change should be made which will conserve to the Commonwealth the whole of the one-fourth of Customs and Excise taxation to which it is entitled under the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- I am reminded that New South Wales gets a very large share of the revenue derived from Customs and Excise, . and has been able to remit a considerable amount of local taxation. But the trouble is that whilst Customs and Excise duties bear heavily, upon the working people, the taxation remitted by the New South Wales Government has conferred benefits upon the more well-to-do portion of the community. </para>

                        <para>- And other concessions have also been made, which have afforded no compensation to the working people who have had to contribute through Customs and Excise towards the increased revenue that &#34;the State Government of New. South Wales has received. I have before me a table compiled in the very excellent publication issued by the honorable member for Darwin, showing the amount of revenue derived from the different States from the three-fourths Customs and Excise taxation returned to them. I am not now dealing with the principles laid down in this memorandum by the honorable member for Darwin, but am simply using his statistics, because they happen to be handy ; though I . may remark that they are indentical with the statistics supplied by the Treasurer in connexion with his financial statements from time to time, and are therefore .officially correct. In one of these tables the honorable member for Darwin shows the surplus revenue paid to the several States since the inauguration of Federation. A sum of &#163;48,919,706 has been paid over by the Commonwealth, of which sum &#163;17,307,905 was paid to New South Wales, or an average of &#163;2,662,754 per annum. That sum represents the total amount returned to the State. I find that for the same period, the total three-fourths collected in all the States amounted to &#163;43,191,357, or an average 0^6,664,824 per annum. The taxpayers of my own State paid, as their share of the three-fourths Customs and Excise revenue, a sum of &#163;14,945,732, or an average for the whole period of &#163;2,299,345/ Under the old system that obtained in New South Wales prior to Federation, that State approximated nearer to the policy of free-trade than did perhaps any other self-governing State in the Empire, and certainly more nearly than did any other State in Australia. The total annual revenue of New South Wales from Customs and Excise did not amount to more than ,&#163;1,500,000 during . the period prior to Federation &#39; in which the free-trade policy obtained. These figures shows that during the Federation period New South Wales has -practically doubled her taxation under this heading. She has received during that period between &#163;8,000,000 and &#163;10,000,000 over and above what she would have received from these sources had she not entered into Federation. I will undertake to say. judging from&#39; my knowledge - and I was  seven years in the politics of my State before I came to the Federal Parliament - that no State Treasurer would have dared to impose upon the people of New South Wales taxation equivalent to that which has. been imposed upon that State by the Commonwealth authorities. The State authorities have not only been relieved from the odium - and it is a very considerable odium - of the imposition, of taxation in a State which is largely dominated by free-trade sentiments, but the State Treasurer has had the benefit and pleasure of . spending the large revenue placed in his hands by the Commonwealth. According to some&#34; criticisms in the State Parliament that revenue has been far from wisely spent. </para>

We are not able to give a final interpretation of the constitutional powers which we possess. We simply endeavour to exercise our authority under the Constitution. If we out-step our bounds that constitutional authority will just as readily tell us so as it will tell the States Governments when they are in the wrong. I do not suppose that the right honorable member for Swan would, in a matter of doubt, say that this House- must not legislate because some one stated on the floor of the House that he questioned our constitutional right so to legislate.  </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the reason why the matter has not been settled does not lie so much at the door of the Commonwealth authorities as with the States. Therefore, the States have no legitimate ground for objecting with respect to the non-determination of our obligations regarding .those debts. But the great, point is that the States have received all that they were entitled to get under the Braddon section, plus a considerable portion of the one-fourth that the Commonwealth was entitled to&#39; use for Commonwealth purposes under the same section. I find from another table in the paper published by the honorable member for Darwin, that during the period of Commonwealth authority a refund of &#163;5&#62;728,349 has been made to the States, representing a portion of the one-fourth revenue derived from &#39;Customs and Excise which the Commonwealth was entitled to hold; and that the average payments amount to &#163;881,284 per annum. So that the States have received from the three-fourths a sum of  ,&#163;43,191,357,  and have also received a good share of the one-fourth. Turning to my own State, I find that during that period New South Wales has received &#163;2,362,163 over and above the three-fourths to which she was entitled. In other words, she Has been receiving on an average &#163;363,409 per annum more than she was entitled to receive under the terms of the Constitution. Some States have not been so favorably situated in the distribution of the. surplus as have others, and none so f  favorably  as New South Wales. In at least two of the years during this period the payment to Queensland has fallen below her three-fourths, but for the total period she has received &#163;61,59.9 of the one-fourth that rightly belonged to the Commonwealth, while Tasmania&#39;s receipts from this source have been &#163;58,795. The payment of surplus revenue to none of the other States approaches the large sum received by New South Wales, but I notice that the very strongest objection to the use by the Commonwealth Government of any of this  money  comes not from the States that have received the least benefits, but principally from those that have received the most, and most of all from the &#39; particular State that has gained the greatest advantage under this section pf the Constitution. Ever since the Commonwealth was inaugurated, the effort of the Federal Government appears to have been to meet the States as handsomely as possible with respect to these payments, and, instead of asserting their rights, the Federal authorities have given way when pressed on many point&#39;s. The result has been that instead of the States being placated, and viewing this matter in a more reasonable light, some of them have apparently come to regard the. Commonwealth as a taxing machine  which exists purely for their benefit. They consider that, the Commonwealth should not arm itself with any administrative powers, and that its  expenditure  should be as limited as possible, while the amount of income derived by it from taxation and returned to the States should be the maximum. Consequently, the Commonwealth Governments have been placed in a most unfair position. Their members have had to bear the odium of imposing taxation, and have been subjected &#177;0 severe criticism at the hands of States Treasurers and States Governments generally, while at the same .time those Treasurers and other States authorities have been pressing the Federal authority to provide for and return to them the maximum amount of revenue that they could raise. This has introduced a most vicious principle into the relationship of the Commonwealth to the States, and the sooner a better understanding is arrived at the better it will be for all concerned. I was one of those who took part in the campaign in my own State in connexion with the acceptance of the Constitution. In the Bill originally submitted,, provision was made- that the Braddon section, which secured to the States three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, should be a , permanent feature of the Constitution, or endure until such time as it could be altered by an amendment of the Constitution, which is not easy to accomplish. I, with others, regarded that as laying down an unsound principle in the relationship of the States and the Commonwealth. I placed that view before the electors, arid asked for the rejection of the first Bill. As a result of that campaign, the Constitution was re-cast, and the Braddon section, which was described in New South Wales as the &#34; Braddon blot &#34; now operates only for a period of ten years from the inauguration of the Commonwealth, after which it is open to the Commonwealth. Parliament to decide how the revenue shall be disposed of. Of course, we have not reached that stage yet. The Braddon section still remains- a principle of the Constitution, and it . is not proposed in this Bill to touch in any way the three-fourths returnable to the States. The Bill deals exclusively with the one-fourth that the Constitution allocates to the Commonwealth Treasurer for Commonwealth purposes. </para>

                        <para>- I did not hear that statement made, but we cannot deal with that phase of the question until the Braddon section expires. When it does, I hope that the members of this; Parliament at that time will be wise enough to devise some scheme that will place the Commonwealth and States or* a better footing, so that the States will not be in the position into which they have drifted, and! which they seem to regard as their legitimate right, of making the Commonwealth a mere taxing machine for their own particular benefit, and to suit their own particular purposes, enabling them to remit direct taxation, and escape the penalties that must come to every Treasurer and every Parliament that imposes taxation. At the same time, if there were any Federal surplus, I should not tolerate anything in the nature of extravagance. It is the one taxpayer that has to find the money, and he, as a rule, has not too &#39;deep a pocket. Taxation often means encroaching very seriously on his margin of living. It . is the duty of this Parliament, as well as of the States Parliaments, to see that taxation for revenue purposes is not too heavy, and that the money drawn from the taxpayer is expended in the best interests of Australia as a whole. </para>

                        <para>- No. There is a wise economy, and an unwise economy. The latter is the kind that dries up the functions of government by unreasonable savings, such as the present Treasurer was disposed to make in the case of postal expenditure within the last twelve months. However, as a celebrated writer would say, &#34; That is. another story,&#34; and the telling of it will keep for another occasion. It is the same taxpayer that will suffer by unreasonable expenditure, or benefit by reasonable expenditure. We have to appeal to that taxpayer for our justification, hot only for imposing taxation, but for spending the money so obtained. What I am pleading for is a reasonable arrangement, whereby the authority that&#39; has. to impose the taxation shall have the right, as far as possible, to direct its expenditure, and the authority that expends it shall be under the obligation of justifying that expenditure by going to the taxpayer, and asking for the money to meet it. Whilst that is so, however, I recognise that as things are there must be a considerable surplus over and above what may be determined as the legitimate requirements of the Federal Government&#39;, and that that surplus should be distributed amongst the States on a fair and equitable basis. </para>

However, there is the undoubted fact that the States Treasurers who have benefited the least by Federal taxation - even those who have suffered by it - have not been the severe and unreasoning critics of Federal management that some of the other Treasurers who have benefited most, notably those of New South Wales, have been.

                        <para>- My objection to that is that, whilst the Customs, taxation presses upon every man in the  community, and most severely upon the poorest, because everything they eat and wear is taxed by that means, the remission, of taxation by the States has benefited only the wealthiest section of the community, and the poorer sections have received no adequate compensation. As a great proportion of the revenue derived by the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and Excise comes out of the pockets of the poor toilers, they are entitled in return to special consideration in its expenditure. For that reason, I. should like to see as much of the money as possible allocated towards the provision of old-age pensions. There are in the Commonwealth large numbers of men and women who have done the hard pioneering work to make the country habitable, and who, like most pioneers, have received most inadequate rewards. A large section of the community have been- . unable, through no fault of their own, to make provision for the- time when they cannot support themselves. How could they be expected to do so under the conditions of a wage . system which regards &#163;2 a week as a handsome remuneration for a labouring man?&#39; He is expected to provide a home, to pay a high rent, and to dress, feed, and educate his children. When he has met all those calls, he is not left with much to make provision for old age. And after he has done the work of his life, and is overtaken by old age, the only relief that is afforded&#39; to him in any of the States is that he is housed in an asylum under conditions which certainly, in verv many respects, are not a credit to our civilization. We want to improve that state of affairs, and I am glad  to know that some States, notably Victoria and New South Wales, have moved in that direction. While Victoria made a promise of doing something very substantial and handsome, I regret to say, from the information I have received here, that its old-age pension has been largely degraded to a pauper&#39;s dole, and is not what it ought to be, and what those who advocate a system of this character think that it should be. New South Wales instituted a system of old-age pensions. I am glad to say that I had the privilege of being in its Legislative Assembly at the time when the Bill was introduced, and was one of those who helped to place that humanitarian legislation on the statute-book. I well remember that when practically everybody had become favorable to the principle, a great number of honorable members saw so many difficulties in the way of ils accomplishment - that is in the matter of finance and all that kind of thing- - that at one time the outlook seemed to be almost hopeless ; but at last the measure was enacted. . It is one of those humanitarian pieces of legislation of which my State can well afford to be proud. True it is, that a little time ago, there, was thought to be a need for retrenchment, and one of the first things to be retrenched was the old-age pensions system. A number of men and women were suddenly confronted with a number of technical questions, and if they could not answer them to the letter, their names were removed from the list. In that way, a great number of unfortunate persons who were good citizens lost their pensions. At one time, a Bill was submitted for the. purpose of altering the basis of that legislation, and making it more difficult to get a pension; but, fortunately, it was not passed. I am glad to say that the humanitarian feeling in my  State has now found expression in another direction, and that recently a measure has been passed to provide for invalids, who were not provided for under the Old-age Pensions Act. In New South Wales we have a provision for aged people, a provision for invalids, and a kind of insurance provision for miners, who meet with death or injury&#39; from accidents while prosecuting their avocation. I am pleased to know that with respect to this humanitarian legislation my State takes the lead in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- In New South Wales, the administration of the law is watched so closely that very few, if any, undeserving persons get a benefit thereunder. I know - and it is impossible that it should be otherwise - that there are numbers of persons whose cases are not met by the law, but who are just as deserving as those who derive a benefit therefrom. It requires a residence of twenty-five years in the State. There have come under my notice cases where native-born New South Welshmen, in reduced circumstances, who, &#39; as miners had travelled over the length and breadth of Australia in pursuit of their avocation, were debarred from getting a pension because they could not show a con1tinuous residence of twenty -five years in the State. A similar provision, I understand, also obtains in Victoria. That is one great reason why a Commonwealth measure is  absolutely necessary to meet Australian conditions. All .that the applicants will be asked will be whether they have lived the specified time in the Commonwealth. We shall not ask whether they have lived in New South Wales, or Western Australia, or Victoria, or Queensland. We shall cease to know the State boundaries, which at present play an important part in the administration of State legislation. That is one of the great reasons why the whole community- -even in New South Wales and Victoria as well as the other States - are desirous of seeing a system of Federal old-age pensions established. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs&#39;</inline> excellent compilation, it is estimated that on the basis of the New South Wales pension we shall be required to provide for about 168,000 or 170,000 persons, and that the sum necessary to meet their cases and the cost of administering the fund will range from &#163;1,500,000 to &#163;1,600,000 per annum. I, for one, feel so &#39;strongly that the system is a good and &#39; desirable one that I want to see it made a part of the policy of the Commonwealth as speedily as possible, and for that reason I am prepared, to assist the Government in testing whether this Parliament can now appropriate for the purpose a certain sum out of the one-fourth share of the Customs  and Excise revenue to which the Commonwealth is entitled under the Constitution. I know that if. it is not constitutional to appropriate the money for that purpose there are other purposes - notably, in providing for efficient defence - in which it could be used, and used in the best interests of the Commonwealth. I wish to impress upon the House- that, inasmuch as Customs and Excise duties fall so very heavily upon the&#34;&#34; toiling masses, they are entitled to receive some benefit, and I know of no way in which a benefit can be better bestowed than by means of an old-age pension. The Government have nothing to thank me for with respect to their legislation. So far as I possibly could I endeavoured to reduce the taxation on a very large number of Tariff items, but it has been levied, and I appeal to the Government to consider the advisableness of allocating .the revenue in the direction which I have indicated. I noticed that, in a recent interview with the Sydney newspapers, the honorable member for East Sydney indicated that the opposition to the present Tariff was not nearly so effective as the opposition to the preceding Tariff. He said that the reason was that, on a previous occasion,, there was a solid, compact body against the imposition of high duties on the general taxpayer; but that, in the present House, at least one-half of the men who sat on the Opposition side were strong protectionists, and that a portion of the other half were moderate protectionists. The free-trade section which dealt with the Tariff in this session was a very small and ineffective body. The only persons who are responsible for that state of things, however, are the leaders of the Opposition. They decided to stand down from the position which they occupied in a previous Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, sir. I want to- show that, inasmuch as&#39; the Opposition stood down from the position which they had previously taken up, and, to  a certain extent, assisted the Government&#39; in imposing .duties, and inasmuch as the taxation comes out of the pockets of the working people, the Opposition should be prepared to come forward and &#39;assist the Government to pass a humanitarian measure, which will enable them to confer some benefit upon a large section of the community which has to pay this taxation, and which does not derive any benefit from the remission of State direct taxation. On that occasion the right honorable member for East Sydney described the Opposition as a &#34;broken-backed Opposition.&#34; So far as the Tariff is concerned, it was a broken-backed Opposition, and I think that it will remain so for a long time, unless its tactics are altered. I trust, however; that, whilst it may be truthfully described as a broken-backed Opposition on the fiscal question-, it is not so on the question of old-age pensions, and that when a reasonable measure is submitted, even though it should come from the Government side, it will receive fair consideration at their hands. .If it only receives the same amount of consideration at their hands as the late Tariff did, I am quite satisfied that it will be enacted in a very short time. </para>

                        <para>- I . do not want to read the extract in&#39; which the leader of the Opposition sets out the position ; but I may mention the honorable member . for . East Sydney had1 stated that of the thirty-one members of the Opposition fifteen were staunch protectionists, that only twelve could be describee?&#39; as free-traders, and that he had described the Opposition, on the Tariff, as a &#34;broken-backed Opposition.&#34; I also said that it was solely responsible for that state of things, . because, if he had so pleased, it could have been as solid as it was in the first Parliament. I hope that it is not broken-backed on the question of passing humanitarian&#39; legislation such as providing pensions for the aged and the invalid. </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with the suggestion of the honorable member for Fremantle that the fund for those purposes should be raised by means of a weekly contribution from persons. That plan has been tried in other countries,, but it has not proved to be very satisfactory. We have -in our community many who would like&#39; to avail themselves of a sound system of Government assurance. Having carefully considered the matter, I  arrived at the conclusion that the only way in which I could make provision for my wife and family in the event of my being cut off was by means of assurance ; but I had to take out a policy with a private company. I have no guarantee that we may not have in Australia a repetition of. the crisis which took place in the United States of America two or three years ago, when the insurance companies were shaken to their very foundations. The establishment of a Commonwealth assurance system, with the Government behind it, would enable men who desired to make provision for their families to contribute to a fund for that purpose, with the certain knowledge that their efforts would not be fruitless. In conclusion, I have only to say that I think this Bill is called for. It was the intention of the framers of the Constitution that its financial provisions should be merely a stop gap. They were designed in the first place only to cover the- period prior to the imposition of Customs and Excise taxation by the Commonwealth, but it was determined eventually that they should bridge over the period covered by the bookkeeping section. That period has expired, and it is now open to this Parliament to legislate &#39; in a way that will be fair to the finances of the Commonwealth and the States. I do not think that this is an unreasonable proposal, and I shall therefore support it. As for its constitutional aspect, I have to confess that I am not a constitutional authority. It is well known, however, that this House is not the interpreter of the Constitution. Another authority has that obligation cast upon it, and if any State considers that the Commonwealth Parliament has exceeded its constitutional powers, it may obtain the decision of that tribunal. If this Parliament exceeds its rights, it must bow to that authority just as the States or any private individual must do. That being so, so long as any legislation proposed by the Government appears to be reasonably within the constitutional powers of this Parliament, I do- not think that the States can complain of injustice, or that they are being deprived of any right. </para>

                    <para>. - It was not my intention to speak to this motion, but the debate has been somewhat protracted, and I think it necessary to offer a few observations on the Bill, if only to make my position clear to my constituents. I leave the constitutional aspect of this question to those who have had a legal training, feeling sure that the Government satisfied themselves before introducing this measure that it was . within the constitutional powers of the Parliament to pass. That is sufficient for me. I desire the inauguration of a Federal system of old-age pensions, and think that- we have a splendid opportunity to secure it by voting our surplus revenue to a fund for such a purpose. No candidate for parliamentary honours would dare to announce his opposition to an old-age pensions scheme, but we find many who profess to favour it offering objections whenever an opportunity presents itself to secure the consummation of their wishes. The right honorable member for Swan has told us that we&#39; are prepared to support this Bill - apart altogether from the question of its desirableness - on the sole ground that it would lead to the passing of a beneficent measure. There are times when even honorable members who do not &#39;belong to the Labour Party favour the passing of beneficent legislation, and we look to them to help us when the opportunity offers to secure the inauguration of a Federal&#39; system of old-age pensions. It is singular that in connexion with almost every Bill providing for an appropriation we hear, some honorable members complain that we are proposing: to take away money from the States. As a member of the Federal Parliament, I consider that I am just as much a representative of the States as I am of the Commonwealth. I care not what method is adopted to provide for old-age pensions so long as we are not called upon to pay twice for them. One would imagine from the observations of some honorable members that the_ people of the States are not Commonwealth electors. </para>

                        <para>- It is for the House to determine that question. While it is the duty of the Opposition to see that proposed legislation is likely to be beneficial to the people, I doubt whether a carping opposition is essential to good government. I do not think that the practice of raising objections to every Government proposal, merely because it is a Government proposal, is conducive to sound legislation. I hope that we shall have, without delay, a Federal system of old-age pensions.&#39; New South Wales has a fairly good system, and although it is not what it ought to be, it is certainly better than that in operation in Victoria. My desire as a Victorian is that the system in force here shall give way to a better one. We have to remember that we represent not one State, but the people of the whole Commonwealth. We have been told, <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> told truly, that a chain- is only as strong as its weakest link, and just as the States have had to unite to secure an adequate system of defence, so we must have a Federal system of old-age pensions if the wants of the people are to be satisfied. But if the people of some of the States are worse off than those of the others, the interests of the whole Commonwealth are affected. Although we inhabit a continent, there is no such thing as provincialism in Australia. In Great Britain one countryman hardly understands the dialect of another living but a short distance away, but from Tasmania to Queensland and right across to Western Australia, there is only one language spoken. This is because our people are so largely migratory. Many of them have lived in more than one State, and there is always a considerable movement of population from State to State. Therefore, the authorities of the States should give the Commonwealth every assistance to the consummation of the grandly benevolent idea embodied in the Constitution of providing old-age pensions for the whole of Australia. It may be that the Governments of Queensland and Tasmania do not see their way to provide pensions for the people of their States. They may say, &#34; We should like to pay old-age pensions, but we cannot yet find the money.&#34; </para>

Do we ask our Judges to contribute so much a week towards their . pensions, or do we talk of charity being given to them because they receive pensions for which they have not paid? Decidedly not. Their pensions are given for services rendered to the State. </para>

                        <para>- I have been interested in friendly societies for twenty-four or twenty-five years, and know that, notwithstanding that the members of those societies obtain direct and almost immediate benefits for their contributions, they often become unfinancial because they are out of work, or have suffered misfortune, or have to move from one place to another. Similarly, working people will find it impossible to keep up contributions to an old-age pensions fund. Besides, if every one is to be compelled to contribute to such a fund, Parliament might as well appropriate the necessary money, and raise it by taxation. The honorable member for Wimmera, like others, harped on the fact that people should make -provision for a rainy day. But in the early nineties, many persons who thought that they had done so, and were  living under happy sheltered conditions, suddenly found their savings swept away, and their independence gone, because inflated values had suddenly collapsed. .What occurred in that financial crisis may occur again. Whatever provision one may have made for his old age, he cannot be sure that it will suffice. It has been suggested that the Commonwealth should provide pensions, not only for- the indigent aged, but also for helpless invalids. In Australia, many callings, such as mining, expose the workers to great hardship, so that men are virtually used up while still young. We shall, however, do a great deal if at the present time we&#39; can provide a Commonwealth old-age pensions system by means- of this Bill. I ask those who wish for the establishment of such a system not to look for holes in the measure, by the enlarging of which they can ruin it ; not to insist on its unconstitutionality, but to assist us in achieving our ends by constitutional means. </para>

                        <para>- No. The intention of the framers of the Constitution was that the Commonwealth should establish an old-age pensions system, and they knew that for that money would be necessary. At present, three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue has to go to the States, leaving one-fourth for Commonwealth purposes. Of course, it- was anticipated that at first the Commonwealth would have surpluses. It was well known .that as time went on many services would have to be taken over by the Commonwealth, and that they could not be administered without money. I have no doubt that the people of Australia - not the petty individuals known as the States Premiers and Cabinets, who evidently desire to oppose everything proposed by the Federal Parliament - will uphold the proposal to provide old-age pensions out of the surplus revenue. </para>

                        <para>- The day is yet young, and we are supposed to do a &#39; certain amount of work when we are compelled to sit. The Federal Convention inserted section 87 in&#39; the Constitution with a foresight that does not appear to be shared by the statesmen of to-day. It was probably in the minds of those who suggested and supported that section that, in the future, there might be such a Commonwealth Treasurer in power as we have to-day, and that it was absolutely necessary to have some safeguards. I regard the Bill as both unnecessary and unwise. It is unwise because it can operate only for a period of one year, seeing that in 19 10 section 87 ceases to be of any value, and that we then, so to speak, come into possession of the whole of the revenue from Customs and Excise, pending some arrangement with the States in regard to surpluses&#39; and unexpended balances. Tt is the sort of measure that I do not think the Prime Minister would have sanctioned  in the early days of Federation. At the Convention the intention was, I believe, that all unexpended balances should be returned to the States at the earliest possible moment ; and, therefore, it seems to me the greatest folly on the part of the Government or any party to attempt to bring about old-age pensions by such means as are proposed. Such telegrams as those sent out by the Treasurer can simply have the effect of stirring up strife and widening the breach between the Commonwealth and the States. It may be, however, that members of the Labour Party would prefer to see the breach widened, and, instead of Federation, a unification - that they would prefer to see the powers of the Commonwealth increased, and those of the States decreased. </para>

                        <para>- But, at the same time, I think the desire of members of the Labour Party are in the direction I have indicated, although the idea of the Federal Convention was that Commonwealth and States each had their own work, and that Federation, and not unification, was desired. It is dangerous and unfortunate that this policy should have been adopted suddenly. When the Premiers, after the late Conference, left Melbourne, they had no idea that they would, on the 28th May, be informed by telegram that the surplus was not to be paid over. </para>

                        <para>- If it had not been for the incidence of Federation, the bill would not have been footed, or possibly something might have happened similar to what happened in Victoria. In this State, after the system had been inaugurated by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir GeorgeTurner,</inline> the bill had to be footed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Peacock, and he footed it so badly that one year there was a deficit of &#163;900,000. Both in New South Wales and Victoria, in consequence of a system of . old-age pensions having been introduced without&#39; proper supervision, the bill had to be footed by somebody else. I thoroughly agree that it is desirable to establish a Federal old-age pensions system. Under the systems operative in New South Wales and Victoria, a great many deserving persons are left out in the cold. There is -no doubt that it is our duty at the earliest possible moment to give effect&#39; to a Federal scheme. </para>

                        <para>- I put it first. But I say that we must provide the means with which to pay those pensions honestly. I do not think that the method proposed to be adopted under this Bill is either honest or fair t&#39;o the States. Up to the present time they have been receiving surplus revenue from&#34; the Commonwealth, and they should continue to do so until the Commonwealth has no surplus to pay over. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member&#39;s interjection- is so long that at this hour of the evening I am not able to grasp it. Of our full one-fourth of the net revenue from Customs and Excise there will soon be nothing left over and above our actual expenditure. In 1910 - unless a different arrangement be made in the interim- this Parliament will acquire full control over the Customs and Excise revenue. &#39; If we then adopt the reckless policy foreshadowed by the Treasurer, it will not be long before there&#39; will be no surplus revenue to hand over to the States. We shall have mopped up the lot. </para>

I think that the Treasurer is making a somewhat similar mistake, and that, attributing the prosperity of Australia to his Tariff, he is forgetting Providence, and the good seasons, which fortunately have been experienced in the greater part of the Commonwealth. In answering to-day a question put to him. by the honorable member for Swan, the Treasurer said that he intended to charge against the June balances  &#163;250,000  for naval defence, and  &#163;2 22&#34;, 000  for the purpose of providing a trust fund for the payment of old-age pensions. </para>

                        <para>- To show the futility of the provision proposed for old-age pensions, I mav say that in the excellent report presented by the Royal Commission that inquired into the establishment of a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions, it was stated that the amount required annually for the purpose would be  &#163;1,506,000.  It will be admitted that  &#163;222,000  is a very small amount when compared with what we are given to understand will be required to finance a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions. The proposal to set aside  &#163;250,000  for naval defence, is one which should not be agreed to by this House until it has been given an opportunity to say whether it will approve of the Government&#39;s scheme of naval defence. We have never so far considered any scheme, and we have, therefore, no right to appropriate the amount referred to, nor has the Treasurer any right to say that&#39; that amount should be taken from the June surplus revenue. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Kennedy cannot assert that this is a Bill to find the money for old-age pensions. It is a Bill in which the Treasurer is trying to crimp moneys, which ought, in the ordinary course, to be paid over to the States. The honorable member must be well aware that the Treasurer has stated that he intends to keep back  &#163;250,000  for naval defence from the June balances. Does the honorable member approve of that? The Treasurer also intends to withhold  &#163;222,000  as a trust fund for old-age pensions. </para>

                        <para>- That was their warning, and it was altogether too sudden. The Treasurer was applying the guillotine, and it was a very improper thing to do. In my opinion, the proposal to withhold , &#163;472,000 of the June balances is altogether wrong, and no precedent for it can be found in the management of the finances of the States or of the Old Country. As the Treasurer knows quite well, it has always been the custom to pay unexpended balances into the Consolidated Revenue. </para>

                        <para>- In this case, the Treasurer  does not propose to pay debts with the money he intends to retain. We know that not one penny piece of the &#163;250,000  proposed  to be retained for  naval  expenditure, or of the &#163;222,000 to be reserved for  aid-age pensions,  will be  spent in  June. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than if we could afford to expend the whole amount of , &#163;1,500,000 for the payment of old-age pensions from the 1st June. In view of the fact that it is not possible for this money to be spent in June, I believe that this Bill is unwise, and that it will create further friction between the States and the Commonwealth. I am opposed to it as being unwise, unnecessary, and undesirable, and as proposing the commencement of a system of finance which may lead us into very considerable difficulties in the future. I warn the Treasurer and the House that the condition of our finances and the reckless manner in which we are proceeding with regard to them, will sooner or later lead us into very great danger if not into actual trouble. </para>

                        <para>- True Federation is achieved when we have an equitable arrangement between the States and the Federal Government. Although when I first entered this Parliament I was called a quack I have long ago forgiven the honorable member who used that term, and I appeal to the House as to whether I have not always taken a broad view of questions which have been brought before us for consideration. I have fought, not for my own State alone, but for all the States ; and not for a section of the people, but for all the people. I am doing the same now, but I say that it is our bounden duty to deal honestly and -fairly with- the States as well as with the people of Australia, as a whole. </para>

                    <para>. - When this Bill was formerly under consideration in Committee, the honorable member for Corio raised the question- that clause 3 ought to be so amended as to protect a member publishing a document which he had received from the Government Printer. Generally speaking, the Bill protects the Government Printer in respect of the publication of a document which has been laid upon the table of either House of the Legislature; and clause 4 protects those who publish in good faith for the  1  information of the public, copies of, or extracts from, parliamentary papers. The honorable member for Corio considered ; that provision should be made so that a member of Parliament, for instance, who  I  receives a copy of a report issued by the i Government Printer, under authority of either House, and who is asked by a con- &#93; stituent for a copy, shall be protected in supplying it. A somewhat similar provision is contained in the English Act. I promised to have clause 3 amended so as to effect the honorable member&#39;s desire. I have circulated amendments which are intended to effect that object. The first . amendment would make subsection 1 of clause 3 read that no action shall lie against a person &#34; for &#39; &#39; publishing any document published under the authority &#34; of the Senate or House of Representatives. An amendment to that effect will extend the protection afforded by &#34;the clause to any person who publishes documents which have been previously published under the authority of the Houses of the Legislature.

The present difficulty is that there is no method prescribed by any Statute of our own for summoning witnesses, enforcing their obedience, or punishing those who have been guilty of disobedience. The Committee that has already reported to this House has recommended the passage of a Bill of this description. The Bill has been several times  before the Senate, and was finally recommended by a: Select Committee of that Chamber iri this form. </para>

                    <para>.  - We have not had time to examine the Bill carefully, but from the little attention I have given to it it appears to be the most drastic piece of legislation that we have ever had before us. I do not know why a person escaping from custody should get two years&#39; imprisonment. Where is the necessity for such severe&#39; punishment? It shocks me to think that a person refusing to answer a question may get two years&#39; imprisonment. I suppose these offenders are to be tried by a jury, and that this Bill is not like that other Bill to be submitted to us in a day or two, under which a Judge without a jury can send a man to gaol for several&#39; years. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that the penalty should be reduced from two years&#39; to one year&#39;s imprisonment. If any person tries to prevent justice from being meted out or contumaciously refuses to give evidence, or to  allow  a person to give evidence, a year&#39;s imprisonment is not too much. I am not one of those who believe in very high penalties; but we must make this penalty high enough to meet a case of the most factious or contumacious resistance of the law. I trust that there will be no need for the infliction of any high penalties; but we should take the power to compel what is called cheerful obedience to the law. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the amendment will be rejected. It seems to me that we are hardly qualified to make a definite pronouncement detract-&#39; king from a proposal formulated by a dulyqualified&#39; legal practitioner. So far as my logic guides me, it seems to me to be necessary to do something more than provide against any one taking an active part in preventing the Court from arriving at the truth. If we omitted the words proposed to be-left out, we should merely have a provision against some active effort to prevent the attendance of a. witness. The offence then punishable under the clause would be some definite action taken to avert the course of justice. The word &#34; omission &#34; is necessary to cover passive resistance. </para>

There are occasions when an employe&#39; has an engagement to do important work, and would forfeit something very considerable by attending the Court.&#39; In such circumstances, he must have the protection of a clause like this, which would compel his employer to give him the necessary permission to appear before the Court. This is a question of draftsmanship rather than of legislation. A man might be so placed that, without the protection of a provision of this kind, he would suffer serious loss. I hope that the clause will be agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- If that is the rule, there can be no harm in making it clear in the clause that a mere act of inadvertence will not involve the person concerned in a penalty, although that act of inadvertence may lead to a witness failing to attend before the Court. I hope that the Attorney-General, if he will not agree to leave out these words, will qualify them in such a way as to make the meaning of the clause clear. </para>
