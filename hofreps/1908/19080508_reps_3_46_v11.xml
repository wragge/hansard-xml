                            <para>- I was not aware that the Treasury officials "riddled" the scheme put forward by the honorable member for Mernda. I think that his scheme represents ari attempt to do something which is very difficult, and to do it fairly. The Government scheme is largely, based upon that which was put forward by the honorable member. It embodies a few variations, but, personally, I give the honorable member for Mernda every credit for the work which he has performed. I go further, and, on behalf of the Government, thank him for doing all that he possibly could to assist them in the settlement of this most intricate question. </para>

                        <para>- With reference to the statement made by the Treasurer yesterday, afterwards withdrawn, that an American Trust, known as the Standard Oil Company, had acquired am improper influence over honorable members in connexion with an item in the Tariff relating to kerosene - the statement  arising out of something said by the Minister of Trade and Customs to the Treasurer, which, though not intended for publication, was made public, to the effect that a' certain decision of the Committee in connexion with the item would be a victory for the trust - whereupon the Committee decided ro postpone the further consideration of the item, and with reference also to the fact that direct charges of the bribery and corruption qf members bv the company in connexion with this item, previously made by persons outside, were thereby revived, I ask the Treasurer, as representing the Prime Minister - whom I know to be unavoidably absent - whether he will take into his immediate consideration ' the desirability of making either independently or by means of the joint Committee appointed by Parliament, as a result of the direct charges, an investigation into the truth of the allegations? The dominating desire in my mind is. not to bring about the punishment of persons who have made statements reflecting on Parliament, but to give an opportunity to them to justify what they have published, and, if they cannot do so, to allow the character of Parliament to be cleared of the aspersions. </para>

                            <para>- Unless the House itself wants an investigation into the matter, I do not think it of sufficient importance to justify any action. As for the rumours which the right honorable gentleman says were revived, I understand that their investigation has been referred to a Joint Committee. I do not think that I shall see the Prime Minister before Monday, but I shall consult him about the other matter when I meet him, and if he thinks that what transpired yesterday is of sufficient importance to be referred to the Joint Committee, or to be inquired into in any other way, I shall agree to that course- Personally, I am strongly of the opinion that a mountain has been made of a molehill. No imputation of any kind was intended last night. </para>

                        <para>But they must blame themselves that their motives have been misinterpreted in certain circles. It has always been in their power to crush the evil flow of slander at its source by denying the professional lobbyists, of whom they have good reason to complain, access to the precincts of Parliament. By postponing this course until it has been practically thrust upon them they have clone Parliament an ill turn, and at the same time they have very badly served all semi or insincere protectionists. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> very sensibly remarked last night, those gentlemen will now be placed in a most unfortunate position should they register their votes in favour of the foreign Trust which is trying so hard to destroy the Australian industry. </para>

                            <para>- The most important part of the honorable member's question is the last part, in which he expresses a desire that this Parliament should be made perpetual. Perhaps there is something in that suggestion which is worthy of consideration. The point involved in his suggestion is whether it is right that any individual should be allowed to advocate attacks on private property. I can understand the honorable member's anxiety upon that score. But I am not aware that the statement in question had reference to an attempt to take property from any individual. It appears to have been a statement made on behalf of property and interests generally. The existing law sufficiently enables the authorities to deal with any individual who attempts to lead attacks on property. </para>

In the answer he gave to a question which I put to him the other day, the Minister stated that the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> was specifically mentioned in the instruction which  I  quoted, because the question was first raised in connexion with that journal.

It has been suggested - and with a good deal of force that the duty which has been requested upon oregon  -  namely,1s. per 100 superficial feet - is too high, and I have been considering whether some of the timber included in the paragraph under consideration should not be made dutiable at that rate, whilst the softer woods - especially oregon - should be admitted at  6d.  per 100 super. feet. </para>

                        <para>- In the north. An abundance of it can be obtained in Queensland. If those concerned choose to turn their attention to the matter, there is plenty of timber suitable for butter-boxes to be found in the Commonwealth. A deputation from Queensland recently waited upon me in reference to this matter, and I requested them to put their views in writing. They did so, and they informed me that the opposition to the duty upon this class of timber really emanated from the importers, who are making very heavy profits indeed. They declared that whenever any proposal is made to supply timber for butter-boxes from Northern Queensland, the importers kill it by quoting the price at which the imported article can be obtained. When I asked why the statement had been made, that it was impossible to place an order for between£2,000 and £5,000 worth of this timber their reply  was  that there was plenty available if those requiring it were prepared to pay a reasonable price. I am not so much concerned about the request with respect to the duty  on  butter-box timber as I am about that relating to the duty on oregon, because, according to the honorable member for Barrier, oregon, which is not produced here, is absolutely necessary for use in mines. I differ from the honorable  member,  but recognise that he has a better knowledge of what is required in the mines of Broken Hill than I have. I should think that hardwood would be suitable for them, but I do not set my information against the statement of experts, that  Oregon  is preferred because it is light, and  warns  miners of approaching danger by " talking." </para>

                        <para>- In that case the duty will be the same as that on1-inch stuff. On timber of less than of an inch in thickness  the  full rate in respect of timber 1 inch in thickness must be paid, because  it is  not necessary to introduce such sizes. I have taken into  consideration,  as far as possible, the information supplied to me by the trade. It is pointed  out that  to stop at timber½-inch thick would be to penalize users of weatherboards,. Weatherboards are slightly less than ½-inch thick, and unless we adopted this rule importers will be required to pay duty upon them on a basis different from that adopted in other parts of the world. Those who deliberately send in timber less than j| inch in thickness must pay on it the full duty on timber of not more than <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> inch nor less than g inch in thickness. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to occupy the attention of the Committee for more than a few minutes, because some honorable members are more conversant than I am with the details of the timber trade. I am pleased that the Ministry, to some extent, have recognised the extreme character of the suggestion made by the Senate in respect of an item on which we made a great fight in this House. It seems inconceivable that senators should make a suggestion which will hit an industry with exports representing between  ^26,000,000  and  ^27,000,000  of our total exports, in favour of manufactured exports representing about  ,£2,750,000.  While desirous to encourage the manufactures of the Commonwealth, the Senate has displayed a lamentable lack of the sense of proportion in striking at an industry on which most of the other industries rest, in favour of one which shows such a small proportion of our total exports. On the question of measurement, I merely wish to draw attention to the effect of the suggested alteration in the definition, and I am surprised that the Ministry, when they recognise that the Senate is wrong, do not revert to the original decision of the House of Representatives. There is always some matter of substance underlying these verbal alterations ; and I remind honorable members that the original definition which appears to be the standard definition, was. inserted after ample consideration.  I do not intend to go into details as to the operation of the proposed duties, but shall simply state, on information supplied to me, that in one case the duty will be increased by  14  per cent., in another case  3v  33  1-3  per cent., in another by  58  per cent., in another by  86  per cent., in another by  100  per cent., and in a fifth by <inline font-style="italic">j 66</inline> per cent. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that matter as I proceed. The Treasurer made some reference to the steps taken by the Queensland Government to open up certain timber country, and I may inform honorable members that last session the State Parliament passed Bills for the following railways with that object in view :  - Caboolture to Woodford North Coast, 17 miles and 60 chains at a cost of £86,874 ; the Atherton extension of 31 miles and 14 chains, at the cost of £195,689 Kannungar to Blackbutt, Brisbane Valley, 28 miles and 29 chains, at a cost of , £170,842, or a total of 77 miles and 23 chains, at an estimated cost of£453,405. It is remarkable that while only two men have come to Melbourne to represent the interests of Queensland in this connexion, scores of local importers have been going about this building, whenever the timber duties have been under consideration. </para>

At any rate, Australian timber was spoken of in contemptuous terms, and we were informed by importers that it was most unsuitable and dangerous for the making of butter-boxes. But, after all, what does a duty of1s. per 100 feet mean ? </para>

                        <para>- What does a duty of 1s . mean? In my opinion, it is not even a reasonable revenue duty, and might very readily be granted in the case of an industry native of the soil. . I have every sympathy, as I said before, with the representations made regarding the suitability of oregon for mining purposes. But, while oregon may be particularly suitable for use in the Barrier mines, I contend that there are Australian timbers equally serviceable for the purpose. I have- the greatest authority for saying that, weight for weight, though not bulk for bulk, Australian hardwoods are stronger than Oregon, thus giving, protection in the mine, with equal ease in handling. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but I do not desire to confuse the two issues. The strong argument against Australian timber was that it is heavier to handle in the mines. We  get  tired of debating questions of this kind, but I am strongly of the opinion that there is an absolute prejudice against Australian timber. I go so far as to say that importers in Melbourne find it to their interest to quote prices for imported timber in their lists, while, as to Australian timber, no definite figures can be obtained from them. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to ask protectionists this question. Before they impose a protective duty must they demand that the article to be protected must be supplied in sufficient quantity to every one wanting it ? There is nothing more tricky than that. To demand that the producers of an article shall, before a protective duty to foster an industry is imposed, be in a position to supply every one  that  requires the article simultaneously and immediately is an absurdity. </para>

Protectionist sawmillers here are not content with getting logs free. They want the timber cut up not only into large sizes but also  into  lengths one quarter-inch and one half-inch thick, planed and dressed in the cheapest labour countries in the world, and yet they call themselves protectionists. </para>

                        <para>- Speaking generally, I think that ironbark would be dearer wood, but not very much dearer than oregon. When we recall the fact that our forests  are  being destroyed, and that no use is being made of our native timbers, surely a  national Parliament ought to consider whether it should not give a protectionist duty equal to what I call a revenue duty, and the honorable member for Parkes, who is an out-and-out free-trader, has described 15 per cent. as a fair revenue duty. My complaint is that a Parliament which calls itself protectionist will not give to one of our native industries any protection, not even to the extent of a revenue duty, while it will give a high revenue duty in respect of articles which cannot be produced here. Undoubtedly our forests are a national asset. My complaint is not that they are being destroyed, but that we are not making use of the timber as they are being destroyed. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the destruction of national wealth which might be used in commerce, giving employment to our own people, and also assisting the men who are on the land. Has it never occurred to honorable members that while we are talking about immigration, and making it easy for people to settle on the land, it is an anomaly, that valuable trees should have to be destroyed. That is, I think, an important point to be ' considered. Every honorable member who comes from the Northern State must know that some of the most valuable timber in the world is sacrificed so that the selector may get a bit of land cleared. His timber is valueless to him. I have seen logs hauled to the edge of selections in the Kingroyd and Nanango districts, worth each, and sold . for 5 shillings. </para>

                        <para>- These letters are handy. Most of the timber merchants want picked pieces. So long as it is to the interest of the importers to make it difficult for the market to be supplied they will embarrass the local industry. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It is only fair that I should now examine the position. The Treasurer has indicated what he proposes to do regarding the definition of sizes, superficies, and so on. Why should we encourage the importation of boards, cut and dressed, under 1 inch, while we are prepared to allow the logs to come in free, and also to admit squared pieces in large sizes free, or at a very low' duty ? What justification is there for us to make it easy for people to import from foreign countries timber cut up' into thicknesses of½ inch and inch ? Why should not the work of cutting the timber into boards be done here? It has been stated that the employers and the employes in Melbourne are agreed on this point. </para>

                <para>Some time ago a deputation, representing operatives employed in the timber trade of Brisbane and surrounding districts, waited upon the Government, and asked them to permit you to make representations on our behalf in Melbourne, with a view to maintaining the Tariff on foreign timber as at first proposed. In this request we had the cordial support of alt workers engaged in the timber industry in Queensland, numbering, with their families, between 40,000 and 50,000 persons, including sawmill hands, fellers, teamsters, labourers, and others. The first announcement of the Tariff created a great impulse in our industry, and we saw for the first time a prospect of being able to earn a good living, without having to contend against the crushing competition of cheap labour in Sweden, Norway, and Siberia. </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe that the honorable member for Lang is capable of feeling any attack at all. He is a very industrious member of the Committee, but, with all due respect to him, he is so cocksure about everything, that it is very seldom that any argument brought forward has any influence upon him. I, of course, intend no reflection on the honorable member. I like to hear him express his views ; they are frequently very interesting, and sometimes helpful. The point I make is that there is a combination between employers and employes in the saw-milling and timber-importing industry in Melbourne, and they have issued a joint statement of what they desire, which, in my opinion, reflects upon the intelligence  of  members of this Committee. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Melbourne Ports need not get excited. The joint statement to which I have referred was handed to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sutch</inline> himself, and he contended that the course proposed in it was the most desirable one  to adopt. He is a representative employ engaged in the industry, and a labour man, like the honorable member for Melbourne Ports and myself. I took very great interest in what he said, and gave due weight to it, but when I find, in the joint statement of employers and employes, a scale of duties proposed, which is entirely in the interests of city saw-millers and timber importers, it is about time that I spoke out in no uncertain fashion. I want to say that the duties proposed in connexion with the timber industry are the lowest duties which have been submitted in the Tariff for the assistance of any native industry. We have imposed protective duties on butter, jam. cheese, condensed milk, currants, hops, and on almost everything but timber, which, it cannot be denied, is one of the most valuable native products of Australia. Every assistance is given to industries carried on in the cities and towns, but the farmers and timber-getters of the Commonwealth are apparently too far away from the centre of Government to exercise any influence upon members of Parliament. . </para>

                        <para>- No, I said that 40,000 persons are concerned in the progress of the industry in that State. If any proposal were made which would render it difficult for city saw-millers to keep up the rates of wages of saw-mill employes we should' hear something about it very soon. But what about the men who are out in the forests felling the trees, and doing pioneering work in the making of roads in different parts of the country, and thus preparing the way for the settlers of whom we hear so much ? Apparently these men are to be given no encouragement. </para>

Under existing conditions the settler in many parts of the Commonwealth must cut down the timber on his land before he can utilize it, and he is compelled to burn it, because, owing to the importations of timber from abroad, he cannot find a market for it. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so; but I am speaking of what I know takes place in Queensland, and I believe that in other States valuable timber is wasted in the same way. Real natural wealth in the shape of valuable timber is being destroyed. I do not pose as an expert, but I believe that in Australia we have a greater variety of. valuable timbers than is to be found even in the United States, and unless efforts are made in some way to conserve our timbers we shall some day regret our neglect. I shall not go into the question of afforestation, but no one will deny that it is necessary that some effective steps should be taken to conserve our natural timbers. I appeal to honorable members to accept the request of the Senate. The Treasurer has proposed a modification of the Senate's request, and it is highly probable that his object will be defeated. If he is under an impression that honorable members opposed to duties on timber will assist him to carry any one of his proposals he is more innocent than I take him to be. In connexion with no other duties has so great a determination been expressed to keep them down to the lowest possible rate. Honorable members opposed to timber duties succeeded in reducing the duties at first proposed to the lowest possible rate, and in my opinion they were wrong in doing so.I believe that another place has more correctly interpreted public opinion in the Commonwealth in connexion with these duties than we have done in this House. Surely the duties suggested by the Senate are low enough ? There is not one that can be said to be more than a reasonable revenue duty. There is certainly not one that can be described as a protective duty, or is likely to have any protective effect which will afford the assistance to which those engaged in the pioneering of this industry are entitled. </para>

                        <para>- There is no more reason why the matters dealt with in the various paragraphs of this item should be arranged in the way they have been than might be advanced for a similar arrangement of items 314, "Buggy shafts bent but not dressed ; " 315, " Buggy shafts bent and dressed;" 316, "Shafts n.e.i. in the  rough; 317, "Shafts n.e.i. dressed;" 318, "Bent poles, rough;" 319, "Bent poles, dressed ; " 320, "Whiffle-tree bars," and 321, " Shaft bars." All these are given separate numbers, whereas under the item timber, the various kinds of timber dealt with are included, not in items having separate numbers, but in paragraphs in alphabetical order under one item, and there are so many of them that the whole alphabet has been used, and a portion of it repeated to number them all. In my opinion it is not competent for the Committee to deal with a portion of an item which is not affected by a request of the Senate. I think that you have laid that down already in dealing with item 170. I speak from memory as to the particular item on which such a ruling was given, but I know that you have laid it down that where the duty alone is proposed to be amended by a request from the Senate we can deal only with that, and that we cannot deal with the wording of an item unless the Senate has requested some amendment of it. I believe that all that we can do in this case is to decide whether the duty shall be1s. or any modification of1s. from one penny upwards. </para>

                    <para>- The Treasurer was quite in order in moving the modification he has moved. The ruling which I gave some time since, and to which the right honorable member refers, was given in connexion with a request from the Senate which did not affect the wording of an item, and where any alteration of the wording proposed would have involved the insertion of a. new item. In similar circumstances the Treasurer would not be in order in submitting the modification he has now proposed, but it will be seen that whilst the Treasurer believes that certain timber included in this item should be dutiable at1s., certain other timber included in it should, he proposes, be dutiable at only <inline font-style="italic">6d.</inline> per 100 superficial feet. The Minister is prepared to agree in part with the amendment requested by the Senate, but is not prepared to agree to it wholly. </para>

                        <para>- No, the Treasurer has moved a new sub-item for the convenience of the Committee in dealing with the matter. Whilst he desires that some timber shall be dutiable at1s., he desires that oregon timber, 12 x 6, or its equivalent, shall be dutiable at only 6d. per 100 superficial feet. Honorable members will see that that is clearly a modification of the Senate's requested amendment, which the Treasurer is quite entitled to propose. </para>

If it' is competent for the Treasurer to move that it be dutiable at 6d. per  100  superficial feet, is it competent for any other member of the Committee to move that it be admitted free of duty? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, that would be in accord with the course I have followed throughout in order that the Committee might be given an opportunity to deal with the duties in whatever way it desired, taking the lowest duty proposed, first. That is why I have insisted from the beginning that the modifications shall be dealt with separately. If the modification now proposed is dealt with, it will be quite competent for the honorable member, if it is not carried, to move a further modication if he so desires. Or it would be competent, if that is not carried, to move a further modification that the duty requested by the Senate be omitted. That would leave the duty as it first stood. </para>

                        <para>- It is not through a ring, but through the natural increase of cost of the timbers which are supplying the market. They are becoming more difficult to obtain, and it requires more expense to put them free on board ship. </para>

                        <para>- No, it is simply that, as is being experienced a little in Queensland now, timber which may be cheaply produced when near the facilities for shipment, becomes dearer as you have to go back into the forest longer distances. </para>

If the others are making large profits, whether as the result of a ring or anything else, the Queenslanders have their markets made, and. can make their profit's. There is a larger demand for Queensland timbers than can be supplied. </para>

That is the fact, and an honorable member who has perhaps the . largest experience of the butter trade in this House can verify it. </para>

                        <para>- If there is a penny or twopence per 100 feet profit to be made, will they not order the timber that will pay them best? Of course they will. The real object of this little proposal is to absolutely shut out from these markets all the cheap small cuts that are used for packing cases, and also butter-box timber, and retain that market entirely for Queensland timber. What might follow? Queensland might say to the southern States, " All right, we have our market secured now. You will have to come to us. We are not going to sell you any large stuff to put' into your mills, but will do the sawing and dressing in our own State. You will have to take the small stuff from us. We will employ the Queensland mills and you can close down." </para>

                        <para>- I do not. In fact, I urged fourteen or fifteen years ago in a State House that instead of talking so much about timber importation, we ought to be growing the timber and making importations unnecessary. There is for Queensland timber as large a market as Queensland can supply. One honorable member spoke about the competition of cheap labour. New Zealand is Queensland's nearest competitor. Is that a cheap labour country ? Are its forests anymore accessible than those of Queensland ? </para>

                        <para>- We are not asking that timber should be made free. All the competing timbers are getting dearer every year, and it is only a question of a comparatively short time when there will be no competition from New Zealand at all. The timber of Queensland will become an increasingly valuable asset. At present there is a profitable outlet for Queensland timber, which will not decrease, but will increase. The profit obtained by the millers upon it now is considerably less than will be obtained in the future, as the competing timber becomes dearer and dearer. Why, then, should a duty be imposed which will seriously affect other Australian industries? We have many industries that have to spend a considerable amount of money on timber. The use of hardwoods for purposes for which softwoods are usually used is practically prohibited by the nature of the timber. Hardwood is infinitely ' better for certain purposes than soft wood; but for other purposes soft woods must be used even though it has to be obtained at a higher price. As to the proposed measurement which will affect this duty, the interpretation given by the Treasurer to the term " superficial foot " was a most extraordinary one. Now he has changed it, and has made it if anything more extraordinary still. Is the Treasurer under the impression that his amendment will affect-inch stuff? </para>

                        <para>- And anything below will pay at actual measurement. Now I point out the curious effect of this proposal. First of all, it will affect only a very small portion of the imports. It will have no real effect for the Minister's purpose, because the quantity of timber that comes in under inch is comparatively small. But it will double the duty on  ½-inch  stuff. Here is the peculiarity of the position. A-inch board will pay as if it were1 inch, but a¼-inch board will pay only on¼ inch thickness, or one-fourth of an inch. So that the position is this: We say, " the difference we have allowed hitherto for smaller sizes is not sufficient. We must double and treble it, because some labour is put into the timber outside Australia. When we come to the smaller sizes of all, upon which, if anything, there is more labour, we will let that in at its actual measurement." </para>

                        <para>- In the case of-inch boards, the charge will be nearly 3s. per 100 instead of1s. There is a serious aspect of this case that has not been regarded. The nearest competitor of Queensland timber is New Zealand. The honorable member for Wide Bay cannot say that cheap labour is employed in that country. He cannot say that the Queenslanders have not the same advantages that the New Zealanders have. He cannot say that larger profits, are being made on these imported timbers in consequence of the low wages paid. It is all a question of supply. The honorable member for Wide Bay knows perfectly well why it is more economical to cut where the logs are obtained. A saving of waste is effected. There are certain off-cuts that are practically useless, and that it is not necessary to send to market. There is a saving of freight. The Prime Minister of New Zealand has stated that, if Australia penalizes the people of the Dominion for doing on the spot cutting which it is usual to do at the source of supply, they will put an export duty on logs. </para>

                        <para>- We should be influenced by the fact that, if New Zealand places an export duty on logs, the timber which our industries need will be more costly.. Besides, it is proposed that we should make a special attack on the New Zealand industry, our duties being so arranged as to compel the dressing of timber to be done here, whereas, for economical reasons, it should be done where the logs are cut. The leader of the Labour Party has stated that the duty was agreed to elsewhere as a reason why it should be agreed to here. But what are the circumstances? A compromise was made by the Treasurer in regard to this duty. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I admit that the compromise does not bind individual members of the Committee; but Ministers should consider themselves bound by it. The rate agreed upon here was voted for by a considerable majority, whereas in the Senate divisions there was in one case a majority of only three, in another of two, in another of one, and finally a tie. </para>

                        <para>- Not when the timber is sold by the superficial foot. Under the Minister's proposal, boards over    inch in thickness will pay as if 1 inch in thickness, whereas boards¼ inch in thickness will have to pay only as¼-inch boards. The duty is not being increased on boards of a thickness of less than inch, but it is being doubled, and nearly trebled, on thicker boards. If it is intended to place an excessively heavy duty on such boards, let it be done directly. The original definition of "superficial foot" is universally accepted, while the Minister's definition is contrary to the usage and custom of the timber trade in all English-speaking communities. The Minister might as well insert in the Tariff a provision saying that, for the purpose of these duties, a gallon shall mean a quart, a ton 15 cwt., or a yard 2 feet 6 inches. He is increasing rates by a clumsy and improper method. We should adhere to the standards of weight, measure, and capacity which are in universal use. It is ridiculous to so alter the definition of "superficial foot" that a board inch in thickness will be dutiable as if it were an inch thick, allowing a¼-inch board, which is almost the same thing, to be dutiable as a¼- inch board. </para>

                        <para>- That being so, the intention must be, by a side wind, to make dutiable, as if it were 1 inch thick, practically all timber under 1 inch which is imported. If it is desired to increase the duty on such timber, why not provide for that directly, instead of by altering a definition which has been accepted by the Customs Department ever since Federation? If a higher duty is desired, let it be proposed and carried - if a sufficient number of members are in favour of its imposition - but the alteration of a wellunderstood definition of measurement should not be agreed to. </para>

                    <para>.- Whatever may be done with a view to encouraging the timber industry, I think that we should deal specially with that part of the request which relates to Oregon - a timber of vast importance to the mining industry. Those who requested a university professor to make certain tests with a view of determining whether Australian hardwood is stronger than Oregon, apparently know nothing about the conditions under which oregon is used in the mines of Broken Hill, and the professor's reply indicates on his part an entire want of knowledge of those conditions. Every one knows that Australian hardwood has a greater bearing strain than soft woods wherever grown. Reference has been made <inline font-style="italic">\o</inline> the question of weight, but that is only one of a number of considerations to be taken into account. Those who have been underground at Broken Hill will know that the peculiarity of the square sets used there requires the employment of timbers of certain sizes, which will so fit as to avoid danger of their slipping when pressure is applied to them. Timbers 10 in. x 10 in. have to be fitted on top of uprights of the same size. The professor who was appealed to gave the breaking strain of a. beam 6 inches in depth, and evidently proceeded to make his tests on the assumption that such beams are laid horizontally, and that it is when they are in that position that pressure is  brought  to bear upon them. In the first' place, the question to be considered is not the weight which a beam laid horizontally will carry, but the pressure that it will bear end ways. The tests made by the university professor may be at once dismissed as having no value from the point of view of the relative strength of hardwood . and oregon! when used as in the Broken Hill mines. In order to ascertain the relative strength of these timbers for mining purposes, he should have taken the downright pressure end ways. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The honorable member for Wide Bay is aware that hard wood does not crush as soft wood does. The fact that Oregon, instead of snapping suddenly, crushes, rnakes it a safe timber to use at Broken Hill. Hardwood of the same weight would be liable to split and collapse without- any warning. I have known hardwood in a . mine to split so suddenly that all the lights underground have been extinguished. It will stand a strain  up  to a certain point and will then snap- Oregon, however, gradually crushes. </para>

                        <para>- The conditions may not be similar. It is an advantage to use timber that will give way gradually instead of suddenly collapsing, and that is why  Oregon  is employed in the mines at Broken Hill. The university professor's replies to the letters addressed to him on this subject do not really touch the main question; they have no regard to the conditions under which  Oregon  is employed in the Broken Hill mines. But for an arrangement having been made when the item was before us on a. previous occasion, I am satisfied that a majority of the Committee would have voted that oregon for mining purposes should be free. Those who favoured a protective duty recognised that the vast quantity of oregon used in the mines does not come into competition with. Australian timbers. In regard to the item generally it is remarkable that notwithstanding the higher rates of wages paid in the industry here Australian timber can be sold abroad in competition with timber from other parts' of the world. It is so highly appreciated elsewhere that notwithstanding freightage charges and the higher rates of wages prevailing in the timber industry here, people insist upon being supplied with it. We have not vet realized the value of our forests, and it is, to say the least, singular that so many contradictory statements on the part of timber getters and timber users, such as builders, should be made. It has been said that supplies of timber from Queensland cannot be obtained in the southern States. The reply of the sawmillers in the north is that 'they are merely asked to supply picked sizes, and that if timber merchants down here placed all their orders with them, they would have no difficulty in securing what they wanted. Then again, some timbers are brought here from distant countries for less than it costs to convey similar timbers from Queensland to the southern States. It is also said that there is a big timber combine, and it seems to me that there are many matters into which we shall have to inquire when the new protection proposals are before us. I should like to suggest to the Treasurer the desirableness of considering whether it would not be wise to impose varying rates of duty in respect of certain timbers rather than to alter the old definition of surface measurement. If he insists upon the insertion of a special definition, let us have no minimum. I desire to support the local timber industry, but having regard to the facts I have mentioned, I am prepared to support a proposal that oregon be free. </para>

                    <para>.- I have listened very carefully to the arguments which have been advanced in connexion with the duties upon timber, and I fail to see any reason why we should depart from the decisions at which we deliberately arrived upon a former occasion. The question was then exhaustively debated, and the final determination of the Committee was a compromise between the various sections of this House. It was one of the few unanimous compromises which have been arrived at during the consideration of the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- That statement is correct. Upon the timber required for the mining, fruit-growing, and butter industries the duties would have been entirely removed had if not been for the desire of some honorable members to arrange a compromise. That compromise having been arranged deliberately, we ought not lightly to depart from it. I think that throughout the consideration of this Tariff my attitude has been in favour of encouraging local industries. I quite admit that if there be an industry in our midst which has a reasonable chance of supplying our timber requirements, it ought to be encouraged and developed. But it has not been shown that there is any reasonable prospect of our requirements in that connexion being met by supplies from our own forests. Under these circumstances, the duty requested by the Senate would be merely a revenue duty upon an item upon which no duty should be imposed. It is needless for me to recapitulate the many uses to which timber can be put. All our industries are practically dependent upon a supply of timber of various kinds. It is one. of. the raw materials in our productive industries, and in the absence of any reasonable prospects of our requirements being met by local supplies, it should undoubtedly be admitted at the lowest possible duty. There appears to be a special reason why oregon, which is particularly adapted for use in connexion with mining operations, should be either subjected to a very low duty, or admitted  free. The same remark is applicable to New Zealand white pine, which is used for butter-boxes. I am not prepared to say that almost as effective an argument cannot be advanced in support of the admission upon similar terms of other timber, such as baltic pine, which is used so largely for weatherboards. I have taken the trouble to calculate what the duty requested by the Senate would mean to the butter industry alone. I have carefully read all the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission in this connexion, and the only conclusion at which I can arrive from the testimony of Queensland witnesses is that butter-boxes made from white pine in Queensland cannot be supplied at as low a cost as can butter-boxes manufactured from New Zealand pine. Some of these witnesses estimate that butter-boxes manufactured from Queensland white pine would cost from1½d. to 2d. each more than would boxes manufactured from New Zealand white pine. If we assume that the difference between the price of the two articles is 2d. per box, the proposal under consideration would mean taxing the great dairying industry of the Commonwealth to the extent of , £10,000 annually. Now, we all know that our dairymen have to compete in the markets of the world. They have to compete against the inhabitants of Denmark, who are very much closer to their market, and consequently every penny of taxation that we place upon this industry means subjecting our dairymen to increased disabilities. In the absence of any reasonable chance of a sufficient supply of timber for butter-boxes from Queensland, it is the duty of this Committee to encourage our export trade to the extent of admitting this particular class of timber at as low a rate as. possible. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt special occasions will arise when butter will be imported into Australia. But our production of that commodity is so great that as a rule the duty upon it will not be operative. All the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission goes to show, that Queensland is unable to supply the requirements of Australia in the matter of timber for butter-boxes, and that there is no reasonable chance of an enormous expansion in the butter-box industry, in the near future. For many years there has been a duty levied upon this class of timber. </para>

In 1906 we imported' timber valued at £1,632,000, and only £344,000 worth was produced locally. Only about one-fifth of the total timber used in Australia is produced in the Commonwealth. How can the remaining four-fifths be made up merely by tapping one or two forests in the way that has been indicated ? </para>

                        <para>- I have looked very carefully through the evidence tendered by the Queensland Conservator of Forests to the Tariff Commission, and he merely declares that there is a certain quantity of timber in that State, distributed over 600,000 or 700,000 square miles without defining any large, compact forests which, can be easily tapped by railway. </para>

                        <para>- Then the evidence of the Queensland Conservator of Forests is not satisfactory. If it could be shown that there was a reasonable chance of Queensland being able to supply the needs of the Commonwealth in the matter of timber for butter-boxes, I should vote for the imposition of a duty upon it. But most of our Australian timbers are hardwood, whereas most of the timbers used in connexion with building operations, the mining industry, and our export trade axe soft wood. I am very doubtful whether there is a great desire on the part of the timber merchants of Queensland to capture the butter-box trade. The pine of that State is regarded as being of too good a quality to warrant its use for butter-boxes. </para>

                    <para>.-The Treasurer led the Committee, to believe that he proposed to give a concession by admitting timber of 1 inch and inch measurement at the same rate, and timber under ⅜ inch, at a proportionate rate. Perhaps the honorable gentleman is not aware that not much soft wood is imported under inch. One-inch boards are used for shelving, flooring, &amp;c, and inch for match lining, stop beads, &amp;c. Some red wood of a similar size is imported, but very little. Veneers go down to as small as1/16-inch, but according to the suggestion of the Senate, these boards would pay exactly the same rate as 1 -inch boards. This would be severely felt by people who, for instance, engage in. piano manufacture, and I believe that a firm has arranged to start this industry, and has invested in some very expensive plant. We have had a long speech from the honorable member for Wide Bay in defence of Queensland timber; but I think that that gentleman, perhaps unintentionally, misled the Committee into the belief that there <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> an unwillingness on the part of timber merchants to sell it. I happen to number a few timber merchants amongst my acquaintances, and I am informed by not one, but several, that they cannot obtain Queensland timber - that they cannot get their orders fulfilled promptly, and have to keep their customers waiting an unreasonable length of time. Those merchants are willing to take every foot of Queensland timber that can be supplied, principally for use in building purposes; and in this connexion I should like to read an extract from a letter written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Langdon,</inline> of Messrs. Langdon and Langdon, one of the largest firms in Sydney - </para>

                    <para>With regard to the duty on New Zealand timber of1s. per 100 feet super. as suggested, we fail to see any necessity whatever for this, as we do not consider that "New Zealand timber of any description enters into competition to any very serious extent with any timber which is grown in the Commonwealth. We know, however, that the Queensland people are anxious to put the highest possible duty upon kauri, as they consider that this class of timber competes very strongly with the Queensland hoop pine, but we can assure you that the Sydney merchants can take as much Queensland pine as the merchants there can send along, and at a price which should be exceedingly remunerative so far as they are concerned. </para>

                        <para>- There is no other logical inference to be drawn from the honorable member's interjection. I only want to emphasize the fact that one of the most reputable firms' in Sydney writing on behalf of not only themselves, but other merchants, tell us distinctly that they are willing to take all the Queensland pine they can get at a reasonable price; and one which would be very remunerative to the suppliers. They are willing to take all the Queensland pine, notwithstanding the fact that the price of it has considerably increased during the past two years. But in spite of their desire to fulfil the orders of their customers, they cannot get a supply. That is not my complaint but theirs. With regard to baltic timber, it is not used to any extent in any houses of a good class. It is used mostly in the poorer class of houses for people who cannot afford to pay for the higher class of timber. Baltic flooring, lining, and ceiling boards are used in the cheap class of weatherboard houses. </para>

Baltic timber is used in the homes of workmen, the poorer class of settlers, and generally throughout the country where people of small means need to build. It is only because it is cheaper, easier to handle, and at the same time durable, that they prefer it, and necessarily have to buy it in preference to more expensive timber. </para>

                        <para>- I have seen what is called clear baltic almost as free from knots as any timber one could wish to see. I do not want to be put in the position of seemingly disparaging Queensland or colonial timbers in any way. I admit that in Queensland and other parts of Australia there are some of the finest timbers to be found in the world, but for some purposes they are not so suitable as are some of the imported timbers. Of course, they are good and suitable for various purposes. There is a demand amongst the merchants of Sydney for the local timbers, but there is not a sufficient supply of them to meet the demand, and consequently they must have recourse to importations. In the Queen's Hall at the present time there are some specimens of Queensland timbers, and any one who will compare them with the exhibits of baltic timber there - not the best class Of baltic, but one of the inferior classes - must admit that they are very fine timbers. No one will say a word against them. I am quite satisfied that the freight, insurance, and other charges incidental to the shipping and transit of imported timbers ought to be a sufficient protection, even if our timbergetters could furnish a sufficient supply. But there is a difficulty in the way. No matter what protection may be imposed, the merchants must import in order to supply their orders. A high duty will not stop the importations. It will not prevent a single foot of these timbers from being imported  and used, simply because persons cannot afford to wait indefinitely for a supply of local timbers. With regard to kauri, the letter continues- </para>

                    <para>With regard to kauri pine and redwood, this timber is used almost exclusively for manufacturing purposes such as joinery and mouldings of every description. We consider that this timber should in reality come in free, as we have nothing whatever growing in the States which will compete with it for such purposes. The same remarks will also apply to yellow and sugar pine from America. </para>
                </quote><para>They might perhaps have added redwoods, because those are used chiefly in joinery work. They are used - almost exclusively, I think - for sashes, mouldings, skirtings, architraves, and things of that kind. With regard to some of the hardwood timbers I have already spoken about the subject of veneers. I do not know why they should be subjected to a heavy duty. There does not seem to be any reason for so doing, because there is ample room for the importations as well as for some of the beautifully marked colonial timbers that are found in Queensland, New South Wales, and Tasmania. I acknowledge readily that some of these woods are very fine in appearance. They have a good grain, take a fine polish, and are excellent for cabinet-making and such purposes. At the same time I feel perfectly sure that all that can be supplied will not be sufficient to meet the demand. I do not want to prolong the debate. I thought it was advisable to lay a few facts before the Committee for its consideration, and I consider that I have done my duty. </para></speech>

                    <para>.When this item was under consideration previously, I made certain propositions to the Minister, and to the honorable member for Barrier, who was very much interested in Oregon pine being admitted for use in the mines at Broken Hill. To the latter I made a proposition which he did not think it wise to accept, and I now ask the former to consider whether it would not be possible to allow a drawback, to the full amount of the duty, on all Oregon used <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> for mining purposes. That is,. I think, a very fair proposition. It may be urged that it would be difficult to follow the timber after it had been landed. But I think that there should be no difficulty, because the Customs officers would be on the wharf when it was landed, and it could be followed very easily to Broken Hill. I do not know, sir, whether you would consider my suggestion, as a modification of the proposal before the Committee, in or out of order, but it is offered to the Minister as a way out of the difficulty. I do riot think that there are any honorable members who are not willing to extend every consideration to the mining industry. Will the Minister, accept my suggestion to modify the duty? Apparently he is not paying the slightest attention to me, and I am afraid that I shall have to vote against his proposal. </para>

All the mines in Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales, and Tasmania use hardwood, and therefore this demand for free Oregon can only be made on behalf of the mines at Broken Hill. </para>

As regards butter-boxes, when the item was last under consideration here, I made a suggestion to the Minister which he did not think it wise to adopt, but which would have met the difficulty at once.I admit that the butter industry is a very large and important one, and is deserving of consideration equally with the timber  industry. I am ready to concede that we are not in a position to supply the whole of the timber for making butter-boxes, and to admit such timber free, provided that it is to be used for that purpose only. </para>

                        <para>- I have bought timber which (was imported ostensibly for that purpose, but which was used for other purposes. I know of many instances of that kind. I dare say that hundreds of thousands of feet of timber which wen; imported on the condition that it was to be used, in the making of butter-boxes have been utilized in other ways. If my suggestion is adopted by the Minister it will entail no cost upon the users of the boxes. It will certainly take a little work away from Australian workmen, but not a very great deal. I think that the difficulty would be met if the timber for butter-boxes were cut into lengths in New Zealand just as timber is cut into lengths for fruit cases. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Honorable members will shift their ground continually. They have asked that at least timber required for the manufacture of butter -boxes should be admitted free, and when. I say that I am prepared to concede that, I am told that the same timber is wanted for other purposes. When the honorable member for Lang was addressing himself to the item the honorable member for Maranoa interjected that southern timber merchants were not prepared to take the whole of the timber offered by Queensland saw-millers. </para>

                <para>I can explain what was meant by the interjection. An inspection of samples of imported pine exhibited in the Queen's Hall will show that much of the imported timber is very narrow. Our difficulty is that southern merchants will not place orders with Queensland saw-millers except for specific sizes - in most cases <inline font-style="italic">12</inline> inches and over. </para>

                        <para>- I have seen price lists of Queensland timbers, and I find that Queensland saw-millers quote prices 15, 20, and 25 per cent. lower than the prices at which New Zealand timber can be landed on the Melbourne wharves. I can inform the honorable member for North Sydney on the best authority that to-day there is a Queensland offer of no less than 25,000 feet of flooring which cannot be placed in Melbourne at even a lower price than the price of New Zealand timber, simply because there is so much of the imported timber in stock. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the quality of the timber offered from Queensland is  not only equal' to, but infinitely superior to, that of the imported timber used for similar purposes. The honorable member for Wentworth should know that there is a very strong combine in the timber trade in Australia. It should not be forgotten that there are two parties concerned in this matter - the merchants and importers of timber who do no saw-milling, and the saw-miller who fells the trees and cuts them up in his mill for sale to the public. The importer desires the imposition of a very low duty, whilst the saw-miller asks only for the imposition of a fair duty which would assist him to make a living. I have known men connected with the saw-milling industry since I was fourteen or fifteen years of age, and although I know many saw-millers, I do not know one who has been able to give up the business and retire upon a competence. </para>

Referring to the " rubbish " of which the honorable member for Lang spoke, I repeat that southern orders are only for large sizes. This means that the best part of the trunk of a tree must be cut up to give the sizes required and the smaller portions of the tree cannot be utilized to supply such orders. </para>

                        <para>- It would have a tendency to keep out the smaller timber that is imported, and would thus enable local saw-millers to put on the market timber which could be cut from the smaller portions of the tree. That timber cannot now be placed on the market in competition with the imported small timber, which honorable members can see for themselves from the samples exhibited, is of very inferior quality, and must have been cut from the branches and not from the trunk of the tree. I do not think that I shall say any more on the subject at present, but I press upon the attention of the Minister the suggestion I have made that butter-box timber should be imported cut into lengths. I have admitted that that would, probably deprive some Australian workmen of a little work, but the injury done in that way would be comparatively slight compared to the assistance which would be given to the local timber industry by keeping out the bulk of the imported timber and making it certain that timber imported ostensibly for the manufacture of butter-boxes would be used for that purpose alone. I shall reserve what I have to say on other items until they are before the Committee. So far as Oregon is concerned, I hold that I have made a very reasonable suggestion, and in the circumstances I shall have to vote for the higher duty. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Committee will re-affirm its previous decision. When the item was previously under consideration, honorable members, after a very lengthy discussion, arrived at a sound conclusion based upon a compromise between the Government and various sections of the Committee. We then fixed the duty at a rate which commended itself to the judgment of the majority of honorable members, and we have no information before us to disclose why another place should request us to reverse our decision. It cannot be denied that we have no timber grown in Australia which can take the place of Oregon. I am not greatly concerned about oregon, except in so far as the general question is affected. I am, however, interested in the timber required for the manufacture of butter-boxes. I have here a sheaf of letters from secretaries of different butter factories protesting vigorously against the increase of the duty requested by the Senate. Amongst them there is one from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton,</inline> who is the secretary of the Council of the Co-operative Butter and Cheese Factories. He writes - </para>

                        <para>- I am not here to vouch for the veracity of any person, but I venture to say that the majority of men do not go out of their way to deliberately tell a false tale. I am unable to affirm that the statements made are absolutely true ; but in this connexion, I should like to ask the Minister of Trade and. Customs whether it is true, as has been stated, that a responsible, officer of his Department was instructed to verify the statements made by timber merchants to the effect that Queensland saw-millers have not supplied , and cannot supply their orders ? If we received a specific reply to that question, and were informed, as the result of an examination of the books of local timber merchants, that orders placed with Queensland sawmillers have not been filled, it would greatly strengthen our case, and would justify the demand made by those interested in butter factories. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton,</inline> in his letter, also writes - </para>

                <para class="block">I can of course only deal with the statements which are placed before me, and I must deal with them from a Victorian point of view. I say, without fear of contradiction, that the butter industry in New South Wales and Victoria is too valuable to the Commonwealth at large to be prejudiced in any way. It is of so much value to the Commonwealth that we cannot afford to trifle with it. We must make every reasonable effort we can to enable those engaged in the butter industry to obtain, the timber which they consider essential for their purposes upon the very best conditions. I am inclined to agree to some extent with the suggestion submitted by the honorable member for Herbert. If the Committee cannot be induced to maintain its previous decision, we might meet the request which comes from the Senate by providing that New Zealand white pine cut into specified lengths necessary for butter-boxes, should be admitted free. </para>

No member of this Committee ever does that kind of thing, and therefore I should not be justified in doing it. We all take the broadest view of every question submitted to us, and taking such a view of this question, I say that I believe timber should be admitted free of duty, because it is required not only by the exporters of butter, but by other persons, who in many different ways are assisting to develop the Commonwealth. We should encourage and not retard that development. I know that what I am saying is not favorably viewed by Queensland representatives, and I should like to say, for their consolation, that if the timber duties be fixed at the lowest rate, they should remember that the longer they keep their timber the more valuable it will become. </para>

                        <para>- I am not an expert in this matter, but I should think that if the trees which have been flourishing for so many years in Queensland are not cut for a few years longer it will not hurt them. I should like to see the timber industry in Queensland and in Tasmania encouraged in every possible way, but not at the expense of industries which are a source of greater wealth to the Commonwealth. The honorable member for Herbert said that timber from Queensland was dumped on the wharfs in Melbourne, and had to be sold at less than its true value because there was no demand for it.' That was unfortunate, but such a thing must always occur when there is a glut in the market. That is all that is involved in this particular case. That timber came along at a time when there was no particular demand for it, and if the consignee desires to quit it immediately, he can do so only at a sacrifice. That is a well understood and recognised rule in business, and is hardly an argument to present for the serious consideration of the Committee. I hone that, we shall re-affirm our previous decision, and that those two large industries to which white pine and Oregon are essential will be assisted by our making the duties as low as possible. </para>

                    (Brisbane) [3.16].- I was not here when the last Tariff was passed, but I remember distinctly that upon that occasion one of the great arguments against the imposition of a duty, at all events upon pine, was that the Queensland pine was unsuitable for butter boxes. We hear now that it is too good for butter-boxes. Apparently any stick is good enough to beat a dog with. Queensland is in the unfortunate position of being one of the only two States, as was pertinently remarked by one honorable member, which are deeply interested in the timber trade. Neither of those two States happens to be one of the two big States. Queensland stands in a very peculiar and unfortunate position in many respects in regard to Tariff matters.  Her  resources are to a great extent unknown, and apparently there has grown up a trade which goes past her doors, and which it is difficult to disturb. When trade gets into a particular groove it is hard to divert it. Vested interests arise, and those who are interested in importations ' from any country will go to considerable lengths to prevent any disturbance of their arrangements. I am afraid that that is what is occurring' in this case, more especially with regard to the baltic timber trade. Extraordinarily conflicting statements have been made as to the possibilities of supplying the Australian demand for soft timbers from Queensland. I have with me statements which directly contradict the assertion that Queensland cannot supply that demand. I am assured that there is a difficulty in placing Queensland timbers in the southern- markets for some reason which I am utterly unable to account for. It has been stated that orders were given for the supply of 6,000,000 feet of timber from Queensland and that the full quantity could not be supplied. I happen to know, and can afford proof which would carry conviction to any unprejudiced mind, that 20,000 feet of first class flooring inches by inches, tongued and grooved, all ready for laying down, have been on offer in the market by Messrs. Campbell and Sons, of Brisbane, for five weeks at 3s. per 100 feet 'less than kauri pine, for which this Queensland timber is sometimes substituted. The honorable member for Herbert stated the quantity at 25,000 feet. My figures differ slightly from his, but that is immaterial.

                    - Jarrah is harder, and splits more. We have jarrah posts in Brisbane, and they are 'not in much favour. I am merely stating facts with regard to the" capacity of the Queensland timber industry to supply the demands of the south. Although that 20,000 feet of flooring boards has been on offer at the price stated, there are no takers, and Messrs. Campbell and Sons cannot get rid of it. Reference has been made to the standing of Messrs. Langdon and Langdon, of Sydney, but they cannot stand higher in the timber trade than do Messrs. Campbell and Sons. I am assured by a member of that firm that they had orders for the supply of 150,000 butter - boxes to Melbourne. They supplied something like 50,000 of them, but on the fact becoming known in Melbourne, the trade here cut their prices to such an extent that the balance of the order was cancelled. I am assured that those boxes could not have been supplied at the cut price except at a loss. What would be the object of that? The honorable member for North Sydney would say that men are not such fools as to lose money in that' way, but combines very often find it worth their while to undercut competitors in order to prevent the trade from being diverted from their own hands. I understand that on one occasion, prior to the association of timber merchants and saw-millers, 2,000,000 feet was ordered from a saw-mill, which at that time was not very large, in Queensland, and was supplied, but no orders have been received by any of the associated or other mills in Queensland from that date to this, except for timber over 12 inches wide, the fact being entirely, ignored that if a timber trade is to grow up between' two places it is necessary that a fair' amount of the seconds and thirds should be taken with the first-class timber. It is estimated that no less than 800,000,000 feet of timber will be opened up by the railways now' under construction or about to be constructed by the Queensland Government. I admit that successive Governments in Queensland have been somewhat remiss in delaying  the opening up of those timber lands, until there has arisen, unfortunately just at this time when the Tariff is before Parliament, a temporary shortage in the timber trade. But, as the honorable member for Wide Bay pointed out, what industry in Australia would be able to. claim a particle of protection if its ability to supply immediately the demand of the whole of Australia were made a condition of granting it protection ?

It is estimated by competent authorities that within a radius of 150 miles of Brisbane alone there is no less than eleven billion feet of pine. A large proportion of that supply has not yet been opened up by railway communication, and probably will not be for some years. But the mere mention of that fact is sufficient to indicate that there is an ample supply of timber even in the south-east corner of Queensland to meet the requirements of Australia for a long time ahead. </para>

                    - And that is called a protective duty because it happens to be on timber, and also because, as one honorable member in the corner inadvertently admitted, it affects only two small States. The honorable member for North Sydney mentioned New Zealand as being the nearest competitor of Queensland in soft woods. He used as an argument why we should not attempt to protect ourselves against New Zealand the statement that that country had threatened to impose an export duty for its own protection. As the honorable member for Wide Bay pertinently interjected, is not that an additional reason why we should protect ourselves? Since 1901, there has been in New Zealand an export duty of 3s. per 100 on log timber. In 1903 the New Zealand Parliament gave the Executive power to increase that export duty to 5s. per 100 at any time. The extra duty has not been imposed, so that it still remains at 3s. We in Queensland say that if the southern market is made available to us by means of a protective duty, and timbers from other countries produced by cheap labour are excluded, a very large proportion of the Queensland timber that is now going to waste will be utilized. ' What are called seconds and thirds will be more than sufficient to supply local wants, and will be made available cheaply for consumption in the southern States. It will be a great benefit to Australia generally, as well as to the timber industry, to make this timber available for profitable consumption. It has to be remembered that the principal competition comes from the Baltic, and that wages in Norway and Sweden run to a maximum of about 2s. per day for this work. This duty will result in an expenditure principally in Melbourne and Sydney of £40,000 a year in wages. Is not that a result which the Victorian and New South Wales protectionists desire to bring about? Although it may be said that this protection is primarily for the benefit of the Queensland timber industry, nevertheless, if that amount of money is spent locally instead of being spent in Norway and Sweden, it is a reason for the imposition of the duty. I wish to impress upon the Committee that what is asked for is in a sense a mere measure of justice to a very important industry in the State from which I come. It is an industry which employs a very large number of people. It is estimated that no fewer than 40, 000 people are dependent upon the success of the industry out of a total population of something like 500,000. It is due to that State that something should be clone within reason. One honorable member has stated that no evidence was placed before the Tariff Commission as far as he was able to ascertain that there are dense forests of pine in Queensland. If the honorable member gathered that from the evidence collected by the Tariff Commission, either that evidence was very incomplete, or he must have overlooked an important part of it. Every one who knows Queensland from the Tweed to Cooktown, will be aware that there are enormous forests of pine and cedar. There can be no doubt about the fact. I have mentioned that there are no less than eleven billions of feet of timber within 150 miles of Brisbane - and Brisbane is merely in a corner of the State. There are vast areas of densely timbered country in various parts of Queensland. I have more to say, but it seems to me that it would be far more pertinent to reserve my remarks for a later item. I shall conclude by asking that because this happens to be a duty which more or less affects two of the smaller States, it should not, therefore, be set aside.

If so low a duty were asked for in regard to any city industry, it would be considered ridiculous. I ask the honorable member for Batman what he would say if it were proposed that a duty of 8 per cent. should be imposed for the benefit of any industry whose cause he so earnestly advocates? He would say that that was no protection at all. There are timbers in Australia which are second in quality to none of the timbers in the world. For building purposes in my own State we use practically nothing but hardwood. If any honorable member will read the evidence given before the Tariff Commission he will find that practically the whole of the wooden houses in Tasmania are built of hardwood. There are available for the inspection of honorable members at this moment a couple of specimens of the very common stringybark. There you have a timber, the breaking resistance of which in a piece 4 x 4 is equal to the strength of the best Oregon 6x6 for mining purposes. If that timber is allowed <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> season, it is not 20 per cent. heavier than imported Oregon. But when a firm like the Broken Hill Company is importing timber steadily, it imports that which is thoroughly dried. When, however, they want a bit of timber from the Tasmanian saw-mills they send a telegram, and ask for the timber to be sent by return boat. The timber may be growing to-day, and they expect to have it on the boat tomorrow, or a few days hence, reeking, and full of sap. If the Broken Hill Company would place their orders with Tasmanian saw-millers with the same regularity that they do with regard to imported Oregon, they would get good-seasoned timber.

                <para class="block">One of the reasons stated by the directors of the Broken Hill Company for the preference given to Oregon is that that timber gives a warning before it breaks, and that stringybark and bluegum. do not. The evidence given before the Tariff Commission, and the tests officially made by the Forestry Department of Tasmania, conclusively prove that that statement is wrong. One of the reasons which show that it is wrong is this : The directors of the principal Broken Hill mine are practically the same persons as the directors of the Mount Lyell Company: Now, the latter company uses Tasmanian timber in its mine. </para>

No section of the community has done more for the development of the country than the bushmen who supply the saw-mills with logs. In Tasmania, the saw-mill is the forerunner of settlement. To keep it going, timber is cut down, and the land thus cleared is taken up  in  small blocks and settled upon. </para>

                        <para>- The company is not badly managed, and possesses one of the most up-to-date mills in the Commonwealth. But it is compelled to export timber to America and to South Africa to supply needs' which Australian protectionists say that it cannot supply. The mines of South Africa are using Tasmanian timber for work for which the Broken Hill directors say it is not safe. Furthermore, the Tasmanian Milling Company has a contract to supply the Mount Lyell mines with timber for all requirements. The directorates of the Broken Hill Proprietary and the Mount Lyell mines are practically identical, and yet, while Tasmanian timber is accepted as suitable at Mount Lyell, it is said to be unsafe for use at Broken Hill. If the Broken Hill mine-owners prefer  Oregon,  let them say so straight out ; they have no right to brand our timber in the eyes of the world as dangerous. The British Admiralty is sending to Tasmania for timber for long spans, to sustain heavy stresses - Tasmanian timber superseding oak for that purpose - and yet so-called Australian patriots say that it is not safe to use this timber in Broken Hill mines. It is too late to discuss . whether our fiscal policy should or should not be protective. We have placed high duties on practically every article which bushmen have to buy ; but now that the timber-getters ask for a protection of 7 or 8 per cent., those who have piled heavy taxation upon them refuse all assistance. The wages of the mill men are higher at the present time than they have ever been before within my recollection, and the conditions of their employment are better. The mill-owners ask protection to enable them to continue paying decent wages; but honorable members who have imposed duties on almost every other production, say that a  5  per cent. duty on timber is too much, and altogether refuse to listen to a request for an 8 per cent. duty. There is in Australia an unlimited supply of hardwood for building, mining, and all other purposes. </para>

                        <para>- I am willing that they should take whatever Australian timber they find best suited to their needs. Duties on butter, hay and chaff, wheat, and jams, which we export largely, are of little or no assistance to the producers ; while duties on timber would assist those in the country. But because of the vested interests in the big' cities, whose Industries are protected by duties of  20, 25,  and  30  per cent., which increase the cost of living of the people in the country, honorable members refuse to give the slightest encouragement' to country industries. I appeal to those who have voted for the imposition of the highest rates of duty on all that producers have to buy, not to refuse to do justice to a country industry which asks for the protection of a duty of  7  or 8 per cent. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to make a personal explanation with reference to a question which I addressed the other day to the right honorable member for East Sydney, when the Prime Minister was being heckled with regard to an arrangement for certain journalistic work on behalf of the Commonwealth. In putting to the right honorable member a question with regard to a contract which he made, when in office, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Plummer, of New South Wales, for the supply of certain articles, I asked whether it was a fact that only two articles had reached the Department. I find that my information with regard to the' number that actually reached the Department was incorrect. I am assured by the gentleman in question that, as a matter of fact, several hundred articles were distributed. I wish to disavow any wish or intention to reflect on the capacity, integrity, or ability of the gentleman who carried out the work which he was appointed to do by the then Prime Minister. I wish to make this disavowal very clear, because I realize that those outside the House have no protection in respect of statements made against them within it. I am one of those who have never taken advantage of their position as members of this House to do an injury to any one outside, even if he deserved to be severely handled, and I am sure that this gentleman did not deserve anything like the treatment which he feels he has received at my hands. My only object in asking the question was to draw attention to what I believed was a precedent for the action which was then being canvassed. </para>
