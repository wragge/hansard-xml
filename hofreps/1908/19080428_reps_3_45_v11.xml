                    <para class="block">The word "massacre" has been improperly used. Murders of natives by natives are continually taking place all over Papua, and occasionally even in the most settled districts. They are due to the causes to which I alluded when the subject was being debated in connexion with the Estimates, such as charges or counter-charges of witchcraft, or other conflicts of native rights or beliefs. The Government has no information as to any increase in the average number of these acts of violence; The complaints, so far as one is able to trace them, . appear, as a rule, to have emanated from three or four persons no longer in the Government service. </para>

                            <para>- I hope to give the honorable . member further information tomorrow, but may say now that the two settlers mentioned seem to have pressed on into country not yet even under general supervision, and consequently can only be surveying land with a view to settlement. Technically, " native land " within the  settled districts is taken to mean the lands which the natives have used, or are in the way of using; the areas between the lands of one village and those of its neighbour have always been considered open. Judge Murray has set out to inquire into the matter. </para>

                        <para>- Some time ago I  asked the Minister of Defence a question with regard to tenders for boots for the Defence -Department in Tasmania, two respectable firms having tendered and a higher tender than that of either of them being accepted. Does the Minister intend to deduct the extra payment out of the salaries of the officers concerned, and will he take action to prevent such a thing occurring again ? </para>

                        <para>- I remember the case perfectly well. Under the regulations, a commanding officer, with the approval of the Commandant of the State, is entitled to accept any tender for the supply of articles for the use of his company, f informed the honorable member previously that the commanding officer, with the approval of the Commandant, had accepted a higher tender. The reason given was that it was believed that the article supplied by one firm would be better than that supplied by another. It appeared to me to have been rather a serious matter, and I caused instructions to be issued to every Commandant that, if the higher tender in any case appeared more acceptable to them, it must not be accepted before the Minister was informed. That seemed to be the only course open for me to take. I could not interfere with the. tender in the case under review, as the contract had been let. However, it will not happen again. </para>

                            <para>- I did not say that a better article would be obtained. I said the only reason given was that it was thought they would get a better article from one tenderer than from the other. It appears to me that when tenders are called for, and samples are displayed, the lower tender ought to be accepted, unless there be some very good reason indeed - and that reason the Minister ought to know - for not doing so. That course will be followed in the future. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to ask the Prime Minister a question in connexion with the matter of tendering. The Minister of Defence has just stated that the lowest tender ought to be accepted if the goods are of equal quality. I am informed that it is not an uncommon thing in the case of imported goods to accept the higher tender, and this is done on the plea of preference. Has not the Prime Minister himself fin ' this Chamber fixed the preference which should be given to one country over others by means of the Tariff? Does he think that it is fair to people who tender upon that presumption to find that some other and additional preference is given, of which they know nothing, and as to which they cannot judge the amount when they tender? I know there is great discontent amongst tenderers. The Prime Minister has, in common with other members of this House, had an opportunity of fixing what he considers the proper_preference. Does he think that that ought to be departed from? </para>

That is, it may be thought that the Department is obtaining a superior article. The cases are so diversified that it is difficult to lay down a hard and fast rule. I know from my political experience in the State and in the Commonwealth that the Departments, and sometimes the Government, if the. matter is sufficiently important, have always reserved to themselves a perfectly free hand in dealing with tenders. </para>

                        <para>Some remarkable figures have been published in regard to the unemployed difficulty in the United States, which for some months past has been acute. According to the New York correspondent of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> a moderate estimate of the number of unemployed in the United States is 3,000,000. The socialist leaders, however, state that there are 4,000,000 workless men in the country, and this, despite the fact that 6,000,000 people have left the United States since October last. </para>

He will also admit, because it must have come under his purview in his own electorate, that the raising of duties has already had the effect of establishing industries there and of giving a good deal of employment. </para>

Tenders have been called for the larger works; some of these are now let, and a good many persons are employed. I believe that it is the intention of the Department to carry out the shallower works, but owing to circumstances, which were explained when the Estimates were under discussion - partly owing to the lack of staff - they could not be pushed on with as rapidly as might otherwise have been the case. However, that difficulty has been overcome, and I hope to be able to report in a day or two that some progress has been made. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Minister of Defence a question in regard to the recent Easter encampment, which I understand was  Colonel Stanley's  first attempt. Will he ascertain how it was that on Good Friday the Ballarat, Castlemaine, and Bendigo men were untrained, and given no work at Langwarrin, and that at the Queenscliff encampment a company of the Geelong Garrison Artillery had no training on work on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, and training for only a few hours on Monday ? </para>

                    <para>. - It is difficult to understand the peculiar attitude of the Opposition towards this reasonable request. On Friday, the honorable member for Dalley used almost "lurid" language, as if an extraordinary injustice were going to be done to the poorer section of the community. He stated, as one of his objections to the request, that he was astonished at the Committee giving such enormous protection to the industry of hat making. Now, this request has nothing to do with hat making. Here is an opportunity for the honorable member and others to treat the makers of caps just as reasonably as the makers of- hats have been treated, and that is all that we ask for. There is no particular difficulty in regard to cap making. There cannot be the same restriction with regard to the number of. factories as there is in the case of hat making. It does not require an extensive plant for carrying on cap making. </para>

                        <para>- There are a good many caps worn, and, as the honorable member for Dalleysaid, by poor persons. On Friday, he stated that we wanted to. levy a duty of 7d. on a cap which is retailed at 6d. Of course, there is no such proposal before theCommittee. Caps are easily made. 'There are at least half-a-dozen factories in New South Wales, and about the same number in Victoria. I believe that caps are also made in the other States. So far as I know, shoddy is not produced in Australia, and if we want to cater for the poorer classes, and afford to local manufacturers, a chance to compete with British manufacturers, we cannot give less protection than is proposed, for the simple reason that the latter largely use Yorkshire shoddy Surely honorable members cannot say that in that case 7d. is too large a duty to impose on a cap ! If the local, manufacturers can obtain the raw material at a reasonable rate, they can make caps as cheaply as they are being sold to-day. The fact is that the Australian-made cap is just as cheap as the imported article. I do not think . it is necessary to elaborate the matter. We are offering a very small protection to the cheapest caps when we take into consideration the fact that a duty of 30 per cent. has already been levied upon the materials from which they are made. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member knows that the cheapest caps are composed of all sorts of rags, which are torn to pieces by machinery, and which are then made into cloth.- In reality, those who purchase this shoddy are not obtaining cheap goods. But, unfortunately, some persons are so poor that they have to purchase the very cheapest goods upon the market, even though in the end these goods may prove to* be dear. I should like to see all caps made out of Australian tweeds. But that is not possible. For these reasons I think that the request- of the Senate is a very  moderate one, and it is one which I am strongly disposed to grant. ' </para>

                    <para>. - The argument of the honorable member for Hindmarsh has convinced me that the request of the Senate ought- not to be entertained. He declares that these caps can be manufactured in Australia as. cheaply as they can be .imported. What then, will happen if- the request of the Senate be granted? The fact that imported caps will be dutiable at 7s. per dozen will enable the Australian manufacturer to add that amount to the price of his wares, and he will then be able to sell them at the same price- as that at which the imported article is sold. That, is what the honorable member calls- '" protection to the manufacturer." </para>

                        <para>- The unfortunate .feature of this matter is that- the proposed duty would be a tax upon the poor man and not upon the rich;- For instance.. &amp; cap costing 7s. 6d. would be dutiable at 35 per cent., whereas the cap worn by the poorer classes of the community would-be dutiable at 7d. In -other words, the man of means who wants a motor cap will be required to pay 35 per cent, upon it - perhaps half the amount that will have to be paid by the individual who purchases a cheap cap. . I do hope that the Committee will not accede to the request of the Senate.  <inline font-weight="bold">'Mr, REID.</inline> (East Sydney) [3.34].- As far as I can understand, the Treasurer and, the Minister' of Trade and Customs  went . into these matters very carefully before the Tariff was introduced, and they submitted a schedule which, in their opinion, .would sufficiently and liberally encourage Aus-' tralian industries. Having acquired' the best information obtainable, and in the light of the experience gained under the operation of the old Tariff, they proposed a duty upon caps of 35 per. cent, under the general Tariff and of 30 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. Now we are asked to go beyond the high-water mark of the schedule as it was  introduced. That is rather a striking departure - it is all the more striking when we realize that it is aimed at - a class of wearing apparel which is admittedly used by those who are possessed -of the most limited means. Under the requested amendment of  the Senate the most expensive caps would be dutiable at 30 -per cent, if imported from Great ' Britain, ' so that persons who invested in those- articles would actually be called upon to pay a lower duty in proportion to' their value than would those who content themselves with the ' cheapest kinds of' caps.. It seems to me that that would be drawing .a line of demarcation altogether in the wrong direction. .  </para>

                        <para>- That may be so, but I suggest to the honorable member that, in many cases, the duty requested would represent 100' and 120 per cent, upon the- cheaper kinds of caps. That is a serious proposition, because, after all, the means of the poorer classes are exceedingly small compared with the means of persons who wear expensive caps,- and surely we have to pay some regard to the incomes of the poorer sections, of the community: We have to consider them a little. Surely there is a line which even the most ardent advocates of protection will draw in favour of those who have to use the cheapest kind of wearing apparel. Surely there is a limit which they will apply to this matter as it affects the poorer sections of the community. Surely  50 per  cent. ought to be regarded as a pretty liberal extension of the rate of duty upon the cheaper necessities of life. Duties of  100  per cent. and  150  per cent. upon articles used by the great masses of the people - even from the stand-point! of the highest form of protection - are an intolerable and gross impost. When the honorable member for Robertson remarked that the effect of this duty would be to increase the cost of Australian made caps by  7  s. per dozen, the honorable member for Hindmarsh interjected, " What about competition?" Now, either the duty proposed is absolutely required to enable Australian manufacturers to produce and sell their caps, or it is not. If it is absolutely required, competition will bring prices down below a fair level, and will lead to all sorts of sweating. That is sometimes one of the troubles associated with any endeavour to push the protectionist principle too far in connexion with items which are really not of very great consequence in the scale of Australian industry, but which affect the daily necessities of persons of limited means. There ought to be some line drawn - even by the most enthusiastic believer in protection. Surely a line of  120  per cent. against the cheaper necessities of life is one which this Committee should be very slow to draw. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. The highest duty levied upon apparel has been fixed at  40  per cent. Why should there be a jump from.  40  per cent. to  100  per cent. and  150  per cent. upon this article? It seems to me that it is carrying the principle of protection to an extreme. Though the duty does not seem much in the aggregate, it is just as much to the poor as a duty fifty times as great would be to the man of more ample means. We must have some regard for the necessities of the people; and this does seem to me to be an extravagant proposal, which looks too much to the interests of the persons who produce these things and too little to the means of the persons who wear them. I think it is putting matters in a position that is not justified. </para>

                    <para>. - I am as well aware as any member of the Commit tee can be that the Government have the battalions behind them. But if a protest is to be made with regard to high duties under this Tariff, it should be made on an item such as that which is now under consideration. In regard to machinery, the protectionists in this Parliament have not been able to climb higher than to secure a duty of  15  per cent. Even the most ardent protectionists in the Senate would not climb higher than that. But they are prepared to climb as high as  120  per cent. in the case of the duties on hats and caps, which are worn by the men who make machinery: Talk about a scientific Tariff ! This is the most unscientific Tariff that it is possible to conceive of. The honorable member for Hindmarsh has expressed himself as being astonished at some language used by me I am astonished at it myself - astonished at my own moderation. But my language is nothing to that which will be used by the people who have to buy these articles. Not satisfied with a high <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, the protectionists have proposed an alternative fixed duty in the case of hats and caps. They have devised a drag-net, and desire to bring every thing possible into it. It is singular that this particular industry should be picked out for special treatment. </para>

                        <para>- It is marvellous, and yet the honorable member for Hindmarsh is astonished that I should use such language concerning it. I am certain that the engineers in his electorate, and their wives who have to purchase hats and caps, not only for their husbands, but for their children, are not prepared to see this industry specially treated. If the protectionists are prepared to sing a sort of Tariff " Excelsior," and to climb up to high duties in regard to some industries, why have they agreed to so small a duty as  15  per cent. in the case of machinery? Another phase of the question which seems to be lost sight of, is that honorable members have allowed the Senate to usurp the functions of this House. A large State like New South Wales might as well not have its proper representation in this Chamber if duties are to be increased in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I am not arguing the. constitutional aspect of the question; I am only alleging that we should not have had such duties in the schedule under consideration if there were anything like proportional representation of the States in the Senate. I wish to emphasize the fact that the people's House - which this House is supposed to be - are not safeguarding their rights sufficiently in allowing duties of this character to be introduced by the Senate. It may not suit honorable members to take a strong stand with regard to the matter today, but any person with the smallest perception can see that in the near future a stand will have to be taken. </para>

                        <para>- There will probably be a great struggle, and, perhaps, the Constitution will require to be altered in this respect. It is a singular circumstance that throughout the schedule of suggestions, although there are about 300 items, not more than two or three involve alternative duties. How is it that the machinery items are not favoured with alternative duties? It is argued that under a 35 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, locally-made hats and caps would come into competition with imported goods. The same argument could be applied to machinery and other manufactures. With regard to the statement of the honorable member for Hindmarsh, that the duty is only 5 per cent. above that on the piece goods which are the raw material, I would remark that it is only reasonable to suppose that the hats and caps manufactured in this country will be made out of niece goods also manufactured in the country. We have already passed high protective duties to encourage the, manufacture of the woollen piece goods out of which the hats and caps are made. </para>

                        <para>- Whichever way we look at the question, there is sufficient protection without a specific duty. As we have extended protection to piece goods, surely it is expected that the articles with which we are now' dealing will be made from goods produced in this country. But the honorable member for Hindmarsh gave himself away by saying that hats and caps are easily produced. If that be so, it means that no great outlay of capital is required in the erection of an expensive plant. That, however, is not the case with machinery, and engineering manufactures. The honorable member knows that it requires a great deal of capital to start an engineering business upon an effective basis. The position in regard to the production of hats and caps is different. It would appear that we are asked in this case to make a special present to men engaged in a special industry located mostly in a special part of Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - The leader of the Opposition, as well as the honorable member for Robertson and the honorable member for Dalley, have been expressing great concern for the poor whom, they fear, it is proposed, by this duty, to penalize. If I thought that they would be so penalized, I should be found voting with the Opposition, but an examination of the facts shows that that will not be the effect of this duty. Under  the old Victorian duty of8s. per dozen caps were being made and sold here at as low as 3s. 6d. per dozen. I hope that they will not be sold at such low prices, for as the leader of the Opposition says, if;wastheresult of internal competition, we bring down prices to such a very low level, sweat ing must take place. In Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales there are Wages Boards and industrial tribunals to prevent sweating, and if we-, allow caps made from shoddy to be imported free of duty, the Australian manufacturer will be placed in an unfortunate position. He will have to pay much higher wages than are paid in the countries from which these caps are exported, and it will be impossible for him to use woollens in the manufacture of his goods. Woollen caps are very desirable, especially in the colder parts of Australia. </para>

                <para>Mr.Reid.- We have imposed a duty of 16s. per dozen on wool felt hats. </para>
                <para>Mr.HUTCHISON.-That duty relates to a wholly different class of manufacture. If it was possible under a duty of 8s. per dozen to sell caps in this State at 3s. 6d. per dozen, I do not think we need fear that the poor will be penalized by this impost. It will make it unnecessary for the workers in the industry to compete with the sweated labour of the East End of London and other parts of England, where mere children and what are known . as " half-timers" are employed by the thousand. It is not my desire that our manufacturers should have to face such competition. If we require them to pay fair wages, we should grant them reasonable protection. </para>

                        <para>- Those who use caps will escape the duty, because they will purchase caps made in Australia.I believe the caps to which I referred as having been sold in Victoria at 3s: 6d. a dozen were made at a time when the conditions of labour in. misstate were not as good as they are to-day. The protection proposed is comparatively trifling, having regard to the fact that if cap manufacturers here use imported material they must pay duty upon it. I fail to see why they should use imported material. It would be a good thing for the children who have to wear caps even if1d. or 2d. more had to be paid for them, because they would get a good article made in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not; under this duty they would be able to obtain locally-made caps at a much lower rate than they otherwise could. My experience is that even the poorest of the working classes do not desire to purchase goods made by sweated labour. Honorable members opposite tell us that they believe' in the policy of new protection, and that being so, I fail to see how they could reasonably refuse to grant protection to the manufacturers in this industry, and compel them to pay wages far higher than those paid in the Old Country. The cry "We are the only people who are trying to protect the poor; the protectionists would penalize you," is an excellent one for the Opposition, but I would remind them that in my electorate are to be found some of the poorest people in Adelaide, and that they are satisfied that I would not do anything likely to subject them to heavy taxation. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. I do not think that the honorable member is in favour of sweating, but he knows that caps are made by people in the Old Country who are sweated. They are trying to better their conditions, and we shall not assist them by passing a low Tariff, which will lead to increased importations of their sweated goods. The duty here proposed is not by any means too high, and if it is carried the result will be that the working classes in Australia will be able to obtain better and cheaper caps," while increased employment will be given in the localindustry. </para>

                    <para>. - I really think that the honorable member for Batman ought not to resume his seat without moving that the duty shouldbe14s. instead of 7s. per dozen. What a lame and impotent conclusion the proposed duty is to the speech just delivered by the honorable member ? Why should we not, in justice to the unfortunate sweated workers of the back slums of London, prohibit altogether the importation of these sweated caps by charging a good stiff duty of,say, <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> perdozen upon them ? If only we do that, according to the honorable member, we shall get these caps cheaper and better than ever in Australia. If the physic which the honorable member recommends be so good, why is he not prepared to take a stronger dose of it? </para>

                        <para>- Why should we impose a duty of only 7d. each on these caps when by imposing a higher duty we shall be able to get them cheaper and better here and at the same time relieve the. sweated conditions of the unfortunate workers in the Old Country? Might I suggest that if these caps are imported at a selling price of 3s. 6d. per dozen the duty now proposed represents an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 200 per cent. This is a pretty stiff duty'. A duty at so much per dozen is' proposed because the Government and honorable members opposite have not the pluck to show the real percentage of taxation involved. They have not the courage to submit a straightforward proposal for the imposition of a duty of 200 per cent. on these articles required by the poorer classes of the community. The proposal is submitted in a sneaking way at so much per dozen so that no one will know how much he is being taxed. The proposed rate of so much per dozen is adopted only to conceal the enormous extremes to which some people are prepared to go in imposing taxation upon these articles. And why on these articles.? Because there is more to be made out of them since they are used by- the great masses of the people. It would be of no use to impose heavy duties on diamonds or expensive jewellery, because only a few people would be reached by that taxation. The reason for the imposition of enormous duties <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> these articles is that since 'hundreds of thousands of people require them money is to be made out of them. In these cases the imposition of heavy duties is something worth trying for.Whyhas not the honorable member and those who believe with him the pluck to state openly the real ad <inline font-style="italic">valoremduty</inline> which they propose on these goods as is done in the case of other good's that are imported? Why is the real duty concealed and disguised in this way?. On the imported selling price the duty now proposed is equivalent to  200  per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> I believe that the price quoted is too low; but even allowing for a fair price, this duty must be over  100  percent. Why do not the Government boldly submit a duty of  100  per cent, on these articles instead of a proposal for the imposition of. a duty of 7s. per dozen? To show how little ' discrimination has been exercised in this matter it may be pointed out that these caps are made of linen and cotton as well as of woollen materials. There- might be some justification for a fairly high duty on caps made of woollen "materials in view of the fact that we impose duties of  35  and  30  per cent, on some woollen piece goods ; but surely some discrimination should be made, and it is absolutely unfair to impose similarly high duties on caps made of raw materials introduced at the lowest rates of duty. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to revive the fiscal controversy, and I admit that there mav be. some reason for the difference in the duties imposed on woollen and colton piece goods. I am dealing now with the statement that a duty on caps should be increased because the duty on the raw material is  30  per cent. That is so in the case of woollen caps,- but it is not so in the case of caps made of other materials, and, so far as I can form an opinion, an enormous quantity of caps made of materials other than wool are used in the Commonwealth. At this stage I do not believe there is much use in fighting these proposals very keenly. It seems .to me that some arrangement has been made by which each matter is practically settled before we are asked to deal with it. </para>

                    <para>.- The right honorable member for East Sydney has been rather hard on the honorable member, for Batman. He says that if so much protection is good, why should we not have more. But using the same argument,. I might say that if two meals a (lay are good, why should we not have twenty-two meals a day?- The statement made that these caps are produced for 'is. od. per dozen or 1¾d. each proves conclusively that there is very great  sweating- carried" on in this industry in the  Old  Country, and we . should deal a blow against it -if "we can.  </para>

These are the people who are being employed at the low rates referred to in the manufacture of these caps. </para>

It is the stalwart sons and daughters of Britishers who are emigrating from the Old Country, and they are being driven out by the cheap .continental labour that is coming in behind them. We should welcome them to this country, not only by imposing a high Tariff on such articles as are now under consideration, but also by imposing a stiff progressive land tax, and by other measures which would tend to make conditions better for them here after they came. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to follow up that reference, and I made it only in answer to the question put by the right honorable member for East Sydney. It has been said that a large number of imported caps are made from cotton piece- goods, and that on that account the duty should be reduced. Surely it will not be contended" that we should have a lower duty on the manufactured article than on <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> raw material.  We ought to be able to make all these caps here. ' I voted for a very low Tariff on cotton and linen piece goods as compared with the duties  1  supported on materials which can be produced here, such as woollen piece goods. </para>

                    <para>.- a  remarkable feature of discussions of this character is the want of unanimity amongst protectionists as to the effect of duties. In this case, as in many others, we have one honorable member declaring that a duty does not increase prices, and another honorable member admitting that a duty may increase prices, but defending the increase on the ground of the employment afforded to local producers. It is obvious that we cannot have two opposite effects arising from the one cause at the same time; we cannot have goods both increased and reduced in price simultaneously. According to the honorable member for Batman, the effect of the duty under discussion . will not be to increase prices. But, if that be so, what, from his point of view, is the object of the duty, seeing that  the only advantage that can be looked for" by the producers is an increase of prices over those of the imported and admittedly cheaper articles alleged to be made by sweated labour? On the other hand, the honorable member for Hindmarsh says that' probably the effect of the duty may be to increase prices by 2d. or 3d. per cap - though he admits that these caps are bought chiefly by the wage-earning and poorer classes - and he gives us the astonishing information that by paying the increased prices purchasers will be getting the articles cheaper. I may have some mental kink which prevents me understanding such arguments, but I certainly fail to see how anybody can get an article cheaper by paying more for it. However these are the mutually contradictory and wholly illogical  statements we have placed before us, and I draw attention to them merely to show the varied grounds on which increased duties are advocated. Unquestionably, the effect of this duty must be to increase prices, and those who will have to pay are those who can least afford to do so; it is the poorer classes and their children who will have to suffer. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to place one or two facts before honorable members in connexion with this item. In 1903, the importations were valued at , £8,000 odd ; in 1904, at £11,000 odd ; in 1905, at £21,000 odd ; in 1906, at £29,000 odd; and in 1907, at least, £35,000 odd. The honorable member for East Sydney asked why the Government did not propose the higher duties at the commencement. If the honorable member had heard the harrowing picture drawn by the deputation which waited upon me - a picture which I was convinced was a true one of the conditions under which these caps are manufactured - he would probably have been of the same opinion as myself. There is no doubt that caps of this character ' have been imported from Great Britain and elsewhere, with the effect of throwing our own people out of employment. Is there any reason why there should be a low Tariff, and why caps manufactured under such conditions should be' sent to Australia when they can be manufactured here at a low price ? The honorable member for East Sydney also asked why the Government had not had the " pluck " to propose an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty ? But surely there is no absence of pluck when the Government definitely state what 'the duty should be? </para>

                        <para>- No. man can accuse me of being biased, because, as a matter of fact, I looked with great suspicion on many of the high duties with a desire to know if they were really necessary in the interests of industries. However, after the evidence had been placed before me, it appeared to me that unless we were prepared to do something to help this industry we should hand the whole of the labour over to the sweated dens of London and elsewhere. That, in my view, would be a disastrous result, especially in view of the fact that these articles can be made here from good Australian stuff at prices within the reach of everybody. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is not  Chairman.  We have agreed to rates of 40 and 35 per cent, on many articles of apparel and attire, and, although I do not know the ratio of wages cost to the value of made-up caps as I know the ratio in regard to hats, in my opinion it is as great as, if not greater than, the ratio of wages cost to the value of other articles of apparel. Why then should we give the cap-making industry less protection ? </para>

                        <para>- Silk hats do not come under this duty. They will pay rates of 35 and 30 per cent. but I think that they should be taxed as highly as any articles of wearing apparel. The Customs Department, however, has published some peculiar decisions, and it may feel justified in making silk hats dutiable as such articles. The caps which are imported compete against the productions of manufacturers who have to work under factories legislation. If there is not a Wages Board in the cap-making industry, it shows that there is not much sweating in the industry here, though, of course, if there is a Wages Board the manufacturers have to pay the rates required by it. I hope that this industry will be given the protection that has been given to others, so that it may be carried on under fair conditions. Some honorable members have said that the new protection is dead. By means of it we have tried to do something to regulate the conditions of employment, which would be absolutely impossible under free-trade. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government had fully considered the Tariff when they first tabled it. They then made the rates as high as they thought consistent with their protectionist ideas, but now that the Senate has stepped in, and assumed a right to increase the taxation of the people, the Government have accepted their suggestions, and made them part of their policy. This is a very serious matter, as in the other place there is no representation of the people upon a population basis. The States will be heavily taxed by the proposed increases. The Government should make a statement to satisfy the Committee before accepting a policy laid down by another place. The people, when they accepted the Constitution, had no intention whatever of conferring upon the Senate the right to increase the' burden of taxation. THe question of whether a proper adjustment of the duties is now proposed is another matter , altogether. The Government must have' fully considered the Tariff for months before they brought it down, and now they make the adjustment of the duties a pretext for the acceptance from another place of a policy which will increase taxation on the people. Let them stand by the Constitution and say that the people shall be first represented before increased taxation is imposed upon them. I shall oppose every increase of duty asked for by the Senate upon that principle, quite apart from the question of adjustment. Increases of taxation should not be made by a body of men who do not represent the people. . This is the people's House. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister could not have received more information since we dealt with the schedule than he had before. He has had the same officers at his elbow all through. Yet he now accepts a proposal to increase taxation from a body which has no right whatever to place taxes1 upon the shoulders of the masses. That is ai» infringement of the rights of the people, who have conferred upon their- representatives, in the representative chamber alone the. power to impose, taxation. The smallest State, which on a population basis is not entitled to six members, has six members in the Senate, and the larger States have no more. If the Government stand by the proposed increase they will' be sanctioning a state of things which is contrary to the principle of representative government. </para>

                        <para>- It becomes a dictation in the end, because the Senate can refuse to pass the Bill unless we accept their requests. The Constitution states that they have the power to request amendments, but no man in his senses would call that anything else than a power to make amendments, because they have the right of rejection if we do not accede to their requests. That' which is proposed takes the form of a suggestion, but actually it is a power of amendment. The right honorable member for Swan took a very proper course in bringing that question before the House, but it was dismissed in a very unsatisfactory manner. </para>

                        <para>- The Government have thereby been enabled to adopt these proposals to increase the taxation of the people. I could quite understand a State, which is not entitled to as much representation as Victoria or New South Wa.les has, being satisfied with such a state of things, but what about the great masses of the people who live in those two States, and upon whom this increased taxation is enforced without their having proper representation in the matter? The Government with their majority back up these suggestions, and say, " We will pass them into law upon party lines." I do not regard this as a party question at all. It is a. question1 for the people, and, quite apart from my fiscal beliefs. I regard it as my  duty  to oppose every increase proposed by the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I am given to understand that it is very difficult to procure in Australia wood suitable for the making of umbrella sticks. As a matter of fact, most of them have to be imported. I know of no factor)' in Australia at present which makes the silk for umbrellas. I am told that it is a very delicate article of manufacture, and requires experts to produce it. It is highly improbable that any manufacture of 'the kind will be encouraged in the Commonwealth by the imposition of this duty. Far more important is the consideration that this is a tax which will press most heavily, as the honorable member for Robertson said, upon the masses of the people. Those who use umbrellas, parasols, and sunshades are the women of Australia. A woman considers a- sunshade or parasol as part of her daily apparel. She will not leave her home without it. We are asked to impose a still greater hardship upon the shoulders of the masses, and particularly upon the shoulders of our women folk. A woman will part with any article of attire rather than with her parasol, to which she will cling affectionately until the last. I see no reason why the duty should be increased, and I shall vote against the request. </para>

                    <para>.- We have had the pleasure to-day, for the first time, of. having the Minister who controls the Department of Trade and Customs, in charge of the Tariff schedule. I am very glad that he is now in charge of what is really his proper work. But, like most chairmen, when he gives a reason he gets into trouble. My experience as  chairman  is that when one gives a reason the trouble starts. The Minister has given a reason for the increase of this duty, and on that ground, and not on the question of the amount of the duty, I intend to quarrel with him. He said that the Government would agree to the 25 per cent, so as to give a margin between the' duty on the article from which the umbrella or- parasol was made, and that on the finished article itself. He forgot to state that already his kind friends in the Senate whom he allows to juggle with the Tariff as they like, have, decreased the duty on silk piece-goods by 5 and 10 per cent., according to the country, of origin. He now wants to spring another 5 per cent, on the completed umbrella, and so in a roundabout manner he is getting on behalf pf the umbrella and parasol makers 10 per cent, greater protection than they had when the schedule left this Chamber. The duty on this article was then 20 per cent., and that on silk piece goods was 20 per cent. The duty on the latter is to be reduced to 15 per cent. (General Tariff), whilst the duty on the umbrellas is to be raised to 25 per cent. On a previous item the Minister made a most pathetic appeal to the Committee to prevent shoddy articles from coming into Australia. But he is making no provision in this case against the importation of the shoddy umbrella, or "to protect the Australian manufacturer of umbrellas or parasols against the sweated parasol makers of Germany: or elsewhere. If his argument on the previous item was a strong one, why does he, not propose in this case the alternative duty which he is so fond of? The reasons which the Minister gave for supporting this increase are not sound. As an Australian,. I, equally with the honorable member, want to see these articles manufactured here. I said months ago that I would support the new protection, and that if it became law one of my strongest objections to the policy of protection would cease. I never did want to be a buyer of foreign articles ; but desire those who make the articles, and not only the owners of factories, to get the benefit of a protective policy. The Minister of Trade and Customs in his appeal to the Committee said that the materials of which umbrellas are made are imported. Why does he as a protectionist ask Australian parasol manufacturers to use imported piece goods? Why does he not ask them to use materials made in Australia? If it is right to encourage the Australian umbrella or parasol maker, I cannot understand the honorable gentleman, as a protectionist, turning round and pleading that the reason why he wants a duty of  25  per cent, is to allow something for the duty he has on the piece goods. . I ask him to tell me why it is not possible to make here the piece goods out of which umbrellas are made, and thus give further employment. The ordinary parasol, or sunshade, or umbrella is not made from silk, but from, a mixture. I cannot understand the attitude of the Minister on this matter. If I am compelled to swallow a duty of  120  per cent. on the caps and hats of the masses, I can well afford to swallow a duty of  25  per cent. on parasols, sunshades, and umbrellas. But, in my opinion, the reasons given by the Minister in favour of this motion are absurd. </para>

                        <para>- The Tariff Commission took the evidence of those who, of course, were interested in making out as good a case as they possibly could, and the protectionist section recommended a duty not exceeding  20  per cent. I fail to see that the Minister has advanced any argument in support of an increase of the duty to  25  per cent. The honorable member for Robertson was perfectly right when he twitted the Government with their easy acceptance of the Senate's demands for increases of duties. I think that, in the interests of. the prestige of this House and its right to keep control of the public purse, the Treasurer should have resisted all attempts at increased taxation from: that quarter. The reason which his colleague has advanced for the acceptance of this particular increase of duty is one which should not commend itself to any honorable member possessing a grain of sense. </para>

                    <para>.- I gather that the Ministry have no reason for increasing this duty except that nobody is to be permitted to escape, whether he wishes to come out of the wet or to keep out of the. dry. Some time ago, we passed a duty which had the effect of preventing persons in drought-stricken areas from getting fodder for their starving stock. When we, on that occasion, feared far too much dry weather, they refused to allow the products of the elements in other parts of the world to come to our rescue. In this case, where we are threatened with too much wet, it is only natural, I presume, that the Government should be doing all they can to make the unfortunate victims of the elements suffer. </para>

                    <para>.- In my opinion, the Government are not acting very consistently in agreeing to the Senate's request. It seems to me that there is no good reason for doing so. The A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 20 per cent., the same duty as under the Tariff of 1901-2, and the Government submitted to this House a duty of 20 per cent. </para>

Evidently they intended that, as regarded their raw material of silk, there should be no margin left for the manufacturers of parasols. </para>

                    <para>.- In this case the Senate has requested the omission of certain words with a view to the insertion of a new paragraph dealing with rubbered waterproof cloth. If honorable members win refer to the requested new paragraphs on page 13 of the schedule they will see that a better  arrangement of the duties can be made in that way. The suggestion is a good one, and the reasons for its adoption must be very evident to honorable members. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to submit an amendment with a view to making the meaning of this paragraph perfectly clear. Honorable members will recollect that when the Tariff was previously under consideration in this Chamber,, in my efforts to obtain a certain scientific method of dealing with the dress goods of women and children, I suggested the adoption of the weight system. That may not be a perfect system, but at least it represents a step in advance. I included in my proposal everything in the way of dress goods known as "printed" or "dyed" flannels. These, as honorable members are aware, are imported exclusively from France. They are not produced in America or Great Britain. Of course, underclothing can be made from these materials just as it can be made from silk, but the cost involved in local manufacture would be very great. I have here several samples of Victorian flannels. One is sold at 7d. per yard, another at 71/2d., another at 8d., still another at 81/2d., and some darker shades at a less sum. </para>

                        <para>- No; I am speaking of the retail prices. It is possible to get a very good flannel at a cost' ranging from 8d. to10d. per yard. Of course, these are essentially dress goods, but unless the position be made perfectly clear, I fear that the Customs Department will regard these materials as flannels, and charge a higher duty upon them. This consideration leads me to ask, " What is flannel ?' ' According to my reading, flannel includes any material made of wool from the finest texture up to the thickest blanket.

                    <para>Flannel (French <inline font-style="italic">flanelle,</inline> German <inline font-style="italic">flanel),</inline> an open woollen stuff of various degrees of fineness, from patent flannel, which does not shrink in washing, to baize, which is a coarse woollen stuff, or flannel with a long nap, first introduced into England, together with serge, by the Flemings. Domett is another variety of flannel, the warp of which is made of cotton, and the woof of wool. . . . The manufacture of flannel is almost the same as that of Other woollen goods, though there are certain wools which are more used for flannel than for any other textiles. For instance, a short staple wool of fine quality from a Southdown variety of the Sussex breed is principally in favour with the flannel-makers at Rochdale, as also the wool from the Norfolk breed, a cross between. the Southdown and Norfolk sheep. In Wales the short-staple wool of the mountain sheep is used, and in Ireland that of the Wicklow variety of the Cottagh breed. Nearly 2,000 persons are employed in this section of woollen manufactures, the chief seat of the industry being Rochdale, in Lancashire ; while blankets, a special branch of the flannel trade, are extensively woven at Dewsbury, in Yorkshire. </para>

                <para class="block">These quotations will serve to show that the definition of flannel is almost as wide  as  the world. Any material made of wool loosely woven may come under that designation. Of course, nobody would dream of calling delicate tissues such as flannel merino, flannel serge, amazonia, superior cashmere, crepe mikado, and crepe stella, flannels. These have their differentiations, and are well known. </para>

The only way in which they can be produced in Australia is by the establishment of a State workshop for the manufacture of such fabrics. But the cost that would be involved in such an undertaking would be so great that it would practically wipe out the splendid record that we have established in connexion with the manufacture of locomotives at Newport. </para>

                        <para>- What are duties of  15  per cent. on material like the sample I hold in my hand, which could be used for the kilt of a Scotchman? The honorable member says that these goods can be used only for female attire. I must admit that, though I have known some pretty " loud " gentlemen in my time, I have never known one who would wear things like these. I cannot see why these goods cannot be printed in Melbourne. If machinery can be built in other parts of the world for printing flannels, it ought to be possible, by the imposition of a protective duty, to enable them to be printed here. Surely the honorable member for Melbourne is lacking in his duty to his constituents in not asking for a higher duty on these goods, because he is one of. those who is usually satisfied that anything can be made in this city so long as the duty is sufficiently high. However, I shall assist my honorable friend in what he desires to do, because I wish to reduce duties on the clothing worn by ladies. I like to see them in pretty frocks, and I want to see the wives, sisters, and children of the working men of this country wearing as good and tasteful material as is worn by women in other parts of the world. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government have accepted so many of the Senate's requests that I cannot see why they should stick at this one, which leaves the principle of the Tariff intact as it went from this House ; because it leaves in the essential words " not weighing over  5  ozs. per square yard." In -practical administration, how could there be a distinction in regard to the same material of the same weight, oh a question as to whether it was to be used for women's and children's dresses, or for other purposes? How could the Customs defeat the introduction of these materials, weighing under25 ozs. to the square yard, as women's and children's goods, even if after they left the Customs House they were to be used in some other way </para>

                        <para>- Many of them might be used, not for outside clothing, but for underclothing for men as well as for women. If these materials can only be used for women and children, there is no necessity to leave the words in ; but if they can be used otherwise, leaving the words in would do no good, because there is nothing to prevent the material being used for other purposes after the goods leave the Customs House. I think the Senate's requested amendment is an advisable one. </para>

It is clear therefore that the feeling of the Department is rather in the direction of the suggestion made by the honorable member for Melbourne - that is, of a reduction, of the duty. Probably the Minister is personally aware "of the order issued by the Comptroller-General. The Departmental officers apparently hold the view that there ought to be a differentiation. </para>

It is open to us to reject the requested amendment providing for the omission of certain words, and to insert other words which would be an amendment or modification of that request; but I fear that it is not open to us, under cover of rejecting the Senate's request, to amend the item as originally passed by this House. If the proposal made by the honorable member for Melbourne is in any sense an acceptance of any part of trie Senate's request it is in order, but if it is not we cannot take advantage of a request which we are discarding to review our own work before the Tariff was sent to another place. The proposal made by the honorable member for Melbourne is an excellent one, but I am afraid that it is in no way an acceptance of the Senate's request. </para>

                        <para>-  On the point of order that has been raised, I should like to explain that from what I know of the debate which took place on this item in another place, it seems to me that the adoption of the request that these words' should be eliminated would not give effect to' the object which honorable senators had in view in making it. We have had from the central office of the Department of Trade and Customs a decision which treats as flannels materials which are not so regarded in the trade. My proposal is simply designed to carry out what I believe the Senate had in view in preferring this request, and if my information be correct the modification I suggest will be indorsed by it. </para>

                        <para>- I have been endeavouring, as far as possible, to avoid any infringement of the Standing Orders, but in dealing with the Tariff it' is difficult very often to determine what does and what does not come within them. In this case it appears to me that the honorable member for Melbourne desires that the hem shall cover not merely dress goods made of flannel, but other dress materials weighing not more than 5 ozs. to the square yard. By inserting the word " including " before the word " women's," and substituting the word " flannels " for " goods," we should overcome the difficulty so far as flannel goods are concerned, but we should not deal with materials that are not flannels. So far as I can see at present, if we desire to carry out the honorable member's object there is open to us no course other than that which has been proposed, and I have therefore accepted his amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Melbourne might accomplish his purpose by proposing the insertion of the words " including women's and children's dress flannels," after the words which the Senate has requested us to omit. I think that the object of the Senate was to include in this item all woollen piece goods weighing under 5 ounces per square yard. The Minister proposes that we should reject that request, and the honorable member for Melbourne now proposes that we should extend the item, although not to the extent desired by another place, by bringing within it women's and children's dress flannels. I think that his modification would be in order, since it would be really an amendment of the request made by another place. </para>

                    <para>.- This is a convenient stage at which to obtain some information from the Minister as to what will be the effect upon the general revenue of the Senate's requested amendments. I am inclined to think that they will lead to the revenue from, the Tariff being greatly increased. If that be so, the argument raised as to what would be the effect of this requested amendment is of scarcely any force. I understand that the total increases proposed by the Senate will mean an enormous expansion of the revenue from the Tariff, which is already greatly in excess of the Treasurer's anticipations. In such circumstances, we might reasonably agree to an incidental reduction of a revenue duty. This proposal will not affect protection. The woollen industry of Australia is protected under a different item. This item relates to cheap kinds of apparel, in the manufacture of which wool is not used. I should think that the protectionists would be disposed to encourage the introduction of raw material which is not produced here. </para>

                        <para>- We must not forget that the effect of the Senate's amendment would be to encourage the manufacture in Australia of articles made of flannelette. If we allow a raw material which we do not produce to come in free, we shall encourage the manufacture of the finished article here. There is no fiscal question involved in this case, and I should think it would be the desire of honorable members generally to provide for the freest entrance into Australia of raw materials that are not made here. The amount of duty involved is only about £11,000., and as that cannot be regarded as a serious loss, in view of the fact that the revenue has increased by this Tariff to the extent of about £2,000,000, the Committee might well agree to accept the reduction proposed. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the Committee will not agree to the requested amendment. If I had my way I would prohibit the sale of flannelette. Every day we hear of cases of children being burnt to death as a result of the use of clothing made from this material. The honorable member for Melbourne has pointed out that when first introduced there was some wool used in the manufacture of flannelette, but it is now manufactured entirely from cotton. Many people who use it are not aware of that fact. It is more inflammable than calico, and its use is a danger to the whole community. I should like to see its importation prohibited, and, at any rate, as some check upon the importation of flannelette we should adhere to our former decision as to the duty to be imposed upon it. </para>

It is simply a farce to go on imposing duties of 10 and 5 per cent. on articles which are universally used. As people will use flannelette, they should be allowed to get it as cheaply as possible. </para>

I understand that the Minister intends to prohibit the importation of celluloid goods. Before any action is taken in that direction, we should be given some reasons for the course proposed. If celluloid goods are not covered by this paragraph, information cannot be given at this stage, but I should like to know what action the Government . pro- . pose to take in this matter. </para>

The honorable member for Calare is mistaken in saying that I propose to prohibit the importation of all such goods.

                    <para>.- We should have some explanation for the motion submitted by the Minister. As the item passed this House, the duty imposed under the General Tariff was 20 per cent., and on and after 14th November, 1907, free. We are requested by the Senate to impose a duty under the General Tariff of 26per cent., and the Minister, without a word of explanation, 'submits a motion to accept the requested amendment. I 'cannotunderstand the attitude of the Government, in view of the fact that when this item was last before us, there was a long and important discussion before we decided to make it free. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of wadding and cotton wool, for the manufacture of which there is a large establishment in Melbourne, employing a great number of hands. The article produced is of the best sold in Australia ; and I may say that, although duties of 20 and 15 per cent. were suggested, the firm I refer to have made no attempt to raise prices, which are the same as those prevailing for the imported article. . I feel certain that if the honorable member for Hunter had seen this locally-manufactured cotton wool for surgical purposes, he would be much more satisfied than be appears to be now. In the item just disposed of, I gave a consistent vote, because I know that the manufacture of flannelette from cotton is not carried on here; but in the' present instance, when we have the means of manufacturing sufficient wadding and cotton wool for the whole consumption of Australia, a duty ought to be imposed. [ have a particular interest in a certain line of business ; and I can assure honorable members that, if it were not for the knowledge that prices will not be raised, I should not be found voting for, this duty on an article, a good deal of which men and women carry about with them in their clothing, though, they, may not be aware of the fact. </para>

Further evidence is certainly needed before a duty is imposed in the present instance. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has told us that, if he thought the duty would increase prices, he would vote against the Senate's request ; and that is slightly irrational, because, if the prices are not increased, how can the duty benefit the local industry ?I feel- confident that the Committee will not reverse its vote on the flimsy reasoning advanced by the honorable member. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to have some clear statement from the Minister in regard to this item. The honorable gentleman has very kindly pointed out that under item 442, " Medicated and Absorbent Wool and Surgical Dressings " are free. But I am exercised in my mind by the fact that enormous quantities of this wool are used in hospitals ; and, under the circumstances, I desire an explanation of what is exactly meant by this item. I am now speaking as the mouthpiece of people connected with the trade, who have written to me; . and I can say that when it was decided to have cotton wool admitted free, there was general satisfaction. If I am given an assurance that cotton wool for surgical dressing is free, I shall be perfectly satisfied. </para>

                    <para>. - If the honorable member will turn to item 442 of the Tariff, he will find it there set forth that " Medicated and Absorbent Wool and Surgical Dressings " are free. I believe that, in the first instance, a duty of 10 per cent, was proposed, but, on the motion of the honorable' member for Hunter, the item was made free. It will be observed that the Senate's request relates to " Waddings and Cotton Wool n.e.i.," which, of course, means wadding and cot-: ton wool not 'included in item 442, thus leaving the material for surgical dressings free. </para>

If there is any industry which can be regarded as natural to the country and worthy of support, it is the industry now under discussion. I can assure the Committee from a close knowledge of the undertaking - in which I have no personal interest - that they have put at least £50,000 into machinery. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me that we do not hold to our former opinions. I notice that the A section of the Tariff Commission - an inquiry which cost a large sum - recommended that the duty should be 5 per cent. If the wadding and cotton wool industry is such an important one that, according to the last  speaker,  some persons have invested a large sum in it, it seems strange that the Tariff Commission did not elicit any information in that regard. Under the Tariff of 1901-2, wadding and cotton wool were free. The A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 5 per cent., and, for some reason of other, the B section desired a duty of 10 per cent. The Government proposed duties of 20 per cent. and 15 per cent., but this Committee, when considering the matter some months ago, decided to make these articles free, and now, at the request of the Senate, it is asked to restore the former duties of 20 and 15 per cent. Surely the experience we are having all along the line shows how unfortunate it was that the decision in regard to the power of the Senate should have been the means, as it is in this case, of placing additional burdens upon the people - a power which it was not intended to have, and which, in my opinion, it does not possess. I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs will be more moderate, and will not insist upon asking the Committee to restore the old duties of 15 and 20 per cent., which it deliberately decided some time ago that it would not have. I certainly do not intend to support the present motion. </para>

                    <para>. - Cotton wool is a misnomer, because the article contains no wool. Cotton waste would be a better term to use. In Australia both wadding and cotton wool car be made. In Queensland, I have seen very good cotton being turned out. </para>

                        <para>- We did not know then that any one in Australia could manufacture such a simple article as wadding. I should think that it was one of the easiest things to make. It has not to undergo a very elaborate process. In Queensland, cotton is being grown profitably. I saw some growing at Ipswich. </para>

                        <para>- We grow a good quantity at the present time, and we could grow a great deal more. When I went to see the Ipswich cotton mill, I was rather surprised to find that they were allowing all the machinery to lie idle. They simply separated the seeds and distributed them to the farmers, but did very little with the cotton except by way of exportation, although they had splendid machinery for producing cotton goods. </para>

                        <para>- I have seen cotton imported from America and made into cotton goods. I am intimately acquainted with the process of manufacture. In Ipswich, the farmers were making far more out of the growth of cotton than they could make out of the production of cereals. The  industry of growing cotton in Australia has been established. An unlimited quantity of the article will be grown some day, and I think that it is very wise on the Minister's part to ask the Committee to accept the Senate's request. </para>

                    <para>.- This proposed reversal of the matured opinion of the Committee requires a larger attendance. I think we ought to have a quorum. I take this step in no disagreeable spirit, but solely because the Committee is reversing its decision. [Quorum <inline font-style="italic">formed.]</inline> We are entitled to some explanation of the change of attitude of a number of honorable members, and, in fact, of the Committee generally, on this item. It is somewhat extraordinary that, without any explanation whatever, the Committee should now be prepared to re-impose a duty originally brought in by the Government, and removed by the  Committee  on a previous occasion absolutely without discussion. The honorable member for Kooyong stated that there was a private concern established, I presume in Melbourne, which had invested a sum of £50,000. </para>

The honorable member for Kooyong, as a representative of the commercial . community here, must have known six months ago of the existence of this most important and mysterious firm. It manufactures blankets, and, incidentally, cotton wool, and because of that the Committee is going to stultify itself in the eyes of the people of Australia. If the Committee is determined to stultify itself, I suppose it will do so, but I should be sorry to be in the position of honorable members who are now prepared ,to reverse their votes without any tangible valid reasons, and to show themselves to be men without solid convictions. - </para>

                    <para>. - The Government took credit last year for. introducing a scientific Tariff, and they now take further credit for accepting improvements suggested by the Senate, which will make it still more scientific. When we examine this and a related item, we find a most extraordinary instance of scientific construction. The Government apparently desire, and have sought by other methods, to encourage the cotton-growing industry in Australia. To assist the manufacture of cotton yarn they have imposed duties of 15 per cent. . (general Tariff), and io per cent. (United Kingdom)'. . But they regard the production of cotton wool, which is a mere by7product of the cotton industry, as' of such great importance, and their  Tariff is made so scientific, that they propose a higher duty -  20  per cent. - on the waste. That is a most- extraordinary system to be called scientific. If cotton can be produced  payably  in Queensland or elsewhere - a fact not yet bv any means proved, because there is a great labour difficulty, in connexion with it - and the Government desire to encourage the industries which flow from that production, which should they protect most? Surely the yarn, which is the basis of the weaving industry. But they propose instead to encourage the production of the cotton 'waste, as it is very well called, by a duty of 20 per cent., while' they impose duties of only 15' and 10 per cent, on the yarn - and I understand that even those are. suspended until there is sufficient production of yarn in Australia to justify their imposition. The Minister has not explained that. It is a most extraordinary grading of the Tariff. If the yarn should have duties of only 15 and 10 per cent., this item should either be free or bear a duty of something like 5 per cent., even from a protectionist stand-point. In accepting this request, the Minister is not improving his Tariff by means of Senate suggestions, as he indicated was his desire, but is actually creating anomalies, and producing an undesirable difference .between the partially finished product - cotton yarn - and the mere waste product of the industry - cotton wool. I intend to oppose the proposal. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister should certainly give the Committee some reasonable explanation of his proposal to accept a request for an increase in the taxation upon the backs of the people. Where is this sort of thing going to end? Are not the Government going to assert the eminent right of this Chamber to control the public purse, or are we to submit to every demand of the Senate for the increasing of taxation? The Minister should give the Committee a reasonable, sensible, and proper account of the considerations which have- induced the Government to ask us to make the requested amendment. </para>

When .the Tariff was before- us last year, the Government told us that it had been prepared after exhaustive 'inquiry and consideration, and that it was, in the opinion, of Ministers, perfect. The Protectionist section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 5 per cent, on the articles now under discussion, but the Government proposed duties of 20 'and 15 per cent.' The' Committee refused to entertain that proposal, and made the item free. We should not go back  on  that decision without the fullest reason for doing so. ;' </para>

                    <para>.-! hope that the Minister will not be deaf to this reasonable proposal. Is he so slavishly bent upon following the indications' of the will of the other branch of the Federal Legislature that he will not remove striking anomalies when pointed put to him. There must be a certain degree of harmony even  in this discordant Tariff. Surely this pro-  position must commend itself to the good' sense of the Minister. He cannot reconcile the proposal for high duties on a waste product with a- lower rate on a finished article. No large amount pf revenue is affected. by the proposed reduction. Were  £1,000,000  or ,£2,060,000 at stake, the Minister might have a good excuse for his attitude. As no large amount of revenue is concerned, surely he will, to, improve, the symmetry of a Tariff which is to hand down his fame, and that of the Treasurer, to future generations, remove the inconsistency which has been pointed out, either by reducing these duties, or by increasing the duties on cotton yarn. The honorable member for North Sydney,- who is eminently reasonable in all his proposals, has repressed his indignation at the Tariff in order to expedite public business, and I hope that .the Minister will not show himself bound in some mysterious way to concede the request of the Senate. Had it been pointed out in the Senate that the duties on cotton yarn are  only  15 and 10 per cent., the request would, I think, have been for similar duties on this item. </para>

                    <para>.- I recognise ' that it is utterly hopeless to endeavour to elicit any information from the. Minister of Trade and Customs as to the reasons which have induced the Government to adopt their present change of front. Consequently I am compelled myself to formulate reasons for the attitude which they now take up. I have noticed that in Australia there are three classes who are granted protection.  There are those individuals who operate the great industries of the country, and who - if protection can be justified at all - deserve to receive a fair measure of it. Then there are those who are powerful in pocket ; and lastly there are those who are powerful in politics. The two last-mentioned classes, receive most protection. 'Is it because the particular firm to which the Minister of Trade and Customs referred is a highly important and prosperous one that we are now asked - without any reason being assigned - to reverse the decision at which we arrived six months ago? </para>

But like a good many others, he either did not know of the existence of this firm, or he thought that it was sufficiently established not to require protection.

                        <para>- I do not know whether the honorable member is in order in refer-' ring to me as "hide-bound," especially when I am. dealing with "cotton wool." I listened very carefully to my honorable friend,, and I must say that upon ' this occasion he did not address, himself to the question under consideration with his customary lucidity and dignity, nor did he make out a case for a' reversal of the Committee's previous decision. He has done me an injustice in asserting that I cannot appreciate sense because it struck me that his arguments were parti'cularly flimsy. In this matter only one of two persons can be at fault - either the honorable member or myself., With the utmost deference I suggest that the. fault may not be mine. I should like to ask the honorable member whether he thinks that the firm to which allusion has been made is sufficiently important to warrant this Committee in stultifying itself for the purpose of bestowing a benefit upon it. That is the only, reason which can be urged for the Ministerial change of. front. . It is purely a question of the interests of one firm. In the politics of protection, I understand that one swallow can make a summer, but in this case one firm will make a particularly large swallow if it receives the .benefit of the duty proposed. </para>

Laycock, Son, and Nettleton. If, during his leisure, he will accompany me, I- shall have very great pleasure in showing him over the works, established by that .firm in this city. I have just telephoned to one of its members, and I have been informed that last year the firm used 250,000 lbs. of» cotton, which cost 4d. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- I have been assured by one of the principals of the firm that last year- about 250,000 lbs. of cotton were put into their various manufactures. Both in Sydney and in Melbourne a very valuable industry has been established which I am sure deserves every encouragement at our hands. A Bradford firm have established themselves here, and we ought to be satisfied that the industry is one that deserves such support as we can reasonably be expected to give in the form of a fair and moderate protective duty. As to the change of view that has taken place in the case of some honorable members, I quite agree that the position is anomalous. The Government originally proposed duties 'of 20 and 1.5 per cent. Like many another item in tEe Tariff, this one. slipped through at an inopportune moment. I do not know- why the Government allowed it to slip through. .Probably if the' leader of the Opposition had been in charge of the business, he would have exercised greater vigilance, and would have been more sue- cessful. ' Had I been present, I should unquestionably have voted for the duties wHich the Government then proposed. The firm in. question is a reputable' and important one: I believe they purchase all the cotton grown in Australia. It has been shown that cotton can be successfully cultivated in this country. This Parliament has agreed to grant a bonus for its production. Here is a firm which will use a material the production of which this Parliament, has in its wisdom decided to encourage. Without the duty the firm will have to abandon the industry. </para>

                        <para>- There is perfect justification for imposing the duties, though I quite agree that the position is anomalous, and that the Government ought to explain their attitude. For the life of .me I cannot understand why the Government, having proposed originally duties of 20 and 15 per cent., did not insist upon that proposition being carried, or, at least, take a division upon it. Therefore I think that my honorable friend the honorable member for Wentworth might have addressed his inquiries to the Government. </para>

                        <para>- That makes  no difference. If the . name had been given by a member of the Opposition, I should say the same thing. If is undesirable that we should fix duties according to the circumstances of particular firms. I have proposed that the. duties shall be 15 and 10 per cent. I have done 'that, not because I approve of a duty at all ; indeed, I think that sufficient reasons have been given why the item should be free. But I certainly' desire to see some equality in our Tariff proposals, and, inasmuch as we have fixed duties of 15 and 10 per cent, on yarn, which is the more finished product, how can we possibly' justify a duty of 20 per cent, on cotton wool ? It was urged when we passed the duty on yarn that it was anticipated that a firm- in Australia would undertake the manufacture. It is now understood that the firm is making preparations, and are expected to proceed, with the business. May not that firm reasonably say that an improper differentiation has been' made if, after placing duties of 15 and 10 per cent, on yarn, we now impose duties of 20 and 15 per cent, on cotton wool ? The honorable member for Kooyong surely does not wish to make the Tariff more incongruous than it is. Of course, as long as the Minister can secure votes for his proposals, he does not care whether there is' incongruity or not. </para>

                        <para>- Here is proof of the statement. The Minister sticks to the. letter of the Tariff even if a typographical error is challenged. Any number, of errors and incongruities can be mentioned, but the Minister takes no notice. He will vote for the higher duties no matter what may be their relationship to other duties. But the Committee ought not to adopt a course that is absolutely against all protectionist principles, as will be done if we impose higher duties on the waste of an industry than on the finished product. </para>

                    <para>.- After listening to the remarks of the honorable member for Kooyong, I perceive that he is giving effect to his statement on the hustings, that he would not ruin any Australian industry, especially a Victorian one. This appears to be a South Melbourne industry, although the firm has a branch in Queensland. The honorable member for Wentworth has referred to the firm in question as being a 'mysterious one. I- do not think that it is very mysterious. Certainly the firm is doing trade to the extent of £40,000 or £60,000 per annum in the Commonwealth. In a letter which the. firm has issued, they say - </para>

All they want is protection, and if they get the necessary protection they will not only reduce the cost of manufacture, but they hope - life is only hope when all is said and done ! - to reduce the price.

The Tariff, as introduced, provided for duties of 20 and 15 per cent., but immediately the item was called on the Treasurer, on his own initiative, and not. as suggested by the Minister of Trade and Customs, at the request of the Opposition, asked the Committee to agree to an amendment providing that on and after 14th November, 1907,. it should be free. The Minister was asked whether he would not, consider the interests of firms engaged in the manufacture of wadding and cotton wool, and he replied that he preferred to rely on the reports of his officers rather than upon the recommendations of any interested firm.

                    <para>.- We have in this item another illustration of the clumsy and unscientific character of the Tariff. We have been told that a reputable firm has' invested £50,000 in the industry to which' this item relates. There are machinery: works in my electorate in which over £300,000 has been invested, but whilst the Government invite the Committee to impose a duty of 20 per cent. 011 wadding and cotton wool, they were prepared, in con'nexion with machinery items relating to an industry giving employment to thousands' of men, to agree to duties of 15 per cent., 1 2 £ per cent., 10 per cent., and 5 per cent. In some cases machinery items have been made free. If the Government are so"' anxious to build up- industries why do they allow the metal and machinery industries a protection of only 15 and' i2| per cent.,' whilst in this case they ask the Committee to vote for a duty of 20 per cent. ? Goethe says that man ie either a hammer or an" anvil. It seems to me that in this case the Government are the hammer, and are constantly hammering at the House to pass increased duties. The Opposition repre-' sent the anvil. We are probably true steel,' but , in view of our numbers we can 'do <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> more than give forth sparks of indignation every time we . are hit with the hammer." Had I the most dire disease from which' literary men surfer - the disease of " adjectiveitis " - I might coin adjectives to describe the clumsy work that is now being carried out by a Protectionist Government. Imagine bur being asked to vote for this' requested duty because there is "a repu-table firm " engaged in the industry concerned. Are there hot reputable men in all industries? As- I have said, there are works in my electorate in which £300,000 has been invested, and although we are told that £50,000 has been invested in local works in which cotton and wadding is made, we have to remember that blankets' and other goods are made there, and that the manufacture of wadding is only an auxiliary. The honorable member for Maranoa said1 very bluntly, but forcibly, "I am prepared to give this man what I gave the other bloke," and adopting his' expressive phraseology I may say that my desire is to see the other " bloke " to whom I have referred treated as it is proposed' to treat the " bloke " engaged in this in-' dustry. I am at a loss to understand how the Minister of Trade and Customs can' work up any enthusiasm in support of this request, having regard to the fact that various machinery items are dutiable at much lower rates. I Said at the outset of the debate on the Tariff that I recognised that I was in a scramble, but I never dreamt of seeing honorable members scrambling for a 20 per cent. duty on such an item as this whilst far more important items are put on the free list. </para>

If, as the honorable member says, there is a discrepancy between these duties and the duties on yarn, I can only regret that we are not in a position to increase the duties on yarn. The use of the letters " N.E.I." is an indication that some wadding is treated in a different way, and honorable members should be aware that wadding used in hospitals is free of duty. The fact remains that these are protective duties. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so, but it only proves what I have said. From information received subsequent to the publication of the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, the Government decided' to recommend duties of 20 and 15 per cent. Then, probably owing to the stress of circumstances in the Committee, the Treasurer' permitted the item to be made free, and now, after still further evidence has been produced, it is thought advisable to renew the proposal the Government made in the first instance, and impose duties of 20 and 15 per cent. The honorable member for Kooyong knew well what he was. talking about, and the firm to whom he referred made the statement that under the 20 and 15 per cent. duties they did not increase their price, and had no intention of doing so. All they desire is a larger market, which means for them an increased output at a reduced cost of manufacture, and they express the hope that the price will also be reduced. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to express my obligation to the honorable member for Kooyong, who seems to be the only member of the Committee who is able to extract a fair explanation . from Ministers. Week after week I am here demanding explanations , from the Government on all sorts of subjects, and  . I  never get a single satisfactory reply. The honorable member, for  Kooyong . rises, and for once. adopts a threatening attitude, and the Government are on their knees before him at once to repeat what they have said a dozen times before. I hope that the honorable member will in future exercise his great influence on the Government more frequently. In spite of explanations that have been given, I am unable to find a reference to the importation of1 lb. of this cotton wool or wadding in the statistical returns of imports tor 1906. In a statement put before honorable members when the Tariff was introduced, the Government set out the imports under each heading, but were unable to show that 1 lb. of this material had been imported. ' The statement made by the honorable member for Kooyong was lucid, but it gave no real information to the Committee. The honorable member spoke of the importation of 250,000 lbs. of cotton. No. man has a clearer view of financial questions, and the honorable member must have been smiling at himself when he made the statement. I propose to put him on his conscience, and he has not been put on that for years. When he spoke a little time ago of 250,000 lbs. of cotton being imported- </para>

                        <para>- I am obliged to the honorable member for the correction. The statement is that 250,000 lbs. of cotton is used in the factory of the honorable member's . friends who are on the telephone, and who evidently sweat their employes, or they would not be working at 9 o'clock in the evening. -I ought not to joke at the expense of the firm, and of course I intend no imputation upon so eminent and important a firm as the one referred to. The moment my honorable friend mentions the name of a firm it becomes important. My point is that the impression conveyed by the honorable member for Kooyong is that the firm referred to uses 250,000 lbs. of cotton each year in the manufacture of wadding and cotton wool, when we know that it is also used in other articles of manufacture turned out by the firm. </para>

That of course would be a wrong inference to draw. Up to the present the ear was the only part of the human form that was not affected by the Tariff. Thousands of people suffer from ear-ache, and it 'is possible that persons who visit the public galleries of this Chamber sometimes suffer from such an attack. . Now it is proposed that any one who suffers from ear-ache must pay a duty of 20 per cent. on the wadding or cotton wool which he uses. </para>

                        <para>- Surely honorable members opposite are not automata that accept whatever is put before them without reasonable explanation ? I feel that it is hopeless to endeavour to induce honorable members to act reasonably in this matter. The Government having had this article free for years under the first Tariff proposed that it should be dutiable at 20 and 15 per cent. Then the Treasurer invited the Committee to negative that proposal. He said lie would not listen to reports of interested firms. That was his attitude before the Committee and the country, and now because some one elsewhere has listened to the reports of interested persons, who if their business has been established for some time have been, manufacturing this article without the assistance of a duty, the Committee -is again invited to. impose the ; duties which -the Government themselves proposed should be abolished. How can we expect to frame a satisfactory Tariff in this way ? The honorable member for North" Sydney, who is always anxious to pursue a moderate course, suggests as a compromise duties of  15 and 10 per cent., putting the item on the same basis as cotton yarn, which is a far more difficult article to manufacture. I hope that the Minister will accept the compromise. </para>

The honorable member for Kooyong has extended to me a public invitation to visit the establishment of the firm to whom he has referred.

                        <para>- Some doubt was expressed as to these goods being manufactured here, but the Department have ascertained that such is the fact; and I dare say I shall be able to tell the honorable member privately the names of the firms. I am advised that the request of the Senate has nothing to recommend it, because the breaking .up of the item would give rise to the annoyances which were experienced in the Department under the Tariff of 1902, to overcome which the present wording was proposed. In&gt; justice to the manufacturers, it ought to be said that there are imported some lines of men's half hose made, of cotton, in the case of which, when the weaving' is completed, there is a mere dusting of wool, blown on by a special process; and  these, goods, are sold as woollen socks to purchasers who know no better. It was this class of goods that caused the annoyance in the examination of hosiery under the old Tariff.  Honorable  members will recognise the difficulty there must be in distinguishing between the. different classes, of goods ; and there is, as I . have said, the absurdity of taxing the raw material and admitting the finished article free. </para>

I can quite understand the honorable member, from his free-trade stand-point, holding the opinion that we ought to accept all amendments of this character; but, from the protectionist stand-point of encouraging industry, and affording employment, there is every reason for, objecting to them, apart altogether from . the difficulties experienced by the Department to which I have referred. We have to take a great deal on trust at the Customs, where not one-tenth or one-twentieth of the goods passed can be examined. </para>

                    <para>.- The only question that arises here is in reference to cotton socks and stockings. Of course, Australia can produce the raw- material of the woollen goods in profusion; but we do not profess to produce cotton, which, when imported, would simply have to be stitched together info socks, and would not give rise to much of an industry, even, if the local articles were better than those imported. Is this not an item on- which a free run can be given to people who use the cheaper, kinds of socks and stockings?.' </para>

There cannot be much in an item of this kind from the point of view of an Australian industry, until we have cotton production established, which is a matter of the future. I think we might allow the people to have one cheap line in the Tariff'; and, as for revenue, the Government are receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds more than they expected. </para>

                    <para>.- 1 suggest that the Committee first decide in reference to paragraphs a and c, and then discuss paragraph b. I have here three samples of woollen socks made in Australia, two of them at is. a pair, and one for very heavy work, such as  navvying,  at is. 6d. I am perfectly satisfied that no Australian workman,, would wear' cotton socks after an experience of such woollen socks as these. Woollen socks have one great advantage over the cotton article, in that they are much easier to darn. I do not know whether, the leader of the Opposition takes any exception- to the. elimination, of the Senate's suggestions, except in regard to paragraph b?   </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister has told us that if the Senate's amendment in regard to cotton socks and stockings is made, the revenue will suffer to the extent of £20,000 per annum, and yet he told us that the manufacture of socks and stockings is a great national industry in Victoria, which will be destroyed unless it is protected. I have- heard many protectionists say that they are opposed to revenue duties. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has said that. </para>

There might well be a duty on silk stockings and socks, because those who wear such articles can afford to pay taxation. Woollen socks and stockings might also be made dutiable. But there should be no duty on the cotton socks and stockings which are used by the working classes. The Government' wishes to impose the same duty upon the clothing of the poor as on the clothing of the wealthy. </para>

They are a very good article, but a little rougher than the imported cotton socks at 6d. per pair which I hold in my hand. One sock brought under my notice was made of very common cotton yarn mixed with short fibre that had most likely been sweepings from a tweed manufactory. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harold</inline> Sampson, hosiery ' manufacturer, Richmond, gave the following evidence' to the Tariff Commission-  71.520.

A Nottingham hosiery company tried to do its own dyeing, but could not, and ultimately followed the American example by establishing a factory in Germany. . The machine that made the heavier and coarser sock which I have here would not be good enough to make this much finer article, which one can see through. There are a few  cotton . socks made here, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Youl,</inline> of South Melbourne, manufactures them for the military and also for the benevolent asylums. I have heard to-day, for the first time, that we in Victoria are cruel enough to put cotton socks upon the old and helpless people in the benevolent asylums. I am glad that this debate has brought that fact under my notice, for I shall  never, in the future, contribute one penny-piece to any institution which puts cotton socks on the feet of old people. When splendid socks like the pair I hold in my hand can be obtained for is. a pair, it is contemptible and uncharitable to save a few paltry pence at the expense of the comfort of the old people. It is an infamy that any hospital or benevolent asylum, or home for the aged poor, should do such a thing. The Minister may ask how it is that I, who am so strong a protectionist, should take the stand I am taking on. this item. ' But, as a protectionist, I recognise, with the true free-trader, that we should not draw one penny-piece from the Customs House. We ought to go even as far as to prohibit the importation, of what we can make for our own citizens, but what we cannot, and do not, manufacture, should be admitted free of duty. If the Minister wants to have, a duty upon these articles, let the Government set up a national workshop for the manufacture of them; and, as soon as that undertaking can produce enough to supply even half the community, let him impose a duty of 100 per cent, if he likes, and he can command my vote. But until that is done, I object to mulcting one out of every two of the adult citizens of Australia by means of a revenue duty </para>

                    <para>.- If honorable members desire to protect woollen hosiery, and to admit cotton hosiery free, they might just as well take a big slice off the duty levied on woollen hosiery, because the latter comes into competition with the former. T think that we should deal with cotton hosiery precisely as we dealt' with other kinds of hosiery. If honorable members have taken the trouble to read the reports of the Tariff Commission, they will know that practically every merchant who was examined asked that there should be a uniform duty levied on hosiery. I am anxious that we should impose a duty On cotton socks, because, at the instance of a representative of Queensland, we levied a duty on cotton yarns, I presume for the purpose of having them worked up here. I want the people who are engaged in the hosiery industry to have a chance to compete with the imported articles. I am not taking this stand merely because the largest hosiery factory as well as another small one happens to be situated in my electorate, I trust that the Committee will hot agree to the Senate's request, because if we do, we shall be destroying a possible industry, and that is the cotton sock industry. The honorable member for Melbourne has contended that people in  benevo-lent  asylums should not wear cotton socks: In my opinion, they should' not be worn by any person if they are prejudicial to the health of the community. I should be prepared to prohibit their introduction, but. of course, that cannot be done at this stage. I believe that woollen socks are the best and most healthy, .and I shall not vote to. make it e:sv for an unhealthy article to be imported and worn by the people 'of </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that it is worth while to read the. whole of the letter, as it is very  long, and therefore I shall only quote a few statements therefrom. The writers say that they make cotton socks, and that the trade prices are 6d.., is., and is. 6d. They assert, that if the articles were admitted free the public would be charged exactly the same prices as they are charged now, and the importers would make from 50 to 70 per cent. profit, whereas if the duty were retained they would make only half that amount. Honorable members will not be reducing the price to the- people of this country if they allow f the articles to come in free.. The importer will get the profit, and the people will not reap a benefit from the removal of the duty. The honorable member for Melbourne said that the Germans are the only people who have the  right kinds of dyes and can manufacture cotton socks. </para>

                        <para>- Yet the Japanese make a large number of socks and stockings and send them to Australia. When I was in Japan some time ago I was surprised to learn that nearly the whole of the cotton singlets used in Australia were manufactured there. Prior <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> that time they ' were all imported  from England, but now the Japanese have secured .almost a monopoly of the trade with Australia. If we wish to protect the woollen industry we shall not achieve our purpose by admitting 'all these manufactured cotton goods free. ' It is the most difficult thing in the world for an ordinary person to distinguish between a cotton sock and a merino sock or a cotton stocking and a merino stocking. If we levy the duty proposed our people will be afforded a much better chance of wearing woollen socks. </para>

                    <para>. - The remarks of the honorable member for Yarra, the honorable member for Fawkner, and the honorable member for Balaclava, remind me of ancient history. An account which I read some years ago related how in the Old Country a tax was placed upon every person who did not wear woollen clothes. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Balaclava read -an official document which has been forwarded to the Customs Department by the persons interested in this industry. But I ask him as a reasonable man  whether - if cotton socks and stockings are being made in Victoria to the extent that that document indicates - we should derive a revenue from this item alone of £20,000 annually ? The idea is preposterous upon its face. The honorable member for Yarra stated that a protective duty would have the effect of inducing people to wear woollen socks and stockings  But are we to tax the whole community - the wives, daughters, and sisters of the workers who are interested in this matter - for the sake of a small manufacturer who is turning out half-a-dozen pairs of socks weekly in South Melbourne? We all know that it is a matter of impossibility fpr many' persons to wear woollen goods. If the honorable member for Melbourne sticks to his guns, I trust that the Committee will support him. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that this is an occasion upon which the Committee can act with a certain degree of liberality towards the great mass of the people of Australia. There is no suggestion that the making up of cotton material into socks is an important industry here, whilst there are tens and hundreds of thousands to whom this is a matter of great importance. I should like to relieve the anxiety of the honorable member for Balaclava in regard to the terrible danger to be apprehended from Japanese cotton socks' invading the Australian market and paralyzing the industry at South Melbourne. V find that in 1906, out of a total importation of £150,000 worth of cotton socks and stockings, the enormous sum of £[155 worth came from Japan. Lest the danger of a flood of Chinese cotton socks and stockings should appal the honorable member, I may mention that the imports from Hong Kong during the same year were valued at £1. The fact of the matter is that the woollen manufacturers are not satisfied with the enormous increased protection which they are receiving under this Tariff - an increase of 100 per cent , I. think. </para>

                        <para>- Then I was wrong in saying that there had been an increase of 100 per cent. But the fact remains that there has been a very substantial increase. Having granted that increase, surely we might allow the people who cannot afford to wear - or who do not wish to wear -  woollen  socks, to obtain cotton socks free of duty. It was only 10 per cent, under the Tariff which operated from 1902 to 1907. </para>

                        <para>- I should prefer 10 per cent. to 20 or 25. But I really think that when honorable members consider the hundreds of thousands of pounds of extra taxation which are put upon the bulk of the people of Australia they will recognise that this is an occasion when we might impose a low duty. This Tariff, as honorable members are aware, will yield anything up to something like £2,000,000 more in actual cash - Australian cash - taken out of the pockets of Australians. Surely honorable members opposite can afford to let the purchasers of these articles, which are not articles of Australian manufacture, have a cheap line. I hope - of course, I admit that the odds are all against it, but still I hope - that as there is no substantial Australian industry involved, the great mass of the people will on this occasion have the benefit of liberal treatment. </para>

                    <para>. - It is surprising to me to observe the amount of interest that is taken in this question of cotton socks and stockings. Honorable members opposite have been piling on the duties line after line, and have imposed upon the great mass of the people taxation to an enormous extent. The honorable member for Maranoa is really upset over the question of' cotton socks and stockings having to bear a duty, although, notwithstanding that he is a free-trader, he has agreed to enormous duties on many other lines. The honorable member professes to represent the masses of the people as do other members of the party to which he belongs. </para>

                        <para>- But, nevertheless, these representatives of the masses of the people impose enormous taxes upon them. They increase taxation upon the goods that those whom they represent alone have to buy, and then call themselves representatives of the workers. There is a large section of the people of this country who are unable to buy woollen socks or stockings. The members of the Labour Party are apparently so unfamiliar with the life of the poorer classes that they do not know that the children of the humblest section of the community nearly all wear cotton socks. </para>

                        <para>- I am opposing indirect taxation. Honorable members opposite are nothing but political humbugs. Here is a body of men calling themselves the Labour Party, who have not even seen the little children going to school in white cotton socks. Go to the poorest parts of any city in Australia, and you will see nothing but cotton socks worn by the children. Go to South Melbourne, which I believe is represented by the honorable member who has been interjecting so frequently to-night, and you will find that most of the children going to school wear cotton socks. These honorable members profess to represent the working people, and yet they are imposing taxation to the extent of £20,000 a year upon cotton socks and stockings. 'These gentlemen are, I say again, political humbugs, who are trading upon the cry of representing the masses of the people, although they are piling up duties which have to be paid exclusively by the poor. The honorable member for Yarra has admitted that no industry has been established, but says that one may be established. </para>

                        <para>- Where is the consistency of people who profess to be enthusiastic in the cause of the poorer classes, and who nevertheless increase taxation upon them? Another set of honorable members are in favour of the duty because £20,000 per annum will be lost to the revenue if it is not imposed. The only satisfaction that I can derive from this Tariff is that in States like Tasmania and Queensland the poorer people are paying less than they formerly paid. There is a shortage, of revenue. What does it mean? It means that the poor people of those States are paying less taxation, whilst more money is being taken out of the pockets of the people of the States where the .revenue is raised from other sources. Yet we find honorable members favouring these duties because they will raise revenue. </para>

They are imported, and evidently they are worn by some one. The people who wear them do so because they cost less than socks and stocking's made of superior material. If we place a duty upon them we shall be taxing the poor people. If honorable members opposite represent the poor as well as the rich, as they profess to do, they will vote to put cotton socks and stockings upon the free list. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Balaclava said that there were fixed retail prices for cotton socks and stockings in Australia, and that if the duty were removed the only result would be that the importers would make a larger profit at the expense of the general ' consumer. My information is' that the duty which the honorable member would have imposed will not put up the prices, but will put down the quality. I have before me two pairs of cotton stockings,  one pair having been imported  ,under  the  old Tariff, and the other  imported  under  the present  Tariff.  Both are  sold  at is. per pair. The quality of the  pair imported under  the present duty  is infinitely inferior to  the  quality of that imported  prior to this Tariff coming into  force. It is invoiced at 5s. 3d. per dozen as against the invoiced price of - 6s. per dozen' in respect of stockings imported under the old Tariff, and both are sold at is. per pair. That shows clearly that this duty will not prevent people from wearing cotton socks and stockings, but that it will lead to their being supplied with an article of much poorer quality. I wish to put it strongly that if honorable members have any thought for the poorest people in this community they will not endeavour to compel them to wear hosiery inferior to that which they now use, which, Heaven knows, is poor enough. </para>

                    <para>. - The debate on the Tariff has disclosed the fact that in this House there are protectionists and protectionists. There  are  those  who strongly advocate protective  duties  to encourage industries that give promise  of being established on a self-supporting basis ; there are others who are prepared to advocate taxation through the Customs, and to so allocate it that whilst being a powerful means of raising revenue it will also have a protective incidence. Those who support protective duties* to establish local industries are not in favour of purely revenue duties, and I understand that the honorable member for Melbourne, who has so ably placed this question before the Committee, comes within that category. He desires to establish  industries  by. means of protective duties ; but he is not  in  favour of Customs taxation merely for the purpose of raising revenue. The ' Minister  of  Trade and Custom's has urged that we should accept this request for the reason, amongst others, that if the honorable member for Melbourne's proposition were agreed to we should lose a good deal of revenue. I think that he was justified in placing that phase of the question before the Committee, but I. would ask those who do not believe in Customs duties for' merely revenue purposes to keep that fact in mind. Many people must necessarily wear cotton socks or stockings. Climatic conditions throughput a large part of the Commonwealth  render the use of such hosiery almost imperative, and it is absurd for the sake of encouraging a local industry to endeavour to compel those residing' in the warmer parts of Australia to use woollen hosiery. If this duty be imposed, they will be .compelled either, to purchase these goods at a greatly enhanced price and thereby to add materially to the revenue from Customs taxation, or to do  without such wear. It has also been urged with much force that cotton hosiery is used largely by the poorer classes, and that this tax will fall heavily upon the worker - upon the miner and even the factory hand engaged in other industries. It will press very heavily upon the working man with a family, who has to provide his children with hosiery, and it will be still another charge upon his slender income. I do not think that it is the desire of the protectionists of the Labour Party to' impose burdens upon the poor in this connexion. It has been admitted by the Minister of Trade and Customs that one strong reason for asking the Committee to agree to this increase is that it is necessary' to .make good a loss of revenue in other directions.. </para>

                    <para>. - On more than one occasion, I have said that my only object in supporting protective duties is to encourage the manufacture of the dutiable articles in Australia. I have not supported duties merely for the purpose of. raising revenue, because I believe that revenue should be collected in some other way. When the Tariff was previously before the Committee, I did not quote from , reports of either the free- trade or protectionist sections of the Tariff Commission, because I could never discover' which section told the truth. In every case one or the other must have been- saying what- ' was untrue. When one honorable member quoted in support of a (proposal the report of the protectionist section, another quoted in opposition to it the report of the' free- trade section, and the result was chaos. Strangely enough, I find that both sections of the Tariff Commission were agreed in this .particular case. </para>

The manufacture of this kind of cotton hosiery was confined- to Germany. The Australian manufacturers did not spin cotton yarn. </para>

                <para>These reports proved conclusively to my mind that there was no immediate prospect of the establishment of the manufacture of cotton socks and stockings in Australia, and I therefore deemed it my duty as a protectionist to vote against the imposition of any duties upon these articles. I have learned since that Foy and Gibson, of Collingwood, do. manufacture cotton socks, and I have also been told that they are manufactured by  a   firm in my own electorate. It will be ad mitted that I have always fought hard to get for my constituents what they require. I know the manufacturer, in South Melbourne who has been referred to; and I knew his father before him as a manufacturer of excellent woollen goods, but until this evening I never heard that they manufactured cotton socks or stockings. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but the Committee sat in 1906 and 1907, and I admit that much might have happened since they took evidence. As a protectionist. I have contended that the imposition of a protective duty does not necessarily increase- the price of the dutiable article where there is local manufacture as well as importation But if we imposed a duty on cotton socks and stockings when these articles are not manufactured here, I am certain that without local competition the result would be. that the importer would raise the price in proportion to the duty. I am aware that when people have been accustomed to pay a certain price for an article, they strongly object if they are asked to pay a higher price. In voting as I intend to do, . to make cotton socks and stockings free of duty, I hold that I shall not be departing from true protectionist principles, as no satisfactory evidence has been adduced that- these articles are being commercially manufactured in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I happen to know that the cotton socks and stockings so largely used by adults and children in Australia are made chiefly in Germany. The reason is .that the secret of the dyeing of these articles is not in the possession of the manufacturers of any other country. British manufacturers, have for many years tried in vain tocutintothetrade,but they have been unable to obtain the secret of the dyeing of the goods. The manufacture of these articles is practically a monopoly in the hands of German manufacturers; There is no possibility of their being manufactured here. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Batman cannot prove that the cotton socks and stockings to which I refer are being made here. As a matter of fact, they cannot be made here. The honorable member for Calare has pointed out that climatic conditions make it a matter of choice with a majority of the people of Australia to wear cotton socks. I know that I prefer cotton to woollen socks for summer wear. As one who professes protectionist principles, I am unable to vote for a tax upon an article- which is largely used by the community which is not made, and is not likely to be made here, and which, to all intents and (purposes, is a monopoly in the hands of the manufacturers of one country who have not permitted the secret of their manufacture to be discovered even by the manufacturers of older nations of the world. </para>

                        <para>- The Custom, returns, however, show that about . 95 per cent. of the woollen hosiery comes from Great Britain, and, therefore, the increase has not been 66 per cent., but only about 33 . per cent., the duty being 26 per cent. against Great Britain, whereas in the previous Tariff it was 15 per cent. The imports of cotton hosiery in 1904 were valued at £128,000, in 1905 at132,000, and in 1906 at £155,000 while the imports of woollen hosiery in the same years were valued at -£265,000, £290,000, and  £313,000 respectively. The increase in the duty on woollen hosiery has been -little enough, and I should have preferred, it to remain, at the original figure, namely, 25. per cent. all round, with no preference. It has been suggested that some honorable . members are voting against the request of the Senate in order that the revenue may be maintained. But the revenue aspect does not appeal to me; I am voting as a' protectionist, because cotton socks and stockings can be made here as well as can woollen socks and stockings. If the re-  quest be granted, there will be a duty on the raw material, while the finished article will be free. </para>
