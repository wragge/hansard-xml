Pratt, commission agent, of West&#39; Devonport, Tasmania, the writer says that he wishes me to bring under notice -  the continual loss we, as produce agents, are put to through the mutilation of our telegraph messages. On the 2nd of April, I wired a Sydney firm an offer of 20 tons of potatoes, at ?3 17s. 6d. f.o.b. The message despatched through an error in the George Town cable station, read <inline font-style="italic">?3</inline> 7s. 6d., thus causing me a loss of over <inline font-style="italic">?10</inline> 10s. Now, every business firm is responsible for the errors of their servants, but the officials screen their error by stating &#34; no claim can be entertained for compensation.&#34; May I trespass upon your good nature to see into the matter for me? I have it on good authority that a claim of over <inline font-style="italic">?80</inline> was paid by the State Government. </para>

We certainly shall not postpone the consideration of the Senate&#39;s requests on the Customs Tariff Bill to deal with the subject. I do not know what the Premiers of the States intend to do in the matter ; but it may not be necessary to deal with the scheme at the earliest possible date, even after the Customs Tariff Bill has been disposed of. The course taken will depend a great deal on the action of the Premiers. </para>

                        <para>- The scheme submitted by the right honorable member for Swan was one for ten years only as an extension of the Braddon clause, and for reasons then given was put forward because of the urgent desire of the Government to obtain control of a certain portion of the Customs revenue before 1910, to at once introduce a system of old-age pensions. That necessity is now being&#39; removed. </para>

                        <para>- In the summary at the head of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> reprint of the Treasurer&#39;s financial proposals, it is made to appear that it is intended that ^6,000,000 per annum is to be returned to the States for a period of five years, and that the amount is then to be gradually reduced, and finally abolished after a period of thirty years, whilst, in the &#34; recapitulation &#34; paragraph of the scheme, the reduction over thirty years is made applicable to the amount which the States are required to pay the Commonwealth to make up the interest on their respective debts. In order to remove any possible misapprehension, will the Treasurer say whether the summary mentioned is or is not correct? </para>

                        <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation. You know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that I have ho desire to say anything offensive to, or to be on ill terms with any honorable member in this House, and when I interjected a few moments ago I did not intend to suggest that the members of the Labour Party or any other honorable members in this House voted against their moral con- . science. I think that as a general rule, in connexion with our votes, &#39; the question of conscience does not come in. We simply exercise our judgment as to what is the most desirable course to pursue. All that I intended to say was that as I understand the position, members of the Labour Party, when they differ in caucus, on caucus matters are bound to be guided by the decision of the majority, however much they may be individually opposed to the proposition under consideration. </para>

                        <para>- By way of personal explanation, I should like to say that when I interjected, in reply to the right honorable member for Swan, that he was hardly the kind of man to say what he did say,  1,  really said what I fully meant. The right honorable member had a seat in a Cabinet for a very long while, and he gave a number of votes then, which he has since said were entirely wrong. I thought that the right honorable gentleman had given those votes against his conscience, but he- now tells us. that they were errors of judgment merely. I am sure that the Labour Party are quite content to leave the matter at that. </para>

But I regret to say that I did notice, not only the paragraph in question, but also a. long article in a recent number of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> in reference to a similar condition of affairs in New South Wales where there was a demand for land far exceeding the available existing supply. I have seen similar statements made in other States, and regret them, because I hope to see the time when not only the whole of the local demand for land will be met by the States, but we shall also be prepared to find land for a large number of white immigrant settlers. </para>

                            <para>- I may, perhaps, be pardoned for saying that the honorable member&#39;s question, and particularly its conclusion, appears to be incoherent. I have made a statement of facts as to the States, and am not concerned with the question of whether or not a statement of fact is in the interests of or adverse to the Labour Party. I have repeatedly read in newspapers such as the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> - which no one will say is a Labour newspaper - that the number of applicants for lots offered in a particular district was greatly in excess of the blocks available. I regret that such a state of affairs should prevail in Australia, and think it can and ought to be altered. I saw the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price&#39;s</inline> speech, and noted that his remarks were associated with a reference to the proposed locking of the Murray. It is perfectly certain that when that great work is accomplished thousands of acres now carrying units will be able to support scores of families. </para>

                    <para>.- I  understood last night that the Treasurer intended to devise some means of preventing this item being duplicated. The honororable gentleman pointed out that, under the heading of &#34;j &#34; we had already voted for, I think, an immediate duty of  3&#188;d.,  whereas now we have a proposal for a duty of  4d.,  consequent to a proclamation. The Treasurer seemed to think last night that my proposal to eliminate the words embarrassed him in dealing with the Tariff, by leaving the two items therein ; but  1  point out that the two items would be in the Tariff in any case. Supposing my proposal to eliminate the words were not made, we should then be in the peculiar position of still having the item of lubricating oil in two places, subject to an immediate duty of  3&#188;d.,  and to a duty of  4d.,  following on a proclamation. It will be seen, therefore, that this amendment does not in any way add to the embarrassment caused by the duplicate proposals.; and I suggest to the Treasurer that he could very easily get: rid of one of these duties by a recommittal. </para>

                        <para>- Then the only question before us is whether the duty shall be  3&#188;d.  as passed, or  4d.,  as proposed by the Senate, the latter being not an immediate duty, but one pursuant to a proclamation. I think the Committee has shown very clearly that they desire to get rid of the principle of making duties depend on a proclamation to be used hereafter. We all desire to know exactly what the Tariff is going to be, and to have it settled without liability to having the question disturbed at some future time by a proposal on the part of the Government for a proclamation to be indorsed by both Houses. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Parkes is quite right in saying that I postponed the further consideration of this item in order that I might inquire into the effect of the proposal made. I have satisfied myself that whether the paragraph  jj  is in or not, no harm can be done. But it is better to take one of thej&#39;s out, and if that be done, then the question as to the duty of 4d. and 33/4d. will have to be decided. On the decision of the latter question, the duty carried will take precedence. i do not intend to oppose the proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has not explained why petroleum spirit should be dutiable. We have been asked to impose duties for the protection of those who are engaged in the making of motor engines, and now we are being asked to tax the oil used to drive such engines. During the winter months a superior oil must be used to get the Australian engines going, whereas imported motors will start with benzine or a cruder oil. The imposition of a duty on naphtha and petrol is against the interests of the makers of engines in Australia. The oil is not produced here. </para>

                    <para>.- As a test of the strength of petroleum spirit I confess that the reference in this paragraph to a specific gravity of less than 790 does not enlighten me very much. If these figures be inserted I do not know what quality of oil will be subjected to duty. But if the request of the Senate would have the effect of imposing a tax upon that necessitous section of the community who dwell in rural districts and who are compelled to use oil as the motive power for their engines, I think that we ought to reject it. If we admit kerosene for illuminating purposes free, but impose a duty upon it when it is used in connexion with rural industries, I think that we shall be guilty of a very grave inconsistency. The proposal of the Treasurer will subject to duty all. the lower grade oils now being utilized for motive power. </para>

                    <para>.- It is generally understood that any spirit with a higher specific gravity than . 790 is kerosene. Any oil with a lower specific gravity is petroleum spirit, and may be used for such purposes as naphtha and benzine are used. We need to exercise great care to prevent petroleum spirit of a less gravity than 790 being introduced ostensibly for industrial purposes, but afterwards being used for domestic purposes. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that we should have some further information respecting this item. It seems to me that it will be very difficult to control the various qualities of these oils by merely placing an embargo upon them through the Customs House. All these oils should, I think, be dealt with under the Commerce Act. I am quite aware that at the present time that Act does not give the Minister power to compel oils of different degrees of strength to be branded, and I think that it requires to be amended in that direction. That is the way in which all the oils used for industrial purposes should be treated. </para>

                    <para>.- It appears to me that a specific gravity of 790 marks the difference between kerosene, and benzine, benzoline, gasoline, pentane, petrol, and turpentine substitutes. This Committee has already decided that kerosene for illuminating purposes shall be admitted free, but it has not decided that other oils shall be so admitted. I am satisfied that if we fix too low a specific gravity many of these oils will be introduced as kerosene, and will afterwards come into competition with- the other oils which are being produced in the Commonwealth. The oils enumerated in this paragraph are used chiefly in. connexion with motor cars and motor boats, and the remarks of the honorable member for Wimmera had reference principally to residual oils. In the mineral oil industry in New South Wales  &#163;  1, 000,000 has already been invested by a company which to-day is capable of supplying the requirements of the Commonwealth. Under such circumstances I am surprised at protectionist members of this Committee casting free-trade votes simply because the industry is not native of their own State. </para>

                        <para>- I think that a limit should be fixed to the specific gravity of kerosene. At the present time there is a large quantity of kerosene upon the market which is being used -in the homes of the poor, and the use of .which is positively dangerous. If we desire to protect the poorer section of the community, we shall see that  only  kerosene of the highest standard is used for illuminating purposes. I am convinced that if the request of the Senate be  rejected,  inferior oils&#39; will be introduced and sold for lighting purposes. </para>

                    <para>. - The Treasurer has stated that the oils specified in this paragraph are not used for motive purposes. As a matter of fact&#39;, they are used for no other purposes. A motor engine in reality is a gas engine. Naphtha and benzine are extremely volatile substances, and as soon as they are mixed with water they are useless. It is their admixture with air which &#39; generates a gas that is the motive power of the ordinary motor. Kerosene possesses a higher specific gravity than .790. The oils mentioned in this paragraph are really spirits which are used for motive power, and for motive power only. The Treasurer is evidently labouring under a misapprehension. </para>

The gas generated must be enclosed in a chamber, and it is the explosion which produces the motive power. The Treasurer has attempted to induce honorable- members to vote with him by declaring that these substances are not used for motive purposes. I hope that the Committee will not be under a misapprehension, as is the Treasurer. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not canvassing the merits of the question, but would point out that the Only alteration requested by the Senate is in respect of the duty. It has not made any request in respect of the wording of the item. The Minister proposes to abolish the item as it stands, and to create a new one. </para>

It is a technical matter, and it is almost impossible for me to say whether the addition of the word  1 crude &#39; &#39; would alter the meaning of the words &#34;residual oils.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I do not think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that you are fully seized with the actual point of order that I wish to raise. I take this point of order with no ulterior object, but if we are allowed in this case to go beyond the request made by the Senate we may have to do so in connexion with other requests. My contention is that if the word &#34; crude &#34; does not alter the article described in the item to which it applies, namely, residual oils, there is no occasion to insert it. If it does, then the Minister is proposing to insert in the item something with which the Senate has not dealt. </para>

                        <para>- I would suggest, on the question of order, that we are not tied to the actual words used in the item. This is not like amending part of a clause in a Bill ; we are dealing with the request of the Senate on a substantive proposal ; and if the addition of this word simply provided for solar oil, without residual oil, it would be competent for us to make the addition, because we should be operating on the amendment suggested by the Senate. We can subject solar oil to a duty and exempt residual&#39; oil, but if the effect is to introduce a new proposal, which does not embrace either solar oil or residual oil, it is not competent for us to make the alteration, </para>

                        <para>- lt is quite competent to make any necessary alteration. For instance, if the Treasurer desired, it would be a fair modification to move that one oil should be subject to a duty of id., and the other oil subject to a duty of &#163;d. But as to the word &#34; crude,&#34; as there has been an objection raised by honorable members who regard it as another item altogether, and as I have no technical knowledge on the subject. I must rule such an amendment out of order. </para>

                        <para>- Protectionists vote for duties in relation to industries that are known to have no prospects of success, and still more do they vote for duties when it is known that an industry will be open to such competition as will regulate prices, apart from any prospective powers we may have in this connexion. I may say that, in addition to the one company already established, there are two other companies, who own equally large and rich deposits, and which are prepared to enter into the business as soon as this duty is  imposed  This shows that, apart from any administrative power, there will be sufficient competition to insure a check on prices. In 1906, there were imported 187,000 gallons of oil, showing that the facility for dumping has been sufficient to subvert the duty, if any, which has hitherto prevailed. At any rate, this importation shows that the protection, up to the present, has not been sufficient to secure the market to our own people; and I appeal to all protectionists to vote with me on this question. </para>

                    <para>.- There is no doubt that this is a substantial industry in New South Wales, and that it is not receiving at the hands of the Government that consideration which might have been expected. There were, as has been stated, 187,000 gallons imported in 1906; and it is indisputable that this oil can be, and will be, supplied within the near future. Expenditure on this industry is going on under able and experienced direction ; and the whole of this importation will be rendered unnecessary by the production in New South Wales and elsewhere. I have myself seen contracts for a supply of over 50,000 gallons of New South Wales oils for use in Victoria in connexion with brickworks. We all know that these various oils are the results of different stages in distillation, solar oil being the third product, and residual oil, of course, a later product. The honorable member for Macquarie, who attaches so much importance to this industry, will act wisely if he accepts the suggestion which has been made. Neither he nor the industry has anything to thank the Treasurer for in accepting a suggestion which represents a modification of the position I understood to have been definitely agreed upon by the honorable gentleman last night. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad that it is proposed to divide this item. The honorable member for Macquarie, if my information is correct, has not much to fear from the introduction of foreign residual oils at a low rate. These oils are very crude, and are used mainly for fuel, and I am given to understand that the shale deposits in the honorable member&#39;s electorate do not produce that kind of oils, which are a primary necessity in a number of industries, notably, manufacturing industries, where great heat is required. If, therefore, we impose a heavy duty on residual oils we shall do no great good to the oil industry of New South Wales, and, at the same time, do much injury to a number of other industries. I shall support the proposal of the Government to divide these oils, and I am glad that they are prepared to stand by the original decision of this Committee. In my opinion a duty of even&#188;d. is too much ; and to impose a duty of1d. would practically prohibit importations, with the undesirable results I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>- We are informed that some of this oil passes into domestic use, occasionally with serious consequences. Only recently, for instance, a boy at Lilydale lost his life through using oil not properly refined. That was asserted in the evidence given before the coroner to have been the cause of his death, and the fact that the Standard Oil Company brands this oil&#34; for engine purposes only &#34; is an indication that it should not be used for domestic purposes. The present flash point is too low. </para>

                        <para>- The proposal to give preference to British oil caps the edifice. I gathered that the Minister desires us to deal with this question, not as a commercial one, but on humanitarian considerations.  His  proposal is to be regarded as a life-saving provision, intended to prevent persons from being killed by lamp explosions. He mentioned an instance in which a boy had been so killed. But to merely discourage the importation of crude oils- </para>

                        <para>- If it is intended to do that, the Government should propose an Excise of 6d. per gallon on all oils having a lower flash point than 97 degrees, manufactured and sold in the Commonwealth. If his proposal be prompted by humanitarian motives, obviously that is the course which he should adopt. But this is really a proposal to levy a tax upon kerosene when it is used as a fuel. It is a question of prohibiting the use of kerosene having a flash point of less than 97 degrees Fahrenheit as a motive power for engines. </para>

                        <para>- It is not necessary to argue the question at length. So many conflicting statements have been made in respect of it, that it is very difficult to ascertain the truth. But we know perfectly well that a flash point of not less than 73 degrees Fahrenheit is the test which has been applied to these oils all over the world. That flash point is practically the universal standard. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer did not have the advantage of hearing the remarks made by his colleague, who pointed out that the flash point test was .raised to 97 degrees Fahrenheit because this oil was sometimes used as an illuminant, although it was dangerous to put it to such a use. He urged that, to prevent its being used as an illuminant, it was necessary to prohibit its importation. If that is the reason for raising the flash test obviously an Excise duty of 6d. per gallon should also be imposed, so as to absolutely prevent inferior locally-produced oil being used as an illuminant. But whilst that would mean that only high-class oil would be used for such a purpose, and might be an excellent proposal from a humanitarian point of view, we must recognise that, it would involve a larger expenditure on the part&#39; of those who used these oils. Oils of a lower flash point are now being used, not as illuminants, but for other purposes for which they are not dangerous, and since they are giving great satisfaction they should be allowed to come in as before. </para>

May .we ask you to use your interest to get the Senate- to recommit the item and amend it- to &#34; Kerosene Oil shall be free, provided it has a flash point of not less than 73 degrees Fahrenheit.&#34; * </para>

                        <para>- The discussion has been somewhat irregular, inasmuch as I have not yet put the requested modification. When it was submitted I thought it well to allow the debate to proceed for a few minutes whilst I examined it, and determined whether or not it was in order. I have come to the conclusion that the latter  part of the proposed modification will not be in order. I refer to the words - 11 and on and after 6th May, 1908, Mineral Oil, n.e.i., per gallon (General Tariff), 3d. ; (United Kingdom), 2d.&#34; </para>

I do not think that it is expected of the  Chairman  that he should look up such information for himself. In the circumstances, I rule that that portion of the modification- which I have read would be an entirely, new item, and is therefore out of order. </para>

                    <para>. - Before I take the course that I intend to adopt, I want to point out, in reply to the honorable member for Boothby, who said that the flash test had not been over 73 degrees Fahrenheit, that, when I held office as Minister of Trade and Customs, certain representations were made to me in reference to a very large importation of oil by the Standard Oil Company. Sixteen vessels from America came here at different times loaded with kerosene, with which it was proposed to flood the local market. Acting on information that I received, I discovered that* the tins or cases of oil .comprising these shipments were not marked as being of a safe flash point. I was informed that the flash point of 105 degrees close test was the same as the open test of 150 degrees. I therefore held up those consignments until the consignees were able to mark on the tins and&#39; cases the proper flash point of 150 degrees fire test. The Standard Oil Company is trying to destroy the development of kerosene oil production in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I forget for the moment. It is true that 73 degrees Fahrenheit has been the test, but there is a great divergence of opinion on the question of whether or not that is a safe test. There are documents in the Department which show very clearly what strong evidence there is in support of the view that that is not a safe test. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that I sometimes become heated, when honorable members, who were returned here for the purpose of supporting protection, turn round, and, because a particular duty does not suit a State, or a particular part of a State, are utterly careless how they may thwart those who are endeavouring to develop industries of the greatest moment to the future of Australia. An honorable member has told us that this company has spent &#163;1,000,000 without the inducement of any protection. But if the company did spend that amount, it was with the idea of prospective protection ; and I think that shareholders ought to have some return for the investment of so large a sum, if the investment were <inline font-style="italic">bon&#226;fide.</inline> I hope to do all  I  can, at any time, to help an industry which, so far as the possibilities of the present and the immediate future are concerned, has not a very bright outlook, in consequence of the undue competition of foreigners in the Australian market. If we are to succumb, because it so happens that a few people in a particular district or State, use oil, then, of course, we must abandon the protective policy which has been decided upon by the people of Australia. I feel that I am called upon at this particular stage to draw attention to the votes of some honorable members, who might justly be expected to support a protective policy, but who are drifting away into another channel, because certain duties may not suit a particular corner of some particular State. I hope that this parochial and un-Australian spirit, which is exhibited in some particular cases, will receive no encouragement. </para>

                        <para>- I did my best to introduce a law to that end ; and had I remained at the head of that particular Department, such a law would have been passed. I can assure the honorable member that I was not to be frightened by people outside, who threatened all sorts of pains and penalties, if spurious medicines were not admitted into the Commonwealth. In my opinion such medicines are a curse. However, all that is beside the point ; what I desire to say is that there should be some definite action regarding the flash point. If any action we take is incidentally protective, while not in any way upsetting our decision in regard to kerosene, there is no reason why we should not deal with the matter in that way. In every case where honorable members try to get behind their protectionist principles, they ought to be exposed. As the  Chairman  has ruled the latter part of the amendment  - which, I may say, is a very important part - out of order, I move - </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the market value of these shares - which are not marketable in Australia but in London - is high because of something which the Treasurer is expected to give. However, I do not. think that the honorable member for Macquarie is right - I sincerely hope not - because, not so very long ago, those shares were 300 per cent. above par. </para>

                        <para>- I intend later on to. draw attention to one or two instances, in addition to several to which the attention of honorable members has already been directed. I assume that the only reason for the postponement is that the Treasurer has not the necessary numbers present ; and, in  the meantime, I suppose there will be an urgent whip, with possibly a fresh set of proposals, having the object of securing the power of prohibition by Ministerial regulation, or some other means of defeating the will of Parliament regarding free kerosene. The Minister has been urging us to expedite the disposal of the Tariff ; and to that end a number of honorable members on this side have refrained from speaking. </para>

                    <para>. - I came from Queensland at the request of those of my constituents who use oil engines, to oppose a duty on the oil which they have to buy. They say that such a duty would amount to a tax on their industry, and that  the Ministry must have a sinister design in proposing it. The Treasurer declares that he has not. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> have ruled part of his proposal out of order. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. Although rates of 3d. and 2d. do not sound very much, they mean taxation to the amount of thousands of pounds on the oil users of the Commonwealth. The Minister, like Wellington at the battle of Waterloo, seeks to gain time. He has asked for a postponement in order to get his numbers. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister might have known that it would be ruled out of order. I have received representations from many persons in Western Australia, pointing out that the proposed duties would greatly interfere with the economical use of oil engines, which are being increasingly employed all over the State. I do not know why the Minister desires to place any obstacle in the way of the use of these. engines. I am ready now to vote against his proposal, but I may not be here this evening, owing to an engagement which I cannot postpone. I have known a debate to be continued for some time, in order to secure a satisfactory division, but I have never known a postponement to be asked for by a Ministry on the ground that it wished for time to bring its supporters into the chamber. Notwithstanding what the Treasurer has said,&#39; his- reason for asking for this  postponement must be that the numbers are against him. </para>

                        <para>- No. I stay here constantly. But the Committee is justified in regarding the course now proposed as unprecedented; and, notwithstanding the assertions of the Treasurer, his action bears&#39; the construction that he desires delay because he has not his numbers.  His  officers are present, and can afford him any assistance required in the framing of a new proposal, without it being necessary to postpone the consideration of the item in the manner suggested. The Committee would probably allow a cessation of the discussion for the time needed by the Minister to consult his officials. </para>

                        <para>- Our divisions should express the sense of the majority, and I think no honorable member desires to take advantage of the absence of his fellows. But the Treasurer is to blame for the present extraordinary position. Why did he not circulate his complicated and intricate proposal, instead of springing it upon the Committee? If we took a vote now, the majority would be against the postponement of the request. To my mind, the difficulty would be met by differentiating between burning oil and oil for use in oil engines. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not mind New South Wales representatives pitching into the Treasurer ; but adverse criticism is now coming from all parts of the Chamber. So far as I could gather from his remarks, part of his proposal has been ruled out of order, and he wishes for time in which to frame another. Of course, I do not know what his hidden intention may be, and shall not pour kerosene on the smouldering mass of indignation which sits at the table by suggesting any. Until when does he wish to postpone the request? </para>

                    <para>.- Throughout the consideration of this Tariff I think that honorable members have been most considerate to the Treasurer. They have recognised that he had a very big task on hand, and one which would strain the energies of a very much abler man. Considering the whole of the circumstances, I think that he has done exceedingly well. Sometimes we can really understand what is the meaning of his proposals, and we ought to feel grateful for that. In regard to the particular item under consideration it is only reasonable that the Treasurer should be granted the adjournment which he seeks. He has made a most definite promise as to the time when the matter will again come up for discussion, and I think that he ought to be allowed an opportunity to look round a bit. </para>

                    <para>.- This is another of the items in respect of which the Government agreed to accept a certain duty, but subsequently got its representative in another place to support a higher duty. The original proposal of the Ministry was that under the general Tariff the duty upon paints and colours ground in liquid should be 4s. 6d. per cwt., and that under the Tariff for the United Kingdom it should be 4s. per cwt. After debate, however, the honorable member for Bendigo - who in fiscal matters is practically a Government supporter - moved that the duties should be 4s. per cwt. and 3s. 6d. per cwt. respectively. The amendment was accepted  by  the Government and agreed to without division. The Treasurer, therefore, in asking this Committee to reverse its former decision  by  agreeing to the request of the Senate, is breaking faith with it. I hope that honorable members will show their resentment of his action  by  voting against the proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the Committee made a great mistake last evening when it dealt with the item of linseed oil. The decision at which it then arrived will inflict a great injustice upon our local manufacturers of paint. The latter are obliged to use 9 gallons of linseed oil in manufacturing 1 cwt. of paint, and as linseed oil is dutiable at 6d. per gallon they are thus required to pay 4s. 6d. upon the raw material used in that quantity of paint. Consequently, if we do not agree to the request of the Senate, our manufacturers will receive no protection whatever. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the proposal to admit linseed oil free, when denaturated, will be adhered to. It would be monstrous to load our manufacturers with a burden such as has been suggested by the honorable member for Hindmarsh. I am sure that the decision at which the Committee arrived in that connexion was quite inadvertent. Honorable members would not deliberately impose such a burden upon our paint manufacturers. It is monstrous that they should be obliged to pay 4s. 6d. upon the raw material used in the manufacture of 1 cwt. of paint, seeing that they enjoy a protection . of only 4s. per cwt. upon the finished article. I hope that the Treasurer will see that the request of the Senate in regard to linseed oil, when denaturated, is retained in the schedule. </para>

                <para>Mr.REID. - Manufacturers who use sugar can obtain it in bond under departmental by-law, and surely if linseed oil were not denaturated the manufacturers of paints ought to be able to get it in bond and to manufacture there. The Government have shown a magnificent degree of generosity to-day in recognising the claims of the oil wells of Great Britain. They have offered a preference of 33&#189; per cent. to the oils produced in England, Scotland, and Ireland ! Surely, then, they will not &#34;go down&#34; upon paints. Any influence that I can exert will be used in the direction of retaining the request of the Senate in regard to linseed oil. in order that we may relieve our paint manufacturers of the burden which has been placed upon them. If they are to be granted no relief in that connexion I should not desire to press for a preference in the present instance. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to say a word or two regarding the duty levied upon linseed oil. For years past, not only has this oil been produced in Australia, but the linseed has been grown here. The Victorian Government for some years offered a bonus on the production of flax and linseed. The industry of linseed production has been introduced, and I believe that both in Sydney and Melbourne there are factories which express the oil. This proposal is a very ingenious way of securing the free introduction of linseed oil, which is imported only to be mixed with paints. Those who make up liquid paints use imported oil </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Linseed oil is denaturated only by mixing it with paint. The provision seems to be an ingenious device to get rid of an import duty. One of the difficulties in regard to the establishment of oil production in Australia is that, by a curious development, the oil for which the plant originally was chiefly grown, has now become a residuary product. The demand for oil cake for feeding purposes in Europe is so great, and the price is consequently so high, that the oil itself is being produced very cheaply, not only there, but in India. It is brought here at a very low rate, and the progress of the industry of oil production in Australia has thus been retarded. The imported oil is cheap, because the producers are now paid a very high price for what was formerly a by-product. That illustrates the difficulty of dealing with this question. There is no doubt that linseed oil has been subjected to a very low duty, and that fact, together with its cheap production abroad, has made it difficult to establish the industry here. Nevertheless, it is being carried on in Victoria as well as in New South Wales, and it would be a mistake to agree to this extraordinary provision, to which, by the way, I object on other grounds. </para>

If the honorable member can show that we are producing here an oil that is good enough for the manufacture of paint I shall support him, but he has not been able to disprove the statement made by this firm, which is the largest manufacturer of paint in Australia.. The honorable member for Wimmera will tell us that we can obtain good whiting in Australia, but Australian whiting is useless for the purpose of making putty. </para>

                        <para>- Can the honorable member name any painter or any manufacturer of paint who is satisfied with Australian linseed oil for paint-making purposes? At one time it was the custom to allow linseed oil to come in free when mixed with whiting, and there is no reason why that practice should not be continued. We want to be sure that the oil has been denaturated in such a way that it cannot be used for any other purpose than the manufacture of paint. It is not necessary that it should be mixed with whiting. I should have no objection to a proposal that paint in which free oil was used should be manufactured in bond. </para>

                        <para>- Locally-made paints have to compete with imported paint, which in many cases is badly adulterated. This Parliament does not propose to give the local manufacturers any relief in that respect. Even if we imposed the duty requested by the Senate and allowed the paint manufacturers to import free of duty linseed oil for manufacturing purposes, we should give the industry a very small measure of protection as compared with that which has been given to others. </para>

                        <para>- I see no reference to that item in this circular. I agree with the honorable member for Mernda that it is ridiculous to impose protective duties to encourage the production of linseed oil in Australia, if by other means we reduce the opportunity for its use here. Some local paint manufacturers say that Australian linseed oil cannot be used with satisfaction in the manufacture of paint. I see no reason why it cannot. The users of paint might as well say that Australian paint cannot be employed with success, and that the duty on paint ought to be removed. If the House does what those in the trade request in this case, it will surely be doing all that could be expected of it </para>

                    <para>. - The firm to which I have referred wrote some time ago to the Comptroller-General pointing out that, prior to Federation, they were allowed to obtain linseed oil denaturated under Customs supervision. The reply which they received from the Comptroller-General was as follows -  7th April, 1908. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, -</inline>
                    With respect to linseed oil, the Senate has made a request to the House of Representatives that linseed oil, when denaturated as prescribed by departmental by-law, be admitted free, provided that, in the opinion of the Minister, sufficient linseed oil for manufacturing purposes is not produced in Australia.
                </para>
                <para>It is presumed that this request, if accepted by the House of Representatives, will satisfy your wishes in the matter. </para>
                <para>That shows that the Comptroller-General is satisfied that it would be fair to allow the old custom to continue. It is rather surprising that the honorable member for North Sydney has not received from the paint manufacturers a request to support its continuance. It may perhaps have escaped their attention. </para>

                        <para>- In the circular that I have received on the subject a calculation is made on the same basis, and it shows that both manufacturers of paint and of putty will have no protection if they have to pay duty on linseed oil. I for one should be satisfied if, in the meantime, we agreed to what has been the old practice. The honorable member for North Sydney has not shown the Committee that the paint manufacturers are using the locally-made linseed oil ; and I think that if he made inquiries he would find that they are doing nothing of the kind. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for North Sydney is quite misrepresenting the position. Oil, as good as any in the world, is produced in Australia, but very little of it up to the present time, and the reason is that the duty of 6d. does not counterbalance the greater advantages in Calcutta and elsewhere in oil expression, owing to the fact that we have not the same market for the by-products. The oil that is made here is, so far as I have ever heard, preferred in Victoria and elsewhere, as, at any rate, quite equal to the imported article for the making of paint, putty, or any other kindred commodities. It is recognised that there is a production of oil here, because a stipulation is made for a sufficient production. But who is to say what is sufficient? Surely we ought to give&#39; some encouragement to the production of an article on the production of which a bonus has been offered. There can be no use for linseed unless its oil is expressed ; and that, of course, means an oil-producing industry. It would be most strange, as the honorable member for North Sydney has pointed out, if, after offering a bonus, we should remove the duty altogether on the only possible product. </para>

                    <para>. - The remarks which I made in regard to the item previously before us refer to this item, and I must say that the protection afforded is very small. As the honorable member for Mernda has said, oil can be made here, but is not up to the present being produced to any great extent. The protection on the dry colours amounts to only 2s. 6d. per cwt., and as13 gallons of raw oil are required to make1 cwt. of paint, all the protection given, even including the 6s. requested by the Senate, is1s. 6d.

                    <para>.- I was surprised at the course taken by the Committee in regard to the item last under discussion ; and now we have a similar case before us. When this item was originally before this Committee, the honorable member for Parramatta pointed out that the Government proposal meant an increase in the duty of 225 per cent. ; and, while he did not profess to know much about colours, he protested against an absurd increase of the kind, and moved that the duty be reduced from 3s. 3d. to 2s. That amount was negatived, but immediately afterwards the honorable member for Gwydir moved that the &#34;duties be reduced from 3s. 3d. and 3s. to 2s. 6d. and 2s., and that amendment was agreed to, and was, therefore, practically accepted by the Government, and became in essence a Government proposal. Now, however, we have the Treasurer asking us to reverse a vote to which he, on behalf of the Government, agreed on a previous occasion. When is this sort of thing going to end? Howlong are we going to overlook and acquiesce in these breaches of faith, and to regard them as, if not meritorious, at least permissible on the part of the honorable gentleman? We are becoming absolutely demoralized, and the time has arrived when we ought to make a protest. The circumstances amply justify me in refusing to accept in good faith any statement, agreement, or promise on. the part of the Treasurer, because we find so often that he only resorts to such means for the purpose of deceiving us and devising means of evading a fulfilment of his promises. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member will come with me to South Australia I shall be delighted to show him at Mount Sienna an astonishing variety in unlimited quantities of nearly all the colours required in Australia, including burnt sienna, stated by experts to at any rate approximate to that imported. All this request does is to provide a duty of 2s. 6d. against the cheaper colours, and that may be quite high enough for French ochres worth about &#163;310s. per ton free on board ; but it is clearly not enough in the case of burnt sienna, which is valued at present at about &#163;80 per ton, but which is sold in competition with the local article at about &#163;30 per ton. The burnt sienna is said to be equal to any brought from older countries ; and too much protection would not be given if importation were altogether prohibited. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to be useless for one man, unsupported by others of his fiscal faith, to continue to object to increases of duty. When I see honorable members who profess to hold free-trade views really helping the Government to impose higher duties by silence and unwillingness to divide, I feel that it is a waste of time to oppose what is being done. Apparently it seems to be thought that because we have not an independent free-trade majority the Government should be allowed without protest to have exactly its own way in regard to the Tariff. A week or two back, I was absent for a day or two, and a great song was made because certain duties were then agreed to; but I find, when I am here, that mine is the only voice raised in protest regarding some of these proposed increases by the Senate, and that, under the circumstances, my opposition is entirely useless. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Lang does an injustice to the protectionists of the Committee if he thinks that they will allow the raw material of the paint manufacturers of Australia to be taxed without protest. The proposals of the Government concern them almost more than they concern the free-traders. Barytes is the basis of 90 per cent. of the colours which are used, and those who wish to put a duty on this material owe (o the Australian manufacturers of paint an explanation of their action in increasing the price of their raw material. If we give the paint manufacturers a duty of 6d., and charge them 2s. on their raw material, they will not feel that they have benefited much by the Tariff. I should like to see these duties removed altogether. I understand that there are immense quantifies of barytes in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - A great mistake was made when the item was first before the Committee. Apparently, honorable members did not then know that barytes can be obtained in unlimited quantities in all the States. In South Australia, a contract for the supply of 2,000 tons has been entered into bv one company alone, and this material can be obtained there to any extent. I produce a sample of green colour, of which 90 per cent. is barytes. This was manufactured locally. Hitherto we have been importing barytes chiefly from Germany. If we mine our own supplies, we shall employ a large amount of labour, and probably create an export trade with Great Britain. </para>

                    <para>.- Will the Treasurer explain why he wishes to make tiles and slabs of fibro cement and similar substances dutiable at such high rates ? Already the effect of the Tariff has been to greatly increase the prices of building materials, and this proposal will further tend to make building more costly. The result, of course, will be that fewer buildings will be erected. Those who wish to rid themselves of the incubus of the landlord, by acquiring houses of their own, will find it harder to do so, and workmen connected with the building trade will find it more difficult to get employment. I shall oppose the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that combinations&#39; of brick manufacturers have already caused considerable trouble in the building trade in Australia. I desire to know whether the articles upon which we are now asked to increase the existing duty are those which the Brick Combine object to having associated with their bricks in buildings? In certain of the States the Combine have refused to supply bricks at the ordinary market price if they are to be associated in building operations with certain articles which are used in the construction of walls and of divisions between rooms. </para>

We are asked to add to this item the words &#34; and slabs and tiles of fibro cement, asbestos cement, and similar substances.&#34; I have received representations in regard to this matter from quite a number of responsible persons, whose word can be accepted in all good faith, and I think I am justified in reading at least one of them, which says - </para>

                    <para>It will be seen that it is requested that the duty on the sheets (which are used far walls and ceilings) be raised from 15 per cent. to 35 per cent., not from 30 per cent., as it would appear from the printed &#34; request.&#34; The slates it is proposed to raise from 25 per cent. to 35 per cent. if they be classed as slates, or from 30 per cent. to 35 per cent. if they be classed as tiles. </para>
                    <para>We contend that as these materials are not manufactured here the present duty is sufficiently high, and that if it be raised, as requested, it will amount to prohibition. The materials under consideration meet an Australian requirement, inasmuch as they are heat and fire resisting. The sheets and slates should not be classed together, as they are for quite different purposes, the former for walls and ceilings and the latter for roofs. Roofing slates (presumably natural slates) stand unaltered at 25 per cent.&#34;, and the slates under consideration should be classed with them. </para>
                    <para>Should the House of Representatives accede to the Senate&#39;s requests, the higher duties should not come into operation until the materials are manufactured here, and there is no indication, that we are aware of, of any such intention. </para>

                <para class="block">Those objections are urged by Messrs. Noyes Brothers, and I have received similar representations from other merchants of equal standing. One firm suggests that the item should be divided into &#34; sheets, slates, roofing tiles, and roofing slates.&#34; I think that the Treasurer might reasonably postpone the consideration of this request until he is in receipt of representations which can be made to him by more responsible persons. If honorable members believe that by imposing the duty requested they will bring about the local manufacture of these articles, they are labouring under a misapprehension, because the statements of those who are most familiar with the details of the trade show that that is impossible. I trust that the Treasurer will either take time to consider this question, or will refuse to accede to the request of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to point out that fibro cement is used for many purposes, both in our cities and in the country. Amongst other things, it is used for making silos. The value of silos is now generally recognised, and the only reason why more of them are not erected is their excessive cost. A silo to carry 100 tons of ensilage will cost anything from&#163;100 to&#163;150, but if in its construction fibro cement be used, it can be erected for a very much smaller sum. A framework of wood lined with fibro cement makes an excellent silo. I would further point out that, on account of its extreme lightness, &#39; the cost of conveying fibro cement to the backblocks is very small indeed. This article can also be employed for roofing purposes in lieu of slate. It makes an excellent roof, as an exhibit at the recent Agricultural Show, Sydney, demonstrated. I have read testimonials as to its value from quite a number of persons in responsible positions. They declare that it answers all requirements. It is very warm ; it is fireproof ; and does all that is claimed for it by the manufacturers. The Senate requests an increase of 20 per cent. in the duty which was placed upon fibro cement under the Tariff as it left this House. The Minister should give some reason for his proposal to agree to the increased duty. I should be prepared to accept as a compromise a proposal to omit fibro cement slabs from this request, so that they would remain dutiable at 15 per cent. under item 247. This is an age of compromise, and when one has to deal with a majority, one must be content with a compromise. </para>

                        <para>- Then I shall say that I have seen layer after layer of asbestos brought to the surface at Ilfracombe, where a company was carrying on operations some years ago. I am also informed that the requested amendment of the wording is necessary to avoid confusion and trouble in classification, owing to the presence of fibro cement in item 247. It was intended that manufactures of fibro cement, such as slabs and roofing tiles, should be dutiable at the same rate as other tiles, but the specific reference to fibro cement in item 247 confuses that intention, and makes it very doubtful. </para>

                    <para>.- The difficulty might be partially overcome if the Treasurer would modify the request by omitting from the proposed additional wording the word &#34; slabs,&#34; leaving slabs of fibro cement dutiable at 15 pet cent. under item 247. I have it on good authority that fibro cement sheets are not made here. They are imported, and a  good deal of work is involved in cutting and preparing them for use in Australia. To accept this request, so far as fibro cement slabs are concerned, would be to inflict a hardship on users of that material, whilst at the same time restricting employment in the Commonwealth. I hope the Treasurer will agree to my suggestion. </para>

                    <para>. - The Treasurer has read a statement to the effect that it was intended that all these materials should be subject to the same duty. As a matter of fact, it was not. The item as originally introduced was amended, and the intention was that fibro cement, being an article not manufactured here, according to the information at our disposal, should be admitted at 15 per cent., as it is largely used in rural districts for erecting structures which, if built with other material, would be far more costly. It is used, as the honorable member for Robertson has pointed out, in the construction of silos, and enables such structures to be erected at small cost. It is easily distinguishable from any other preparation, and a duty of15 per cent. would be a considerable protection in respect of it. I therefore ask the Treasurer to stand by the decision at which we previously arrived. I do not know whether asbestos cement is made here, but I; do know that asbestos is produced in Australia.

                    <para>. - I think that a fair compromise would be to remove fibro cement slabs from the requested amendment, leaving them dutiable under the next item at 15 per cent. These sheets are cut up when they arrive here, and in that way a good deal of employment is given. Fibro cement is a building material of great value. It is not made in Australia, and its importation extends employment in the Commonwealth. If we leave fibro cement tiles subject to the higher rate, and simply take fibro cement slabs out of the requested amendment, so that they will be dutiable at 15 per cent., that will be a very fair compromise. We shall then be able to settle the question of whether or not this duty should be increased by 5 per cent. Our original intention is quite clear. Under the Tariff as originally passed by us, the duty of 30 per cent. was applied only to roofing tiles, flooring tiles, and tiles n.e.i., whilst a duty of15 per cent. was imposed on fibro cement. </para>

If it be wished to put asbestos into sheets or slabs, it has to go through a process of mixture with some other material and cement, and be subject to pressure. People who were importing roofing and flooring tiles complained of the competition of tiles made of fibrous cement and asbestos cement ; and if the amendment as proposed by the Treasurer be carried it will place all upon the same footing. This material is coming into use now ; and I have seen a building composed of it piled up with wood and set on fire, with the result that it still retained its shape. </para>

When we consider that later on, glassware, including smelling and perfume bottles, is subject to a duty of only 25 per cent., it does not seem at all reasonable to make the duty on building materials10 per cent. higher. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that we might retain the original duty, in view of the fact that these particular tiles  are coming largely into use in the erection of buildings. A duty of 30 per cent. is very high, and, unless there be some special reason for the increase, the Committee ought to resist the Senate&#39;s suggestion. </para>

                    <para>. - When this item was discussed in the Senate the chief object in making the increase was to give greater preference to Great Britain. It was pointed out that these articles are mostly imported from foreign countries, and though preference might have been extended by reducing the duties that would have conflicted with other items such as those which immediately follow. It is a very small increase when all is said and done. </para>

It pays &#163;14 for each of these crucibles, although f.o.b. one costs only  &#163;4.  Crucibles are made in my own electorate, but not the sort to which I refer. The locally-made crucibles will not stand the work required in bottle-making. The firm in question would be the first to use locally-made crucibles if they would serve, because they are being made not far from its own premises. </para>

                        <para>- I believe so. One of the leading glass-bottle manufacturers in Melbourne, who has also a business in South Australia, but does not use these crucibles, assures me that they have to be imported. That should be sufficient proof that they cannot be made here. Firebricks are made in Victoria and elsewhere, but the locally-made bricks are good only for certain purposes. Some time ago I saw a furnace under construction at South Melbourne, which was to be used for experiments in steel making, and they were sending to Scotland for the firebricks required. Similarly, it is necessary to send to the Old Country for the crucibles I have spoken of, which I am informed are made only in Glamorganshire. </para>

                    <para>.- I am at a loss to know why the Government wish to make crucibles, scoritiers, and muffles dutiable. When the item was last under discussion it was demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that the crucibles, muffles, and scorifiers in use in all the Government analytical departments, and in all the laboratories of the Commonwealth, have been imported. For such technical work as assaying,- locally-made crucibles are useless. </para>

                    <para>Locally-made crucibles vary in quality on account of the clay being unsuitable, and are thus very unreliable, and are little used. The  Battersea  (Morgans) crucibles are imported, and used very extensively. In Western Australia the crucibles of German manufacture have the preference because they are more durable even than the  Battersea,  the latter, as a rule, can only be used for one charge, whilst the German crucibles are invariably used four or five times. </para>

                <para>I have been told by a gentleman who is, I think, the leading metallurgist in Australia, that local crucibles are uneven in quality, and absorb a large part of the charge, so that the results cannot be depended on. As thousands of pounds are sometimes invested in a mine on the results of an assay of an ore sample, it is necessary that the crucibles used should be absolutely reliable. I hope that the Committee will not make the requested amendment. </para>

                        <para>- They may not be made on the banks of the Yarra, but may be made in other parts of the Commonwealth. The protection given to the local manufacturers of glassware is only 25 and 20 Der cent., rates&#39; of duty which are very low compared with some which have been imposed for the benefit of other industries. Those connected with the two large glassware factories in mv district have not asked me to support duties for their protection. Indeed, it is to the credit of New South Wales industries generally that they have not canvassed the Committee for assistance. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in favour of the smaller glass bottle makers being made entirely dependent upon one large firm in the Commonwealth for the supply of glass bottle marbles. I would further point out that one firm could not compete successfully with similar establishments in other parts of the- world.. Consequently. I believe that we ought to allow our glass bottle manufacturers to obtain their marbles in the cheapest market.- For this reason, I hope the Committee will agree to the request of the Senate. </para>

I really think that the Government ought to five way to the Opposition. The Treasurer ought to encourage its members to assist him in framing the Tariff upon good protectionist lines. </para>

                    <para>.- I am getting very tired of these old free-trade arguments. During the course of the Tariff debates, we have heard a great deal about the consumer. But may I ask, &#34; Where does the consumer of glass bottle marbles come in?&#34; The honorable member for Hindmarsh stated that one of his reasons for assenting to the request of the Senate is that these marbles can be produced in enormous quantities in the &#39;Old Country. That statement might, with equal reason, have been made in respect of every item in the Tariff schedule. It might have been urged in regard to locks, and yet the honorable member voted for a 20 per cent, duty upon them. He further stated that only one firm would be .required to manufacture these marbles. Need I remind him that only one firm, employing four men, is engaged in the Commonwealth, in the manufacture of locks? It is strange that honorable members&#34; should be such great protectionists only when an industry is located in their own electorates. In the electoral division of Dalley there are two glass companies - the Federal Glass Company and the Cooperative Glass Company - both very fine firms indeed. Their employes number over 300. When the Tariff was before us on a previous occasion, I voted to extend to them a protection of 25 per cent, under the general Tariff, and of 20 per cent, under the Tariff  for the United Kingdom. I cannot understand why a great protectionist like the Treasurer - and such -an ardent lever of New South Wales industries - should baulk at the manufacture of glass bottle marbles. If we can make glassware in the Commonwealth, why cannot we manufacture these marbles? I utterly fail to see why this industry should be penalized more than is any other industry. </para>

As a matte* of fact, it is the simplest thing in the world to manufacture them. But if we retain the duty upon these articles, they will still continue to be imported, because one firm at Home can manufacture in a few hours, sufficient marbles for the requirements of the Commonwealth for a year. That is why I support the request of the Senate. </para>

If the request of the Senate be agreed to, certain persons who are engaged in scientific work will be penalized without any good being conferred upon the Commonwealth. In the interests of advanced science, I trust that the Committee will not agree to that. A similar remark is applicable to item 256, in which the Senate has requested the omission of certain articles which are now admitted free with a view to making them dutiable. </para>

                        <para>- I am well aware of the industry. I believe I am correct in saying that the graduated necks of these test tubes are imported, and that the only work done in respect of them in the Queensland factory is that of adding bottoms to the tubes. As one who has had some practical experience of these tubes, I may say that the annealing of the Australian work does not correspond with that done abroad, and that consequently when the locally-made tubes are subjected to a very high temperature, as they often are, they break. Even if this duty be imposed, as requested, tubes used for testing cream and milk in the majority of cases will still be imported. The other articles included in the item are manufactured in Australia, but we have not yet been able to properly anneal the glass bottoms to these tubes. </para>

                    (Brisbane) &#91;9.0&#93;. - My information is somewhat different from that of the honorable member for Moreton. I have had an opportunity to visit the factory where all these articles are made, and have seen the graduated work being done there. All the apparatus for such work is installed in the factory, and I know that, comparatively speaking, a large number of these test tubes are being made in Brisbane, and used with satisfactory results in the dairying industry. If they were not satisfactory they would not have the sales they command. The honorable member for Moreton is an expert in dairying matters, and if any of these tubes have ever failed him I am inclined to think, on the principle that one swallow does not make a summer, that he has been unfortunate in having purchased a defective one. Defective work is occasionally turned out by even the best manufacturers. It may be taken for granted, however, that if the work of the Brisbane factory were not on the whole thoroughly satisfactory, it would not command the business which it now does. These tubes are used not only by dairymen, but by brewers and others. I have here a statement from the manufacturers to the effect that all the articles mentioned in this item, and proposed to be struck out, are made by them, and give perfect satisfaction. The regulations relating to their manufacture in Queensland might well be adopted in every State. These are very stringent in regard to the Government inspection and marking of all these instruments. Before they leave the factory they have to be approved by a highly qualified officer of the Department of Agriculture, who, on passing them, stamps them accordingly. The regulations required that on a certain date - I think that it was 31st December, 1906 - all instruments of a similar character in use in dairies in Queensland should be submitted to the Government official to whom I have referred, and if approved by him stamped with the Government mark. It may therefore be said with perfect truth that every one of these instruments in use in dairies in Queensland has been approved, and bears the Government stamp.

                    I do not know that the &#34;Kew&#34; certificate should be given with them. The manufacturers point out that many of these instruments are part of the necessary plant of a large number of industries, and are no more difficult to manufacture than are the engines used in those industries. As the manufacturers properly say, a great many of the instruments which they have to use are also dutiable, and it is only fair that this struggling industry should receive its fair measure of protection. They inform me that if the proposed protection be granted, they intend to extend their operations to Sydney and Melbourne, and probably to Adelaide, so that the industry will cease to be an essentially Queensland one. It is within their knowledge that there is in Australia a large number of men thoroughly competent to make these instruments, who, owing to the limited extent of the industry here are unable to obtain employment, except in directions outside the work for which they have been specially trained. I sincerely trust that in these circumstances the Committee will see fit to concede this measure of protection.

                    <para>.-Ifmy memory serves me rightly, this item was originally considered in this House during an all-night sitting, and the honorable member for Corangamite then made a most informative speech. I think that it was chiefly due to his eloquence in explaining the reasons why these instruments should be on the free list that the duty to which they were subjected under the item as introduced was removed, and they were put upon the free list. Since the Committee then bad an opportunity to go fully into the whole details of this question, I think that it would be most unwise for it now to reverse its decision. </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection, if they can be made here; but radiometers and other scientific apparatus of a certain class must, under any circumstances, be imported. If these instruments could be made here satisfactorily, those who require them would not run the risk of the enormous cost in breakages which importation involves. To remove these instruments from this item will mean  a tax which, while yielding very little revenue, will act as a handicap on those engaged in scientific work. </para>

                    <para>.-It is of no use flogging a dead horse, the Committee having, I believe, made up their minds as to how they intend to vote. I can, however, corroborate everything that the honorable member for Brisbane has said ; and I know this to be a growing industry, which ought to have a little fostering. The honorable member for Corangamite is not fair when he says that these instruments have to be imported. </para>

                        <para>- I have seen these glasses being made in Brisbane, and from that establishment the Queensland Government obtain all their scientific instruments for laboratory and expert dairy work. That being so, surely the instruments are good enough for the general public? Some of those which the honorable member for Moreton saw, may not have been up to the standard; but I know that every instrument made in this establishment is tested by a Government expert, and bears the Government stamp. </para>

                    <para>.- There has been some misapprehension as to the remarks made by me in reference to test tubes. I had no intention of casting any reflection on the accuracy of the graduating of the tubes made in Queensland, but I do say, after some years of experience, and after giving the tubes an honest trial, that they will not stand the heat necessary in testing milk and cream. I am sure the honorable member for Maranoa will understand that I had no intention of trying to mislead the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable member told us that he had seen the work done, and that the graduating was perfect. I have no objection to the graduating of the bottles; all I say is that they cannot stand the high temperature. I am prepared to admit the quality of the thermometers, and much of the other glassware made here, but what 1 have said in regard to the test tubes is quite correct. </para>

                    <para>.- What the honorable member for Moreton speaks of are the test tubes mentioned in the first part of the item, but what he really means in connexion with cream testing is &#34; glassware graduated in centimeters, grains, minims, ounces, and grammes.&#34; If beakers and flasks are to be free, the same argument applies to everything in the list; and I repeat that a duty on these instruments is simply a tax on scientific investigation in a great many industries throughout Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member placed his proposal before me this afternoon, and I put it in the hands of the departmental authorities, requesting them to prepare an amendment which would give effect to his intentions. I did so, with a view to preventing a certain class of oil from being used for illuminating purposes. I adopted the suggestion of the honorable member, which seems to me to be a very good one, because, since the debate was initiated this afternoon, I have found that the flash point test in a great many parts of the world is much higher than it was declared to be by some honorable members. In one instance it is  105  degrees Fahrenheit. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members seem to be getting into a regular tangle in reference to this flashlight test. The object of the Committee, I take it, is to insure that kerosene shall be admitted free. But the proposal of the Treasurer would have the effect of excluding practically half the imports of kerosene into Australia. It would completely shut out all the imports of the British Oil Company which have a flash point of less than 102 degrees. I need scarcely point out that that test is four degrees above the flash point of the British- Asiatic Company&#39;s oils. </para>

                        <para>- I hold no brief for any company. My sole desire is to see that the people of Australia get their kerosene for illuminating purposes and also for oil engine purposes free. What has occurred to-day illustrates the absolute folly of this Committee attempting to dabble in intricate questions which should be dealt with by experts. The safest course we can adopt is to adhere to the flash test laid down by all experts in the world, which is about  73  degrees Fahrenheit. </para>

                    <para>It would appear that the difficulty in regard to the admission of low test kerosene below the standard flash point may be overcome, so far as its use as a fuel oil for oil engines is concerned, by means of denaturation. It is quite possible to cheaply and effectively denaturate low test kerosene so that it may be perfectly adapted for use in oil engines, and, at the same time, unsuitable for burning in illuminating lamps. The denaturation would not affect the fuel (heating or calorific value) of the oil detrimentally, on the other hand, the denaturation would be so carried out as to slightly raise the calorific value of the low-test kerosene. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Every tin of kerosene to be used as an illuminant has stamped upon it the flash point test. Surely a flash point test of 150 degrees Fahrenheit is good enough. The White Rose oil has been on the market for a number of years, and no one can say that it is not a good illuminant. Throughout Western Queensland no other oil will be used. It has maintained its position on the market, and it is to the interests of the Standard Oil Company to keep it well up to the standard. Can any one say that the price of kerosene in Australia has not been reduced during the last ten years? </para>

                        <para>- It did. The proposal that kerosene to be used in oil engines shall be denaturated is mere bunkum. Let a flash point test be fixed in respect of kerosene for oil engines and we shall then know what we are doing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson</inline> tells us that this oil can be denaturated cheaply and effectively. We have a right to know how that is to be done, and until we have more information on the subject I shall not vote upon it. The Treasurer knew before we adjourned for dinner that he would meet with a stout opposition in respect to this proposal. I am satisfied that the Committee desire that kerosene, whether for motive power or for use as an illuminant, shall be free. If it is undesirable to import kerosene of a low flashing point for use in oil engines, surely it is equally undesirable to allow it to be produced in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Maranoa that in the desire to accomplish that which we cannot accomplish we are asked, not only to involve the users of this oil in ridiculously heavy expense, but to introduce in connexion with the oil trade of Australia a system which does not exist in any other part of the world, and which must tend to injure the Commonwealth. It would be highly absurd to appoint Customs officers to open up cases of kerosene on the wharfs, to open each tin, to empty its contents into a vat or tank; to denaturate the oil, and then to re-tin, re-solder, re-case, and deliver the oil. </para>

                        <para>- It would. In reply to the honorable member for Dalley, I would point out that kerosene oils are not put up .specially for the Australian trade. If we are going to separate the Australian trade from that of the rest of the world, we shall add considerably to the cost of the oil. We obtain supplies of oil from the cheapest market. We take them from the East when they are obtainable there more cheaply than they are in the United States - that is particularly the case in respect to engine oil - and we may also in case of scarcity buy them from New Zealand and elsewhere&#39;. Are we going to compel the sellers to specially treat that oil for Australia,? As I have said, oils are not specially put up for the Australian trade. They are tinned and cased in -immense .quantities ready for orders from any part of the world. If this proposal were carried out, the Australian trade would be placed on a different footing. </para>

                        <para>- It is. We are asked to take this action in respect of an enormous trade, important to the whole Commonwealth, on a statement by one man - I make no reflection on his qualifications - tint it can be done cheaply and effectively. I think I have shown that it cannot be done cheaply, and the Committee certainly does not know that it can be done effectively. Such a dangerous experiment would not be made , by any Parliament unless it had the highest scientific authority for it. Even where such a proposal was supported by the highest scientific authority, it would not be adopted until it had been demonstrated that it could be carried out effectively and cheaply. </para>

                        <para>- Let us see whether we should secure safety for the public. I am with the Minister in the desire to protect the public from the use of dangerous oil, and our freedom from accidents shows that they have been very considerably protected, whether by the importation of good oil, or under the laws of the States, so far as they have laws regulating the sale of oil. The Minister asks the Committee to take the risk of making an experiment, the effectiveness of which has not vet been demonstrated, and, by agreeing to it, we shall accomplish nothing as regards the safety of the consuming public. </para>

Unless action is taken by the States, and that action reaches not only the manufacturer but also the retailer, the public cannot be protected in the slightest degree. We shall have this oil produced locally in considerable quantities, and it may be distributed without any denaturating, and sold as illuminating oil. </para>

                        <para>- If that is the process, I have very little faith in colouring as a protection to the public. Unfortunately cheapness is so necessary to many that they would not mind the colouring, so long as the oil would burn. However, that has nothing to do with the question. What I contend is that we cannot protect the public unless we can reach the retailer - that the only power that can effectually protect the public in relation to the final distributor is the power of the States. In some of the States that power has been taken, and is exercised ; and if we could help the States - it would only be a help - without altering the whole system of the import trade, we should be justified in doing so. But under a proposal of the kind before us. we see our ineffectiveness to be so great that we are asked to support a proposal which involves the separation of the Australian trade from the trade of the rest of the world. </para>

                        <para>- Pure foods are produced and sold in all parts of the world ; and Australia occupies no special position in that respect. We are now asked to separate our trade from that of the rest of the world, and to bear all the consequent disadvantages and additional cost. Much of the oil must come here without being treated, and we. are asked to insist on an elaborate process at this end, which will not protect the public, because the only protection, as I Have pointed out, must come from the States. In addition, we are asked to adopt the test without any inquiry or opinion beyond that of one scientific man -an opinion obtained on the spur of the moment. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the question involved, because we are now dealing with oils of a lower test. I understand that some companies claim to produce a certain oil for engines at a higher test; and I am informed that, not only is that oil more costly than some others, but that some engines are not adapted for its use. </para>

                        <para>- In any case, that is not the point. . The whole question is whether the Government are prepared to admit for engine purposes oils at a lower test. I have already expressed my opinion of the method which the Government proposes to adopt for their admission. I think we should be unwise to adopt the proposal, especially seeing that the result would not be to protect the public one whit. I wish the local producers of oil every success, but I cannot support such a restriction on imports, especially when local production of low-test oils will not be restricted in the least by our action. They will be able to send out oils of any test, which vendors may sell as an illuminant; and if any protection of the public is needed, it must come from the States. I should not object to make any easy distinction merely to assist the States ; but it is a different matter when we are asked to change the whole trading conditions, and adopt a certain process of denaturing on the dictum of one man. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sorry that the test has been increased to 102 degrees, because, in my opinion, it would have been better to leave it at 97 degrees. I have always understood that it is essential to take great precautions in regard to kerosene purchased for illuminating purposes. Now, however; it would appear that all the tests of the past were unnecessary, and that oil may be allowed in at 73 degrees, supposed to be for engines, while it can be sold as an illuminant at the price of good oil. We are told that if we attempt to stop this practice, we shall be interfering with some interests ; but that is an argument which is advanced against every proposed reform. There never was a law passed yet which did not interfere with the interests of somebody. It has been recognised for years that a low standard is bad, and that it is necessary to protect the public, first against dangerous oil, and, secondly, against inferior oil sold at the price of good oil. </para>

                        <para>- We should not object to a standard of 83 degrees, because the oil chiefly used in oil engines has a flash point of 86 degrees.. It has been stated that such oil may occasionally be used for illumination, with dangerous consequences ; but I know that when the proprietors of the Fairy Mead Sugar Mill, in Bundaberg, tried it for the sake of economy, they found, not that it was dangerous, but that it gave a very poor light, and its use had to be discontinued. No one who was not exceedingly ignorant would use it in preference to the ordinary illuminating oils, which are properly advertised, and can be easily distinguished from it. Even if people were foolish enough to use it, they would run no risk, the general  expert opinion being that a lamp which is dangerous if oil having a flash point of 73 degrees is used in it, would also be dangerous if oil of a higher flash point were used in it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The standard in Great Britain is a flash point of 73 degrees, and while one American standard is 100 degrees, the test is made in such a way that it is only the equivalent of 73 degrees in the Abel-Pensky close cup test, In most of the States of America, and in every other country in the world, the standard is 73 degrees or less. We should not object to a standard of 83 degrees, our position being that oil having a flash point of 86 degrees or more should be admitted free. The honorable member for Macquarie says that this oil is not so good for motive purposes ; but the following unsolicited letter from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wrench,</inline> a butcher in Childers, and a user of an oil engine, puts a different complexion on the matter. He says - </para>

                    <para>I have the honour to approach you on the recent action of the Senate in fixing the duty on kerosene to such oil as does not exceed a flash test of 97 degrees Fahr., which will put a burden on consumers of oil (kerosene) for oil engines, inasmuch as the oil which gives the greatest power is one with a low flashing point. That being used chiefly now is &#34;Royal Daylight,&#34; which, I believe, has a flash test of 86 degrees, which will be subject to a duty of 6d. per gallon. I am a consumer of kerosene for an oil engine, and this will mean to me anything from 30s. to &#163;2 per week extra for oil for my engine-pretty heavy, is it not? </para>

                <para>Then follows an apology for writing. This is not the only letter of the kind which has been received. In Central Queensland, the district I know best, thousands of oil engines are being used, largely because of their economy in fuel and running expenses. They have been bought on the understanding that cheap fuel will be available. If the users cannot get oil having a flash point of 86 degrees, which, I believe, costs 7&#189;d. per gallon, they will be forced to buy oil having a flash point of 98 degrees, at a cost of9&#189;d. per gallon. </para>

                        <para>- Then allow all oil having a. flash point of 83 degrees or over to come in free. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hake,</inline> the Chief Inspector of Explosives, and Chemical Adviser to the Department of Defence, reported in 1904 that oil having a flash point of 70 degrees is perfectly safe, and the Government adopted that as the standard. How is it that it has been suddenly discovered now that such oil is dangerous? Every argument advanced prior to the adjournment for dinner merely dealt with the protectionist aspect of this question. I contend that the proposal of the Treasurer, if adopted, will penalize those who use oil as fuel for engines. Any person who uses for illuminating purposes an oil with a flash point test of, 86 degrees must be satisfied with a palpably very inferior article. But no danger would result from its use. All the experts of the world have declared that 73 degrees is a safe flash point test to adopt. I have known cases in which inferior oils have been used for illuminating purposes, and in which those oils have actually choked the lamps containing them, so that their use had to be speedily discontinued. Are we to abandon the whole of our trade in these oils simply upon the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson,</inline> the Government Analyst of Victoria, who was never previously heard of as an authority upon explosives, and in opposition to the opinions of all the recognised world-known experts ? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member urges that, so long as an oil will not burn satisfactorily, the public are sufficiently protected. I do not hold that view. An oil which will choke a lamp will also choke an individual. Some of these oils give off. such an enormous amount of carbon that their use is absolutely dangerous to human life. By adding a very small amount of inexpensive colouring matter to them, they can be easily recognised. Thus the argument of the honorable member for Capricornia in regard to imposing a prohibition upon these oils falls absolutely to the ground. </para>

                        <para>- I would afford such a safeguard if I could ; but because I cannot secure that, surely I am not to be debarred from doing what I can in regard to the imported oil. We have to do our duty to the people of Australia, leaving the State authorities to do their duty with regard to local manufacturers. If we place the flash test at a proper level we shall find that the State authorities will adopt the same test with regard to local productions. The honorable member for Wentworth made a great point of a quotation from a book in regard to placing the flash test at  73  degrees. I should like to know the date of that book? </para>

                        <para>- In  1906,  an important conference took place in Germany, which was attended by a great many scientists, amongst whom were some of the greatest authorities in the world. One of these informed the conference that, in his opinion,  83.6  was the lowest safe flash point. The secretary of the conference, however, went further, and said that 86 degrees was the lowest really safe flash point. It was also pointed out that climatic conditions had to be taken into consideration. Now, the mean temperature of Germany is far lower than that of Australia, and more especially of Queensland. </para>

I am simply trying to protect the public. I have, however, been driven almost to distraction by the varying statements made by those interested. I have been assured on the one hand&#39; that if we carry the proposal of the Treasurer it means the &#39; complete obliteration of the British Imperial Oil Company, and also of the local company. On the other hand, I have been assured by authorities just as competent that the Treasurer&#39;s .proposal would  secure  a virtual monopoly for the local producer. </para>

                        <para>- I am not prepared to take any notice of any of these statements.&#39; I am proceeding on the broad principle that we should protect the public in two respects : first, . from danger to life, limb, and property, and secondly from fraud. I say that an oil which is imported to Australia for something like 6d. per gallon, and which is sold for lighting purposes, is not safe to use; and in my opinion we should not allow it to be imported for that purpose. But I recognise that the oil engine is becoming generally used, especially in the country districts. These engine&#39;s are frequently under the control of inexpert persons who do not really know the danger they run. I do not wish to deprive the users of oil engines of cheap fuel. The proposal of the Treasurer will permit a cheap fuel to be admitted free of duty, but it would b2 admitted in such a way as to be easily recognised .from the oil .which could be used safely for lighting purposes. If the company which is importing this fuel were prepared to place upon its tins an intimation of the purposes for which the oil was to be used, I should be satisfied. It is usual for the householder to buy his oil by the tin ; not by the pint  Or  quart. </para>

I am perfectly clear that . the honorable member for North Sydney was alluding to the tins in which the oil is. put &#34;up. &#34; I am glad to hear the leader of the Opposition say that,; in his opinion, the suggestion is worth considering, but he will have to convert the honorable member for North Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- The embossing of the tin costs very little indeed. I hope that honorable members who are anxious that the user of liquid fuel shall get it as cheaply as possible will not be led away by the statement which has been so freely made that he will be prohibited from using the imported article if it is interfered with in any degree at the Customs House. We have the authority of a competent analyst - and I take leave to say that there is no more competent man in Australia than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilkinson</inline> to express an opinion on this subject - not only that it can be cheaply and effectually done, but that the heat-giving power will be increased. Here surely is an answer to the argument which has been used. Those who say that if we carry this proposal the user of oil engines will be placed at a disadvantage, must be able to see that the slight disadvantage in any infinitesimal increase in the price - and I do not think there will be any increase because the tendency is to fall rather than to rise - will be more than counterbalanced by the greater safety to the lives and property . of people. The proposal will also give them a certain amount of immunity from the swindling and fraud which undoubtedly are being perpetrated. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member did not say anything about the tins being marked. What he alluded to was the denaturating of the kerosene on the other side of the world. He said that it was not likely that they would put up a special number of tins in that way for. Australia. He did not refer to the marking of the tins. That is a very good suggestion, and one which seems to be feasible. Like most honorable members, I have read. a great deal on this subject, during the last week or two. The letters and articles which I read were so contradictory that I do not feel competent to offer an opinion. I merely rose to point out that the honorable member for Laanecoorie has misunderstood, if not the actual words, the purport and intention of what the honorable member for North Sydney said. </para>
