                        <para>.- I think that it would be convenient if the honorable and learned member for Bendigo made his statement before the general discussion, and if he is ready to do so now the House would like to hear him. The discussion of the report could then be adjourned until a convenient day next week. </para>

                        <para>- After your ruling yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> inregard to the reading of newspaper paragraphs, I am in a bit of a quandary as to how I should proceed. It is necessary, for the purpose of a question which I wish to put to the Minister of Defence to read the following paragraph, which appears in to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> headed, &#34; Federation and defence. Disastrous disappointment &#34; - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Sydney, Thursday. - Lieut.  -Colonel Onslow,  addressing the Women&#39;s Patriotic Club on Australian defence to-night, said that federation in respect to defence had been a disastrous disappointment. We had obtained an able soldier in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Hutton, who, thwarted, baulked, and insulted by the Government, had returned - ti England in disgust. Since 1905 we had had a military board. The Deakin scheme was a disastrous folly. He did not believe that the best brains of Australia were connected with it. It was really conscription. Officers should be higher in the social scale than their men. The Swiss military system would not be at all suitable to Australia. </para>
                    <para class="block">Does the Minister think it right for an officer commanding a large force of citizen soldiers to criticise the Government in that way ; and will he, if the report is correct, take steps to remove this officer from his command at once? </para>

                            <para>- The fact that an officer is also a member of Parliament places on him a special responsibility. I do not know that any one will attach great value to the opinions which have been cited, though it must be acknowledged that the report is not a full one. The public have, on one side, the views of Lieut.-Colonel Onslow, and on the other, those of Lord Roberts, and can decide between them. The statement seems to imply that none except those of so-called high social standing should be given positions of trust in our defence forces; but if we were dependent on such persons, there would be no defence for Australia. </para>

A certain measure of freedom is allowed in different parts. </para>

                            <para>- I am inclined to think that the Prime Minister is under a misapprehension as to the information I desire. I wish to obtain information, not as to the custom of the departments, but as to the determination of the Government. We have granted a preference to certain imports from Great Britain, and I wish to know the decision of the Ministry as to the preferential treatment of British goods in connexion with tenders for departmental supplies. </para>

                        <para>- I very much regret that I have to call attention to a statement reported to have been made by the Treasurer, and to have to make a personal explanation in regard to it. Not content with the exercise of his rights and privileges as a member of this House, the Treasurer, as soon as we rose last night, made a statement to press representatives in regard to the reduction of departmental Estimates, and endeavoured to lay as much blame as he could upon my shoulders. In that statement, which is published in this morning&#39;s newspapers, I have been misrepresented.&#39; In my own defence I find it is. necessary to say that the Estimates for this year were not finally settled by me before I retired from the Government. </para>

                            <para>- The Estimates of every Department. I resigned office as Treasurer before they were finally settled. I had not decided finally on their limits, and had not consulted the Cabinet, and therefore the Estimates as introduced in this House were not what they would have been had I remained a member of the Ministry. At the time I resigned, as far as I can remember, it was not finally decided what amount the Prime Minister would require for Defence purposes. My colleagues did not seek interviews with me in regard to the Estimates of their respective Departments, but my interviews with the leading officials were of the most amicable character. I heard on their part no expression of dissent from the way in which I dealt with the draft Estimates, as far as I had consulted them, and was not aware that they disapproved of any action taken by me. At no time was any representation made to me by any of my  colleagues as to departmental dissatisfaction with what I had done with their Estimates. So far as I was aware, the officers of the different Departments were satisfied. Yesterday the Minister showed me a departmental paper on which in my own handwriting appeared a statement indicating that I had reduced the Works and Buildings Estimates of the Post and Telegraph Department by &#163;27,100. That fact had passed from my mind. The Department asked for &#163;32,000 for the construction and extension of telegraph lines in New South Wales, and I reduced the amount to &#163;30,000, a reduction of &#163;2,000. As a matter of fact, only &#163;14,000 had been spent in that direction during the previous year, and I thought that &#163;30,000 would be sufficient. Then again, I reduced the Estimates for similar works in Victoria from &#163;120,000 to &#163;100,000. I considered that as the Department during the previous year had expended only &#163;84,000 on such works, &#163;100,000 would be probably as much as it could expend during the present financial year. The total reduction made by me was &#163;27,100. Then he is reported to have said that I sent back the Estimates-in-Chief of the Department, reducing the amount asked for from &#163;547,000 to &#163;511,000. So far as my memory serves me, I was informed by Treasury officials that those particular draft Estimates were too large, and that if they were agreed to we should be unable to show a balance. </para>

                            <para>- I am not seeking to evade responsibility; I am only stating what actually took place. I am almost ashamed to refer to this matter; but, apparently, confidential notes of a Treasurer - confidential not as against the next Treasurer, but only so far as the public are concerned - have been unearthed. The decision as to carrying out the suggestions in these notes rested, of course, with the Cabinet afterwards ; they were merely preliminary notes, not final, prepared in order to ascertain how much could be allowed for each Department. And because I used my own pen, instead of allowing some one else to do so, these confidential notes of mine of proposed amendments made by me several times in regard to the same Department, which had not even been submitted to the Cabinet, are now published by the Treasurer in order to shield himself and attempt to throw the blame on me. Personally, I think this a most unusual proceeding. Why should confidential Ministerial notes on such a thing as Estimates, made and altered several times probably, and never intended until the last moment to be final, be published with such a motive? The present Postmaster-General did not occupy that office while I was a member of the Government; and, therefore, he knew nothing of those Estimates, and had nothing to do with them. </para>

If the right honorable member thinks he has been misunderstood, or misrepresented, he is entitled to make an explanation ; but, at the same time, I imagine he is going beyond legitimate bounds, and I ask him to bring his remarks to a conclusion as soon as possible. </para>

I only desire to add. that these notes were confidential, and were not final, and for my own use or that of the Department only. I might have thrown them in the wastepaper basket if I liked, as they were merely scrap notes for final settlement; and it is most improper, in my opinion, for a future Treasurer to use them in order to shield himself at my expense. I regret very much having to make this personal explanation, in view of the fact that the honorable gentleman and myself worked together on terms of personal friendship as colleagues foryears. </para>

                            <para>- These are not Cabinet secrets, but are set forth in public documents. The right honorable member for Swan, as Treasurer, very rightly sent the departmental Estimate back with a request that it be reduced. The Department reduced the* Estimate by  &#163;30,000,  or thereabouts, and when it was returned to the Treasurer, he further reduced it by  &#163;77,100.  In addition, he made further savings to the extent df  &#163;23,000.  That was the condition of the Estimate when I received and accepted it. </para>

                            <para>- I am making a personal explanation on the attack&#39; levelled at me by the right honorable member for Swan. At that time, the estimated&#39; revenue left a very small . surplus over the whole year; and it is the duty of a Treasurer to see that he does not introduce Es&#39;timates of expenditure which he cannot meet. That is what influenced the right honorable member, and I am not blaming him. I only take notice of the fact, because the leader of the Opposition last night attacked me for doing something which I did not do. </para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable member has anticipated a very general desire on the part of the House. I should have introduced the subject before, but, as we were so close to the end of the session, did not deem it desirable to do so. Some arrangement ought to be made by which notice of questions should be required. </para>

                        <para>- On the 27th inst, the honorable member for Cook asked two questions with reference to the tests to which letter carriers are subjected when; applying for promotion as sorters. In addition to the reply then given, the following further information has been furnished by the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, Sydney- </para>

                            <para>Candidates for appointment as Sorters to Grade I., &#163;138 per annum, are required to sort 500 letters in 13&#189; minutes with not more than 2 per cent. of errors (10) ; before they can be promoted to Grade II., candidates are required to sort 400 letters in 12&#189; minutes, with not more than1 per cent. of errors (5). It will thus be seen that the figures embodied in question (1) do not apply to entry to the Sorter&#39;s Grade, but to the test to be applied before promotion of a Sorter, Grade- I., to the higher Grade II. The 500 letters or cards for test are picked out for the purpose of diversity. </para>

If a Letter Carrier is ambitious to become a Sorter he may obtain sorting list long before his turn to be tested in line of seniority. The learning of 2,000 post towns is not necessarily restricted to three months, but he is allowed three months from the date he signifies his willingness to be tested. With these qualifications test is considered reasonable. </para>

                        <para>.- In my opinion, this Bill is merely a machinery measure, for which the Constitution clearly provides, five years after the imposition of a uniform Tariff. In debating it upon a former occasion, the right honorable member for Swan, who said that he was curious to know my view of it, asked whether I was prepared to do justice to the States. My reply is that I am most desirous of doing justice to them, and I trust that the time will never come when I shall attempt to inflict injustice, either upon the States or the Commonwealth. When this measure was being discussed, about six weeks ago, the objection which was urged to it by the. honorable member for Parramatta and myself was that it should have been accompanied by a financial statement, or, as an alternative-, that it should not have been proceeded with until the Premiers in Conference had an opportunity of debating the financial relations of the Commonwealth to the States. But, during the course of the debate which has taken place, the Bill has been attacked, not only upon the ground that it was introduced at an inopportune time, but also upon its merits. Viewing it from the latter stand-point, I am heartily in accord with it. By passing&#39; this Bill we shall do no more than we ought reasonably to do if we intend to discharge the duties which have been delegated to us as a Commonwealth Parliament. I have no doubt that this Parliament has complete power to appropriate the whole of the 25 per cent, of the net Customs and Excise revenue specified in the Constitution. </para>

The right honorable member for Swan has asked, &#34; Shall we do justice to the States?&#34; I say, &#34; Yes.&#34; The verdict which has been given repeatedly at general elections is undoubtedly the concern of this Parliament. I have read the programme of the honorable member for Swan, and I know that he was an earnest advocate of a Federal system of old-age pensions. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Flinders, who is a K.C, has not the shadow of a doubt as to the constitutionality of the Bill. As a matter of fact, 110 lawyer has yet definitely stated that it exceeds our powers under the Constitution; But even if its constitutionality were in doubt, surely the question is ot sufficient importance to justify us in taking the step that it is proposed to take. </para>

                            <para>- I have never argued in that way. But we cannot shuffle upon this question. Like myself, the honorable member is thrice pledged to a scheme of Federal old-age pensions. Here is the means of initiating such a system, and yet he says that we ought not to avail ourselves of it. It will be within the recollection of honorable members that I recently submitted a motion affirming the urgent necessity for establishing such a scheme. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Swan has asked why I did not tackle this question earlier. But I would point out that we had no power to deal with it in this way until five years after the adoption of a uniform Tariff. That period expired about the time that a general election was at hand. Later on Parliament went into recess, whilst the Prime Minister visited Great Britain ; and therefore we have not lost much time in dealing with it. We could not have tackled it very much earlier. Within ten days after the House had affirmed my motion that the establishment of a Federal system of old-age pensions was an urgent matter, I made a public statement, to the effect that I was in favour 01 this Bill, as under its provisions an amount could be&#39; appropriated and credited to a special trust fund, which would help to provide the Federal Treasurer with the necessary funds to commence paying old-age pensions from the 1st July, 1909. </para>

                            <para>- A parrot could repeat that cry. If we are to have no surplus, this measure will be without effect. If we expend the whole of our net quarter, and the profits from various services, it will be inoperative. But there should be, and, I think, will be, a considerable surplus.  I  expect that at least &#163;1,000,000 will be accumulated before July, 1909. </para>

                            <para>- My anticipation is that there will be then at least &#163;1,000,000 accumulated in a trust fund, and available for the payment of old-age pensions. According to my calculation, an accumulation of about &#163;I,250,000 would be more satisfactory. The question is, are honorable members .prepared, at this stage, to anticipate that accumulation by an appropriation? It is within the power of the Commonwealth to provide for other necessary expenditure as well as old-age pensions, under a trust fund, and it will be the duty of the Government to so provide for it if they think it necessary/ Will the Treasurer say what the increase of revenue has been under the new Tariff? </para>

                            <para>- If we go beyond our powers, the Bill will be invalid. The right honorable gentleman has himself stated that this is a question for legal men. The honorable member for Flinders, in a clear, lucid, and emphatic speech, said that there was not a shadow of doubt as to our right to exercise these powers, and the strongest adverse opinions I have heard from legal members have been the expression of a doubtful hesitation in regard to the matter. Three or four of the lawyers whom I have consulted say that they believe this legislation to be within our powers. </para>

                            <para>- The opinions were not paid for; but I think that. they were the result of deliberate consideration&#39;. The people, from whom we have extorted &#39; so much money, should be able to look forward to the receipt of pensions should they in their old age desire them. Not only have the toiling masses to provide the great bulk of our revenue, but, as the Minister of Defence pointed out to-day, they have also to find the flesh and blood to defend the country. Therefore, this, is not a party issue; men of all shades of opinion should be delighted at the opportunity to use part of our one- fourth of the net revenue for old-age pensions on theist of July,  1909.  It is not necessary to discuss at length the principles of a Bill which are apparently generally accepted, though I should make a passing reference to the Conference of Premiers held since it was introduced. It was thought that an opportunity should be given to the Premiers to express their opinions on the subject before we finally dealt with the measure ; but we have not got as much help from their deliberations as was expected. I am pleased that the Conference resolved that, in its opinion, a&#39; Commonwealth old-age pensions scheme should be established at the earliest moment. But it made the establishment of such a scheme conditional, whereas we, in our promises to our constituents, have been unconditional. </para>

If we did, we should be unworthy of our positions, and ought to give our constituents an opportunity to say whether they desire that we should continue in their service. There seems to be a hazy idea that, if the Commonwealth expends the whole of its net quarter of Customs and Excise revenue, some of the States will lose more than others. 1 deny that the expenditure will be disproportionate to any serious extent. Each State must pay its share of new expenditure according to population. </para>

                            <para>- And with regard to payments for other new services. I do not suppose that the Government require a measure of this kind for transferred services. They have a constitutional warrant for expending their share of the revenue upon such services. I do not think, however, that one State could be debited with such expenditure in another, though I do not dogmatize in this matter. New expenditure, however, will be charged <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> an arrangement which is fair to all the States. The statement that the large States will provide nearly the whole of the necessary money is. erroneous. Each State will, for all purposes of calculation, practically be called upon only to furnish sums for the payment of old-age pensions to its own citizens, and should be proud to be in a position; to do so. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that later. If all the States had old-age pensions schemes and if they dealt with each other reciprocally they would still be unable to do what can be done under our legislation. . That is an additional reason for urgency. Should the States which now have old-age pension schemes in operation be financially embarrassed by this Bill, they will have the remedy in their own hands. It is open to them by. a State Act to empower the Federal Government to pay their old-age pensions out of the proportion of Customs and Excise revenue returnable to them, and as soon as they do that their embarrassment will cease. The Commonwealth will pay instead of the State. The States need not suffer a day longer than they please; but in the case of the States which have no old-age pension scheme in operation, it is absolutely necessary that we should act without delay. This measure simply means that if we pass this session an Old-age Pensions Bill, and make an appropriation for the specific purpose, there will be no legal obstacle in the way of our paying into a trust fund to help, meet&#39; the obligations which the Federal Treasurer may thereby have to meet in the early future. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; and the States may relieve themselves of that burden whenever they please. The passing of a Federal scheme will certainly not mean the imposition of an additional burden on States which already have local schemes in operation. Since this Bill was last under discussion, I have received letters from every State which satisfy me that the people, and more particularly those in States which have no old-age pension schemes, are almost unanimous in the desire that a Federal system should be inaugurated without delay. </para>

                            <para>- It will, therefore, be  seen that Queensland, like New South Wales and Victoria, may by its own act relieve itself from any embarrassment. If the Governments of those States desire the Federation to take over the payment of old-age pensions, they need not be financially embarrassed. The other States must be prepared to meet this new expenditure. If the Customs and Excise revenue this year will be nearly&#163;2,000,000 in excess of the amount received under the old Tariff, then old-age pensions should be a first charge upon that excess. I go so far as to say that we should not be doing more than our duty by appropriating money, and accumulating it in a fund for the purpose of meeting Federal obligations incurred by pur own Acts and due at a future date, subject to section 87 of the Constitution. We are undertaking duties of a national character which have hitherto been performed by some of the States, and&#39; 110 one can fairly accuse this Parliament of being extravagant. On the contrary, the charge has been made again and again that we have been too niggardly. In the early days of Federation some of the States found themselves in a position of difficulty owing to the severity of the drought, and -the return to them of surplus revenue in excess of their three-fourths of our net revenue was considerate and becoming on the Commonwealth&#39;s part. That return was made according to law, and the States were fully entitled to it. It may be that the amount returned to more than one of the States as the result of this special appropriation will be less than three-fourths of their Customs and Excise revenue. </para>

                            <para>- Then why this eagerness to defend the States as distinguished from the people? The Constitution provides that the people of the States shall elect members of the Senate, and that the people of the&#39; Commonwealth shall elect the members of this House. It is difficult for any one who is not a lawyer to appreciate the difference between the terms &#34;the people of the Commonwealth&#34; and &#34;the people of the States.&#34; I recognise the distinction, but certainly do not appreciate the difference. </para>

                            <para>- Men are always willing to take up the arduous duties of office as soon as they are elected by the people. We must not forget that a member of Parliament can do nothing without the people. We have arduous duties to perform, but the people can always find plenty ready to shoulder the responsibilities  of political life. We can do nothing except by the verdict of the very people who constitute the States, and the point that I wish to impress upon honorable members is that those people have given a thrice repeated verdict which we must not set aside. The Prime Minister has in view in connexion with this measure the initiation of a system of defence of which as regards its naval side I entirely approve, and my views on which I have previously expressed in no uncertain manner. No one can deny that the members of the party with which I am associated have always been opposed  to the Naval Agreement. When it was first put before us in 1903 by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton we did not approve of it; we did our best to defeat it, , and were nearly successful. At that time the people were opposed to the attitude we took up, but I believe that to-day three-fourths of the people of Australia are entirely in favour of it. I do not mean that we should inaugurate a system of coastal defence which should not be associated with the defence scheme of the Imperial authorities. Honorable members will agree that it would not be wise, or even reasonably sane, for us to talk about initiating a scheme of defence dissociated from Great Britain. But in a country which is wholly dependent upon another, we search in vain for that essential of manhood which makes a worthy people and a worthy nation. So soon as a nation leans upon another for support, its people as a people begin to decline. The many natural difficulties with which we have to contend have made the virility of our people what it is to-day ; and it would be a sad day for Australia, and those who are to govern her hereafter, if, whilst she is practically a nation, with a constitution under the Crown of Great Britain, her manhood were to shirk their responsibility of defending their country to the last man. The whole question at issue is simply one of method. I am one of those who believe that we should take our own responsibilities upon our own shoulders. I have always been in favour of coastal as opposed to field defence. </para>

                            <para>- I have perhaps drifted away from the subject-matter of the Bill itself. Those who oppose the creation of a small fleet of our own, base their opposition on the assumption that, if we start  defending ourselves in this way, Great Britain will desert us. Is it not a fact that some of the most shrewd advisers of  His  Majesty the King have stated, from time to time, that it would be of great assistance to the Imperial Government if we had naval depots and a small fleet to defend our own shores ? ls it not a fact that almost all authorities declare that all we require at present are ships capable of holding off any stray cruisers for two or three days until the Imperial Fleet shall arrive? I take this opportunity of saying that I have never supported the restriction of the present Australian Squadron of the British Fleet to Australian waters; because my belief is that, where trouble is, there the ships should go. First, we should- secure a system of old-age pensions at the earliest possible date; and I hope that a Bill will be introduced immediately and passed this session providing for their payment not later than the 1st July next year. The initiation of a system of defence for our coast and harbors should also be undertaken at the earliest moment, but I cannot anticipate that the money will be required for a very considerable time, lt is only fair, however, that Parliament, as an earnest, should give some indication of its intention; and, therefore, I hope that this Bill will pass after reasonable debate, seeing that it raises no party question, and should be dealt with in the true Federal spirit, in the interests of the people of Australia as a whole. </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened with much attention to the honorable member for Wide Bay ; and I think that if I were to describe his speech as solely one in favour of old-age pensions, I should not be inaccurate. The validity and legality of this measure does not trouble the honorable member. From his arguments one would almost infer that, in his opinion, practically the end justifies the means, whether or not those means are constitutional. I am altogether opposed to the Bill, and was.  prepared to vote a direct negative. As, however, I cannot, under present circumstances, take such a course, I intend to support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Parramatta. In my opinion this Bill is not correctly named : it ought to be described rather as &#34;a Bill to prevent the return to the States&#39; of about &#163;700,000, which the Government do not know how to spend, or have not arranged to spend.&#34; My contention is that the measure is an invasion of section 87 of the Constitution; that it is an attempt to perpetrate a grave breach of faith, and that it is a departure from a clear and honorable understanding, made with the States prior to Federation, at the Federal Convention of 1 898 - an understanding on which the States of Australia federated. Those words cover the whole of the contention which I shall advance, in opposition to the measure. Immigration, defence, old-age pensions, and other important or beneficent questions, have nothing whatever to do with my opposition to the Bill. The honorable member for Wide Bay placed prominently before us the great necessity and advisableness of adopting a scheme of old-age pensions at the earliest possible moment.  1  agree with the honorable member on that&#39; point; but I hold that it has nothing to do with the matter we are now discussing, and, therefore, I shall not touch upon it in the slightest way. </para>

                                and also on the further ground that the Bill represents a departure from a clear and honorable understanding made prior to Federation, and in support of this latter contention I intend to show what the framers of the Constitution said and meant when section 87 was passed. As the Attorney-General says, my contention is, in the first place, that the Bill is
                                <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline>
                                and, then, that if it is not
                                <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline>
                                it is an attempt to perpetrate a grave breach of faith with the States. I wish to say once and for all that there is no doubt that the Commonwealth, under section 87, can expend annually the whole of the one-fourth of the net revenue from Customs and Excise.

I  contend that if the Commonwealth does not spend the whole of the one-fourth, the unspent or unused portion must, under section 87, be returned to the States. That view has been acted on ever since the establishment of the Federation. </para>

At any rate, the view  I  have presented has been acted upon up to the present&#39; time ; and  I  have never heard anything to the contrary suggested. No suggestion to the contrary was made at the Convention in 1898, nor has any been made since, although nearly eighteen months have elapsed since the bookkeeping period could have teen terminated. No suggestion of the kind has been made by any Prime Minister, Treasurer, Leader of Labour Party, or, indeed, by any one in this Parliament, except a remark of the honorable member for Flinders, some months ago, who said he thought such an interpretation was possible.  I  do not know that the honorable member made &#39; that remark very deliberately. It was,  I  think, an opinion that the question was open to doubt. </para>

The honorable member, however, on 31st March last, rushed in, and took up the cudgels on behalf of the Government, and expressed a view which is adverse to my contentions and to the interests of the States ; and he has the credit, as well as the responsibility, of being the first to suggest such an invasion of States rights. </para>

                            <para>- Then it must have been kept very close, because I had never heard it expressed by any one before. When I was busy endeavouring to adjust the financial problem between the Commonwealth and the States, I never heard any suggestion of the kind made. The Commonwealth may spend the whole of the one-fourth if it chooses, but, if it does not spend or use the whole of its one-fourth then, I think, it is clear that the balance must be returned to the States. Further, I contend that under section 87 of the Constitution, this House has no power to credit any unexpended portion of the Commonwealth&#39;s one-fourth share of the net Customs and Excise revenue to a trust account, except for the purpose of paying a charge or debt actually incurred, or a liability actually existing. </para>

I desire to point out to the honorable member for Wide Bay that we have not merely to consider what is desirable in this matter. A great many things are desirable, which it is impossible for us to obtain. If we can, constitutionally, secure the necessary funds to initiate a Federal scheme of old-age pensions, without any breach of good faith with the States, I am quite in accord with most of what the honorable member said. </para>

                            <para>- If we desire to expend the full one-fourth share of the Customs and Excise revenue, to which we are constitutionally entitled, we are at liberty to do so. Why have we not spent it? In this connexion I wish to defend the action taken by my old friend and colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, in the early day of the Federation. Recognising that- the States were then suffering under a great many difficulties, he naturally desired to return to them as much money as possible, so as to enable them to meet their obligations. At that period several of the States required liberal treatment financially by the Commonwealth. Queensland was suffering from- a terrible drought, and Tasmania was in difficulties by reason of the falling off of Customs revenue. Even a few thousand pounds were of consequence to Tasmania in those days, whilst Western Australia required every penny that she could get to assist in developing her immense territory. I think, therefore, that when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner did his utmost to sustain the financial position of the States during the difficult time that they were passing through, his action commanded the approval of the people of Australia. In his speech on 31st March last, the honorable member for Flinders attached very great importance to section 81 . of the Constitution - so much importance,  indeed, that he appeared to almost ignore the provision contained in section 87.  He, apparently, forgot that section 81 is a general provision which is to be found in the constitutions of all British countries. It relates to the power of Parliament to appropriate money for the services of the country. It would be impossible to carry on a Constitution if Parliament had not power to appropriate revenue for the public service, subject, of course, to its constitutional powers. But I submit that the words in section 81 &#34;to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner, and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution,&#34; do not give us full power, for the power is limited by the provision contained in section 87. The honorable member for Flinders seemed to treat the power conferred under section 81, as if it were plenary,  whereas I contend that it is limited by the words of section 87. . I submit that the  language of section 81 is general in character, and must be read subject to the specific words of section 8y, &#34;not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth&#39; towards its expenditure.&#34; I take the word &#34;applied&#34; to mean used. The section continues - </para>

                    <para>I believe that the words of this section mean that the Commonwealth is at liberty to expend not more than one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise&#39; revenue, and that -the balance of three-fourths - or more - shall be returned to the States. I come now to the words &#34; its expenditure&#34; contained in section .87. I contend that those words mean actual expenditure. They would, I think, include money due on contracts to the extent of the work actually performed. 1 believe that they would also include repayments of actual debts and such like. . If we appropriated money to pay debts incurred by the Commonwealth or in connexion with contracts actually performed for the Commonwealth, it would be proper to charge it against the expenditure for the year, and it might be put aside if it had not actually been paid until the claims against it we&#39;re presented. </para>

                            <para>- We have not to consider what is best for the Commonwealth or State Treasuries, but solely what is right from a constitutional point of view. The words &#34;its expenditure&#34; do not in my opinion include money set aside in a trust- account to meet prospective charges, prospective debts, and liabilities for  works which have not been undertaken or which, perhaps, have not even been decided upon. Yet that is what this Bill purports to do. Out of our one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue it proposes to set aside money for the purpose of meeting prospective charges and debts and liabilities for works which may not have yet been thought of. </para>

                            <para>- My contention is that appropriation is merely the authority to expend money, but that expenditure is an Executive act based on that authority. The meaning of the two words is therefore quite distinct. Evidently the honorable member thinks that I do not know the difference between the words &#34; appropriation &#34; and &#34;expenditure.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I see no great prospect of paying for it from current revenue, and as this great work is necessary and urgent, I should pay for it out of loan funds, just as all the railways in Australia have been paid for, as well as nearly all the other great public works in New South Wales. I repeat that the words &#34;its expenditure&#34; refer to <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> and existing liabilities and not to prospective, visionary liabilities. That is my deliberate belief. It seems strange that I should have to defend the interests of the States against the views of the honorable member for Flinders, who sits alongside me. For some reason or other he has been anxious to take the credit for this thing, when, as a matter of fact, it will do him a lot of harm. </para>

I am really sorry that he should be open to the charge of endeavouring to deprive the States of what I consider is their just due. The honorable member for Flinders dealt with annual appropriations for the payment of sinking funds in regard to loans. My opinion is that it is within the power of the Commonwealth to pay out of its one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue annual payments to such funds. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. If an Appropriation Act authorizes the payment annually of a sum for the repayment of a debt which has been incurred, it can surely be paid out of the one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue. But until 1910 this Parliament is not sovereign in regard to expenditure. Its powers of expenditure in regard to Customs and Excise revenue are limited by section 87 of the Constitution. </para>

The Treasurer, too, was a member of the Convention. The honorable member for Wide Bay is continually saying, &#34; Let us be honest, and act as honest men.&#34; That is what I want his party to do on this occasion. </para>

I will read, for the purpose of proving my contention That the Bill, even if not <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> is a grave breach of faith with the States, quotations from the speeches of some of the most prominent members of the Convention. Their opinions ought surely to have some weight as to what was the intention of the framers of. the Constitution. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon, on the nth March, 1898, in moving the insertion in the draft Constitution of what is now section 87, providing for the return to the States of three-fourths or more of the Customs and Excise revenue  -  I refer honorable members to the official report of the Melbourne session, page 2378 - said - </para>

                        <para>I have, on every occasion when I have referred to it, advocated that there should be some definite return to the States provided for. I hailed, with very great pleasure, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon&#39;s amendment when he brought it in. It is simple and effective, and will coincide entirely with what I have advocated upon this question. I also think that, as regards the small States, as well as possibly the &#39;larger ones also, this is one of those clauses which will help very materially to recommend the Bill. If we give up this &#163;6,000,000  of revenue, and the States have no power of raising revenue through the Customs, and no guarantee from the Federal Treasurer that they will get a return, there is only one alternative, and that is imposing excessive direct taxation to fill up the gap ; and that would prevent a great many persons from voting for the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing about appropriation being considered as expenditure, or providing that the unexpended balance of the one-fourth may be placed to a trust fund for future use and not returned to the States. There is nothing in that to suggest that an unexpended balance under section  87  would be regarded as an expenditure, on the ground that it had been appropriated, or, in other words, had been authorized to be expended, but had not been expended. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton said that the whole of the unexpended balance would be annually paid over to the States.

                        <para>I will pass on to a much more important provision very lately introduced into the Bill. That is a provision that a fourth only of the net revenue of the Commonwealth will be allowed to be expended by the Commonwealth. That is to say three-fourths or more of the revenue must annually come back to States whose citizens are taxed. </para>

                    <para class="block">All this goes to show that, from the beginning to the end, the intention of the Convention was that under the Braddon section the Commonwealth should annually return to the States any unexpended balance remaining after liabilities actually in existence had been met. There is no ambiguity in these words. The honorable member for Wide Bay has reminded us that this is not a party question, and I appeal to honorable members, again quoting the honorable member, &#34; as honest men,&#34; to say what is the plain, clear, unmistakable meaning of these words. It would seem that, with some honorable members, the end justifies the means. </para>

                            <para>- He did not actually use those words, but I think that that inference might be drawn from his observations. After reading these words, uttered by prominent members of the framers of the Constitution at the Convention of which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were members, I appeal to honorable members not to support this proposal on the part of the Government. Is it likely that, but for the proposal of the Government to take advantage of this measure to assist in bringing into operation a scheme of old-age pensions, we should have found the Labour Party, consisting of twenty-six members, prepared to support this Bill, irrespective of the interests of the States ? I am just as strong a supporter of old-age pensions as is any member of the Labour Party, and but for my vote and the votes of members from Western Australia who supported me, the power to deal with old-age pensions would not have been in the Constitution ; but I urge that the fact that it is proposed to finance a Federal system under this Bill cannot override constitutional considerations, or the honorable understanding made with the States before Federation. That a majority in this House appears to be opposed to the views I have urged, and seem to. me to be willing to do what I consider is a grave injustice to the States, will not cause me to waver in my determination to perform what I believe to be my duty, a duty that I owe to my own State and to the people of Australia generally. I owe, too, a duty to the Constitution which I took part in framing, and I am not going to subscribe, without the strongest protest, to an interpretation of that Constitution which, I am sure, the Convention did not intend to be placed upon it, and which I do not think is legal. </para>

I have endeavoured to place before the House all those portions of his speeches which appear to me to have a bearing on this question.  I  am surprised at the attitude of the Government and of the Labour Party, which is always boasting of its desire to do justice. Where are the defenders and protectors of the rights of the States on the Government side of the House? One would imagine from the attitude of honorable members on the Government side of the House, and especially in the Labour corner, that they had not been returned by the people of the States of Australia; that they were here, not to represent the States who have sent them here to look after their constitutional rights and interests, but that these matters were of secondary importance to the passing of some warlike or beneficent measure. </para>

                            <para>- I  have not said that they are not. The Labour Party, in this House more particularly, seem to ignore or forget the promise to, and the honorable understanding made with, the people of the States during the Federal campaign. They seem, also, willing to overlook in this case the provisions of the Constitution for the protection of the revenue of the States, and, apparently, are never better pleased than when they are able to do something which will place the Treasurers of the States in financial difficulties. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members of the Labour Party seem to forget the great duties and obligations resting upon the Parliaments of the States. They have responsibilities which affect as closely, if not more so, the material welfare of this country than do those of the Commonwealth Parliament. The nurturing and education of the future men and women of Australia is intrusted to them. The opening up of the country by means of railways, roads, bridges, and water supply schemes, and also the immense work of subduing the wilderness and making the land available for occupation and settlement rests with&#39; them. They are intrusted with the maintenance of law. and order, and with promoting and assisting production from the soil all over this great continent. Remembering all these great duties and obligations, we ought surely to have some sympathy with them in the gigantic work they have intrusted to them.. But we find on the Government side of this House very little sympathy for the States, if we may judge by this and other measures. The Treasurer seems to have no regard for the obligations resting upon the States, and the demands made upon their revenue.  His  sole desire seems to be to try to please honorable members of the Labour Party. He will never please them ; he will never satisfy them until he signs their pledge, and joins their ranks. I wish that he would do so, for he is, to all intents and purposes, a member of that party. He is returned by the Labour Party, and kept in office by them. </para>

                            <para>- So do I. The obligations and duties devolving upon the States are so great that it is difficult for them to make ends meet. They could, with advantage to Australia, spend millions more than they have at their command. Even if our revenue this year will be .&#163;2,000,000 in excess of that of last year, I fail to see why we should take from the States &#163;500,000 of that total, unless we have expended it. The people of the States are clamouring for new services to open up the country and settle people on the land, and I utterly fail to understand why this Bill should have been introduced at the present stage. Surely the Government might keep faith with the States until 1910, and until then, at all events, return to them any unexpended balance of the one-fourth under section 87 at the end of each year, as in my opinion is the legal as well as moral interpretation of section 87. Apart altogether from any question of law, I do not think that it can be denied that this proposal is utterly wrong, and that it will be considered by the States to be a grave breach of faith. We have great power in regard to expenditure and taxation, and&#39;, if we wish to finance any scheme designed to benefit the people, we can surely find some way of doing so without trying to drive a coach-and-four through the Constitution for the purpose of depleting the revenues of the States. The course that we are asked to take cannot, I think, be justified. Even if it is legal, it is inexpedient, and reflects discredit upon its advocates. It is wrong that we should even try at this stage to take away from the States, who have not sufficient to provide for their present requirements, a large sum to which they are entitled. In Western Australia we have to build railways out of loan moneys, the revenue being insufficient to meet such demands. There are hundreds of miles of railways awaiting construction, and  money  has. to be borrowed for that work. I am not here to mince words, neither do I wish to be discourteous to  any  honorable member, but, as I have said before, the power of the Labour caucus is so strong that its wishes must be complied with, even if it interferes with compliance on the part of honorable members -with the interests of their constituents. If it were not an iron-bound organization, should we find every member of it in agreement with respect to. such a measure as this ? They do not seem to care for the Constitution. They have in view the providing of funds for a scheme which members on this side of the House are ready to help them to secure if they will take a proper course, and every other consideration has to be ignored. </para>

                    <para>- When the House adjourned for lunch, I had almost arrived at the end of what I desire to say, but, before  I sit down, I should like to recapitulate in a few words my contentions. I contend that, under section 87 of the Constitution, this House has no power to place any unspent or unused portion of its one-fourth of the revenue to a trust account, except for the purpose of paying a charge or  debt actually incurred, or a liability actually existing. I contend also that the words &#34; its expenditure &#39; &#39; in section 87 mean actual expenditure, and might, I think, include money due on contracts to the extent of work actually performed, and also the repayment of actual debts and such like. But I have contended - and I contend now - that the words &#34;its expenditure&#34; do not include moneys set aside in a trust account to meet, prospective charges, prospective debts, or prospective liabilities for works not vet incurred, or not yet decided upon. In fact, my contention is that the words &#34;its expenditure&#34; mean <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> and existing, and not prospective <inline font-style="italic">ox</inline> visionary liabilities which&#34; may never come forward for payment. I contend also that, apart from the constitutionality of the measure, it is an attempt to perpetrate a grave breach of faith, and is a departure from a clear and honorable understanding made before Federation with the States. In the course of this debate it has been said in so many words that if this Bill is illegal, it cannot do any harm, because it may be set aside by the High Court. That, I think, is a most vicious principle - if I may use so hard a word - to introduce, especially into legislation which affects the States so vitally and so directly. I regret that this sort of idea should have entered the minds of honorable members. Surely that is not the spirit in which &#62; during these early days of Federation, and during the continuance of the Braddon section, we should enter on legislation which affects the States. Why should the Government&#39; desire, or even think of, introducing legislation which I have no doubt they will admit, is, on the face of it, of - doubtful validity ? </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer says, &#34; No &#34; ; but I think that there are laymen quite as capable as himself, and a great many lawyers, who could be found to say that there is a great deal of doubt as to the validity of this measure.  I  suppose that later on we may be addressed by some legal members, and we shall then see whether there is or is not any doubt in their minds as to its validity.  I  think few will venture to say that there is no doubt whatever. </para>

                        <para>- But there are some things so evident that we may almost stake our existence on them. At any rate,  I  do not think the honorable member for Flinders will say there is no element of doubt as to the interpretation which may be placed on this Bill by the High Court. My point is that it must be admitted that there is an element of doubt in this matter - though  I  have no doubt myself - and if that is so, then especially when we are dealing with friendly States, composed of our own people, we should not try to strain our powers to the uttermost. For a long time  I  have had strong complaint to make in regard to this straining of the Federal powers. The desire of the Government seems to me to strain them so much that there are often questions raised before the High Court as to the validity of our Acts. </para>

                        <para>- But the other Acts were &#34; pretty close to the wind,&#34; and if the Government have been fortunate in most of the cases, there has ever been an element of doubt. Personally,  I  have been in accord with some of the Acts called in question; but  I  certainly am not in favour of the Bill before us, and of some other measures which the Government have tried to pass. &#34;  I  commiserate the Government a little, because  I  will not assume that they very much relish the course they have pursued. Unfortunately the state of parties in this House has forced the Government to introduce these Bills, or go out of office. </para>

                        <para>- I appreciate the honorable member&#39;s kindly feeling towards me, as shown by that observation. In conclusion, I ask again why we should strain the Constitution to its utmost limits when the result must be to injure the States. I appeal to the Government to think of the great obligations and duties which are cast on the States in the opening up and development of the country, the placing of people on the land, and in promoting the general production and progress of this great continent, and if there is to be any straining of the Constitution, to let it be in the direction of helping the States. I have tried to do only  what I consider to be my duty in upholding what I know, from my own personal knowledge, was the intention of the framers of the Constitution. I am firmly of the opinion that this Bill is contrary to the Constitution, and is, moreover, a grave breach of that honorable understanding which was arrived at between the States and the Commonwealth&#39; at the Melbourne Convention of 1898, prior to Federation. </para>

                    <para>. - No one will complain of the right honorable member for Swan for exercising his independent judgment in accordance with what he believes to be his duty as a member of this Parliament, and as one who had something to do with the passing of the Constitution. </para>

                <para class="block">Although I concede that much, I must admit to a feeling of deep regret that the right honorable member should even suggest that this Bill is in any way a breach of faith or a violation of the spirit of the Constitution. The feeling of the House all through has been to pay the greatest regard to the rights and duties of the States ; in fact, a great deal of our trouble has arisen from a sincere desire on the part of the Treasurer and honorable members to iri.no wise embarrass the States in the early stages of Federation. We&#39; realized that during the early life of the Constitution there were certain limitations which were intended as a direction to this Parliament ; and during the first five-year period, when we were realizing what our finances were, and what the effect of Federation might be on the States, it was felt that we should stay our hands and &#34; go slow.&#34; Possibly we have erred in going too slowly, and&#39; in failing to realize that the people of Australia created the Commonwealth Parliament as a national Parliament, and vested it with national powers, to be exercised for their good. The general attitude of this Parliament has been, and still is, one of sympathy with the States. Another impression that the honorable member left upon the minds of his hearers was that the Commonwealth and States are entirely separate entities, apart from the people. I think that the electors&#39; view of the matter will be : &#34;We have established two sets of agents - Federal and State. We have given them separate powers, the first set to act for us in Federal matters, and the second to act for us in State matters. </para>

                        <para>- But the right honorable member talked about the Commonwealth and the States as if the Commonwealth were something external to the people, when, as a matter of fact, both are one and the same people.  His  argument practically is that we should hand over to the States all the money that we can, and thus cripple the Commonwealth. To do so means that we shall be obliged to levy heavy imposts upon the people if we intend to fulfil our national functions. In all our financial proposals with the States we should so arrange our affairs that neither will be obliged to impose unnecessary burdens on the taxpayers. What we want to realize is that both the Commonwealth and the States derive their authority from the same persons. The honorable member put his position very clearly, and, from that standpoint, he is to be congratulated. He contended, first, that this Bill is unconstitutional; secondly, that it is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution- </para>

His claim that the Bill .is unconstitutional is based upon -his contention that it violates section 87 of the Constitution. He urges that the meaning of that section is that the money which the Commonwealth does not actually expend in one year, or which is not set aside to meet an existing debt or liability, or to cover  payments in connexion with contracts to the extent to which they have , been fulfilled, must be returned to the States. The section in question reads - </para>

In- connexion with a similar section contained in the United States Constitution., <inline font-style="italic">Story</inline> summarized the. arguments in. favour of the wider interpretation, as follows : The argument in favour of the power is derived, in the first place, from the language of the clause conferring the power, secondly from the nature of the power which renders it in the highest degree expedient, if not indispensable, for the due operations of the national government ; thirdly from the early, constant and decided maintenance of it by the Government and its functionaries, as well as by many of the ablest statesmen of the United States from the very commencement of the Constitution. Section 81 of our Constitution must, therefore, be interpreted in the widest possible way. It must necessarily be so interpreted when it is remembered that we have to deal with national institutions, and that without revenue we cannot discharge our national functions.&#39; The Commonwealth has been endowed with great powers t and the power of appropriation must be proportionate to the other powers conferred upon it. The right honorable member for Swan . contends that the power of appropriation is limited by section 87, which he argues provides that all money not actually expended by the Commonwealth during the financial year must be returned to the&#39; States. He bases his argument upon the use of the word &#34; apply.&#34; But I would point out . that that word, is always used in connexion with appropriations, and that it really means &#34; appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth.&#34; It is now an ordinary practice in the High Court in interpreting the Constitution to contend that we must look at Statutes enacted by the Imperial Parliament, with the view to giving to similar words in our own Constitution a similar meaning. Now if we look at Act 63 and 64 Vic, we shall find that it reads : &#34; An Act to- apply a sum out of the Consolidated Revenue &#34;- </para>

The first Act passed by. this Parliament was &#34; An Act to grant and apply &#39; &#39; a certain sum out of the Consolidated Revenue. Consequently the words ot section  87  mean that not more than one-fourth of the revenue from Customs and Excise duties shall be applied and appropriated annually towards the services of the Commonwealth. Otherwise why is the word &#34; towards &#34; used in that section? If the word &#34;applied&#34; means &#34;used &#34; as the honorable member contends, the section would read : &#39; &#39; Not more than one-fourth shall be used annually bv the Commonwealth towards its expenditure.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- What is being done is subject to the provisions of section 87. Sections 89 and 93 appropriate balances to the States; and although the Bill repeals section 93, the balances remaining over and above the Commonwealth requirements will still be so appropriated ; but by virtue of this Bill, it may be contended that the word &#34;expenditure&#34; as used in section 93, has a restricted meaning, </para>

                <para class="block">But if it be construed strictly to mean the actual expenditure and payment of money, the Constitution would be unworkable, because it is impossible to make up actual balances every month all over Australia, and pay them to the States. . Therefore, it is obvious that the word has a wider meaning. In my opinion, it is intended to cover debts or obligations due, or to become due. Had the Commonwealth taken over the debts of the States, with a liability for interest of &#163;8,250,000 a year, it would have had the power to retain the money necessary to meet the obligation out of general revenue. Whether the word &#34; expenditure &#39; &#39; can be applied to general appropriation for the purposes of the Commonwealth is questioned, and this Bill will remove that doubt. &#34; Surplus &#34; is distinct from &#34; balance,&#34; and means moneys in hand over and above the sums appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth. Under the Constitution we have clearly the power to pass this Bill, and it is necessary to pass it to enable us to carry on the great work intrusted to us. The Constitution having endowed us with national powers, they carry with them the right to appropriate moneys, without which such endowment would be futile. </para>

                    <para>. - Except for part of the speech of the right honorable member for Swan, the argument, so far, has centred round the constitutionality of this measure. I admit at once that that is very difficult to decide, and that laymen do not get much light, either from the provisions of the Constitution, or from the opinions of those learned in the law, who seem to take opposite sides. Therefore, I-and, no doubt, many other lay members - must hold that the constitutionality of the measure is uncertain, and that the Government and law officers of the Crown must take responsibility for recommending it to Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- They are trust funds. Some of &#34;those in the list which I have here are such as the constitutional question raised has nothing to do with; the officers&#39; guarantee fund, for example. But other of those trust funds were established so that it should not be necessary to pay to the States at the &#34;end of the financial year the sums placed to their credit, and if their establishment is constitutional, there is no need for the Bill. </para>

The Attorney-General said that the right honorable member for Swan, and others, did not seem to recognise that the electors were represented  by two agencies - the one a national, and the other a State agency. He seemed . to imply that the electors of the States, being identical with those of the Commonwealth, would be prepared to trust the national agency just as freely as they would trust a State agency in this matter. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. It is really a Bill to legalize a further appropriation for future purposes. There has been much dispute .as to the exact meaning of the words &#34; used &#34; and &#34;applied. &#39; &#39; Judging by the Treasurer&#39;s forecast, it seems to me that we shall have to take into account the meaning, not merely of these words, but of the word &#34; take.&#34; lt would seem from the Treasurer&#39;s statement of his intentions that it is a case, not of using or even of applying money, but of taking money. </para>

                        <para>- I desired an assurance&#39; in that regard, for the power given by the Bill is a very wide one. I do not object to the establishment of a Federal scheme of old-age pensions. On the contrary, I have always approved of old-age pensions being under the control of the Commonwealth. I supported the system as a State undertaking in pre-Federation  days, and with the establishment of the Commonwealth I considered that such a scheme should be taken over by the Federal authority. But if the Ministry pass an Old-age Pensions Bill, it will annually absorb far more than any surplus Customs revenue we are likely to have. That is another reason why this Bill seems to me to be unnecessary. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister now takes power to accumulate, or to hold oyer, for the purposes of the Commonwealth, considerable sums in a trust account. Then it has been claimed that this Bill will only absorb the actual surplus, and as regards that surplus it is said that we have been returning to the States every year, on an average, &#163;800,000 in excess of the proportion of revenue to which they are actually entitled. We have not teen doing anything of the sort. A considerable portion of that amount,  ranging  from &#163;350,000 to &#163;400,000 or &#163;450,000, really represents interest on the value of the transferred properties which we have not yet paid to the States. They certainly have not lost anything in that regard, because the surplus moneys which we have returned to them have been far in excess of the interest actually due in respect of those properties. But we have no right to take credit to ourselves for having returned to the States, on the average, &#163;800,000 a year in excess of what we were required to do, when, in reality, we have handed back to them only about one-half of that amount. The other day, the Treasurer, when foreshadowing the requirements of the Commonwealth, indicated that, even during this year of boom revenue, he anticipated a surplus of only &#163;400,000 odd. He did not make it clear whether or not we should have that surplus after appropriating &#163;250,000 for naval defence purposes. In that case, we should have a surplus of only &#163;200,000 ; and, in the other, a surplus of something over &#163;400,000* In reality, we shall&#39; have little or no surplus. As the Prime Minister told us to-day, the valuation of the transferred properties is practically complete, and immediately it has been settled, interest upon them will become payable by us. We become the trustees, though not the owners, of the properties ; and we have to provide the interest out of our one-fourth of the revenue, thus absorbing the surplus of this boom year. The Minister foreshadowed that, in the immediate future, he did not anticipate so large a revenue, and that he expected still larger demands, apart altogether from old-age pensions. I really do not know whatre.sult is to be attained, at any rate this year, by&#34; means of this Bill. It would have been much better not to have introduced this measure, but to have brought down an Old-age Pensions Bill, which would, in itself, absorb all the surplus, and more. Of course that might necessitate a financial arrangement with two or three of th* States, who would be asked to give an equivalent contribution in consideration of their being eased of the obligation to pay pensions. In any case, however, all&#34; th&#60;; surplus would be more than absorbed bv old-age pensions; and I see no necessity whatever for measures of the sort now before us. Such a Bill has not been found necessary hitherto. We are supposed to be intending to take only a portion of the surplus, and when&#39; we ask where the surplus is, we find that it does not exist.  The Treasurer will admit that the . payment of interest, which will shortly begin on the transferred properties, will practically absorb all that is anticipated as surplus. Another matter of regret is that in this measure the system of bookkeeping is continued. This is most unfortunate, in view of the fact that one of the strongest reasons for Federation was that it would  get rid of the obstacles and difficulties in the way of trade between the various States. The desire was to have free borders and free coasts as between State and State, so that, among other things, the trouble and expense of passing complicated entries for goods might be done away with, and a free exchange substituted, such ss there ought to be in what is one country. </para>

One of the objects of Federation was to make the well-to-do States assist the less well-to-do States; but it was found that a burden might be placed on the weaker States unless there was a guide as to the duties paid on goods actually consumed in each State. Thereupon the clumsy, awkward, but, I must admit, for the time necessary, system of Inter-State bookkeeping was established. Now, however, we are at the end of the five years, and, with the experience gained, we know what would be a fair&#39; adjustment between the States. As a matter of fact, there has already been an adjustment between New South &#39;Wales and Victoria, and, that being so, it ought to be possible for the Commonwealth to devise a scheme fair to all the other States. Yet, here it is proposed to continue the present troublesome and inaccurate system. </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, the present system is more troublesome and difficult than  the pre-Federation  system of  collecting  duties, inasmuch as now an analysis has to be made of, say, a coat ; it has to be ascertained whence the buttons, the thread, and the cloth have come. Indeed, the system is only made possible by evasion - to use an Irishism, it is only possible. because it is. not observed. It is impossible for me to believe that the firms who handle these goods make the complete analyses which are called for under the bookkeeping section ; and the work can be done only in such a rough manner&#34; as to make it quite inaccurate. I feel sure that a settlement could be come to which would pav every consideration to the smaller States, and thus there would be removed a system which is a blot on our Federation. I did hope that when Ministers were dealing with the question, they would abolish the bookkeeping; but, on the contrary, we find it deliberately continued by means of this measure. There are no issues at stake that could not be easily met, and it is most desirable that we should, in every respect, feel that we are one people. It ought to be possible to send goods from Melbourne to Perth or elsewhere, with just as much ease as from Melbourne to Warrnambool. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt the honorable member could give illustrations of the difficulty and the absurdity of the system which, though useful for its immediate purpose, was never intended&#39; to be continued. I have not attempted to&#34; say whether the Bill is constitutional or not, simply because I do not know. Reading one portion of the Constitution would lead me to believe that it is constitutional, while another portion of the Constitution leads me to a contrary view ; and, in my opinion, only the High Court can settle the question. If our application of moneys to trust funds in the past was constitutional, then the Bill is not required; and, on the other hand, if it was unconstitutional, the passing of this Bill will not alter the situation. </para>

                    <para>. - I listened with interest to the speech of the right honorable member for Swan, who seemed very impatient because honorable members did not agree with all he had to say. The right honorable member, in taking the view that the Bill is unconstitutional, said that he felt a burden of responsibility resting upon him, owing to the fact that he was a member of the Federal Convention. I suppose that for a. period after the inauguration of Federation there was a good deal of responsibility on those who had been members of the Convention  j but that responsibility, . I think, ended when Parliament appointed a High Court to interpret the Constitution. Under the circumstances, the right honorable member for Swan has no more responsibility in this connexion than has any other honorable member, and a great deal of his eloquence, and the resentment he showed towards honorable members who ventured to interject, was meaningless. If the Bill is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> the High Court will say so,&#34; and to me the question seems one of policy rather than one of constitutionality. Much of the legislation to which the right honorable member was a party has been reversed, and, so far as we have a forecast, the High Court will be against another Act &#62; which- the right honorable &#39; member assisted in passing. The passing of this and similar Bills will make it so much less possible for the States to carry on the services which they have at present under their control, and, in this way, the object of Federation will be accomplished, inasmuch as the Commonwealth will be asked to take over these services. The States will then have less to do, be less important and less arrogant, and more easy to live with than is the case at present. There is what is called a fight for States rights, but in reality these are not rights. The States have certain functions to perform, and, if we withhold  money,  their remedy is to ask that the services be taken &#39;over by the Commonwealth. The Treasurer estimates that the revenue derived from Customs and Excise this year will exceed that of last year by &#163;2, 000.000. Should his estimate prove correct, the Commonwealth will thus receive &#163;500,000 more than it received last year. But that sum will prove altogether insufficient to enable the Government to give effect to the policy, foreshadowed by them, even if they were  able  to credit the whole of it to a trust account. But I contend that .any moneys credited . to such a . fund ought tn be regarded as a set off to the amount due to the States as interest upon the transferred properties. I presume that a certain rate will be allowed upon their capital value. If the Government pay the States interest upon the transferred properties, no  money  will be left in the trust account. Of course, it mav be urged that no harm will result from the passing of this Bill. The honorable member for Wide Bay devoted most of his speech t&#34; emphasizing the desirableness of establishing a Federal system of - old-age pensions. May I point out that such a  system  cannot be inaugurated consequent upon the passing of this Bill, except in the very distant future. A sum of &#163;1,500,000 is required to cover the cost of a Federal scheme of old-age pensions, and long before that amount has been accumulated, other demands &#39; will have been made&#39; upon the trust fund - demands which must be met promptly. There are&#39; Acts upon our statute-book which will make heavy demands upon the&#39; money which it is proposed to credit to that fund. For instance, there is the cost that will be incurred in &#39; giving effect to the defence scheme of the Government, and the outlay that will be involved in the construction of the. proposed Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. We have also to bear in mind that the projected line will probably not pay, and the Commonwealth will have to make up Hie deficiency. Recent returns show that the mines of Western Australia are upon the down grade, and that the quality of the ore is deteriorating with depth. Interest upon the capital cost of the railway will also be a charge upon the Commonwealth. Then we shall have to face the loss that will be incurred in administering the affairs of the Northern Territory, and the payment of interest upon its public debt. . All these schemes will be a charge upon the trust fund which it is proposed to create, to say nothing of the bounties, the payment of which has been authorized bv Parliament. Consequently, if the Labour Party expect that we shall be able to annex the whole, of the additional .&#163;500,000 to which I have referred, as the nucleus of a Federal old-age pensions fund, . they will be disappointed. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly the honorable member had in his mind the matter of payment for the transferred properties. Whilst I do not feel disposed to oppose the amendment, I should prefer to see the Bill rejected. I do not think it is expedient to establish the trust fund that is proposed. If we do so, the States will probably test its validity in the High Court, and in any case, we are merely meeting trouble half way. If we want to initiate a special scheme of old-age pensions, let us impose direct taxation for that purpose. Certainly, we cannot provide the necessary money by passing this Bill. The Attorney-General has spoken upon the question of the constitutionality of this Bill. To my mind, it is&#34; a matter of little consequence whether he is right or wrong in his contention, inasmuch as the measure will be inoperative for the old-age pension scheme. And, moreover, if the Bill is constitutional, the Constitution Act al ready gives the powers that are asked for in this measure. If we place it upon the statute-book, its constitutionality will probably be challenged by the States which will resent the creation of a trust fund. The only justification for the creation of any such fund would be an intention to relieve the States of some of the services which they at present administer. In the end, I believe that the finances will adjust themselves. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not propose, at this hour of the day, to occupy much time in discussing the measure. The case for both sides has been strongly and fairly put. The right honorable member for Swan raised the point that the Bill is unconstitutional, while the Attorney-General has contended for its constitutionality. Although the right honorable member for Swan said that he did not speak as a lawyer, he argued with considerable skill and ability, evidently understanding his subject thoroughly, because he was able to handle it as well as a great lawyer could have done. Undoubtedly in this he was assisted by his long experience as a Minister of the Crown, in the State of Western Australia and in the Commonwealth. For five or six years he helped to administer the sections of the Constitution with which he dealt, and, no  doubt, understands their inner, as well as their apparent, significance. But for the views in opposition to his put forward by some of my legal friends, I should entertain no doubt as to the soundness of his contention. Indeed, I think that, so far, he has had the better of the argument. He has created so much doubt as to justify the belief that the question will never be settled except by the High Court. Bur the right of the States or of the Commonwealth cannot be prejudiced whether the Bill is passed or not, because both are secured by the Constitution. The measure cannot be considered as one to interpret the Constitution ; it is rather declaratory. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of clause 4 provides that - </para>

                <para class="block">The question arises whether a saving or setting aside of money - the placing of it to a trust account - is an expenditure. We are asked to declare that it is. I support the view put forward by the right honorable member for Swan, that under section 87 of the Constitution the Commonwealth can apply only one-fourth of Customs and Excise annually towards its expenditure. Does &#34; applied annually &#34; mean &#34; used &#34; or &#34;spent annually?&#34; After hearing the arguments which have been put forward, I think that it does. Money not used or spent annually must be returned to the States. There is a manifest distinction in the Constitution between &#34;applying&#34; revenue or money and &#34; appropriating &#34; it. Section 81 provides for appropriating the revenue of the Commonwealth, that being the first section in which the word is used. Section 82 enacts that - </para>

                <para class="block">The terms .&#34; appropriating &#34; and .&#34; applying&#34; are not synonymous, but have different meanings, and should receive different significations. Section 87 says that not more than one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure, and, although it is dangerous to dogmatize on constitutional questions, my view is that what is meant is &#34; used annually &#34; or &#34; spent annually.&#34; Money that is not used or spent within the year must be paid to the States. That was the intention of the framers of the Constitution. Passages have been quoted from the reports of the debates of the Convention, which show that it was understood that the whole of the unexpended balances would be returned to the States, and that interpretation has been placed on the Constitution from the beginning. It has been the practice of the Treasury to return to the States all unexpended balances, and I see no reason why that practice should be altered ; indeed, I think that it cannot be legally altered, and that the declaration that payments to a trust fund shall be deemed expenditure will be null and void. It is a contradiction of terms to say that appropriations shall be expenditure. The word &#34; applied &#34; occurs for the second time in the Constitution in the second paragraph, of section 87. In that connexion it undoubtedly means paid. &#34; Applied towards the payment of interest &#34; means paid towards the interest --spent in the payment of the interest. It does not &#39; mean &#34;appropriated,&#34; be-, cause there is a previous- appropriation. Personally, but for this obstacle in the Constitution, I should be quite willing&#39; t&#39;o vote for the Bill. As a matter of convenience, it would be a most desirable thing to do, if we had the power to save the unexpended balance, and- pay it&#39; into a Trust Account - to hoard it up for big Federal enterprises. But I have to consider what are the rights of the States as well as of the Commonwealth. I am not prepared in any way to abridge &#34;the undoubted constitutional and legal rights of the States. I do not believe that the States will tamely acquiesce in any invasion of those rights. If they do acquiesce in this Bill, it will stand. If they &#34; do not, they can bring an action against the Federal Treasurer to recover the unexpended balance. </para>

                        <para>- It is not desirable to promote .litigation between the Commonwealth and the States. It would Be disastrous t&#39;o take any attitude that appears to be fighting the States, invading&#39; their rights, of encroaching upon their privileges. We ought rather, if possible, it. cultivate friendly relations with the States Governments, which are part of the machinery of the government of the Commonwealth, just as much as we are. They form a part of the King&#39;s Government of Australia, and there is no occasion for contest or conflict between them and the Commonwealth Government. So far as concerns the intention of this Bill to facilitate great Federal enterprises, such as old-age pei&#62; sions and naval defence, I am as anxious to promote and assist those objects as is any other honorable member, but I am not prepared to violate the fundamental principles of the Constitution, even for the sake of promoting popular measures. If this Bill is invalid, it may mean a little delay, but in eighteen months or two years the Braddon section will cease to operate, and arrangements may be made for entering upon those great&#39; national enterprises in the meantime. It will take a couple of years before we can expect to develop&#34; a scheme of naval defence that will involve actual expenditure, and in the same way it may take eighteen months or two years before Federal machinery for the payment of old-age pensions throughout Australia becomes effective and operative. By that time the Braddon section would have ceased to operate. There are other matters in connexion with this proposal which I would criticise, but as the time for adjourning has now arrived, I shall reserve my further remarks for the Committee stage, if it is reached. In the meantime, I hope it will be understood that no one who has criticised this Bill is adverse or hostile to its ultimate objective, but that the objections raised by the right honorable member for Swan and those who agree with him are founded upon legal, technical, and constitutional principles &#39;that we feel bound to assert. From that point of view, I think the House will pause before it launches upon an enterprise which will undoubtedly bring  the Commonwealth into conflict with the States, may lead to prolonged litigation, &#187; and will tend to create further irritation and ill-feeling between the two important branches of the King&#39;s Government in Australia. </para>

The action of the Treasurer is one of the most arbitrary and ill-advised that could possibly be taken, and I hope that the Prime Minister has sent a reply to the Premier of Western Australia, stating that whatever instructions have been issued are contrary to the plain words of the  Constitution,  and that the ordinary practice, adopted for the last seven years, will be continued. </para>

                        <para>-- I also wish to ask whether the Treasurer cannot see his way to throw some light on the matter that has been brought before the House by the right honorable member for Swan. Surely when the Premier of a State telegraphs to a member of this House on a matter of such importance, the Minister of State primarily responsible ought to be able lo offer an immediate explanation. .1 do not think we are asking for any more than we are entitled to. </para>

                            <para>- What happened was this : The end of the month of May has not yet arrived. It has been usual, when the end of the month falls on a Saturday or a Sunday, to pay on the Friday. The Acting Under-Treasurer telegraphed to the States on this occasion giving reasons why the balances were not to be paid to the States to-day. The reason was this - that it was hoped that the Surplus Revenue Bill would be passed. The Bill ought to have been through. I hope that it will be through before the end of next month. There is no intention, nor was there ever any intention, to create a breach of the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- As I understand, the telegram which the right honorable member for Swan read stated that the instructions given were that neither this month&#39;s balance nor the succeeding month&#39;s balance were to be paid. The question which I wish to ask. is this - is it the serious intention of the Government, or of the Treasurer, before the Surplus Revenue Bill is passed, to deprive the States not merely of what may be the surplus for the remaining month, but to deprive them of an amount equal to all the surpluses that they have had during the preceding months of this financial year? Because, if that be so, I venture to think that that state of affairs will put a totally different complexion upon the whole proceeding, from that which has been put upon the policy of the Government by this House. It will mean making the Surplus Revenue Bill retrospective in the very worst sense, by taking back from the States, in effect, what has been paid over to them, and depriving them absolutely - if that view be right - of the provision which the Constitution has made for them for the remaining month of this year. I cannot believe that that is the real meaning: </para>

                            <para>- It seems pretty clear that what I have stated is the fact. It means this - that during the past ten months of this financial year, the Treasurer&#39;s view&#39; is that we have been paying too much to the States, and that we are now going to take money back from the States. If the telegram of the Western Australian Premier means anything, it means that; and, further, that we are going to take money back from the States by extracting from them all the revenue to which they would otherwise be entitled during these last two months of the financial year. If that be the intention of the Treasurer) I. think that it requires further explanation. I suggest that the explanation which the Treasurer has given us needs to be further explained, or else- </para>

                        <para>.- I think that we have aright to complain of the tone adopted by the Treasurer towards honorable members of this House when he.  is  asked for information upon important public questions. Honorable members are entitled to resent the contemptuous manner adopted by the. Treasurer when addressing himself to members on this side of the House, The . manner in which he addressed the honorable member for Wentworth was, undoubtedly, unbecoming to. the  dignity of the Treasurer&#39;s position. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer has no right to treat any honorable member in such an abrupt, curt and overbearing manner. The question under discussion has arisen in consequence of the telegram received by the right honorable member for Swan from the Premier of Western Australia. But the matter affects every other State&#39;s finances. The explanation given by the Treasurer was not satisfactory ; in fact, the Treasurer&#39;s explanations never are very satisfactory. I understand the position to be  that  instructions will now be given by the Treasurer that only the three-fourths constitutionally payable to the States will be paid. That may have been a wrong impression, but the. Treasurer&#39;s explanation was so short, snappy, and incoherent, that the House does not really know even now what is the real financial proposal he has in mind regarding the amount to be paid to the States for this month. </para>
