                        <para>- Yesterday the honorable member for Hindmarsh asked a question, without notice, in reference to  certain contraventions of the Customs Act by Messrs. Harris, Scarfe, and Company, of Adelaide. I am informed that the eight contraventions referred to .are not part of the seventeen charges mentioned, and have no connexion whatever with them. They were merely technical contraventions of the Act, such as clerical errors, &#38;c. Contraventions of this kind are of frequent occurrence in all the States, and, as no fraud is imputed in such instances, they are dealt with under Part XV. of the Act, and a small penalty usually imposed.- The particular eight instances in question were quite ordinary instances of this kind, and their number is explained by the fact that they cover a period of about fifteen months, having been held over on the advice of the Crown Solicitor. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable members are doubtless aware that the Attorney-General has suffered during the last few days from a rather severe throat and chest attack. But he insisted on being present to-day to move the second reading of this measure. Apparently he did not think  that the Order of the Day would be&#39; reached so soon, and allowed for the ordinary interval for the answering of questions without notice. Not having prepared myself with the data, it is unnecessary for me to make any further remarks ; but in moving - </para>

                        <para>.- The general feeling in this House on the present occasion must be one of satisfaction because of the opportunity now offered to endeavour to settle the. vexed question of the site of the Federal Capital.  At the present time I do not wish to enter upon any inquiry as to the causes of the delay which has occurred. But  1  think I represent the general feeling in New South Wales upon this subject when I say that the people of that State are strongly dissatisfied with that delay. So long t ago as  1903 - five years since - the Government took up this question, and endeavoured to settle it. More than two years ago - namely on the 13th December, 1905 - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs,</inline> then Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, stated that the Government intended to introduce a Bill to determine the question, and to carry it to a conclusion during that session. From that time to this no such Bill has been introduced, and no effort has been made to settle the matter. I do not wish to enlarge upon these details, because we have at last an . opportunity to endeavour to terminate the difficulty. Honorable members, I&#39; think, will not feel aggrieved at the interest shown in this matter by the representatives of New South Wales. Honorable members from each of the six, States have never been blamed for exhibiting some degree of zeal in connexion with matters which, although Federal, peculiarly affect their own divisions of the Commonwealth. I look upon any criticism of our desire to press this matter to its conclusion as most unfair. I am not at all sure that the Government have chosen the best method of dealing with the question, but am quite prepared to accept that which they have chosen. I understand from the statement made by the Prime Minister that the Government propose that we should go into .Committee ; and that if the word &#34;Dalgety&#34; is removed from the Bill pro&#187;gress should be reported, and that the Government should then submit resolutions for a ballot. The effect of that action would not be to exclude Dalgety or any other site from the &#39; final selection. I assume that in fairness to those who advocate the .selection&#39; of Dalgety &#34;it would not be considered a final vote with regard to that site. Dalgety would be entitled with other sites to be considered in any ballot carried out. I would suggest to the Government that a more convenient course would be to test the opinion of the House upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill. The Bill is described as being one &#34; to determine more definitely the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth in the neighbourhood of Dalgety.&#34; If a majority of this House is in favour of retaining the word &#34; Dalgety &#34; in the </para>

                            <para>- So long as the Government will understand that in so voting the usual interpretation placed upon&#39; the throwing out of a Government measure on the motion for its second reading will not be adopted ; but that the vote will be simply regarded as the most convenient way of testing this matter. It is idle to ask an honorable member to affirm the second reading of a Bill to more definitely determine the Seat of Government at a certain place if, when- the Bill is taken into Committee, his first act will be to vote for the elimination of that site from the Bill. The more logical, shortest, and most effectual way of determining this question will be, therefore, to decide whether things shall be left as they are on, the motion that the Bill be now read a second time. Those in favour of the proposition naturally and properly will vote for that second reading. </para>

                            <para>-- -Yes; I think that would be the simplest form to adopt. I wish in advance to earn the  gratitude  of honorable members, in the hope that I maybe heard for a moment or two, by endeavouring to deal with this subject as briefly as  possible;  because I  think  that it would be a pity if we unnecessarily protracted this debate. I desire to remind honorable members of the agreement arrived at at the Premiers&#39; Conference, which met in the beginning of the year 1899. As honorable .members will recollect, after the first referendum it was found that the people of New South Wales had not by the requisite majority affirmed Federation. I, as the head of the Government of New South Wales in those days, suggested a Conference of the Premiers of the six States. That Conference was held, and I submitted to it a number of points. I think &#39;that honorable members will agree with me that in -effecting the abolition from the Constitution Bill of a provision which would have meant that at a joint sitting of both Houses, held after a general&#39; election, 66 votes out of the total of in would not have been/ effectual &#39;to carry any proposition, I rendered a substantial service, and added to the democratic lines upon which the Constitution is undoubtedly framed. I also, think that in putting a period to the iron-bound provision in the Braddon clause another substantial service was rendered to the people of Australia, although I am the last one to withhold from the States a proper, if more elastic, form of protection for their financial interests. Well, these were two large &#39; matters, and honorable members may consider this a small matter. They may think that the attitude which I took up in claiming the Federal Capital site for New South Wales was a narrow one. But so far as I am concerned, I took the view, in the interests of- the Federation, and as the leader in tHat great battle before the second referendum, that with these three alternatives in the draft Constitution I could look forward to an assured victory for the cause, whilst in the absence of any one of them I could not have the same confidence. I based this claim to the Federal Capital Site upon a higher ground than that. Viewed in the light of the interests of the Australia of the future, I formed the opinion - to which I still adhere - that, in the inevitable development of our national- greatness, it will be found that the ultimate centre of the millions who will inhabit this great continent will be somewhere in the State of New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- That prediction confirms my contention that it will be in New South Wales. But whether that be so or not honorable members, I feel sure - whatever  their views may be - will at least begin with a disposition to honour,, if possible, the terms of the -arrangement arrived at. I shall never forget the effect which the right honorable member for Swan produced upon this House by the earnest and eloquent appeal which he made for an honorable observance of that which was never reduced to the formal binding terms of a written agreement. He appealed to us not on the basis of an agreement expressed in plain black and white and signed by every one of the Premiers of the States, but on the faith of that which he regarded as amounting to some sort of an honorable understanding. He will remember that I honestly responded to his call. From the first time that he made that appeal to me I have loyally striven to the extent of my power and influence to give effect to that understanding. I call upon him to act in the same honorable spirit towards the understanding which he signed in black and white with reference to New South Wales. I think that I may fairly make that appeal. I honoured his appeal, which rested upon more flimsy ground - which was not set forth in so many words, and signed, sealed and delivered - and I ask him in the light of his own signature, and honouring his own agreement, to remember that whilst the Premiers&#39; Conference would not allow the Federal Capital to be located in the neighbourhood of Sydney, whilst it stipulated that it must be at least 100 miles distant, it expressly agreed that it should be within a &#34; reasonable distance &#34; of that city. I wish at once to make the admission that I do not expect the House to carry out even that honorable and well-expressed agreement, if, as a matter of fact, there is no reasonable site within a &#34;reasonable distance&#34; of Sydney. I do not wish to interpret that bond as we interpret bonds between men of business, if there be no site which can reasonably be regarded as a proper one for the Federal  Capital  within the ordinary meaning of the language within a &#34;reasonable distance&#34; of Sydney. I am not here to say that the Federation should be blind to the future interests of the people of Australia to the extent of selecting an unreasonable and unsuitable site because it happens to be within a certain degree of contiguity to Sydney. But I do take up this position : that if within a &#34;reasonable distance&#34; of Sydney there  is  such a site available this House  - if it  recognises the honour which springs, from agreements between representatives of great communities - will honour the Premiers&#39; agreement. It is, I think, in the nature of an agreement which rises to the highest degree of sanctity, because it was upon the faith of that agreement that the people of New South Wales were asked to cast their votes in favour of entering this Federation. It is quite different from the ordinary kind of agreement, for a breach of which some measure of damages awarded by a Court will suffice. This is not that sort of agreement. The people of New South Wales, above the signatures of the Premiers of the six States, were told, &#34; If you join this Federation, we agree and promise, on behalf of the people of our respective communities, to do this thing.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- My Government made no such agreement. No such agreement was ever made. Governments cannot write out bargains between great communities. The bargain resulting from the Premiers&#39; Conference was not between this Government and that - it was an honorable understanding between the great bulk of the communities of Australia. If the honorable member will pardon me for saying so, it was possible for the Parliaments and the peoples of those States to have raised their voices in repudiation of that agreement. It was published, I think, in the early days of February, 1899 - about the 1st or 2nd February of that year- and the vote was not taken until the middle of 1899. All through those months there was no voice raised to suggest to the people of New South Wales that the agreement which had been entered into by the Premiers of the States was one which would be dishonoured by any single State. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose that I was guilty of this unfortunate weakness - that I looked upon this agreement signed by the six Premiers as quite good enough for me. I did not act in the spirit of the man who is dealing with hucksters in trade. The part of the  bargain  which I put in the Constitution was that to which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner attached so much importance. In the light of events, which I did not foresee - and I am obliged to my honorable and learned friend for his reminder - if would have been wise if I had realized that the most solemn agreement does not always bind unless every term of the agreement is expressed. </para>

                            <para>- Sheer inadvertence. I can assure the honorable member for Flinders that- the reason this was not placed in &#39;the Constitution was that I was perfectly satisfied with the written undertaking on the part of the Premiers of the six States. For months it was open to the States Parliaments &#39;to repudiate the undertaking; but the whole question went to the ejectors on that basis, and, in the light of events, I regret I did not place the words kit the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- Although it may take up time, I should like to make the matter a little clearer. The whole of this question was threshed&#39; out in the Parliament of New South Wales before &#39;the Conference of Premiers. I must remind honorable members that this was not an ordinary Conference of Premiers. Before I asked the Premiers to meet me, all these points were, as I say,- threshed out in the Parliament of New South Wales, and these terms about the Capital Site were, a part of the arrangement which I submitted to the assembled Premiers. If honorable members will not regard this minute signed by the Premiers as &#38; proper guide for interpreting the section&#39;, in order to get the spirit of the section, they are taking, a course which I did not .expect. I expect an honorable spirit on the part of honorable members. I know it is open&#39; to them to take points, and say, &#34; It was not in the bond, and, since that be so, what do .we care for any understanding at which the Premiers arrived?&#34; But is there a man&#39; in New South Wales, Victoria, or any of the other States, who would have changed his vote because that arrangement had been arrived at ? Who will say that any of the people of Victoria would have reversed their vote for Federation because of the Premiers&#39; minute? </para>

                            <para>- I do not desire to enter further into this matter. There are two ways of looking at the question. If it is to be subject to the scrutiny of proof, as in a Police Court, or any other kind of Court, there are, I admit, a number of loopholes by which the honorable understanding can be escaped. But if the spirit of agreements or understandings arrived at from time to time between great communities, represented by their trusted leaders, are to be interpreted in this way, there will be an end to international communication or agreement of any sort. What Act of Parliament records the solemn obligations into which representatives of great nations enter at Conferences of the kind? What Act of Parliament guarantees the honour of a great nation for the full performance of its treaty obligations? The fact is, that this was an understanding expressed in black and white, and signed. Those who choose to repudiate that understanding are perfectly at liberty to. do so, because there can be no suit for breach of agreement, or for penalties. All that will remain to the people of New South Wales will be the feeling that on an understanding, which was an anxious and important one to them,&#39; and on the faith of which they joined Federation, the Commonwealth has not acted in  that  honorable spirit in w. hick it acted to the. right honorable member for Swan in connexion with another question not expressed in the terms of a written agreement. Where is &#39;the provision in the Constitution that there shall be a railway established between this side of the continent and Western Australia? We did not ask the right honorable member for Swan to prove his case as if in a Police Court ; indeed, I think we went, perhaps, further than the strict rule required. </para>

It was put in black and white, signed by each of the Premiers,- and published throughout the length and breadth of Australia. As I say, I do not desire to labour this point too much. If honorable members will not act on the understanding, there is no power on earth to compel them to do so. I can  only  appeal to their sense of what is fair and right ; and I now dismiss altogether that part of the question. As I say, honorable members are entitled, in spite of this provision in the agreement, to have some site suggested to them which is a reasonable and sufficient site for the purpose. I do not contest that view for a moment ; but it is always subject to the fact . that the reasonable site must be a reasonable distance from Sydney, and that, if there is no reasonable site within that distance, Parliament must do the best it can. Now, I submit that there are at least two magnificent sites within a reasonable distance of Sydney, one of which is Lyndhurst. </para>

                            <para>- Well, Lyndhurst, as honorable members know, stood absolutely at the top in three of the ballots which were taken - it may have been in five out of six ballots - and being a little under, I think, Bombala, or Tumut, it had a commanding position until the very last. Since then another site has been brought under the notice of Parliament, and that is also within a reasonable distance of Sydney. When I use the. term &#34; Sydney,&#34; it is only with reference to the State of New South Wales. Some pivotal point has to be mentioned ; and in this connexion, &#34; Sydney &#34; merely represents the whole of the interests of the whole of New South Wales. The site I refer to is Canberra, which was not in the list of those submitted at the first ballots. That fact, in itself, is not, of course, a disadvantage, because we must remember that Dalgety, which now stands in the Seat of Government Bill, did not receive a single vote on the first ballot. It is an extraordinary circumstance that, from the sixty or seventy honorable members assembled, Dalgety, out of the six sites submitted, did not receive one vote. Dalgety did not even get the vote of the honorable member for  Eden-Monaro. </para>

                            <para>- My super-angelic friend, the member for Grey, has at times been confronted with the choice between two undesirable alternatives, and has then undoubtedly exercised his common sense by selecting the less objectionable one.- I then stuck to Dalgety like wax, because if I let it go I should have got something worse. Whilst in  office, I was bound to stand by Dalgety so long as it represented the deliberate will of the Legislature. But can it be said that I, or any other honorable member whose first choice Dalgety was not, am bound by the selection of Dalgety if an opportunity is given for making a better choice? A person who chooses one of two evils is not thereby debarred from choosing good when the opportunity arrives.  That is my answer to my honorable friend. I consider Lyndhurst a magnificent site. It was my first choice, and would be so again to-day had I not reason to believe that Canberra will be given much more support. </para>

If I see no prospect of that, I must, in the exercise of my intelligence, vote for the next best site.

I was in Kalgoorlie when, for nearly eight days, the thermometer never went below about 150 degrees, although the moment  the Federal politicians left, the temperature fell about 50 degrees.

                            <para>- Although the weather during my stay was not all that could be desired, I should say that Kalgoorlie must be one of the finest places in Australia to live in - if you have a thirst. I look upon Canberra as the site likely to be more acceptable than Lyndhurst to honorable members generally, and it is therefore important to consider its advantages and disadvantages. Had its merits been discussed prior to the first ballot, I should not now occupy time in detailing them. But, whilst the good points of Dalgety, Bombala, Lyndhurst, and a number of other sites have been exhaustively reviewed more than once in previous Parliaments, those of Canberra have not yet. I think, been discussed, and therefore I propose to advance a few reasons why this site might well be chosen in honorable fulfilment of the agreement amongst the Premiers, as being within a reasonable distance of Sydney,. I do not wish to express any opinions of my own ; I prefer to give the House the! benefit of those of the Engineer-in-Chief of Public Works for New South Wales, an eminent officer who visited the site, and devoted his professional talents to drawing up a report upon it. As this report is in the hands of honorable members, I do not propose to occupy time with lengthy quotations from it, though I may be allowed to pick out one or two recommendations of Canberra which it &#39;contains. </para>

The extent of gently undulating country suitable for building exceeds that of any of those other sites, while the low hills generally surrounding the city area, with the foot hills in the middle distance to the south, and the high peaks again in the far distance forming the mountains of the southern watershed of the Mumimbidgee, give it an attraction as regards scenery unsurpassed by the others suggested. </para>

                    <para class="block">The question of railway communication is also very important. There is railway communication already within/ a mile or two of this spot, and by the construction nf a short line from the main! southern railway it is possible to connect the site with the whole railway system of New South Wales. As a matter of fact, it is already connected by rail with every part of the railway area of Australia. I. shall  not deal  with other matters affecting the site. I h&#39;ave pointed out that it is within reach of lofty eminences ; that it is beautiful in the matter of scenery ; that ft&#39; is within reach of lofty mountains ; that it has a magnificent water supply ; and the most excellent building materials. In my view it answers every requirement which could be sought for in connexion with the Federal Capital. I want to leave the discussion of this question without endeavouring to disparage in any way any of the other proposed sites. I am not going to disparage Dalgety because I am advocating the claims of Canberra; I do not wish to gain any support by disparaging that site. I simply urge that&#39; in Canberra we have a beautiful site for the Capital, the selection of which would incidentally, satisfy, in the most honorable way, the expectations of the people of New South Wale sounded upon the agreement to which I have referred. There are one or two other considerations of a general character which do not concern the merits of a particular site. It has been said in some quarters that it would be a mistake to build a Federal Capital ; that the Seat of Government should remain, in Melbourne, or should alternate between Melbourne and Sydney. I do not believe the Federal Parliament: will ever breathe a Federal atmosphere in any great city of Australia:. At one moment Victorians are attacked here for their provincialism, and in the next, representatives of New South Wales are attacked in the same way. Then&#39;, again, the Tasmanians, the South Australians, and the Queenslanders are from time to time charged with provincialism. But the greatest of all provincialism in Australia comes out of the newspaper offices. Whilst it sits in Melbourne - -and probably it would be the same if we sat in Sydney - this Parliament is every daly under a sort of bombardment which does not represent a truly Australian sentiment, nor breathe the true Federal spirit, but which gives rise to fresh issues of discontentment and separation between the representatives of the different States. </para>

                            <para>- I think so, end we shall also be able to improve the conditions under which the Federal Parliament meets. I do not shrink from the neighbourhood of organs of public opinion. The newspapers of Australia, if they like, can have their representatives by the thousand at the Federal Capital. One of the advantages of -a country capital, so far as we are personally concerned, will be that we shall be more under the glare of public observation in such a place than we are in any of our great cities. Let every organ of public opinion in Australia send its representatives to the Federal Capital ; but my experience is that it is only in a Federal Capital that we can hope to secure the development of a truly national spirit. It seems to be an economic arrangement to meet in this magnificent&#39; building, which cost Victoria a million sterling; but is it consistent with the dignity of the Federal Parliament that it should be a non-paying guest of one of the States ? That has been our position for the last seven years. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that, but when we are in the &#39;house of the most hospitable entertainer, there is sometimes the consideration that we should not intrude too long, upon his hospitality - that we ought to have a house&#39; of our own. Surely this Parliament should have a house of its own. . It is the design of the Constitution, at any rate, that we should, and, if we do not respect the idea, let us at least respect the terms of the Constitution, which makes a Federal Capital, and a Federal Parliament sitting in its own house, an integral part of the Federation. As one of the inhabitants&#39; of another State, I wish to. acknowledge in the strongest  terms the unselfish liberality extended to this Parliament by the Government and people of Victoria. It was no light matter for the State Parliament to leave this magnificent edifice, and to take up temporary quarters at the Exhibition Building, in order that we might be accommodated with the greatest comfort and convenience. lt is only right that we should be deeply grateful to the members of- the Parliament of the state of Victoria; but the time has come when we should cease to be the guests of any one State. The time has come when we should set up our own-&#39; house. One objection raised against our doing so is that it would be very expensive. The establishment of a capital in a crowded city would be infinitely more expensive than would be its establishment in the country. If we choose to set about the founding of the Capital in an extravagant way, we may do a gross &#39;injustice to the people of Australia ; but surely we shall not take it for granted that we are going to so disregard&#39; our duty ? Surely we are not going to erect palatial edifices for the Governor-General, the Parliament, and our officers in the early days of our existence? Surely we can emulate the majestic simplicity of the early American patriots? For sometime they had no magnificent edifices. As the Federation grew in majesty, strength,, and wealth . such appurtenances grew with it ; but the idea of establishing an expensive series of buildings at the Federal&#39; Capital has been invented in order to disparage us and to disparage our duty in respect of this matter. </para>

                            <para>- Surely the presence in the House of men of the brainy intelligence of the honorable member and others would be sufficient to prevent anything of the kind. I look forward to the establishment of a Federal Capital having no element of extravagance connected with it. The extravagance of a building is not in the comfort Or the accommodation which it affords ; it relates to outside show. A most comfortable and convenient! building can be erected at moderate cost on a plan which provides for .internal details. Does my honorable friend the Minister of Trade and Customs, ever dream in connexion with that magnificent site of his - which is waiting so impatiently for the glories of the future - of squandering millions on the banks of the Snowy River? I am sure that he would be the first to vote against any such extravagance, even if it were designed to glorify his own electorate. I do not think that any honorable member has any . idea of squandering the public money in the erection of magnificent exteriors, which may well wait until the strength and wealth of this country will honestly permit of them. Therefore, in supporting the establishment of the Federal Capital I emphatically repudiate any suggestion of extravagance. The question of access to the sea has also been discussed. Some say, &#34;You want a site like Dalgety because it is safe from attack from the sea.&#34; Others again say, &#34; You want access to the sea.&#34; Do not let iris forget that access to the sea implies access from the sea. I admit; that Dalgety is an absolutely safe site for the Capital so far as that consideration is concerned ; but I claim the same merit for Canberra. It occupies an equally safe position. 1 think I am not wrong in saying that it is as near the -sea as is Dalgety. </para>

                            <para>- In that respect the two sites are practically equal. In Jervis Bay, which would be the port of Canberra, we should have one of the finest natural harbors in the world. It is a harbor which encloses water - not a harbor which extends its wide embrace to the waters of the Pacific. I have had the pleasure of spending some time at Eden, on Twofold Bay,  where there is a magnificent sheet of water. But the great drawback of the Bay is that it is magnificently open to the Pacific. Those who have been there know that the wharf, which is in the most suitable place, is sp small that steamers cannot be brought right alongside, I went there by the <inline font-style="italic">Wakitipu,</inline> and that was my experience. Part of such vessels extend beyond the wharf, which will accommodate only one vessel on each side. I should, in fairness, state that there is very little traffic there at the present time. I do not suggest that if traffic increased human enterprise would not provide better accommodation, but I do not think that I am unfairly stating the position when I say that the great drawback to Twofold Bay is that there is an enormous expanse of water between the two headlands. On the other hand, Jervis Bay, like Sydney Harbor, has two heads within a comparatively close distance; which enfold an enormous water area, securely protected from every storm that blows. </para>

                            <para>- Practically it is. It will .hus be seen that, so far as access to the sea is concerned, Canberra has access to one of the finest harbors in the world.. If we selected Dalgety, and obtained access to Twofold Bay, we should have to construct enormous works to make it a port worthy of the name. I should like honorable members to consider these matters. It is idle to twit honorable members with the votes they give in connexion with the different sites. I have just been informed that the Prime Minister says  that  he did not agree, to take a test division upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill. </para>

                        I suggest that the course which I have indicated is the better one. Of course the Prime Minister understands that this is strictly a non-party question. Upon this Bill we stand upon absolutely non-party ground, seeing that different
                    </para>
                    <para>Ministers intend to vote in different ways. Consequently there need be no delicacy whatever about the question. If the Government had submitted the Bill as a united Government there might have been some feeling of delicacy about the rejection of the motion for its second reading. But in this instance the Government submit the Bill to us for the purpose either of choosing or rejecting Dalgety. That being so,I say, that it is absurd for those who intend to vote for any site other than Dalgety to affirm the second reading of this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- No. It is understood that if in Committee the word &#34; Dalgety &#34; is eliminated the whole Bill will be emasculated, and we shall then proceed to an exhaustive ballot. So that whether we negative the second reading of the measure or not is immaterial. If it reaches the Committee the bowels of the measure will go, and with its bowels, its life. We must not stand upon these ridiculous points. </para>

                            <para>- It has not. But is that the sort of argument with which we are to be met in discussing this question? It reflects almost the schoolboy code of morality which makes a boy&#39;s marbles unsafe. We are asking for the recognition of this right of ours, and I am sure the honorable member for Franklin will be the very first to give the matter the most honorable and candid consideration. If there be a majority in favour of Dalgety, I suggest that by affirming the second reading of the Bill, the whole question will be settled. </para>

                        <para>. - I must apologize to the leader of the Opposition for making my appearance a little late, and for not being able to move the second reading of the Bill. In approaching this question, I feel - and I have always felt - that under the Constitution this House is under a solemn obligation to do its best to establish a Federal Capital. I agree with the right honorable member for East Sydney that until that question is settled, there will always be a source of conflict between certain portions of Australia and the rest of the Commonwealth. Of course, it is desirable that, that source of conflict should be removed. If honorable members will look at the history of this Parliament they must recognise that it has done its best from the very foundation of the Commonwealth to get a complete and satisfactory settlement of this question. Further, I believe that when clause 125 was inferred in the draft Constitution, and when the Capital of New South Wales was eliminated from that Constitution as one of the places which might be chosen, the parties to the arrangement had a definite purpose in view. That purpose was to afford this Parliament an opportunity of selecting a Federal Capital at a place in New South Wales where it would be absolutely free from the dominating influences of any of the. large centres of population. It was intended that the Federal Capital should be reasonably distant from Sydney, so that when it had been established it would not be under the suspicion of being subject more or less to the dominating influences of the State capital. I feel that it is a real evil for the Seat of Government to be located in any of our capital cities. Whilst it is so located Parliament must depend, not upon its own inherent power, but upon the State in which it sits, for the support and dignity which ought to attach to its own position. For this reason it was found necessary in the United States and in Canada to establish a Federal Capital. In just the same way, I believe, that it will be found more necessary in the future to establish a Federal Capital in the Commonwealth so that this Parliament may reflect the true national opinion of Australia. It does not follow that because we meet in Victoria that we are dominated by the Victorian press or by the Victorian people. This House has already exhibited its independence of judgment in many decisions at which it has arrived. But we have to satisfy the people of this continent that Parliament is not being subjected to Victorian influences. Wherever we go we hear it suggested that whilst the Commonwealth Parliament continues to meet in Melbourne it is practically under Victorian control, and, for instance, that Victoria has influenced it in the shaping of the Tariff. </para>

Of course the honorable member for Parkes is of opinion that we are subject to such, influences, and therefore he very naturally says, &#34; Get us out of Melbourne,&#39; and by all means get us away from Sydney too.&#34; My own opinion is that if the electors of New South Wales were induced by the leaders of the various political parties to believe that under Federation certain things were likely to be accomplished, and if they acted on the faith of that understanding, we should, as far as possible, honor the bond. In the same way we should honor the agreement with Western Australia.

Subsequently the right honorable member for East Sydney, as Premier of that State, attended the Conference of Premiers, at which the provision relating to the Federal Capital was amended to the form in which it stands to-day. That Conference . agreed to the clause as afterwards amended and issued it with a memorandum which set forth reasons for the amendment. The words are as follow -  lt is considered that the fixing of the Site of Capital is a- question which might well be left to the Parliament to decide ; but, in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South Wales, the Premiers have modified the clause, so that while the Capital cannot be fixed at Sydney, or in its neighbourhood, provision is made in the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales at a reasonable distance from that city. </para>

                            <para>-  1  have no doubt that the right honorable member for East Sydney, when he had the document printed, had some object; but I think we may all frankly admit that the document was forgotten. When the ballot was taken, both the right honorable member for- Swan and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turned voted for Dalgety ; and yet they were not charged with breach of faith - there was no appeal then to the right honorable member for Swan that he should &#34; honour the bond,&#34; and. he voted as he believed he was entitled to vote. Assuming, however, that the understanding was such as has been suggested, what is the interpretation to be placed on the words used? In fixing a site we are asked to say that the test is to be reasonable distance - from Sydney. I do not &#39;think that the right honorable member for East Sydney or any other honorable member would push the argument further than that, according to their reading of the memorandum, the capital site must be at a reasonable distance from Sydney. When Dalgety was decided upon, was it ever alleged that it was not at a reasonable distance from Sydney? </para>

                            <para>- That is, in my opinion, how we should approach this question. At the same time we ought not to fix on a site that would be practically Victorian. It would not be fair to fix the site in such a way that New South Wales would be deprived of &#39;&#39;the prestige which would follow from the establishment of the Federal Capital within her borders. I do not think, therefore, that we ought to apply the test suggested by &#39;the right honorable member for East Sydney, and decide that Dalgety must be excluded by the terms of the Constitution, or even by the terms of the memorandum, from, the consideration of this House. I think we have acted fairly in choosing the site that we have; and I ask honorable members to remember that the choice was not made hurriedly. </para>

                            <para>- It is the site that Parliament has chosen, and it is the only site which commanded a majority of both Houses. On the 16th December, 1905, I traced the history df this question up to that date. In a despatch to the Prime Minster of 6th May, 1906, honorable members will find a <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> of this history, and a more complete <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> in a further despatch dated 28th November, 1907. The history shows that in the year 1899. the New South Wales Government appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Olivera</inline> Royal Commissioner, and that that gentleman recommended the three districts of Southern Monaro, Yass, and Orange. Immediately after the Commonwealth was established, the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, asked New South Wales to offer sites, and the three recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> including the area of Dalgety, were submitted. The- members of both Houses of the Federal Parliament visited the sites, including that at Dalgety, and in 1902 this House, by resolution, agreed to the appointment of a Commission to inquire into the merits of the sites offered, and of &#39;these sites Dalgety was one. That Commission reported in 1903, and amongst the places on which they reported was Bombala.. At a later stage, a special report was made on Dalgety as under offer. In that year there was a difference of opinion between the two Houses, one being in favour of </para>

                    <para class="block">Tumut, and the other being in favour of Bombala; but in 1904 the present Seat of Government Act was passed, in which both Houses chose Dalgety. It will be seen that until 1904 these sites were under offer to the Commonwealth, and Dalgety was never objected to on the ground of its unreasonable distance from Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- I think the honorable&#39; member is incorrect. In 1904, the Seat of &#39;Government Act was passed. It was assented to. on the 16th August of. the same year, and during all that time the Mew South Wales Government and Parliament took no exception to our selecting the Dalgety area. </para>

                            <para>- Negotiations were opened with New South Wales, in the endeavour to settle the question. The right honorable member for East Sydney admitted that he desired another choice; but he said that he accepted Dalgety - as the next commendable ; and I am prepared, just as staunchly as ever, to support the choice of the Parliament. <inline font-style="italic">My</inline> own impression, as against that of others in &#39;New South Wales, who so much assail this selection, is that it is absolutely the best that New South Wales is ever likely to get - that any change would absolutely be for the worse. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Reid-McLean Administration was defeated, and the present Government came into power. We were asked by the New South Wales Government if there was a change of policy on this question, or whether we took up the same attitude as our predecessors, and we replied that we regarded the Act as mandatory. The Premier, of the State then asked us if we would submit the constitutional issues to the High Court, and we replied &#34;Yes,&#34; and requested his Government to commence an action. He desired that we should drive in a peg; but it was pointed out that the Act gave us no authority to do so, as it did not define in metes and bounds any particular area, nor did it confer on the Commonwealth a foot of territory in New South Wales.  We stated, however, that we were willing to prepare a short measure to enable the constitutional issues to be. tested. Accordingly, our Attorney-General and the Attorney-General of New South Wales met in conference, and the Bill is the result. The present Premier of &#34;New South Wales said - </para>

                        <para class="block">Parliament has declared that no area outside that within a radius of 17 miles of Dalgety will be considered by the Federal Parliament in negotiating for a seat of Government; and to that extent it is binding, both upon the Federal Parliament and the State of New South Wales. On the other hand, it is contended that this Statute is a mere registration of the opinion of the Federal Parliament, and that it is no more binding upon the State than a joint resolution of the two Houses. This resolution may be revoked, and the Seat of Government subsequently determined within territory quite outside the Dalgety area. Whichever view is correct is really immaterial at the present time, because both Governments seem now to agree that the next step is to define some area by metes and bounds ; next to open negotiations for the grant or requisition of that territory ; and, finally, when such territory becomes the property of the Commonwealth, in terms of the Constitution, it will be necessary for Parliament by formal Act to determine the Seat of Government within that area. </para>

                    <para class="block">The New South Wales Government claimed the right to determine the territory. It read section 125 of the Constitution to provide that the grant or transfer of territory to the Commonwealth is a condition precedent to the determination of the site by the Commonwealth. We took the view that three stages are contemplated, the first being the determination of the Seat of Government by the Commonwealth. The section reads - </para>

                            <para>- The section provides, in the first place, that the Parliament of the Commonwealth shall determine the Seat of Government; that has been done by the passing of the Seat of Government Act. The next thing to be done is to define the territory which we desire, and the third step to be taken is to approach the State, and ask that the land may be conveyed to us. We are providing by the Bill for those things to be done. If the State contends that our action is illegal, it can obtain a decision from the High Court, and we are introducing the Bill to enable that to be done if the State so desires if. </para>

                    <para>Section 125 of the Constitution -  the acquisition of the territory  by  the Commonwealth must, we advise, take place before the determination of the seat of Government  by  the Parliament: We are of opinion that the right not only to determine the &#34; Seat of Government,&#34; but also  by  necessary inference the right to determine the position in New South Wales of the Federal territory is vested in the Parliament. No &#34;territory&#34; can be transferred to the Commonwealth without the Commonwealth&#39;s assent. The course adopted (in passing the recent Act, the Seat of Government Act) is, we think, a convenient one : for otherwise there might be something in the nature of an absolute deadlock, as it is quite conceivable that the Commonwealth, through the Federal Executive, might acquire  by  grant or otherwise land in New South Wales which would be legally &#34; vested in and belonging to the Commonwealth,&#34; but. no part of such land might be deemed by the Parliament suitable for the Seat of Government.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter- of Opinion. I&#39; think that Dalgety is not at an unreasonable distance from Sydney, and will not be under the dominating influence of that city.  Dalgety was chosen fairly and honorably, as the result of a plain, straight-out vote. No trickery was resorted to. If, on this occasion, that site is struck out of the Bill, the people of Australia will not be satisfied unless it, as well as its rivals, is dealt with by an exhaustive ballot, as on the previous occasion. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The Government wish to have the matter settled. We desire to have the territory defined if Parliament still approves of Dalgety.

                            <para>- The elimination of the words &#34; Schedule A &#34; would be an indication that the House desired the selection to&#62; be re-considered. If such an amendment were carried, a motion would be immediately submitted to permit of an exhaustive ballot on all the competing sites. If the House then determined once more in favour of Dalgety, we should simply have to recommit the Bill, re-insert the schedule, and send it to another place without delay. We consider that the whole question could be expeditiously dealt with in that way. </para>

                            <para>- My purpose is to stand by the. decision of this Parliament. I propose to state shortly the purposes of the Bill. It is designed to determine more definitely the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth in the neighbourhood of Dalgety, and the territory there within which it shall be. This Parliament has chosen Dalgety, but under the Act of 1904 the territory is&#39; not defined or delimited. As the Attorney-General pointed out in his memorandum of 20th October, 1905, having fixed and chosen the site the next step is to define the metes and bounds of that territory. The original Act provides that the site shall be within 17 miles of Dalgety. That provision is mandatory, but the next section is merely directory. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and&#39; learned member is correct. It now provides that the area of the territory &#34;should&#34; be 900 square miles, and that . there &#34;should&#34; &#39;be access to the sea. This section is practically a direction to the Government as to what shall be done in negotiating with the Government of New South Wales. Instructions were given- to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> to prepare different . areas of choice, and in a paper printed on 15th December, 1905, will be found a statement of what he proposes as to the Federal City. He first of all selects an area of 100 square miles, -and then he deals with an area of 200 square miles, an area suggested by. the resolution passed by the Parliament of New South Wales. He was also asked to fix what he considered was the smallest possible area that we could safely acquire for the purposes of a Federal City. He &#39;determined that that area should be 630 square miles, and in answer to a further request that he should state the area that ought to be acquired to provide for water supply, water power, and sewerage, he reported that the desirable area should be 1,050 square miles. The exact area necessary for the Federal Capital depends, of course, upon the location of the site. </para>

In other words, those- who hold estates in fee simple will hold them from us under the same tenure.

                            <para>- The Bill also provides for the continuance of State laws in respect to the territory until the Federal Parliament enacts new laws and for valuation of lands in the Federal territory. Provision is likewise made for access between the territory described in Schedule A and the sea, clause 7 providing that it shall be within a distance of 15 miles on either side of the line described in Schedule B. In conclusion., I think we shall be well advised in passing this measure. I do not suggest that the Parliament should not give every consideration to the expressed will of the New South Wales Legislature. </para>

                            <para>- In the year 1904, the Reid Ministry came into power. They retired from office in 1905. Immediately the present Government assumed the reins of power, the ex- Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> endeavoured to arrange with us for a special case being stated for decision by the High Court; but, after negotiations had proceeded for some time, disagreement was arrived at. Immediately that result was brought about, a Bill relating to this question was tabled in this House. In 1905, the right honorable member for East Sydney asked us - because another site had been mentioned in the interim - not to proceed with the measure, and his wish was acceded to. In 1906, when Parliament again met, we were invited by the New South Wales Government to consider the claims of still another site, which had not been submitted to the State Parliament - I refer to Mahkoolmah. The Government immediately promised to give that site consideration, and visits of inspection to it were organized. It was really during one of these visits that Canberra was discovered. It&#39; was not until September, 1906, that we obtained a report on Canberra from the State of New South Wales. </para>

I repeat that it was in September, 1906, when we obtained&#39; a report on Canberra, and only in October of that year Parliament was prorogued. There was no time to deal with the matter in the interim. Parliament met again last year, and the first thing that the Government did was to table this Bill. Subsequently, requests were made to us to permit of further visits being made to Canberra, Dalgety, and Tooma. </para>

It seems to me that he has been a long time thinking over the matter, seeing that seven years have elapsed since the first Commonwealth Parliament assembled here, that the question of the Federal Capital has been discussed many times since, and that until now it has never been suggested that either myself or any other honorable member, in casting his vote upon this important question, has not had the most complete freedom of action, and has been actuated by other than an honorable desire to do what was right. Had it not been for the remarks of the right honorable member, I should not have addressed myself to this question so soon, but I feel that his observations in regard to myself as a member of the Premiers&#39; Conference of 1899 were altogether unnecessary, and that they were totally unjustified. When the amendment of the Constitution was adopted by the Premiers&#39; Conference on the urgent representation of the right honorable member, as Premier of New South Wales, I had no knowledge whatever of any of the eligible sites in that State. At that time, all that we knew was that Moss Vale was outside the 100 miles limit. With the exception probably of the right honorable member himself there was not a single Premier who knew anything about the districts in which eligible sites were available. The right honorable member has endeavoured to institute an analogy between his action in supporting the proposal for connecting Western Australia with Eastern Australia by railway, and the attitude which I take up in regard to the question of the Capital Site. In reply, I merely wish to say that upon the transcontinental railway question, I have never done more than to use every legitimate endeavour to induce honorable members to see eye to eye with me. I have merely quoted the promises which were made by the leaders of various parties in Australia prior to Federation, with a view to inducing the people of Western Australia to enter the Union. In short, I have never done anything in regard to that project which has not been above-board. I have never said that if somebody would not do something for me, I would not do something for him. </para>

                            <para>- Apparently, there is a feeling abroad that, because some New South Wales representatives acted in a generous federal and national spirit in regard to the vote which they cast in favour of that great project, I should, upon this occasion, reverse my previous opinions and actions, and throw in my lot with them, quite irrespective of my own views upon this question. </para>

We merely declared that &#34; the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth should be in the state of New South Wales, and be distant not less than 100 miles from Sydney.&#34; </para>

I do not look upon it as a local question in any sense of the word. So far as I am concerned, it cannot be a local matter, because whatever site may ultimately be decided upon it will be far removed from the State which I represent. It is only quite recently that the word &#34; reasonable,&#34; which is to be found in the padding of the report covering the clauses recommended by the Premiers&#39; Conference, has assumed any great importance. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable member acted in the way that he considered right towards a neighbouring State, and I have never lost an opportunity of saying so. I have always declared that in regard to the transcontinental railway he has been one of the best friends of Western Australia. New South Wales initiated proceedings in connexion with the selection of the Federal Capital by appointing the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> to report upon eligible sites. He reported upon Albury, Tumut, Bombala, and other places. It was not until after this Parliament had actually selected Dalgety that that State began to urge objections to its choice. In fact,I think that the action of the Parliament and the Government of New South Wales means not only that the site shall be in that State, but that its Government and Parliament shall approve of it. All I can say is that the right honorable member for East Sydney, as Premier of New South Wales, never suggested such a thing at the Premiers&#39; Conference. </para>

                            <para>- I had no recollection whatever of the word &#34; reasonable &#34; being embodied in the report of that Conference until somebody unearthed it years, afterwards. After the Conference had terminated, I did not again study the report. I took for my guide what I considered embodied the views of the Conference, namely, the words inserted in the Constitution. But, after all, what is &#34;reasonable?&#34; Canberra is supposed to be within a reasonable distance of Sydney, and Dalgety is not. But there is only a difference of 93 miles between their respective distances by railway from Sydney. In other words, 203 miles is regarded as a &#34; reasonable &#34; distance from that city, whilst 296 miles is not. </para>

                            <para>- Delegate, near the border of Victoria, is quite 50 miles from Dalgety. But the right honorable member knows very well that it is farther from Sydney to Tooma and Albury than it is from Sydney to Dalgety. I repeat that, in the opinion of some honorable members, 203 miles is considered a &#34; reasonable&#34; distance from Sydney, whilst 296 miles is considered an &#34; unreasonable &#34; distance. Ninety-three miles makes all the difference, according to their views. Now, although I do not regard Dalgety as an ideal site - in many ways I can imagine a better one - I still believe that it is the best of the sites which have been submitted, and that, taking it all. round, it far surpasses Canberra. I regret that I should have had to take a rather prominent part in connexion with this Capital Site question, because it has brought me into conflict of opinion with honorable members in this House with whom I do not desire to be in conflict. However, I was unavoidably drawn into the matter in my capacity as Minister of Home Affairs, when I was asked to report upon certain sites. After I ceased to be Minister of Home Affairs I was asked to visit Lyndhurst, and last year I was specially requested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> the then Premier of New South Wales, to visit Canberra, and express my opinion as to its eligibility. I complied with these requests; and, because I have given honorable members the benefit of my experience, I am regarded by some as adverse to the interests of New South Wales. I have no axe to grind - no feeling in the matter; the selection of the Capital Site will not in any way affect me, or the State I represent. But this is a question on which we are all expected to express our views to the best of our ability ; and if we possess any special knowledge on such a question to give Parliament the advantage of it. I have not asked any one to vote in the way that I vote. I have not asked any honorable member in the corner where I sit to vote with me, nor did I make any such request when I was a member of the Government. I shall exercise my vote in the way my judgment dictates, leaving others to do the same. Let us, however, go back to 1898, just after the Federal Convention, and see what was done by the New South Wales Government, of which the right honorable member for East Sydney was Premier. On the 12th October, 1898, amongst a number of resolutions in view of the forthcoming Premiers&#39; Conference, the right honorable gentleman moved one to the effect that the New South Wales Parliament desired to submit for the consideration of the other States &#34; that clause 125 should be amended, and provision made in the Bill for the establishment of the Federal Capital in such place within the boundaries of New South Wales as the Federal Parliament may determine.&#34; Surely those words are clear enough. </para>

                            <para>- I may say that the right honorable gentleman, when he submitted that resolution to the New South Wales Parliament on12th October, 1898, appeared to be ill at ease, if I may judge from reading his speech. The right honorable gentleman had been to the Federal Convention, and had discussed this question as the leader of the New South Wales delegates ; and he did not seem to be desirous of interfering, if he could avoid it, with the work of the Convention. He made all sorts of excuses for submitting that motion ; he said that he admitted he did not like doing so, and went so far as to say that if Queensland were in the Federation - Queensland not having been represented at the Convention - &#34; the position would have been considerably different.&#34; With that resolution, and many others, the right honorable gentleman came to the. Premiers&#39; Conference, and urged, as he had a right to do, in the most persuasive way, that the Seat of the Commonwealth Government should be in New South Wales. That was agreed to, principally, I think, because it was thought that such a concession would very much help to obtain a vote in favour of Federation by the people of that State! On the12th October, 1898, as reported on page 1340 of volume 94 of the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> the right honorable gentleman said - </para>

                    <para>I admit at once that if we were to go further -  that is, further than saying that the Capital should be in New South Wales -  and endeavour ourselves to decide in what particular spot in this great Colony, bordering three other Colonies, the Capital of the Commonwealth should be fixed, we should absolutely cease to have any justification. I am prepared to leave to the wisdom of the Federal Parliament the arrangement as to the particular spot in this great Colony where the Capital should be fixed. I am prepared absolutely to leave that to the Federal Parliament. </para>

                        <para>It is my earnest wish that the provisions of the Constitution shall be carried out loyally on both sides. If they are, the Federal Capital will be established in New South Wales at no distant date, but, just as it is possible for the Federal Parliament &#39;in its treatment of the subject to so act that there will be no Capital in New South Wales within a reasonable time, it is possible for the Government and Parliament of New South Wales to so act that there will be no Federal Capital in New South Wales within a reasonable time, unless we have an inherent right to select the Capital by our own will. That is a question of serious importance which I hope will never have to be considered. I hope that those who have this matter at heart will rest satisfied that the Government will loyalty regard the decision of this Parliament, unless it is rescinded, and, so far as I am concerned, any attempt to rescind it will meet with my strongest opposition. </para>

                            <para>- This is not a party or a State question. It is a national question ; because it is of the greatest importance that the Federal Capital shall be on the best site possible in New South Wales, so that those who come after us shall applaud our choice. The present difficulty with the New South Wales Government .and Parliament was never foreseen by any of us. It was never contemplated in the early days of this Parliament that, after we had selected a site, there would be any objections raised on the part of the Government of New South Wales. It was only recently that the late Premier of New South Wales seemed to take such an idea into his head; and from that time forth there has been trouble and delay. All this is very much to be regretted, because a great deal of harm has been done even to Federation and to the Federal Parliament. I feel that it would be almost better to defer the question for some time - until, say, we can think more federally than we do at present. It has been suggested that the Commonwealth Parliament should sit in Sydney for the next decade in order to avoid the present unpleasant position. The reading of the Constitution is as clear as possible ; it never was intended other than that this Parliament should have the settlement of the site for the Seat of Government. </para>

                            <para>- That idea was never in the minds of the Premiers who inserted the provision in the Constitution. No such idea, I venture to say, was in the mind of the right honorable member for East Sydney, when he was so earnestly and persuasively urging the Premiers&#39; Conference that words should be inserted in the Constitution providing that the Seat of Government should be in New South Wales. The Premiers might fairly- have assumed that the New South Wales Parliament and people would be gratified to have the Capital within their borders, and would be only too willing, as-in the case of the Government of Victoria, to give the Federal Government and Parliament every concession and help. .It was never thought that the New South Wales Parliament and Government would ask for a concession not provided for in the Constitution, and that, having got it, they would not then be satisfied, but would insist on being, permitted to select the locality of the site for the Capital City. In effect, the New South Wales Government and Parliament say, &#34; No site will be regarded as suitable which is not approved by us.&#34; </para>

I find that the strongest opponents to certain&#39; of the sites mentioned are those who have never paid any visits pf inspection, but are quite willing to combat the views of others who have taken that trouble. Data are very valuable, but the advantages of a personal inspection cannot be over-estimated. I have visited all the sites but Tooma, having been to Dalgety twice, and to Canberra once. </para>

                            <para>- I spent a day at Canberra, and visited the junction of the Cotter River with the Mumimbidgee River, and two or three days at Dalgety. Tooma is far nearer Melbourne than Sydney, and only 1,000 feet above sea level. Therefore that site does not commend itself to me. </para>

                            <para>- It may be nearer in a straight line, but by existing routes it is not so near. B.y the existing railway the distance to Tumut is 322 miles, and Tooma must be 50 miles further, so that Tooma is, by existing railway and road, 372 miles, as against Dalgety 296 miles. One would have thought that the New South Wales Government, if in earnest about the Canberra site, would have done what I did in regard to the other sites, where contour surveys were made to- ascertain their suitability for town purposes. We were not content with an aneroid examination. </para>

I was also able to take advantage of exhaustive surveys, which had been made to ascertain the contour of the site and the nature of the water supply. On the 15th April. 1904, I wrote a report on my visit to Dalgety, concluding with the following passage - </para>

                        <para>The snowy mountain of  Kosciusco  is situated about 40 miles from Dalgety, and, in the event of a Federal. City being built, the Snowy Mountains and Mount Kosciusco, which has an altitude of 7,738 feet above the sea, the highest point on the Australian continent, will be an everlasting interest and pleasure to visitors, and tourists, as well as to its residents. Viewed from the standard of the factors set forth..... the Dalgety Site, in my opinion, fulfils the qualifications to a larger extent than any other Site &#39; in the SouthernMonaro or Tumut districts under the four headings (i), <inline font-style="italic">&#91;e),</inline> (/), and <inline font-style="italic">(i),</inline> and under no factor is it inferior to any of the others. It has also by far the best water supply, and is the most picturesque of all the Sites examined. It is also conveniently situated between Sydney and Melbourne, and when railway communication is made between Cooma and Bairnsdale will be only eight or nine hours from Sydney and &#39; Melbourne. . It would attract visitors&#39; and tourists from all parts of Australia in the summer, by reason of its climate, the attractions of the Snowy Mountains, and the. fishing in the Snowy River. </para>

The line must be made within a short time, for without a railway that large part of Victoria must remain undeveloped. Until a railway from Bairnsdale to Dalgety is constructed, the latter will be 607 miles .from Melbourne by rail, whereas the representatives of New South Wales  will have to travel by rail only 296 miles from Sydney in order to reach it. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know what are the intentions of the Victorian Government ; .but I feel confident that it will be constructed in the early future. Before Dalgety will be conveniently available for  the people of Melbourne, a railway from Bairnsdale to Dalgety will have to be constructed. When the extension of the railway from Cooma, to Dalgety, 31. miles, is constructed, the distance from Sydney to Dalgety by rail will then be 296 miles, and. from Dalgety to Melbourne, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Bairnsdale, 353 miles. It is desirable that a substantial line on which trains may travel at high speed shall be built. </para>

                            <para>- I think that it could. It is merely a question of expenditure. . The Commonwealth might fairly help the States to build substantial lines of railway to the Federal Capital. This is not the first occasion on which such a suggestion has been made, and I certainly think that it would be reasonable for the Commonwealth to assist the States to construct more substantial lines than their own requirements would demand. For instance, the line from Goulburn to Cooma is a very light one, over which trains could not travel at a high rate of speed. A&#39; considerably increased expenditure would be involved in laying down a fast line from Goulburn to Cooma and Dalgety&#39;, and thence to Orbost and Bairnsdale. The Commonwealth might well, therefore, assist the States in placing the Federal Capital on the high road between the great cities of Sydney and Melbourne. I see no reason why there should not be one of the finest railways in the world from Melbourne, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Bairnsdale, to Sydney, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Federal Capital. </para>

                            <para>- I noticed land suitable for closer settlement, and also an area of auriferous country. In conclusion, I must say that I have not appreciated the interjections pf honorable members. In listening to them, one would think that I had some ulterior purpose in view, and had no desire to consider the interests of the people of New South Wales&#39;. We often differ in this House, and there is no subject upon which we might more fully be expected to differ than this. No one can surely suggest that in supporting the selection of Dalgety I am seeking to please my own constituents, or indeed anybody ; my desire is only that the Parliament shall arrive at the best and most satisfactory decision. I regret that I have been forced into a position in which I am brought into controversy with others with whom I desire to. be on the best of terms, and to work with under the most friendly conditions. I am sorry to differ from my friends the majority of the representatives of New South Wales. I wish I could vote with them. If I consulted my personal wishes I&#39; should do so, but I could not honestly or consistently say by my vote that I prefer Canberra to Dalgety as the site for the future capital of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - It seems to me that there is a number of circumstances which justify the reopening of this question. A little time ago, when the matter was discussed in this House, the honorable member for Eden-Monaro said that in my desire to have it re-opened I was going back upon a statement which I had made, whilst holding office some four years ago, that the Capital Site had &#39;been dealt with finally. I think it well to detain the House for a moment or two while I point out what I did say on the occasion in question. With <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> before me, I deny absolutely that I expressed the opinion that the  question was finally settled. What I did say was that in view of the circumstances then existing - the fact that an amendment was before the Chair to upset a vote taken only a few minutes previously - the Government of which I was leader could not countenance any such reversal as was proposed. A majority of honorable members had decided to choose the south-eastern district of New South Wales, which includes Bombala and Dalgety, as the site for the Federal Capital. Within a few minutes after . that decision had been arrived at, an amendment was moved to include the Tooma district in the Bill. I had always been opposed to Tooma, but apart from my personal predilection it seemed to me that in view df the vote arrived at only a few minutes before, we were compelled to abide&#39; by the decision of the House, fully and freely expressed. </para>

                            <para>- I prefaced my observations with the statement that there were grave reasons for attempting to ascertain whether the decision arrived at some four years ago was still the determination of this Parliament. I do not suppose that any one will accuse me of joining in the chorus raised by some people in New South Wales about the sacrifices that have been made by that State in the interests of Federation. I have always attempted to hold the Federal banner loyally aloft in that State during the whole time that I have been one of its representatives in this Parliament. I have steadfastly deprecated any attempt to introduce parochialism into the consideration of Federal questions. But a man would indeed be blind if, knowing anything of .the conditions existing in New South Wales to-day, he did not acknowledge that there is, if not a majority, at all events a strong minority of the people of that State exceedingly &#39; dissatisfied with the position in- respect to the Capital. There can be no doubt that that dissatisfaction exists amongst a very strong minority, if not a majority, of the people. </para>

                            <para>- I hope to be able to show that the Federal advantage is bound up with the re-opening of this question, and I trust that in dealing with it the honorable&#39; member will be prepared to adopt the Federal, and not the parochial, aspect dictated by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> In order to secure the successful working of a Constitution such as ours, our first aim should be to remove any legitimate causes .of friction between the Commonwealth and the States. A- bargain was made in respect of the Federal Capital Site. I was prepared when the Constitution Bill was before the people of New South Wale&#39;s to trust the Federal Parliament to determine the site of the Federal Capital ; I was quite prepared to accept the Constitution without any restrictions at all in that regard if provision were made in it for certain other matters. A large number of the people of New South Wales, however, disagreed with that view, and a bargain was made in the terms set forth by the right honorable member for East Sydney, who was then leader of the Government of New South Wales, and was responsible at the time for the activity which brought Federation into existence. The feeling now in existence in New South Wales is that that bargain has not been honoured by the selection of Dalgety. It is held that Dalgety is removed from New South Wales influence, that it i&#39;s practically cut off from the centre of commercial and political activity in that State, and that its selection therefore is not in accordance with the spirit of the agreement which was entered into. When the right honorable member for Swan taunts me with .having voted for Batlow, which is distant, as the crow flies, less than 200 miles from Sydney, I feel constrained to reply that, unlike him, I am not bound by the terms of any agreement. I was not a party to an agreement that the capital must be within a reasonable distance of Sydney. Even if I were so bound, I could still vote for Batlow, which is less than 200 miles from Sydney, and yet keep more nearly to the agreement to which the right honorable member put his name than the right honorable member is doing. It is considerably nearer Sydney than is Dalgety, and in every respect is more in touch with it. That being bo, if I were bound by the agreement, I should feel that in voting for Batlow I should more nearly conform to the conditions of that agreement than the right honorable member will do by voting for Dalgety.  His  attitude is to me absolutely inexplicable. That an honorable member should urge the Federal Parliament to honour an agreement which at the best was only a verbal one - I refer to the agreement with regard to the construction of the transcontinental railway to Kalgoorlie - that he should dilate in the most poetic terms upon the necessity of honouring the bond and respecting what was at the most only a verbal agreement- </para>

The House rose to the occasion, and met &#39;him generously in that connexion.

                            <para>- I think that Parliament should endeavour to honour a bargain of that sort if it possibly can. Bu&#39;t the right honorable member foi Swan now attempts to back out of &#39;his bargain upon the plea that Dalgety is within a reasonable distance of Sydney. If to go away from Sydney as far as one possibly can. is to remain within a reasonable distance of it, language must have changed its meaning during recent years. </para>

                            <para>- But the railway takes an eccentric turn to the west. That, however, does not affect the question at all. I wish now to deal with a most improper breach of the agreement arrived at by the Premiers&#39; Conference upon the part of the right honorable member for Swan. He was exceedingly anxious that we should observe another agreement which was not committed to writing, in regard to his own State. </para>

                            <para>- I should prefer that it bad been mentioned. But the fact that the right honorable member&#39;s creditor did not present his bill within a few days would not relieve him of the necessity of paying it. In my view, there is a sufficient degree of irritation upon this question throughout New South Wales to compel the attention of every thoughtful member of this House. It seems to me desirable, in the interests of the Commonwealth, that wherever possible, friction should be removed from the path of Federation. While I do not sympathize with all the arguments which have been advanced by New South Wales, I must say that the continuance of the existing state of feeling there - and perhaps its accentuation in the near future by continued litigation regarding the respective rights of the Commonwealth and the State </para>

                    <para>Governments - will be one of the worst things which can possibly happen, so far as Federation is concerned. While I have no sympathy with a number of the charges that have been made regarding the Commonwealth, while I have denied them and endeavoured to ridicule them from the public platform, I have to acknowledge that the reiteration of those grievances - and particularly the grievance in respect of the Federal Capital - tends widely to prejudice the views of many persons in New South Wales regarding Federation. </para>

                            <para>- But to meet such a feeling we should not be justified in choosing for the Federal Capital a site which is otherwise unsuitable. .Those representatives of New South Wales who feel that  Dalgety  does not meet the requirements of  the situation have the responsibility cast upon them &#39; of pointing to a site which is suitable. That, it seems to me, is the proper attitude to demand from those who complain of the treatment to which New South Wales is being subjected. Whilst we should not sacrifice one iota of our requirements in connexion with the site, still I hold that it is worth the while of members of this Parliament to consider whether they cannot - without any undue surrender of the interests pf Australia. - remove once  and for all the friction, the irritation, and the dissatisfaction that undoubtedly exist In respect of this matter in the mother State. Now, coming to the question immediately before us, there can be no possible objection to a comparison of the sites under review. The sites have been narrowed down to very few : and, so far as one can see, there are only three that have  any  chance of being approved by a majority of honorable members. </para>

As I have not visited the Tooma site, I do not propose to say anything in regard to it, beyond expressing the opinion that the situation is too far from the centre of New South Wales to demand my support, and that I think it suffers from the same disability that was raised against Albury, Wagga, and other towns in the Riverina, namely, that it is too&#39; low in elevation for a Capital Site. </para>

                            <para>- I am afraid that, as at Albury and Wagga, the climate would be too warm in summer. However, I have not seen Tooma, and I do not propose to consider that site for the reason that I gave before, namely, that it is too far away from the centre of New South Wales. The other two sites, Dalgety and Canberra, are, I think, &#34; in the running &#34; ; and I am prepared to accept the definition of points that appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of this morning. The writer pointed out that in the selection of a site, we had to consider accessibility, water supply, climate, building and drainage facilities, and&#39; fertility of the soil. </para>

                            <para>- Therefore. I .have an advantage. First, we have to consider the matter of accessibility ; and we are told by the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that Canberra is 203 miles from Sydney, and 435 miles from Melbourne, and the writer expresses a preference for Dalgety because it is only 353 miles from Melbourne, and 296 miles from Sydney. That is to say, Dalgety is more nearly equi-distant,. and,&#39; therefore, more desirable. Of course, the 353 miles distance is contingent on the construction of the proposed railway through Gippsland. The. right honorable member for Swan has spoken about this railway as being a certainty in the near future; but I am rather inclined to think a considerable time will lapse before that work is carried out ; and I have some knowledge of the conditions which prevail in that part of the country. I was a member of the Public Works Committee of New South Wales in 1898 or 1899, when an inquiry was made into the advisability or otherwise of constructing a railway to Bombala, and the question incidentally arose of the possibility of connecting with Bairnsdale, in Victoria, and with the port of Eden. The evidence given in regard to a line from Victoria to junction with a line at Bombala and Delegate, was that it would cost an enormous sum, even over the most favorable route that had so far been discovered. </para>

                            <para>- The cost referred to by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro is not the cost of the railway on the tableland in New South Wales, but the cost of the railway along the coast, after which it will be necessary to incur further expenditure in carrying a line over the coastal ranges to Bombala and then to Delegate. This, of course, adds enormously to the total cost. </para>

                            <para>- I thought the estimated cost was &#163;1,500,000. But the objection 1 take is not altogether the cost. We had it in evidence before the Public Works Committee that, if a train were started from Melbourne by the route just mentioned by the honorable member for Gippsland, for Sydney, it would take twice as long to reach its destination as would a train by the Albury route. That, is entirely due to the grades and curves without which the line could not be made. When we consider that for a distance of thirty miles between Bairnsdale and Bendoc, the grades and curves, though they are not continuous, are equal to1 in 33, it is evident that considerable time must be allowed for any through traffic. </para>

                            <para>- But it is easier country. We know, for instance, that the speed from Albury to Melbourne is considerably greater than the speed from Sydney to Albury, owing to the easier nature of the former country. Under all the circumstances, I regard Canberra as sufficiently accessible, though the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> this morning contends that the site is inaccessible in that it will always lack a port. If we desire a port, and not a site on which to build a port, it seems to me that we ought to go to Jervis Bay. </para>

                            <para>- That is a kind of argument to which we are accustomed, and the .value of which we know how to estimate.  I  am inclined to think from expressions of opinion I have heard, that the New South Wales Government are likely to oppose any granting of territory to the sea, whether from Dalgety or from Canberra. I do not see any objection to making such a concession, nor do I recognise that it would do injury to New South Wales, and&#34; if any vote or action of mine could advance the matter, I should be prepared to give it. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that the honorable member will, by his vote, show that he does not support that policy, and thus confound those people in Sydney, who are for ever talking of the solidarity of the opposition of Victoria. There is no comparison between the port nearest to Canberra and that nearest to Dalgety. The distance from Dalgety to Eden, by the best survey so far made, is about no- miles. </para>

                            <para>- No; there is only an engineer&#39;s estimate of the possibilities. The distance is about  120  miles. From Dalgety to Eden, as the crow flies, is about  80  miles ; but the engineering difficulties stretch out&#39; the travelling distance to over j  00  miles. I was a member of a Committee which inquired into the matter, and have a good memory of the facts ascertained, so that I am speaking with some little knowledge. </para>

                            <para>- For commercial reasons, any railway would have to do so, and the line surveyed goes through Bombala. Then it would cost a large sum of money to make a port at Eden. The Canberra site is  7  miles from the railway at Queanbeyan, though it is proposed to construct a loop line from Yass, on the main southern line. </para>

                            <para>- No survey has been made, because there has been no reason for it; but it is stated that the fall is so gradual that the cost of construction would be much less than the cost of making a line from Dalgety to the sea-board. Then&#34;, again, although Canberra is further from Jervis Bay than Dalgety is from Eden,  30  miles of any railway that would be used to connect the two places are already constructed. Further, at Jervis Bay we have a good port. </para>

                            <para>- There would be no difficulty about making a railway, and whatever difficulties there may be in getting control of Jervis Bay, they would not be so great as if Twofold Bay were concerned. Personally,  I  do not regard it as important that there should be a port. Sections  112  and  51  of the Constitution make it impossible for New South Wales to put any hindrance in the way of trade or communication with the Capital. </para>

The statement published by the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> and circulated amongst honorable members, to the effect that Canberra&#39;s water supply must be pumped over mountains some thousands of feet high, is an absolute invention, and reflects no credit on those responsible for it. Similar statements have been .circulated in other directions. </para>

                            <para>- The obsession of the directors of that paper in regard to Dalgety is the most amusing thing I have seen for a long while. A week or two ago they published a fancy picture of the Dalgety of the future, with palatial buildings in the. middle distance, leading down to an artificial lake, apparently made by- damming the Snowy, while behind, dominating everything, was a magnificent sugar-loaf mountain, capped with snow, the chief feature in the artist&#39;s creation. The initiated know that Dalgety is  40  miles from Mount Kosciusko, and that mountain must be approached within a. few miles before it can be seen from that direction. Kosciusko cannot be seen from any point close, to Dalgety. One has to travel some miles from Dalgety to obtain a view of it, and when one does see the range one is in doubt as to which of the peaks is Kosciusko. </para>

In the vestibule there are on view a couple of photographs of the Snowy River &#34; above Dalgety.&#34; 1 hope honorable members will note the indefiniteness of the statement. We have no information as to how far above Dalgety those  photographs were taken, but we know that views of what, in the parlance of photographers, are &#34;pretty bits&#34; or &#34; little nooks,&#34; can be obtained at almost any point on a river. The honorable member for Boothby and I yesterday recognised one of the photographs as having been taken at a point about 40 miles above Dalgety, where we fished a couple of . years ago. </para>

                            <para>- Shortly before we adjourned for dinner I was alluding to the mis-statements made with respect to the water supply available at Canberra. No one denies the magnificent possibilities which the proximity of the Snowy River to Dalgety offers in respect to water both for domestic supply and for power purposes. It is undoubtedly a magnificent stream. I have fished on it at various points, and at different times, and have always found a fine sheet of water. </para>

                            <para>- There are plenty of trout, and we can also offer the sportsman good trout fishing on the  Gooradigbee  and other rivers near Canberra. It is, of course, important that the selected site should have a good water supply, and, in complaining of the misrepresentations of Canberra in this respect, I desire to point out the water possibilities of that district. The engineers of the State Government have suggested that the Cotter River catchment should  be  utilized for the water supply of the Canberra site. </para>

Those who have seen the report of the Royal Commission on Capital Sites will remember that an investigation was made of the Molonglo and Queanbeyan Rivers as sources of water supply for the Lake George site, and that, according to a plan prepared by Captain Gipps, the Molonglo, at a point nearly 400 feet above Canberra, and only 15 miles in air line from it, could supply water to meet the wants of, not 250,000 people, but several times that number. </para>

                            <para>- No; but at the point named there is a gorge in which could be stored 8,000,000,000 cubic feet, if a wall about too feet high were erected, and the run off of the Molonglo catchment is estimated to be. more than sufficient to fill that reservoir once a year. Tine Molonglo, the Upper Murrumbidgee, the Gooradigbee, the Cotter, the Queanbeyan, and the Gudgenby all have their sources in high mountains. They have a good run off, a good catchment, and a good average rainfall, with the result that storage basins for water supply purposes can be filled from them. On the Upper Queanbeyan, within&#39; 25 miles of Canberra, the Commissioners selected a site for the supply of Lake George, passing over the nearer site on the Molonglo, . because it was not sufficiently high to supply by gravitation the whole of the proposed city area at Lake George. But the site on the Queanbeyan was held to be sufficiently lofty, and to be capable of storing all the water required for the Capital Site there. This second point on the river is within a short distance of Canberra. Then we come to the Upper Murrumbidgee, where the supply is perennial, and where the facilities for storage are great, to say nothing of the Gudgenby or the Cotter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> and his officers estimate that the Gudgenby will allow of the storage of a body of water as large as that obtainable from the Cotter, and that the Gooradigbee, at a short distance from Canberra, can also be relied upon. That being so, we have a network of rivers surrounding the Canberra site, which can be tapped one after the other if it is thought necessary. </para>

                            <para>- That is inevitably so, having regard to the mountainous country which surrounds Canberra, and makes it a sort of amphitheatre. On the east, south and south-west lie a series of mountains which naturally mean broken country, and streams that are nearly all permanent. These are facts that can be obtained from official sources, and some of them are to be found in the report of the Royal Commission, upon the Lake George site. The map published by the Commission will show how short is the distance between the take-off of any of these suggested sources of supply and the site at Canberra. It has been&#39; urged by the right honorable member for Swan that even if a sufficient supply of water for domestic purposes can be obtained at Canberra, the supply is not sufficient for power purposes. In that relation, the engineers of New South Wales say that on the Murrumbidgee, a, few miles below the suggested site, a weir could be constructed at comparatively small cost, which would back up an immense sheet of water on that river and part of the Molonglo - a lake which would be sufficient to supply power for lighting the city by electricity and supplying it. I think, with electric power for trams, without touching the Barren Jack reservoir. But assuming that the power available on the Lower Murrumbidgee is not sufficient, I would point out that Barren Jack is within 40 miles in a direct line of the suggested site. At Barren Jack the State Government will have thousands of horse-power going to waste because they propose to store water there for irrigation purposes, and have no means of utilizing the power which will be available. So that the city site of Canberra can be supplied with power from Barren Jack at a very small , cost and with absolute certainty so far as its transmission is concerned. </para>

                            <para>- There are not likely to be any manufacturing interests in the close vicinity of Barren Jack to absorb the power which will be running to waste. This immense body of water will be passing down to the Lower MurrumBidgee, and will remain unutilized unless the Commonwealth Government comes along with some proposal for its absorption. But as the honorable member for Lang reminds me this scheme is merely a supplementary one. The engineers state that sufficient power for all purposes can be generated within the area which will be Federal territory. </para>

                            <para>- The supply mentioned in their estimate is sufficient for approximately 2,000,000 persons. If during the first twenty years of. its existence we have a population of 50,000 at the Federal Capital, I think it will be going ahead just as rapidly as most of us anticipate. When we realize that the Cotter River catchment is sufficient to provide for 250,000 inhabitants we can cast aside all the other schemes except on the ground of expense. I merely wish to show the ample supply of water that is available if we choose to tap all these various sources. Another feature which has been alluded to as- of all importance in connexion with this question .is that of climate. I do not contend that the climate of Dalgety is likely to be an unhealthy one. Probably it might have a bad effect upon delicate persons, but upon persons of ordinarily robust constitutions I&#39; do riot think that it would be objectionable, except from the stand-point of comfort. My opinion is that a city at the elevation of the Dalgety site, having regard to its exposed position, is bound to suffer severely from bitter wind&#39;s in the winter. </para>

                            <para>- In any case it owes its pre-eminence as a cold place in the cooler months of the year to the fact that it occupies an exposed position. It is open to all the winds that blow. The coldness of the prevailing winds coming over the Snowy Mountains is accentuated before they, reach Nimitybelle, and consequently they make the climate a very disagreeable, though not an unhealthy, one. The same remark is applicable to Dalgety. It is situated in an exposed position. There is nothing tq protect it from the severity of the winds which sweep over the Monaro Plains in the winter. Whatever degree of normal cold exists in that locality is very much intensified by the winds that have. free play there. It is only from the stand-point of situation that I wish&#39; to contrast Canberra with Dalgety. Canberra is situated at a considerably -lower altitude - : it is about 2,000 feet - which may account for some  difference in the temperature itself. But it is because it is surrounded by hills which protect it from the winds that it possesses a decided advantage. It occupies a sheltered situation, and whilst sufficiently high te be cool, is sufficiently enclosed to afford protection against the winter winds. </para>

                            <para>- I am always on the alert when the Minister of Trade&#39; and Customs&#39; makes a statement, because it is safe to assume that he has something concealed. Within 5 miles of Canberra, on the Queanbeyan side, there is exceedingly poor land. I am not to be &#34;&#39; got at &#34; by a suggestion of that sort. I am speaking of the quality of the land within the respective sites themselves and within a reasonable distance of them. The good land upon the Canberra side commences about 5 miles out of Queanbeyan and continues for 40 miles to Yass. The site itself is upon good soil - in fact, I think that some of it- is too good to build upon. </para>

                            <para>- The soil is good, and upon the Canberra flats it is much too good for building purposes. Just outside the city, at  Jininderra,  there is some of the best agricultural land one can desire to see. That is within 4 miles of the centre of the city site. But the site itself is upon excellent soil. On the other hand, within fifteen miles of Dalgety is to be found a granitic soil of recent origin, with boulders protruding all over the place. Of course, these might be removed, but their mere presence in such numbers is proof of my statement that the soil is of recent granitic formation. I believe that in the photographs of Dalgety the boulders in the vicinity of the site have been carefully draped to represent trees - the only trees to be found there. In their naked beauty it was felt that they were a reproach to the site. So far as farming is concerned, the Dalgety site, in my opinion, does not nearly approach the site at Canberra. We have been told that a bad foundation will be found to exist at the latter place. I do not wish to pit my knowledge against that of the right honorable member for Swan. </para>

                            <para>- It. does look a little barren. I was going&#39; to say that, while there is a fine prospect from one standpoint, there is nothing in the way of natural, features to strike the eye beyond the river. There are no local hills of importance, and no background of mountains on which the eye can rest with any satisfaction. It is true that Mount Kosciusko is within 40 miles, but that is not of much advantage when one&#39;s perambulations are confined to a city. From this stand-point, therefore,&#39; I regard Dalgety as unsatisfactory. There is, of course, the river frontage, but beyond that there is nothing of the picturesque to commend the site. At Canberra, on the other hand, there is the plain  in the centre, and foot hills all round, varying the general appearance of the country ; and beyond that, after further rolling foot hills, we have, on the south-west and south, the Murrumbidgee Mountains, towering as a background and proving a most effective foil to the other scenery. </para>

                            <para>- No ; I am sorry to say that the poetic gift has been denied me. But I was certainly impressed at Canberra by the picturesque appearance, which ought to commend the site, to all who desire the beautiful. In the vicinity there are mountain gorges, which afford every diversity of scenery, and I have been informed by trout fishers that there are most interesting places in the heart of the Murrumbidgee Mountains, full of beauty, and within a short distance of the suggested site. I do not say that picturesqueness alone should decide the question ; but, other&#39; things being equal, I think the beautiful ought to turn the scale. While I admit the superiority of the water supply at Dalgety, I contend there are other advantages in favour of Canberra, where the water supply can be provided in&#39; the way I have indicated. I am strongly convinced that the continuance of the present situation is likely to work injury to the future of Australia. I have endeavoured to view this question free from any Sydney or New South Wales influence, and to have regard only to the interests of Australia. If Australia is to become a nation such as we desire to see,, we must, at the earliest possible opportunity, get away- from the influences that are always alleged to surround a Parliament meeting in a big centre of population. As the right honorable member for East Sydney said to-night, while we sit in one centre of population, it is certain that there will be some degree of jealousy and prejudice in the other centres in respect df the work done. I believe that the Canberra site is one that fairly fulfils all the conditions which I have laid down as desirable in the case of a Capital Site; and I express the earnest hope that honorable members will hesitate before they confirm the decision arrived at four years ago in favour of a site that, in my opinion, is not the best, having regard to the object in view. </para>

                        <para>. - I anticipate that a large number of honorable members, especially representatives of New South Wales, will desire to speak on this question, and, therefore, I shall compress the few remarks I have to make into as short a space as possible. I should like; however, to acknowledge the very great assistance which we have received from the speech of the honorable member for South Sydney. I am quite sure that the speech of that honorable gentleman will have the effect, not only of curtailing the number of speeches to be delivered, but of relieving those who do speak of a large part of the subject-matter of the speeches they may have intended to make. The honorable member Iws dealt with almost every utilitarian aspect of the question, and has touched very usefully on the aesthetic side. One of the most valuable parts of his speech was that in which he emphasized, from his own personal knowledge, as one who was for a time Prime Minister, the very great disadvantage under which the Commonwealth and its Legislature suffers from the temporary Seat of Government being placed in one of the capitals. For my part I have always contended, not only that the Parliament should not sit in Melbourne, but that there would be equal objection to its sitting in. Sydney. I should be one of the first to oppose moving this Parliament to Sydney, either permanently, or for a limited period. I am satisfied that all of which we have now to complain in Melbourne in regard to the advantages to Victoria ; in regard to the bias in favour of Victoria; and in regard to the influence of the Victorian press would apply, equally to New South Wales and New South Wales institutions, if this Parliament were to sit in Sydney. The honorable member has emphasized that point so clearly and forcibly, that I shall not attempt to supplement what he has&#39; said. One of the most important, although, perhaps, one of the least interesting aspects of this question, is the legal one. A very large number of honorable members seem to be under the impression - especially those who were not in Parliament at the time - that the Commonwealth has, in a thoroughly legal and proper manner, adopted- Dal,gety as the Capital. I should think that even the speech of the Attorney-General would have convinced honorable members that such is not the case. It was contended in 1903, and in 1904, not only by myself, but by others, that the course which was then about to be adopted in the selection of a Capital Site was unconstitutional. The section of the Constitution which enables this Parliament to select the Capital Site distinctly provides that it shall be an area which has either been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth. The actual words of the section are - </para>

No territory has been granted or acquired, and yet we are asked to pass a Bill to determine the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para class="block">Then I went on to quote the section in the Constitution. I have always thought that the function of an Attorney-General is to &#34; hold the scales &#34; in laying information on any legal question before the House. But to-day the honorable gentleman assumed the attitude of the advocate, and contended at length, and with force, that what has been done is perfectly constitutional. But I  ask, as I have asked before, if this House has, within its constitutional rights, chosen the Capital Site, why does the Government not act on the choice, and put in a peg, or some other &#39;symbol of ownership, in order to give the New South Wales Government an opportunity to bring the whole question before the High Court, in an action for trespass? The Government are evidently conscious- of their unconstitutional position, and have hesitated to put into force the legal power alleged to exist. I am not alone in. the opinion I then expressed; for since that time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales, has taken the opinion .of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Julian</inline> Salomons and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cecil</inline> Stephen, two of the ablest and most experienced counsel in the senior State, to the same effect. The passing_ of that Act was, admittedly, . an indication to the State of New South  Wales of the desire of the Commonwealth Parliament that a site at Dalgety should be ceded ; but inasmuch as it was only the first step towards obtaining it, there is not the same objection to dealing with the question now as there would be if we were actually re-opening the whole matter. The Act is. ineffectual for the purpose of. obtaining a site for the Commonwealth. That view is taken by the two authors who wrote <inline font-style="italic">The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth,</inline> the recognised treatise upon the Constitution. They say - . </para>
                    <para>The chief  question  which has arisen in connexion with these words is whether the determination of the Seat of Government rests, in the last resort, solely with the Federal Parliament, ot whether the Federal Parliament is limited in its choice to sites offered by the Parliament of New South Wales. </para>

                        was published before this Parliament met. &#39; We have not only the authority of the author&#39;s of this work that there is something to be said in favour of this view, but also the best available legal opinions  in  New South Wales. The point is important ; because a number of honorable members, who were not members of the Parliament  in  1904, are possibly under the impression that the Parliament has done all that the Constitution required, in order to possess the Commonwealth of a site, and possibly this is operating to induce them to hesitate about interfering with the choice which is being made. Although the Attorney-General has adopted the role of advocate for Dalgety, he has not cited a single legal opinion against the view which I have put forward from the recognised treatise on the Constitution, as the basis of the opinion furnished to the Premier of New South Wales.

                            <para>- There is a distance of something like 40 miles between Dalgety and Bombala. We have been reminded recently of the desirability of not legislating on the border land of Commonwealth and State rights&#39;, where interests may clash, without trying first to arrange amicably questions of which a forced settlement might lead to reprisals. No decision made by us could be more far-reaching than this. If we were to finally determine upon a site unfavorably regarded by the great body of the people of New South Wales, there would probably result a great deal of unnecessary friction. I do not emphasize the statement so as to give any one the chance to say that it has been held out as a threat; &#34;but it will be generally admitted that it <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> highly desirable, where it can be done without running counter to the interests of Australia, to arrange matters of mutual concern, so as to leave the best possible feeling between the States and the Commonwealth. Canberra is a. site favorably regarded by the Premier of New South &#39;Wales, who &#39;commands a large majority in the Legislative Assembly of the State. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. This is not the Parliament that chose Dalgety. That site was illegally chosen by a Parliament differently constituted. Our proceedings even now will be merely an indication to the people of New South Wales as to the site which we desire it to cede to us. </para>

                            <para>- No. If we choose a site within the compact entered into with New South Wales, the steps necessary to place it at our disposal will be taken before any other Parliament can consider the matter. All that we can do now is to indicate, as a preliminary requisite to action, the site which we desire. I wish to say a word in regard to the compact entered into by the Premiers, and the attitude of the right honorable member for Swan. The leader of the Opposition said that he remembered vividly the perfervid appeal made by the right honorable member to the House - and I remember it, too - to give effect to an implied contract with the people of. Western Australia in regard to a proposed trans-continental railway. </para>

I understood the right honorable member for East Sydney to say in the same spirit, &#34; I appeal to the right honorable member for Swan to observe, not an implied or verbal understanding, but the written undertaking to which he, as Premier of Western Australia, . subscribed, that a&#39; site should be chosen within a reasonable distance from&#39; Sydney.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knows what occurred. The Attorney-General has now stated that the New South Wales Parliament left the choice of the Capital unconditionally to the Federal Parliament ; but, as has been explained, it was subsequently stipulated&#39; by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, then Premier of Victoria, that a site should not be choseo. in or within 1.00 miles of Sydney. That altered the whole situation. The leader of the Opposition, who was then Premier of New South Wales, thereupon said, in effect : &#34;If Sydney is to be barred, I insist upon a further stipulation, a perfectly justifiable one.&#34; He said, &#34; If you bar Sydney, and the country within a radius of100 miles, there must be a further stipulation - not a mere verbal or implied understanding.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I do not recognise any difference. The right honorable member for Swan actually signed that document in which he undertook to recognise the right of New South Wales to have the Capital established at a reasonable distance from Sydney. I do not wish to discuss this phase of the question further than to say that the appeal made by the leader of the Opposition to the right honorable member for Swan was a very reasonable one. He said, in effect : &#34; We recognised your appeal to us with regard to the Western Australian railway; we recognised your statement that there was an implied obligation, on the part of the Commonwealth to construct that line, and you ought now to recognise something that is infinitely more binding - an agreement contained in a written document which you yourself signed.&#34; That was a rational appeal, but. instead of receiving it in the spirit in which it was made, and resolving to reciprocate, the right honorable member worked himself into a passion, and made some observations that were not called  for. _ A great deal has been said in the Victorian press, as well as at public meetings in Victoria, with reference to what is described as the &#34;bush capital.&#34; All that has been said on that score can be speedily disposed of. Honorable members will realize by glancing at the short history of this movement that had it not been for the stand which the people of Victoria took, through their representative, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, there would have been a possibility of the Capital being established in Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner,, as the representative of Victoria, said, in effect, at the Conference of Premiers: &#34; We bar Sydney, and we object to the Capital being established within a radius of  100  miles of that city.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- The people may not be so much concerned; but the press nowadays is the mouthpiece of the public. Whatever may be said of its independence, we know that just as the meteorologist is&#39; constantly on the watch for weather conditions, so the newspaper editors are ever on the watch to determine which way popular feeling is running, and that they write their articles accordingly. I have read in both the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> -articles deliberatelyy v advocating . the indefinite postponement of the determination of this question. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> in one article said in effect : &#34; It is true that the Constitution provides that the Capital shall be within New South Wales, but it does not say when it shall be established.&#34; Therefore, to use its own words, we are to deal with this question on the principle of the Merchant of Venice, and let the people of New South Wales have the Capital established in that State at -some future time! The attitude of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> is equally reprehensible. In one of its leading articles, it deliberately advocated the indefinite postponement of the. question. At the general election some five years ago, it supported- for the Senate four candidates who placed in the forefront of their platform the words: &#34; The indefinite postponement of the choice of a Capital,&#34; -and who received  100,000  votes from the people of Victoria, although proposing to make that unrighteous breach of. the compact. </para>

                            <para>- A good deal has been said of the advantages to be derived from .visiting the various suggested sites. I am one of the few honorable members who have not yet visited any of them. I contend that I am equally as competent as those who have visited them to express an opinion on the question. In my view, there is no qualification in respect of a Capital Site which cannot be indicated to this House quite as well on paper as by personal inspection. The question of water supply is one for engineers to deal with in reports. The question of soil can also be dealt with in reports, whilst the question of climate cannot be determined in a visit of a day. We have had an ironical illustration of the value of one-day visits to suggested sites so far as the determination of the suitability of the climate is concerned. A party of honorable members happened to visit Albury on a very hot day, and. after their departure the people protested against the suitability of that town as a site for the Federal Capital being determined by that one visit, on the ground that the day in question was one of the hottest that had ever been experienced there. They urged that the average temperature should be taken, and that a residence of a few months would enable us to judge whether, so far as climate was concerned, Albury would be a desirable site. Thus a visit to any of the sites is of no service in enabling us to determine the suitability of the climate. With regard to scenery, what do we find? We have exposed in this House photographs which have been deliberately faked to mislead honorable members. We have one photograph, evidently taken by an artist, portraying a view of the Snowy River, on which some aesthetic individuals might arrive at a determination. </para>

                            <para>- 1 base my opinion on the judgment of an honorable member who has been there. The honorable member for South Sydney, who was for some years the honorable member&#39;s &#39; leader in this House, stated to-night that he  recognised  the photograph as that of a scene on the river 40 miles above Dalgety ! That photograph was exposed for the edification of honorable members, and to enable them to judge of the merits of Dalgety. Yet, on the evidence of the honorable member for South Sydney, who has visited the Snowy River as a fisherman, it is a  picture  of the river at a point 40 miles above Dalgety, -and quite beyond the proposed Federal territory. </para>

                            <para>- Some wag has since added to the inscription, &#34;View of the Snowy River &#34; the words &#34; 40 miles above Dalgety,&#34; so that honorable members will now know the truth about it. I speak without any- bias. 1 am glad that, that statement provokes laughter. At one time I was rather inclined to favour Dalgety. I knew that it had a very fine water supply, ana that if the Parliament could be induced to sit only during the summer months the climate would be all that could be desired. I always felt that it was too far from Sydney, but reflected that it was possible that, in the future, there might be a railway from the Capital to Eden, and that people might thus be able to reach it from Sydney or Melbourne by large steamers touching at that port. The more I know of Eden as a. port, however, the more satisfied I am that it would be impossible to induce steamers of any size to call there regularly in order to accommodate a few members .from Melbourne or Sydney. I have arrived, therefore at the conclusion - a fact which I never recognised before - that the people of Sydney, desiring to visit the Capital, would have to travel to the most south-easterly portion of New South Wales in order to reach it, whilst Victorians would have to travel from Melbourne to Goulburn - which is only a four hours&#39; railway journey from Sydney- and would then have * to travel southwards &#39;for eight hours. In other words, the time occupied in travelling from Melbourne to the Capital - putting aside Adelaide and other places - would be equivalent to a railway journey four hours longer than that between Melbourne and  Sydney.  We have been told by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro that the Victorian Government will construct a railway to Dalgety. </para>

                            <para>- I understood the honorable member to say that such an extension would cost  &#163;1,400,000.&#39;  Is it likely that Victoria would construct a line of railway to the foot of the mountains, which are very similar to the Blue Mountains of New South Wales,&#39; and then&#39; extend it over those mountains at a cost of some hundreds of thousands of pounds, in order to carry ten or fifteen members every week to the Federal Capital? If the line of railway contemplated by this State is designed merely for commercial purposes, it is not likely to .be carried over a range of mountains in order to reach part of another State in which Victoria cannot trade. Therefore, we have to take the estimated cost of  &#163;1,400,000  plus whatever it would cost - if Victoria were foolish enough to build it - to construct a line over mountains as difficult to negotiate as are the Blue Mountains of New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- I would not regard it as being as suitable a site as Canberra. But honorable members know for themselves what chance there is of inducing Victoria to spend  &#163;2,000,000  or &#163;3,000,000 upon the construction of that railway. The right honorable member for Swan realized that thoroughly when he suggested, apparently as a sop, that the Commonwealth should step in and assist Victoria to build a line over those mountains for Federal purposes. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable member has a sort of fever for ocular demonstration of everything. I confess that I do not see the need of any such  demonstration. In the matter of a Federal Capital Site I do not think that ocular demonstration can serve any useful purpose except to show honorable members the scenery surrounding it, and that scenery can be reproduced by honest photography. In the vestibule of this House there are some very honest . photographs of the Canberra site. I shall vote for that site, not because I think it. is the best one, but because I think it is the nearest approach to it. If I could see a site nearly half way between Sydney&#34; and Melbourne I should vote for it in order to avoid disputes hereafter. Had a site been available at Yass and had a sufficient water supply been forthcoming, I should have supported ,it. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that honorable members would support me if I did so. The honorable member, although he has only been a brief period in political life, must recognise that under the system of exhaustive ballot there is a danger that one may lose the site which he favours most. If the honorable member can satisfy me that if I propose the selection of Lyndhurst I shall obtain it, I am prepared to take action in the direction he suggests. I repeat, I shall vote for Canberra, because it constitutes the fairest compromise which can be made. </para>

                            <para>- I take my data from proper sources. The honorable member may vote for Dalgety because the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> advocates its selection. I do not say that it is so. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is not a paper to which I go for light and leading. If I desired to find a way out of a difficulty - a very subtle way - I might go to that journal for assistance, but for light and leading I should not consult- it. I shall support the Canberra site, because it represents the nearest approach to a fair compromise between the two capitals. I understand from the honorable member for South Sydney that Canberra is twelve hours distant from Melbourne, and eight hours distant from Sydney. Honorable members from New South Wales have to spend thirty-two hours in the train each week in order to attend to their parliamentary duties. As we have done that for seven years, I do not think that we are asking anything very unreasonable when we ask - in spite of the condition inserted in the Premiers&#39; memorandum - that a site shall be chosen, which, according to the honorable member for South Sydney, is fitted in every way for the purposes of a Federal Capital.  </para>

                            <para>- No. I did not say that we should go to as inaccessible a place as we could get, but) that the inconvenience should be equally distributed. With regard to the cost of establishing a Federal Capital I desire to say one or two words. I know that this aspect of the question has formed a very useful peg upon which to hang many objections. Just before the referendum upon the Constitution Bill took place in New South Wales, -a great dispute occurred in that State as to what  would be the extra cost of Federation. The two opposing parties in that State - the Federalists&#39; and the  anti-Billites  - determined to have the question inquired into before the vote of the electors was taken. The  anti-Billites  chose as their representative a well-known Legislative Councillor of Sydney, and the Federalists selected myself. We chose as an umpire <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Russell</inline> French, the general manager of the Bank of New South Wales. These two gentlemen in their report estimated that the annual  interest upon the- expenditure involved in building the Capital would be ,&#163;75,000. That is to say, they calculated that it would cost &#163;2,500;600. But we must recollect that that- was the  anti-Billite  view. I took exception to their estimate, and. accordingly had to file with their report an addendum stating that I thoroughly disagreed with that feature of it. I have had an opportunity from time to time of consulting the Government Architect of  New South Wales upon this que&#39;stion. He  has collected plans, diagrams, and sections of all the great parliament houses in the world, and he has expressed the opinion that for present purposes - for the building of both Houses of Parliament, for the erection of Government House, and of the necessary Commonwealth offices - the cost need not exceed some &#163;200,000 or &#163;300,000. Of course we could not have marble halls or a White House- </para>

                            <para>- No, because this building cost &#163;1,000,000. But we could have a building which would cover us, and which would provide us with the necessary accommodation to perform our legislative work. When people talk about the erection of a Federal Capital involving an expenditure of &#163;1,000,000, &#163;2,000,000, and , &#163;3,000,000 they &#34;talk with their foot.&#34; Nothing of the kind is required. All that is necessary is a moderate expenditure, such as I have indicated, to enable us to carry on our work. I think that most of us are sufficiently democratic to be willing to put up with a very simple, substantial building for the purpose. One more word about the outlet to the sea. We all know that with regard to the Dalgety site it has been proposed as a very desirable adjunct that there should be access to the ocean. Now, the only part of the coast which could be reached within a reasonable distance of Dalgety is Twofold Bay. I know Twofold Bay very well, and Isay that it really is not a port. A port would have to be created there, and at very great expense, because it is open and exposed to the ocean. On the other hand, Jervis Bay possesses 120 square miles of deep water anchorage. </para>

It is open to the whole world. The British Fleet in Australian waters visits Jervis Bay very frequently to practise gunnery.

Probably the honorable member desires some opportunity to construct buildings such as those which have been constructed upon Garden Island in Port Jackson.  I  have no hesitation in saying that just as New South Wales has given the British Fleet in our waters every facilitv to build al necessary works, docks, &#38;c. for the repair of its ships in Sydney Harbor, so she would be willing to afford the Commonwealth every opportunity and convenience, and possibly to set aside portion of the harbor for naval purposes. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member, of course, understands that we cannot bind the Parliament of New South Wales, or introduce such a stipulation into any Bill. If this House chooses a site which is fa.vorably regarded bv New South Wales, and thus gets the good-will of the people of that State, I am sure that we. shall find ourselves treated in an open-handed, generous way; because the desire will doubtless be to make the site as fine as possible for the honour of the State, as well as for the honour of the Commonwealth. If honorable members think it essential to have communication with a harbor, that condition is fulfilled in the case of Canberra. I shall vote for the site I have just mentioned, not because I believe it is the very best, but because it represents the nearest approach to a compromise between the two great capitals of Sydney and Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>.- We have heard a good deal to-night about the desirableness of having this matter finally decided, and we have been told that until  it is decided there will be friction. But how is the question to be decided if every selection we make is received by New South Wales in the way that the selection of Dalgety has been received? It would appear that the only way for us to have this matter settled is to give up all our rights and, cap in hand, ask the New South Wales. Parliament to kindly tell us which site we may select. </para>

                            <para>- It is the spirit in which New South Wales has always approached this question. We have heard a good deal about this compact of the Premiers; but it is very singular that the view presented to-night was never pressed on the House on any former occasion. It is true that the honorable member for North Sydney referred to a compact in a speech he. made in 1904 ; but he never pressed it as a reason why the right honorable member for Swan and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner should vote for a site within what is called a &#34; reasonable distance of Sydney.&#34; So little was this compact considered, that in both ballots <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner voted for the Southern Monaro site. </para>

                            <para>- I am using the  usual  language when referring to such matters, and I mean the majority of the people who were sufficiently interested to record their votes. The memorandum points out that originally it was provided that the Seat of Government should be determined by the Commonwealth Parliament, and should be within territory vested in the Commonwealth.  It will be seen that under that provision the whole of Australia was open to the Commonwealth; and the Constitution, with that provision in it, was adopted by a majority of the voters of New South Wales. </para>

                    <para>The amendment first in interest, if not in importance, is that relating to the Site .of the future Capita-l of the Commonwealth. Under the Bill as framed by the Convention it was provided that the Seat of Government should be determined by the Federal Parliament, and that it should be&#39; within Federal territory. The amendment now proposed is- that the Seat of Government shall be in New South Wales,&#34; and be distant not less than 100 miles from&#39; Sydney. In nil probability, if the matter had been left in the hands of the Federal Parliament, the Capital would have &#39; been fixed somewhere in New South Wales ; her strong claim, founded on seniority and the vast and suitable territory available for such a purpose, would have told in her favour. </para>

                    <para>With regard to the Site of the Capital, the Federal Parliament was previously unrestricted in its choice provided the place selected was within territory vested in the Commonwealth. By the amendment the Parliament is limited to a selection within New South Wales, at a distance of at least 100 miles from Sydney.  . The compact made must and will be honorably adhered to, and there will, it is hoped aid believed, be not a moment&#39;s unnecessary delay in the fulfilment of the intention of the parties in arriving at the agreement. But in making the concession sentiment has already had full weight given to it, and it will be the manifest duty of the Parliament within the limits assigned to it, to select, as the seat of government, whatever site it considers most in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. </para>
                    <para class="block">There is not a word there about a reasonable distance from Sydney. The electors when they voted certainly did not believe that in the matter of the Federal Capital they were to be confined to within a reasonable distance of the 100-mile limit. If that &#39;were the intention, why did not the right honorable member for East Sydney insert words to the effect that the Federal Capital must be at a distance of not less than 100 miles, nor more than 200 miles, from  Sydney? </para>

One honorable member has. asked why the Commonwealth Government are always asking the opinion of the New South Wales Government on this, that, or the other subject. In my opinion, we have had too much consideration altogether for the States, not merely in the matter under discussion, but in financial matters ; and our courtesy has been mistaken for weakness, and played upon. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, on the 13th April, 1901, addressed the following letter to the Chief Secretary of New South Wales - </para>

                            <para>- We asked th&#169; New South Wales Government to offer a site. It had previously, in a Federal spirit, appointed a Commissioner to report on suggested sites, and he had recommended Southern Monaro, .Yass, and Lyndhurst - J think in the order named- Southern Monaro was, however, first. Those sites were offered to us in the letter which I have read, and in j 904 or 1905 this Parliament selected a Southern Monaro site. If we are to take the offer of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> as the offer of - New South Wales, cannot we also take&#39; the offer of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See as the offer of that State? The trouble about Dalgety  has arisen owing to the fact that the anti-Federal cry is thought to be good for election purposes. We hear about the friction in New South Wales, but is no allowance to  be made  for possible friction in the other States? Are we to take anything that New South Wales offers? The honorable member fbr South  Sydney  practically said that dissatisfaction in the State would not cease until we do what the people there wish us to do; but we shall derogate from our position if we accept whatever site the New South Wales Parliament chooses to. offer. The honorable member was not prepared to say that a majority of the people of New South Wales is opposed to the selection of Dalgety. At most,, he would speak only .of a strong minority. </para>

                            <para>- It is only amongst a small section of the people of Sydney that there is dissatisfaction. Most of the people of New South Wales would consent to any selection we might make. If we stick to Dalgety, and the people of New South Wales will not do what we wish, we must simply knock at the door until the territory is ceded to us, or take steps to acquire it. During the last seven years I have frequently addressed public meetings on the subject of Federation, and have always advocated -the establishment of what is called the &#34; Bush Capital &#34; because one of. the conditions under which we, federated was that the Capital should be in New South Wales. We, in Melbourne, have gained great advantage by reason of the location of the temporary seat of Government here, but the blame for the -delay in removing to a permanent Capital rests entirely, with the Government of New South Wales. If they had acted in the same spirit in which action was taken at the commencement of Federation, the Federal city would be pretty well in hand now. </para>

                        <para>In other words, the power to determine the Seat of Government, coupled with the direction that the Seat of Government shall be within territory granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, implies that the Commonwealth, in the absence of a grant, has power to acquire the necessary territory without grant. This view seems to be supported by a general perusal of the section. There is a clear declaration that&#39; the Seat of Government is to be determined by the Parliament, but there is no declaration that the concurrence of New South Wales is essential. . Had that been the intention, it would surely have been expressly mentioned, and not left to be gathered by implication - and especially by implication &#39;from such wide words as &#34; granted or acquired.&#34; </para>

                    <para>I do not propose to discuss at length the merits of the various sites. That has been done over and over again. I was surprised, when I heard the honorable member for South Sydney describe the Canberra site in such glowing terms, seeing that it has been only recently discovered. The Commissioner, who reported on the various suggested sites put forward in all parts of the State, seems to have overlooked it. The representatives of New South Wales, when putting forward their best sites, also overlooked it. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for South Sydney was complimented, I think for the first time by the honorable member for Parkes, upon the speech which he made to-night. Amongst his objections to Dalgety was the one that it is too far from Sydney. The right honorable member for Swan asked, &#34; Why should Canberra, which is 203 miles from Sydney, be considered within a reasonable distance, and Dalgety, which is only 296 miles away, be considered too far?&#34; The honorable gentleman then spoke about distances as the crow flies. But we must have regard to distances by the most accessible routes. </para>

                    <para class="block">It will&#39; thus be seen that Dalgety is practically equi-distant from Melbourne and Sydney. It has been insinuated in one breath, by the honorable member for South Sydney and the honorable member for Parkes, that Dalgety has been selected in the interests of Victoria, while in the next it has been asserted that it cannot possibly be reached from Melbourne save by a railway journey <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Goulburn, and that the construction of a direct line would involve an enormous expenditure. In view of these statements, how can it be said that Dalgety has been selected in the interests of this State? The cost of railway construction, however, has been greatly overestimated by those honorable members. The Royal Commission reported that the approximate estimated cost of a line from Cooma to Bairnsdale, <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> Bombala and Bondi, would be &#163;1,518,000. That is very different from the statement made&#39; by the honorable member for Parkes that it would cost &#163;3,000,000 to construct a line from Bairnsdale to. the foot of the mountains. The Commissioners further reported that to construct a line from Bairnsdale <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> Bendoc and Dalgety would involve an expenditure of &#163;1,466,000. </para>

                            <para>- The Royal Commission obtained all the available information from the Railway Departments of both States, and their report, from which I have quoted, was rather unfavorable to the selection of Dalgety. As a matter of fact, to my own knowledge, four different routes to the border have been suggested, and there is now under consideration a direct route, <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> Buchan and Bendoc, about 30. miles shorter than the others which&#34; have been suggested, which it is said would not be more expensive. We are told that there is no possibility of a line to the border being constructed. The Premier of Victoria, however, has emphatically declared his intention to ask Parliament to construct it. The proposal has been referred to the Railways Standing Committee for investigation, and. surveyors are now engaged in surveying a route from Orbost up to the Bemm river, and then up the Came River valley, <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> Bondi, to Dalgety. There is every probability of the line being constructed at a very early date, irrespective of whether or not the Capital be established at  Dalgety.  Such a line would open up a vast territory which has long been awaiting development - a territory which honorable members who have not seen it seem to imagine they are best able to describe. The right honorable member for Swan said he had crossed the country in question, and that it contained excellent land and timber; and those who have traversed it will recognise the truth of - his statements. &#39; It comprises a large area of rich land, through which a line could easily be carried. Victoria does not propose to build such a railway merely for the sake of the Federal Capital. It proposes to construct it - and it should have been constructed long ago - to open up the eastern portion of the State. It is strange that so much has been said of late in a deprecatory spirit of the port of Eden. When the honorable member for Lang was discussing this question a few nights ago, and praising Jervis Bay, he .was asked by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, &#34; Will New South Wales give us Jervis Bay with Canberra ? &#34; The honorable member for Lang replied, &#34;I am not talking about that.&#34; </para>

We have heard a great deal about the climate of Dalgety. A bulletin on the <inline font-style="italic">Climate and Meteorology of Australia,</inline> issued last week by the Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology, contains a comparison of rainfalls and temperatures of places which have been referred to as possible sites for the Commonwealth Capital-. That table shows that there is a difference of only about 5 degrees between the mean summer temperature of Canberra and Dalgety. The average mean summer temperature at Canberra is 69.7 as against 63.3 at Dalgety; the average mean winter temperature  of the Canberra district is 45.0, as against 42.2 at Dalgety. The highest temperature on record in respect of the Canberra district is 109.0 and 104.0 in respect of Dalgety ; whilst  the lowest on record is 16.0 for the Canberra district and 11.0 at Dalgety. Then again, it is shown that the temperature of the average hottest month at Canberra is 72.0 as against 67.0 at Dalgety, and that the temperature of the average coldest month is 42.0 in the Canberra district and 40.0 at Dalgety.

                    <para class="block">The honorable member now favours a site which is not on any line of railway ; but would be reached by means of a branch line. On the other hand, if Dalgety were selected it would be on a - railway which would become the main line connecting the capitals of New South Wales and Victoria. It certainly fills the bill so far as that consideration is concerned. It is unnecessary, however, to discuss every detail. As the honorable member for Parkes has said, full information can be obtained from the reports which have been available for some time ; but I am sure that if Dalgety, were the finest spot on earth it would not meet with the approval of the representatives of New South Wales, who are supporting Canberra. If we wish to deal finally with this question we must regard it from a purely Australian point of view. To-day the whole&#39; question has been discussed from the points of view of Melbourne- and Sydney. What about the interests of the other States? Is no consideration to be given to Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, or Queensland? </para>

The people of Australia as a whole have a voice in determining the question, and their representatives here should select what they believe to be the best site in the interests of Australia, not only for the present, but for the future. Having made such a selection - and I believe that in selecting Dalgety they have done so - the Parliament ought to stand by it, and keep knocking at the door until New South Wales hands over the territory. If New South Wales refuses to do so, we shall have to take other steps, but I believe that when the Government of that State realize that we are firmly wedded to </para>

I should be glad if I could congratulate the honorable member for Gippsland as I can the &#176; honorable member for South Sydney. It is only natural that the honorable member for Gippsland should support the selection of Dalgety, having regard to its proximity to his own constituency ; but he has to-night given expression to the very sentiments which, when published in New South Wiles, cause the people of that State to doubt the honesty and fairness of Victoria in regard to the settlement of this question. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for South Sydney said that he was&#39; not individually bound by that agreement, but the honorable member for Gippsland went further by declaring that  he could find nothing binding in it. When those who practically arranged the terms upon which all the States entered the Federation, and who subscribed their names to their interpretation of the provision in the Constitution relating to the Federal Capital, affirm that they are not bound by the agreement arrived at, they practically confess that they induced the States to enter the Federal union under a compact from which they have now absolutely departed. I think that the honorable member for South Sydney sufficiently contrasted the attitude assumed by the right honorable member for Swan towards the trans-continental railway - as to which no compact existed - with his attitude towards a compact which he himself signed. &#39;Sufficient has been said to show the absolute inconsistency of his position. . The honorable member for Gippsland has declared that we should fight New South Wales upon this question. </para>

                            <para>-That may be perfectly true. But to suggest that all the members of this party declare that all the members from another State are preventing this Parliament from meeting in the Federal Capital is not correct. I have never heard that statement made previously. On the contrary, I have declared that the members of this House have always been ready to deal with the question of the Federal Capital when it was brought forward. The remarks of the honorable member for Gippsland in regard to the Commonwealth fighting New South Wales are much to be deprecated. We desire amity. We wish all reasonable sites which can be brought forward to be carefully considered with a view to doing what is right to each State. It has also been said that the New South Wales Government are not likely to hand over the control of Jervis Bay to the Commonwealth. Surely any such request would be an extraordinary one. To suggest, that an enormous harbor like that - a harbor which is capable of being used not merely for Commonwealth but also for State purposes - should be handed over to the Commonwealth is a very big request. But if New South Wales, thinking that the Commonwealth had chosen a suitable site, and that it desired to give effect to the provisions of the Constitution, would provide any shipping facilities at. Eden, would it not provide far greater facilities at Jervis Bay ? </para>

                            <para>- If the New South Wales Government and Parliament think that that State is being fairly treated, no doubt they will be as liberal in their treatment of the Commonwealth as they have shown themselves to be in the past. Another point which has been raised by the honorable member for Gippsland and by the Attorney-General is that the New South Wales authorities allowed an inspection of eligible sites throughout that State. Did that exhibit any narrow spirit? New South Wales gave the Commonwealth the right of inspection from border to border. Why ? Because there might not be, near the 100 miles limit, a really suitable site. Consequently it allowed the Commonwealth to search from end to end of the State, so that if a suitable site were not found near the 100 miles limit we should beat perfect liberty to select a site further away. Whv is an attempt made to turn the generosity of New South Wales against that State ? The claim by the New South Wales representatives is that near to the 100 miles limit - at any rate within a reasonable distance of it - there are sites not only equal to Dalgety, but superior to it, and that consequently we have no right to forget the conditions of the agree-&#39; ment arrived at by the Premiers&#39; Conference. That is a perfectly legitimate position. I come now to the statement of the right  honorable member for Swan, that at the earlier stages in the selection of a Federal Capital Site some honorable members representing New South Wales voted for more distant sites. May I point out that, owing to the Premiers&#39; agreement having gone out of print, no copies of it could be obtained for some years. I recollected that there had been a document of the sort, and that its terms had been circulated in handbill form by the supporters of Federation throughout&#39; New South Wales. However, I could not obtain a copy of it either from this Parliament, from the Victorian Parliament, or from the New South Wales Parliament. At last, however, I found, not a copy of the document itself, but a copy of the handbill that had been circulated in New South Wales, and which quoted it. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of 1904 or 1905. Towards the conclusion of a debate upon this question, I quoted that document in this House. I felt sure from my own recollection that the terms of the agreement arrived at by the Premiers were not being fulfilled, and when I found the document in question that idea was confirmed. But even then I did not like to lay too much stress upon the document as it was not the original and had not been issued by authority. During the Federal campaign, when it was pointed out by many persons who were opposed to the draft Constitution Bill, that Victoria would delay the settlement of the Capital Site question for a long time, and would not support any site that was not near its own border, the agreement arrived at by the Premiers was relied upon, and was issued broadcast, as an answer. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, I could not come across a copy until I found the one to which I refer. After that, a search was made, and a copy of the agreement issued by authority was found in one of the State Parliaments. This the Commonwealth1 had printed. To show that that document changed the views of some honorable members I may mention that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner - who had forgotten the explanation which it contained of the arrangement arrived at in regard to the Federal Capital - stated that in the light of that agreement it would only be fair - so long as there was a suitable site available - to select  a site between 100 miles and 200 miles distant from Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- Both Dalgety and Lyndhurst have advantages of their own, and I am still in favour of the latter place; although I admit that Canberra has a better water supply, and better natural features. These advantages on the part of Canberra, however, do not, in my view, counterbalance the centrality of Lyndhurst, which is most convenient, in point of distance, for all the States of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- If we cannot get the site we desire, we have to try to bring about a compromise. If I thought that Lyndhurst would be selected, I should prefer it for the reasons I have given, because I think that,, with storage, sufficient water could be provided for a very considerable city ; and there are other means of supply when the population justified the expenditure. This water question, though important, can be made too much of. It is peculiar that one of the objections made to Botany Bay by the Commander of the First Fleet was, that the water supply was not good enough, being obtained from certain swamps close to the sea shore. We know that the Commander sent out an expedition to find another harbor, and fortunately found a very fine one - Port Jackson - but the water supply which he deemed insufficient supplied Sydney until the population of that city was nearly 250,000. It was very fine water, which oozed through the sands, and was pumped to Sydney; and it was only when the population got so large that the water did not ooze quickly enough to supply their requirements, that the present scheme had to be adopted. Therefore, I say that it. would be easy, when the population demanded it, to increase the water supply from places in the vicinity of Lyndhurst. I admit that the population will never get too great for the water supply at either Canberra or Dalgety. During the discussion, the Minister of Trade and Customs interjected that I had stated that the selection of Dalgety was conclusive. I happened to be the Minister who had to deal with the matter after Parliament had made the selection, and, although I voted and spoke against the selection, it was not for &#39;me as Minister to consider whether the laws I had to administer were altogether in accord with my own opinions.I, therefore, told the New South Wales Government, that so far as I was concerned, the selection was then conclusive, and I had to act upon it; and I think that was a perfectly proper and consistent attitude. </para>

                            <para>- As Minister, I had to regard the matter as finally settled by Parliament. Suppose I had opposed the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, and, when it had been carried, I had been appointed Minister, would the Minister of Trade and Customs expect me to allow my own opinions and feelings to influence me in carrying out that Act? If Ministers are loyal to Parliament, they must subordinate their own views in carrying out legislation. I do not think I have been unfair towards Dalgety, but I am convinced that it is not! the best site for a Federal Capital. Up to the time of the selection of Dalgety, the New South Wales Government allowed the Commonwealth every liberty in this connexion ; but I believe that a considerable majority of the people of New South Wales - though I do not profess to state what the majority is - consider that that is a wrong site, and that it was selected only because it was as far as could be from Sydney. </para>

Surely we should pay respect to the feelings of a large number of persons, when good grounds can be shown for their irritation. If Western Australia or any other State was concerned, there would have been much more bitter and angry complaints from its representatives than have been made by the representatives of New South Wales, most of whom have tried to secure an amicable settlement. </para>

                            <para>- No; notwithstanding all the temptations to do so. I have too much faith in the advantages of Federation to talk about secession in a case of this sort. But the people of New South Wales feel strongly on the matter, and I think that if honorable members will look into it fairly, they will admit that there is a good deal oi reason for their feeling. This Parliament has attempted to depart from the spirit of the understanding, and has passed by better sites in order to remove the Seat of Governments as far as possible from Sydney, and as near as possible to the borders of another State. I do not think the people of New South Wales&#39; are likely to be satisfied with such an arrangement. The right honorable member for Swan has asked, where is there a better site than Dalgety ? In my opinion, Canberra is superior in almost every respect. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I have spent several days at Dalgety, and was a day at Canberra, but I had had some previous acquaintance with the district. Coming now to the listed requirements of the right honorable member for Swan, both sites are more than100 miles from Sydney. Dalgety fulfils that requirement very completely, being nearly 300 miles away. Both sites are more than 1,500 feet above sea-level, the Dalgety site, according to the right honorable member for Swan, being at a height of 2,500 feet, and, according to the Commissioners, at a height of 2,690 feet. A site at such a height, especially on a plateau like Dalgety, must be exceedingly cold and inhospitable. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard persons who have been in the Antarctic say that the cold there is not unbearable when the weather is perfectly still, but that when a blizzard is blowing a man may lose his life by going 200 yards from his ship or his house. . I have visited Dalgety on a beautiful sunshiny day in May ; but we had not driven half way when the driver asked me to hold the reins as his hands were too cold to hold them.. This he had to do, notwithstanding that he was wearing thick gloves and heavy clothing. Dalgety has a plentiful water supply; but Canberra also fulfils every requirement in that respect. The honorable member for South Sydney has said that 2,000,000 people could be supplied. </para>

                            <para>- Then the right honorable member agrees with the statement. I admit that the Snowy is a larger river than those on the Canberra site; but, whereas, it has been photographed where there are pools, the Canberra streams have been photographed where there are shallows. At Dalgety there are places where one can walk across the Snowy. </para>

                        <para>The quantity of water available from the Cotter catchment cannot be estimated from the flow of the stream at any particular period. In the case of the magnificent catchment area of the Sydney water supply, which is capable of supplying 60 gallons per head per day to two and a quarter million people, the total run off of the rivers fell as low as 1,200,000 gallons a day in 1902; but, by means of proper storage, such dry periods are satisfactorily tided over and the average requirements maintained. </para>

                    <para class="block">The right honorable member for Swan, in his minute on the Canberra site, deals with the question of good climate during summer and winter. It must be evident to any one that the climate cannot be as equable, at an elevation of 2,700 feet, as it is at a better sheltered site with an altitude of 1,900 feet. I admit that, as the right honorable member for Swan has pointed out, Dalgety possesses superior water power, but would remind honorable members that water power can be obtained from some of the rivers in the Canberra district, and more particularly from the Murrumbidgee. It must not be forgotten that the water supply of Dalgety would be drawn, not from the Snowy, but from another stream, the catchment area and. flow of which is 50 per cent, less than that from which the supply for Canberra would be obtained. </para>

                            <para>- From the Mowamba, the Eucumbene, and the Crackenback. If manufacturing were indulged in to any extent on the Snowy River, or much settlement took place there, the water would be contaminated, and, in order to obtain a supply by gravitation, it was recommended that the creeks I have named should be tapped. The right honorable member for Swan also deals with the question of &#34; water frontage for recreation, sport, and beauty &#34; at Canberra and Dalgety. Such frontages can be obtained at Canberra by constructing artificial lakes, and so forth. Then the right honorable member refers to &#34; surrounding and adjacent scenery, with great natural features, within convenient distance.&#34; The beauty spots which can be reached from Dalgety, and to which the right honorable member refers, can also be reached from Canberra. They are not much further from Canberra than from Dalgety, and there, are certain beauty spots near Canberra which are far more distant from Dalgety. I desire now to refer to what is&#39; described as the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> post-card, which has been sent to most honorable members. </para>

                            <para>- One might as well speak of London as England because it is in England as speak of Dalgety and Monaro as one and the same. Perhaps the right honorable member will say that there is no difference between Dalgety and Canberra, as they are in the same locality. I do not wish it fo be thought that I am endeavouring to depreciate the merits of Dalgety. I am giving my real opinion of it as a site, and I say that it is, in my view, inferior to Canberra. </para>

                            <para>- No. But I have been in the Monaro district more than once, and upon, the last occasion I saw the particular site proposed. I have  shown why the people of New South Wales have some reason for the very strong feeling which they entertain regarding the action of this Parliament. Seeing that that feeling of irritation may grow into something worse, surely, if we can remove it by any reasonable compromise, it is our duty to do so. I am, endeavouring to meet the people of New South Wales by abandoning my first choice in favour of a compromise. When we enter into such close relationship with a State, as we must do when we establish the Federal Capital in New South Wales, surely it is well for us to enter its territory upon the most amicable terms. Surely it is to our interest to foster feelings of mutual goodwill. I can see an objection to any such compromise only if the interests of Australia would be sacrificed. I do not see nor wish to see any such thing. I should not argue in favour of the selection of Canberra if I thought that it was an inferior site to that of Dalgety. But I think it is a superior one. I am sure that Sf a majority of honorable members visited both places, and compared them, they would come to the conclusion that Canberra was preferable to Dalgety. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. But I do not know that it would fulfil the conditions of the Constitution any more than do some of the other sites which have been suggested. When reasonable ground exists for resentment, which may grow, and which it is not desirable that we should permit to grow, surely, if without sacrificing the interests of Australia, we can effect a reasonable compromise, it is our duty to do so. I maintain that we ought not to encourage dissension, but that our endeavour should be to foster amity, and to induce the great State of New South Wales, which possesses over one-third of the population of Australia, and which has not always hitherto proved itself unreasonable in its treatment of the Commonwealth, to work cordially with us. I believe that we can do this by agreeing to a compromise, which will carry out the intention of the Constitution, and its attached memorandum, without wronging the Commonwealth in any way. </para>
