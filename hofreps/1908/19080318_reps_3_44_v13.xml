However, I shall consult with the Minister of Home Affairs, and give the honorable member a fuller reply to-morrow. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the communications from the Imperial Government in regard to the Navigation Bill are in reference to the desirability of limiting the application of certain provisions to our own registered shipping, or to our own coastal trade. Is he aware that the limits to which the provisions of the Bill maybe applied go beyond the unanimous resolutions of the Navigation Commission appointed by the Government? Before the measure is proceeded with, will the Prime Minister compare the recommendations - in many cases the unanimous recommendations - of the Commission with the Bill when he is considering the objections urged by the Imperial authorities ? </para>

That memorandum has not yet been received, and until its receipt I have delayed comparing the two. But I will do as the honorable member desires, and any alteration will be very carefully considered. </para>

                    <para>.- To me it does not appear to matter much which way the matter is tested. I presume that the present amendment is as to the whole of the proposed new section  15A;  and that if we do not go the full length of striking the provision out, an opportunity will be afforded to modify it. In regard to the proposed new section itself, I doubt very much whether the powers proposed are really required by the Attorney -General. Doubtless the objection has already been taken that the powers are outside the scope of his office. We can understand somewhat similar powers being vested in him - though even those are extreme - in connexion with the Customs Act, on which, to some extent, the provisions before us are based. Under the Customs Act he is acting as the head of the Department in relation to purely Customs matters, as to which there must be a great deal of scrutiny ; indeed, in my opinion, there is sometimes too much scrutiny. I noticed yesterday that a question was asked in reference to the firm of Harris, Scarfe, and Company ; and if honorable members were aware of the extent of the scrutiny carried out in connexion with that and other firms, they would hesitate, in a matter not related to the Customs, in investing the Comptroller-General with the proposed powers. In the train this morning I read an account of yesterday's debate; and I desire to call attention to the fact that in the Harris, Scarfe case over  100,000  invoices were examined. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to go into the merits of the case, but we are now dealing with a proposal to give the Comptroller-General extraordinary powers in matters not relating to his Customs jurisdiction. As I say, there were examined in the case to which I have referred over 100,000 invoices dealing with the period between 1902 and 1907, and covering imports to the value of between <inline font-style="italic">£2,000,000</inline> and£3,000,000. About 23,000 orders were examined, and in the whole only three mistakes, resulting in under payments, were found. There were in all seventeen other cases, in relation to fourteen of which the firm had already paid the money to the agents, though the agents, it was said, had not paid it to the Government. When we find the Comptroller-General, in his capacity as head of the Customs Department, exercising those extraordinary powers of scrutiny, we ought to hesitate before we arm him with further powers, which are, to a certain extent, not germane to his true position. I desire to point out, further, that a great deal of what is sought to be done by this legislation can be done at present. What the Government desire is to practically enable the prosecutor, who is the Comptroller-General, to make preliminary inquiry, which, of course, is not allowed to any private individual, such as he really is so far as the Bill is concerned. If the Comptroller-General suspects that a contract has been entered into within the original Act, and he has good ground for suspicion, what is there to prevent the Government taking action against the parties responsible for entering into the contract? Surely if the Government are afraid to risk an action - if the ground of suspicion is so weak - the Comptroller-General ought not to be allowed to exercise the powers proposed in the Bill. If there are sufficiently strong grounds to suspect a contract, there is nothing, as I say, to prevent the Government taking action in the High Court, and, in order to prove the existence of the contract, administering the most searching interrogatories to the persons charged. Surely the Attorney-General will agree that,  if there is anything to justify the application of the proposed powers of espionage under the Bill, there are sufficient grounds on which to issue a summons. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with the Customs Act, in regard to which I endeavoured at the outset to draw a distinction. As head of the Customs Department, the Comptroller-General has to make many inquiries, involving an immense amount of detail, that he is not called upon to make under the Bill, because he is, in the latter relation, no more than any other member of the public who might be appointed to do the work. What is there to prevent the Government issuing a writ against suspected persons charging them with a breach of the Act, and then availing .themselves of the very comprehensive powers of inquiry given by the High Court Procedure Act? </para>

                        <para>- The Act of 1906 specially provides that a witness at an inquiry cannot refuse to answer on the ground that the matters dealt with may incriminate him, and that he is not to be prosecuted in consequence of any disclosures thereby made. That gets over the difficulty, and, if it does not extend to this clause, we can provide for an amendment. Such a provision exists in the principal Act, and, I think, is also to be. found in proposed section 15B. If there is any doubt as to whether it applies to an interrogatory  under this clause we can amend it. The point that I wish to emphasize, however, is that all this can be done by an action under which the scrutiny will be controlled, .as it ought to be,, by a Justice of the High Court. The proposed section 15B provides that in all proceedings for an indictable offence the guilt of the defendant must be established by evidence. One would imagine that that is a wonderful safeguard to the public. . To some extent, however, it . widens the scope of the earlier part of the provision under which a very wide discretion is given to the magistrate who may have to administer the law as to a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> assumption of guilt. The bulk of the cases under this measure ' will not ' be " indictments. Section 245 of the Customs Act provides that Customs prosecutions may be instituted in the name of the Minister by action, information, or other appropriate proceeding, in the High Court, or the Supreme Court of any State, and that when the prosecution is for a pecuniary penalty not exceeding ,£500, or the excess is abandoned, a Customs prosecution may be instituted in the name of the Collector in any County Court, District Court, or Court of Summary Jurisdiction. The penalty for which this clause provides does not exceed .£500. Even if it did, the excess might be abandoned, and thus the control of the Court, even in cases involving penalties beyond .£500, is left altogether with the Comptroller-General. The result is that the provision, that where there is an indictable offence the guilt of the  defendant   must be established by evidence, will,- in 99 per cent, pf the cases brought under this clause, be of no protection to the public. What are these Courts of Summary Jurisdiction ? A case involving penalties amounting to ,£500 might be brought before two country magistrates who had only just been appointed to the Commission of the Peace, and they could adjudicate. </para>

I do not know what is the position in Victoria. In some cases they receive a salary of only £450 per annum, and, however capable for their usual work, they are not the class of judges whom I would invest with the very wide powers given by this measure. </para>

                        <para>- I shall allow the Attorney-General to explain that matter to the Committee. I have not had an opportunity of closely examining the Act of  j  906, but am trusting to my memory. I believe that a great many of these offences could be dealt with by "a magistrate, and that the class of justice so obtained is not, from his training, of the standing secured from a Justice of the High Court. The point that I wish to take is that what the Attorney-General desires to do under this clause is to obtain proof of a contract, the existence of which is suspected. Without actual proof, he desires to assume the existence in all cases of a contract unless the contrary is proved. The intent must be proved, but that does not carry us very far, because in the bulk of cases intent will be assumed by the Court, and it is left to the defendant to show that there is no intent. Under this clause a mere charge of the existence of a contract will be evidence of its existence unless proof to the contrary is given» If there is such a strong suspicion as to justify the intervention of the Comptroller-General, there should be equally strong grounds to justify the issue of a High Court writ. When a High Court writ is issued, the most elaborate kind of inquiries may be made by way of interrogatories. These interrogatories must be replied to on oath by the parties charged, who must answer "Yes," or "No," as to whether the facts alleged are true. If there is anything in the shape of perjury, the usual criminal prosecution may follow. Under the circumstances, it will be better to rely on the law, than to go to the absurd lengths provided for in the "Bill. </para>

                    <para>- No; it has not. Some time ago the Victorian Parliament passed the Compulsory Purchases Act. After it was passed, the members of the Labour Party, and a good many others,  said that further powers must be given; . but when the Act was tested - I think by Mr. Mackey - the powers contained in <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> were found to be ample, and the estate to which it was applied now belongs to&gt; the Government.

                        <para>- Let the Minister go to the Court, and ' demonstrate that the Act does not contain the powers necessary to give effect to it. If the Act is tested, it will be found either that it is effective, or that more powers are needed ; and, perhaps, it may be discovered that there are no combines to which it applies. The people are being frightened by the continual asking for new inquisitorial powers. They fear that the next thing will be the introduction of the thumb screw, and boiling oil. The Ministry are pushed on by the Labour Party, and the people are frightened of the caucus, which is now running the country ; because they regard it as a sort of. Star Chamber. Persons will not engage in new enterprises, because  9198. <inline font-style="italic">Australian Industries</inline> [REPRESENTATIVES.] <inline font-style="italic">Preservation Bill.</inline> they never know that they will not be dragged into some Court or other ; and nothing is more necessary than confidence in commercial matters. The Bill is being passed despite the avowed hostility of the Opposition, and the statements of the Labour Party that it will be ineffective. This is an extraordinary travesty on parliamentary Government, legislation being enacted by the Government alone, with the help of one or two supporters. As a producer, I desire to put an end to trusts which are inimical to business ; but I think that the Act should be tried, and proved inefficient, before further powers are given. </para>

But the Attorney-General has told us that the officers of the Crown have made inquiries and are satisfied that the Act is not efficient. </para>

The advice of the law officers of the Crown is dictated, not by hope of fee or reward, but in the honest discharge of their duties to their employer. The honorable member for Fawkner will not accept the statement of the Minister that cases have been inquired into. Does he wish the honorable and learned gentleman to give proof of his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> by mentioning the names of the persons concerned, their trades or occupations, and the offences alleged to have been committed? The Minister has done well in refusing to be drawn on this subject. Although I asked for further information, I am now convinced that he acted properly in declining to give it. I accept his assurance that cases have been inquired into by the best experts which the Department has at its command. </para>

                    (Brisbane) [3.54].- I was unfortunate not to be in the chamber during part of last night's discussion. While recognising that, under certain conditions, it is justifiable to make the averment in an information proof of an offence, and to throw the onus of disproof on the defendant, I hold that this can be done only in certain cases, namely, those in which all the evidence, both for and against, is in the possession of the defendant. Under no other circumstances should the proposed departure from British methods be permitted, it being an axiom of British law that no man shall be considered guilty until proved to be so. We ought not to grant any further powers to the Executive in the matters enumerated in this Bill until it has been demonstrated that it is impossible to give effect to the provisions of the principal Act.

                <para>Colonel FOXTON. - We have been told that it is the opinion of the Crown Law officers that the principal Act is defective. Why was not this discovery made at the time the measure was passed ? Those who are responsible for advising the Executive upon legal matters - although they considered when the Act was passed that it gave the Government all the powers they required in this connexion - have apparently altered their opinion, notwithstanding that no judicial decision in respect of the provisions of the Statute has yet been obtained. I hold that Parliament should not enact further legislation of this character until it has been demonstrated whether the opinion which the Crown Law officers originally held is correct. That is the point which has to be considered. </para>

                        <para>- If I had my way  should soon prove it. If the operations of a combine are not to the detriment of the community, it need not fear the light of day being let in upon them, because it would be able to prove, not merely that its operations were not injurious to the general public, but that it was a beneficent organization. Why should any commercial combine be placed in a different position from that occupied by an industrial combine? I belong to the biggest industrial combine in the Commonwealth - a combine which numbers nearly 40,000 members - and I am quite willing that it should be dragged before the Comptroller-General to enable that officer to determine whether its operations are injurious to the community. I am a member of the executive of that body, and I believe I can speak, not only for the executive, but for the whole of its members. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that this Parliament is more capable of saying what trades unions should or should not do than are the unions themselves - especially in time of trouble. We are quite capable of judging what unions ought to do, because we have devoted more study to the questions than have some leaders of those organizations. If the representatives of a combine are asked to come before the Comptroller-General, and nothing questionable in its methods is revealed by the inquiry, it will be at once known that its operations have been  investigated and that we have found they are for the benefit of the community. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot. Under this Bill, it is necessary to establish intent on the part of a combine to injure the community, and it is left to the Government to find evidence of such intent. The onus rests upon the Government of proving intent to restrain trade. The honorable and learned member for Angas does not see the necessity for applying the provisions of the Customs Act to combines. He does not think that we have yet reached that stage when the operations of combines are so injurious that we require to apply such a drastic remedy. But I would point out that when the principal Act was passed, it was well known that its provisions were not nearly so drastic as are the provisions of the Sherman Act. </para>

                        <para>- Because it was believed that the combines had not reached the same injurious stage that they had in America, and that consequently we required something milder in the way of legislation. But if we find that, after seventeen years, much more drastic legislation than ours is ineffective in the United. States, it is time  that we did something more. The honorable member for Angas takes the view that it is not necessary to apply the provisions of the Customs Act to combines; but I am quite satisfied that we shall require much more drastic legislation than that presented by the Bill - that before we can do much good we must go further than the Sherman Act. Exactly the same influences are at -work in Australia as in America, only in a smaller degree, and they will inevitably work out with the same results. There are honorable members who seem to think that there are beneficent combines in operation in the Commonwealth to-day, though I &lt;lo not know one, and would be obliged if the names of some were mentioned. </para>

The Court regarded that as wrong, and the result was that we expunged the rule, because we did not desire to be an injurious combine, and did- desire to comply fully with the decree of the Court. </para>

I may say that the union to which I belong not only submitted to the decision of the Court, but has never uttered one harsh word of criticism in reference to it. In regard to the award and all connected with the case, every member is 'thoroughly satisfied, and regards the result as fair to both employers and employed. Although I think that this amending Bill will not do all that it is intended to do, I am prepared to" support the Government in order to demonstrate either its success or its failure. </para>

As to what is a beneficent combine, the Newcastle Coal Vend has been quoted as an example. I am not here to defend every action of that Vend, and I should be sorry to do so ; but I believe that, so far, its operations, on the whole, have been of a beneficent character. It has put a fair price on its article, enabling it to pay the miner a fair wage. What is happening to-day ? It is taking the Premier of New South Wales all his time to prevent the miners from striking; and why? Because, amongst other things, they wish to force the Vend or Combine to raise the selling price to 12s., while the Combine desires to keep it at11s. </para>

There could not be a more typical case of a beneficent combine than the present Coal Combine in Newcastle, so far as it has gone at present.

                        <para>- The honorable member said there was no beneficent combine save that to which he belongs. The position reminds one of the definition of " orthodoxy," " Orthodoxy is my doxy, and heterodoxy is yours." The honorable member says that his party is the only beneficent combine, and that it invites the closest scrutiny. It is idle to attempt to establish a parallel between things that bear no resemblance to each other. The Combine to which the honorable member has been alluding has been declared by a Judge, by Parliament, and by public opinion, to be a legitimate beneficent one since something has been done which he and his party violently opposed in this House. That being so, whatever there is of a beneficent character in the Combine of which he speaks has been introduced into it, by the direction of the Judge, despite his determined opposition. I shall offer no objection to this clause if we can incorporate in it the amendment which the honorable member for Illawarra seeks to make. </para>

It is. a simple proposal indicating an immense difference in the conduct of cases, and in the attitude of the Opposition with regard to the action which the Attorney-General seeks to take. We say that if these averments are not answered they should be <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence of the existence of the alleged agreement. </para>

                        <para>- Unless this is  done I shall feel very much inclined to vote ultimately with the honorable member for Balaclava, because I think the Bill will then give all the powers that are required to make the most searching investigation into whatever there may be to uncover with regard to trusts. My position is very plain. I wish equally with other honorable members to find out what the trusts are doing ; I believe that some of them are operating to the detriment of the community. All sorts of allegations are being made, for instance, concerning a Confectionery Trust in Victoria. There were placed in my hands some weeks ago documents similar to those placed in the hands of other honorable members, which seemed to show conclusively that there was, in this State at least, a trust which was injuring the retail confectionery business, and that it was extending to other States. Let us see what the agreement really is - whether it is in detriment of the public interests that it exists, and if that be so let us try to modify or abolish the agreement. We cannot have these harmful trusts running rough-shod over the public interests and the public weal. Whilst I do not think that we ought to regard the individual members of trusts as being criminals until we can prove them to be so, we should avail ourselves of every power that will enable us to make as thorough an investigation of their ramifications as we may possibly do with a view to removing whatever is injuring the common weal and the consuming public. </para>

                    <para>.- These thrusts and counter thrusts between the Labour Party and the Opposition may be very interesting, but they do not seem to touch the question at issue. The simple question is what the Parliament meant when in 1906 it passed the Australian Industries Preservation Bill? I understand that it intended to put an end to all trusts and combines injurious to the public. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that the intention of Parliament was to put an end to injurious trusts and combines. The measure was passed in order to nip at the very start trusts and combines in Australia which, if allowed to run wild as they have been in the United States of America, would do great harm. We are told now that the means provided in the principal Act are not sufficient to secure conviction. The Government come to us and say, " Give us better machinery in order that we may carry out the principles that we have embodied in the original Act." So far, to that proposal there have been two objections - one by the honorable member for Fawkner and the other by the honorable member for Brisbane, who thinks that the Government should at least test the Act and show in what respect it fails. The most complete evidence of failure is that the prosecutor is unable to go on. </para>

                        <para>- In answer to that contention, the honorable member for Balaclava says that the clause provides a lazy man's way of proving a conviction. I am satisfied on this point to take the opinion of the honorable member for Flinders. As to the principle of compelling a man to prove his innocence, it is rather late in the day to find fault with that method of procedure. An enormous number of statutory offences of the present day throw that onus on the defendant, and it is not, in some cases, a wrong course. The object of the Legislature is to prevent the commission of certain offences by punishing -those convicted of having committed them. In many cases the proofs of guilt or innocence are wholly in the possession of the defendant, and, under those circumstances, I see no objection to calling upon him to prove that he is innocent. In a big Customs prosecution many years ago, it was alleged that there ware two sets of invoices, the first set - that  presented to the Customs - being faked, and the second set showing the true facts. The Postmaster-General of the day seized the second set, but had the weakness to hand it on, unopened, to the defendant. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Molesworth tried the case, and my .recollection is that, when it was argued that the defendant was not called on to prove his innocence, he replied : "That is true; but the production of invoices in his possession would prove his innocence beyond doubt, if he be innocent, and I cannot understand an innocent man failing to produce .the proofs of his innocence when he has it in his power to do so." The invoices not being produced, the jury disagreed, and the prosecution was dropped. It seems to me that  any man knowing himself to be innocent, and having documentary proofs of his innocence, would be only too glad to produce them, instead of relying on the chances of an acquittal. In these cases the innocent party desires a verdict of not guilty, not a conclusion to the trial equivalent to the recording of a verdict of not proven. The honorable member for Angas seems to have overlooked the fact that in the cases coming under this measure the defendant would meet' interrogatories with the reply that in answering them he might incriminate himself. That position has aLready arisen. In&gt; the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Attorney-General</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Simpson,</inline> the defendant, by his answer, set up his right to protect himself from pains, penalties, and forfeitures, by refusing to make specific answer to the information and interrogatories. It "was held that in order to entitle the plaintiff to the relief claimed, it would be necessary to prove facts by reason of which the defendant would incur a forfeiture of the land under section 128 of the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1868, and be liable to a prosecution for misdemeanour under sections 127 and 129. He could not be compelled to make a further and better answer. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. The honorable member for Bendigo last night spoke of an omission from proposed new section  15B.  He pointed out that, under proposed new section 15c, the complaint has to be. made on oath in writing before the Comptroller-General can act, and he suggested that there should be the same preliminary required under proposed new section  15B.  But it must not be forgotten that under proposed new section  15B,  the. Comptroller-General merely asks certain questions, and requires the production of certain documents for inspection. The answers to those questions and the inspection of the documents may enable a person to swear that an offence has been committed, and consequently a complaint has to be made on oath in writing under proposed new section 15c, before documents can be required to be handed over. I suggest that the honorable member should move to amend proposed new section  15B  so as to provide that a complaint must be made in writing ' before the Comptroller-General takes action. The complaint could not in that case be made on oath. In both cases, however, some one should father the complaint. </para>

If the principle is adopted in this Bill, it may, later on, be adopted in another, until by degrees every accused person will be held guilty until he proves his innocence, which in many cases the innocent could not do.

                    <para>.- I do not think the Government is so rabidly socialistic that it would ask for unnecessary powers for the ascertainment of facts. The Opposition asserts that we wish men to be treated as criminals until they have proved themselves innocent ; but the provision, as I read it, is simply for a preliminary inquiry, not for a criminal procedure. Criminality in these cases lies in intent, and, under the principal Act, intent must be proved by evidence. All that is asked for here is power to ascertain by means of a preliminary inquiry the position of an individual in regard to a supposed trust or combine. </para>

                        <para>- No. One factor is the keen internal competition which takes place behind a high protective fence. That competition becomes of such a cut-throat character that business men are forced into the Bankruptcy Court.

If the Magistrate had simply convicted without making any statement of his opinion, we could not have upset the conviction, because it might have been that the Magistrate was not satisfied with the defendant's evidence, and if the defendant's evidence was unsatisfactory, I think the Magistrate could have relied on the provisions of the section and given effect to the section.

I think, however, that where evidence is given it is still the Magistrate's duty to say whether he is or is not satisfied that the charge has been proved. In the present case, extraordinary as it may appear, the Magistrate was not satisfied with the oral evidence given by the prosecution, yet he harked back to section 144 of the Excise Act, and convicted.

                    <para>. - For the last few days we have been listening to arguments for and against the amendment of the original Australian  Industries Preservation Act. It was strange to hear the honorable member for Brisbane this afternoon talking as though it was possible for a Government to introduce a perfect measure which should never require amendment, when we remember that some years ago he introduced in Queensland a Land Act which was so far from perfect that the State Parliament has been amending it ever since. When the original Act was before this House the pure  Merinoes  and   Southdowns  of the Opposition " bunted up " against it with all their power, and any good there might be in the measure was, as far as they, could insure it, minimized or obliterated. The ' whole series of laws since the commencement of Parliament in the Mother Land has been based on repeal, amendment, and renewal. .We repeal or amend- this year the laws that we made last year, and next year we shall repeal or amend the laws we make this year - the future is only an evolutionary repetition of the past. I quite sympathize with honorable members who do not desire to make repressive laws or do anything to interfere with the liberty of the subject. At the same time, all financial and industrial organizations receive from Parliament their power to  operate,  and those powers may be revoked, at the will of Parliament. . If the Parliament of the Commonwealth, or any other Parliament, desires to pass restrictive laws against the wolves of those corporations who prey upon their human fellow creatures, it is at perfect liberty to do so - the power which gives those corporations life can take that life away. If those engaged in combines are not doing wrong ' they can unhesitatingly produce proof. I know that when I am attacked I am prepared to go into Court and fight the matter out, because I know that I am not trying to rob, but that my only desire is to engage in- legitimate and honest dealing. The Parliament of the State of Illinois tried for years, and  President  Roosevelt also tried, to deal with the Beef Trust of Chicago. The  President  of the United States of America had one of Napoleon's relatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Bonaparte, United States Attorney-General, and some of the ablest lawyers of America, engaged with that object ; but the Beef Trust laughed .it them. How did the Beef Trust manage it ? The members used to meet in a cab. </para>

                        <para>- Two or three men controlled the trust, just as  twenty  or  thirty  men run Australia, while England is governed by about twenty men. After the meeting in the cab, the orders of the Beef Trust used to go forth, and. if five. or six clever business men can meet together and arrange these matters by signs and symbols, how shall we prevent them? The Beef Trust has demoralized the United States to such an extent that every dog when he passes a butcher's shop stops and wags his tail, because he recognises a friend inside in the sausage, and he knows that some day he will- be there. The honorable member for Illawarra contends that the Tariff creates trusts in America. But I understand, though I am not quite sure, that there is no duty on kerosene. </para>

                        <para>- The Oil Trust is the greatest trust the world ever knew, and it ran the United States Government until Roosevelt became  President.  Those desperate men, who, as  President   Roosevelt says, have the genius to create these trusts, cannot be crushed by means of any little Simple-Simon legislation. There must be the power of the nation behind the movement, and, indeed, in my opinion, some of these men will have to be killed before we can succeed. The vast multitude of business men are honest; but I may say that in an election in South Australia I was defeated at Encounter Bay bv money stolen from the Customs; and yet there was no power in South Australia that could reach  those men who had been robbing the State Treasury for years, and who have been robbing the Commonwealth. </para>

Honorable members have suggested that all these matters should be fully investigated in Court on a. charge being laid, but I point out that if the Government took a case into Court, and engaged expensive counsel to conduct an inquiry, extending, perhaps, over days, and were then", it may be, defeated  on  a technical point, the pure Merinos of the Opposition would be up in arms, also the cross-breeds of the Corner, and even the honorable members in this corner would feel inclined to turn the Ministry out for being such fools. I desire the Government to be- sure before they take action that,, when they go into Court, they must win,, and to- that end it is cheaper for us to perfect the law here than to engage lawyers; outside - if we have  any  money to spend, let us spend it here. We ought all to join- hands in assisting the Government to pass </para>

                        <para>- No. Some time ago we passed an amending Electoral Bill, under which a candidate for a seat in this Parliament could take proceedings against any one who slandered him. I took proceedings under that Act, which was passed with the assistance of the present Attorney-General, but found that instead of the defendant having to prove that I was guilty, I had to show that I was <inline font-style="italic">innocent</inline> of the charge made against me that seventeen or eighteen years previously I was associating with drinkers. As a matter of fact, I have been a teetotaller ever since I have been in Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member for Darwin has been appealing to the Committee to pass a perfect law. He will probably recognise the necessity of amending in the first place human nature. The Opposition are certainly endeavouring to do that which the honorable member desires, but, unfortunately, in their efforts to make our legislation as perfect as possible they meet with strenuous opposition from him and others. The honorable member for Balaclava also appealed to the Opposition to help the Government to pass this Bill on the ground that the principal Act had been found defective, and that unless it were amended as the Government propose, we should soon find it necessary to pass a further amending Bill. I venture to assert that unless the Government adopt the suggestion made by the Opposition for amending this clause the necessity for a further amending Bills will speedily arise. It is to avoid such a. contingency that the Opposition are suggesting amendments that will make good what seemed to them to be obvious defects: in the Bill. Unfortunately, the reason why so many amending measures are necessary is that very often when the Opposition have proposed amendments with the object of improving the original Bills, they have met with strenuous opposition, the contention being raised by the Government and their supporters that the proposed alterations are unnecessary, and that the Bill in its original form really embodies the proposed amendments, and is intended to do so. That position has been taken up by the Minister in the present instance. The leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Illawarra have shown that the words in the clause that we desire to amend have already given rise to trouble. We have also had quoted a specific case taken under a similar provision, wherein the presiding magistrate gave a decision which some honorable members think he ought not to have arrived at, but which he felt bound to give, having regard to the wording of the section under which the case was brought. If it is not the intention of the Committee that these words shall be interpreted in the way that the magistrate in the case referred to interpreted a similar provision in a Commonwealth Act, surely it is reasonable to ask the Minister to remove any cause for doubt, and agree to make the intention of the clause clear. That, however, seems to be the last thing which a lawyer in charge of a Bill is prepared to do. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister is obscuring the real point at issue. In the case in question, the magistrate could have announced his decision without giving reasons for it. He might, without comment, have arrived at the conclusion that he was not satisfied with the guilt of the defendant, and that, in accordance with the practice in British courts of justice, he should give him the benefit of the doubt, but that, having regard to the wording of the section of the Act under which the prosecution had been brought, he had no option but to convict. He could have arrived at that conclusion without expressing the reason for his decision, and had he done so the justices in the superior court, not being aware of what -was in his mind at the time, would have had to uphold his decision.  I am as anxious as is any honorable member that trusts should be put down. I do not think that any section of the House has a monopoly of the desire to defend the public interests from injurious attacks by combines and trusts. It is, I am sure, the honest desire of every honorable member to do what is fair and right to put down trusts in order that the public interests may be safeguarded; but in the effort to do so we must try as far as we can to avoid inflicting injustice by legal methods. It is because of such a desire that the Opposition suggests to the Minister a certain course, the adoption of which can do no harm, .but will undoubtedly remove the element of serious injustice' which exists in the proposed section. I was astonished at the speech delivered just now by the honorable member for Hindmarsh. He appears to be willing to support any Government proposal, irrespective of its justice or injustice. </para>

                        <para>- That, I think, is a gross exaggeration of facts. It is all very well from the honorable member's point of view, as long as it can be set in operation only against those whom he and those associated with him regard as their natural enemies. But if such a provision were put in operation against a union or a combine of an industrial character to which the honorable member might himself belong, I venture to say that his views would undergo a radical change. - At the outset he desired to condemn as injurious all combines and trusts, and challenged the Opposition to point to a beneficent one. When reminded of the existence of trusts like that in connexion with the Newcastle coal mines, which members of the Labour Party, with whom the honorable member is associated, have always claimed to be a beneficent one, he shifted his ground. There may be a difference of opinion as to whether it is beneficial to the public that the price of an article of domestic use should be kept up by means of a combine, but there has been no doubt expressed by the Labour Party as to the beneficent character of the Coal Combine, which keeps up a monopoly price, with the special approval of the Labour Party, to the detriment of the public, who have to purchase coal from them. When this was pointed out to the honorable member, he changed his ground. Instead of condemning as injurious all trusts and combines, as he set out to do, he defended this and another combination, of which he is a member. There is no consistency in such an attitude. I refer to the incident, as showing how wonderfully flexible are the minds of some honorable members when they are called upon to view trusts and combines from an aspect in which they have either a political or personal interest. As soon as they are associated with it, it loses its injurious character and becomes beneficent. I do not defend trusts and combines, though I recognise that, under our complex system of industry and commerce, there is a natural tendency, and in some cases, perhaps, justification, for certain combinations. As long as these combinations exist without injurious effect to the community, not much exception is to be taken to them. The difficulty is to know what combines or trusts are non-injurious. Combinations, whether of labour or capital, made for the purpose of unduly inflating prices, are in effect injurious to the public, which has to pay more for the goods it purchases. It .is difficult to know where to draw the line between one kind of combination and another. There are in operation in Australia, and more particularly in Victoria, combinations which are decidedly injurious to the public, and which in the public interests should be suppressed. I find no fault with legitimate efforts for their suppression, so long as these are founded on recognised principles of British justice. The issue between the Opposition and the Government is not whether injurious trusts should be suppressed, but as to whether certain words in the Bill are or are not subversive of fair and just principles, and we have made a reasonable appeal to the Government to agree to an alteration, which, without weakening the measure, will get rid of some of its more objectionable features. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General has told us that the real purpose of the provision under discussion is that failure to establish innocence shall be evidence of guilt. If that be so, why not make it clear ? That is all we ask for, and it is going a long way from accepted procedure in our legal methods. If there is no intention to bring about a possible miscarriage of justice, such as in the case which has been referred to, which was due to the application of a precisely similar provision, why not get rid of words which are capable of being misinterpreted, and use words which will clearly express the intention of the Legislature? I would remind the Committee that those who helped the Government to impose high Customs duties are primarily responsible for the conditions which favour the existence of trusts. </para>

                        <para>- Some kinds of trusts exist there; but such trusts have not assumed the, dimensions of the trusts of protected countries, and are more limited in their operations. 'Legislation passed mainly with the assistance of the Labour Party is bringing about the conditions under which trusts best thrive, and, therefore, the members of that party are primarily responsible for the existence of trusts here. Having created this evil, they are assisting to pass panic legislation to deal with it. No doubt their object in creating monopolies is to give an opportunity for the nationalization of industries. They are supporting legislation which they say will be ineffective, with the avowed object of subsequently applying the principles of Socialism to the industries of the community. I shall support the amendment, and, if the Government accepts - it, our proceedings will be shortened, and the Bill will come into operation all the sooner. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot accept the amendment. The difficulty in prosecuting at the present time is to obtain evidence which will prevent the case from being non-suited. There are two ways of doing this. One is to throw the onus of proof on the defendant, and the other to compel him to produce his documents, and base our case on them. But it may happen that the agreement relied on is missing, or for some reason not obtainable, though obviously . in existence, and operating injuriously to the welfare of the community. We say that in that case, as the existence of the agreement is absolutely within the knowledge of the parties to it, who know its terms and conditions, there is no harm in providing that the averment of its existence shall be evidence, unless the contrary is proved. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The wording in the Bill' is the same as that of the Customs Act, under which there have been hundreds of prosecutions without injustice or hardship. Is there any hardship, or anything contrary to British justice, in throwing the onus of proof on the defendant in these cases? The rule of evidence is that where the subject-matter of a party's allegation is peculiarly within the knowledge of the other party, the obligation of 'disproving the affirmative is thrown upon him, although there are certain modifications which reduce the strength of that proposition. Phipson says that - </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing harsh in this provision, which is an absolutely necessary one, seeing that if we fail to obtain a knowledge of the contents of the agreements entered into by trading combinations, under the other clauses of the Bill we shall be in the position of shifting the burden of proof. There are many other authorities which I might cite in this connexion, some of which I mentioned last evening. But I may say that in the criminal law relating to coinage, to certain cases of forgery, and in the Explosive Substances Act, the principle of throwing the onus of proof of certain matters upon the defendant is distinctly recognised, because the matters to which it refers are matters within his knowledge, and it is easy for him to satisfy the Court of his innocence. I therefore ask the Committee to adhere to the clause in its present form. </para>

                        <para>- I confess that I do not understand its meaning. If it means what I think it does, it will be almost impossible to prove the guilt of  a  trust, and consequently it might very well be' eliminated. But if it means what the present <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs thinks it means, this clause certainly goes very much further than the Attorney-General invited the Committee to go during the course of his speech. I believe that if we make the averments of the prosecutor <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence of the guilt of the defendant, we shall compel the production of evidence by him just in the way that the Attorney-General suggests the clause in its present form will do. That, I think, is as far as most honorable members who are imbued with  a  sense of justice wish to go. In conclusion, I should like to know whether the principal Act was framed with the full concurrence of the Crown Law authorities? Did they advise the Government as to its efficacy ? I take it that they were consulted, because I find that on the 14th June, 1906, the Treasurer twice repeated the statement that the Bill would prove effective in operation. I presume that, as a layman, he would not have spoken with such conviction unless he had the concurrence of the Crown Law authorities. I think I am justified in asking the Attorney - General whether that is not so. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that the Crown Law authorities examined the Bill carefully, and were then of opinion that it would prove effective. If that be so, I cannot understand why the Attorney- General has not tested its validity. I think that he should have attempted to put its provisions into operation. Why should he wait upon the mere <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of one officer, who, however able he may be, is not infallible, and who only a few months previously was of the contrary opinion. I desire to give the Minister the power which he seeks, but in its present form the clause goes very much further than that, and therefore I shall support the amendment of the honorable member for Illawarra. </para>

                <para class="block">The words I propose to insert are those with which proposed section 15c commences. I am still of opinion that the Comptroller-General, as representing the Department of Customs, should not be called on to move in an important matter like this on his own initiative, on, perhaps, some secret or hearsay information, but that he should be in a position to require an informant to reduce his complaint into writing, and affirm his belief in its <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> by taking an oath. This would be a protection to an important departmental officer, who could not then be ordered by some political head to institute proceedings on insufficient evidence. If it be said that: the Customs Act gives similar power, I point out that there is a great difference between the exercise of such a power under an Act, as against combines and trusts, and its exercise for the enforcement of revenue. No doubt the Comptroller-General ought to be allowed, on his own initiative, to take action for the protection of the revenue, because that is in the interests of the public but, under the Bill, the action will be for the protection of companies or manufacturers, who complain of unfair competition. </para>

If we desire to enforce the law for the benefit of the public, we ought to have some person willing to take the responsibility of issuing; a plaint by taking an oath. If the amendment be carried, it will naturally follow that the opening words of the proposed section, down to the word "he," will have to be omitted. </para>

                    <para>.- Before that amendment is put, I desire to call attention to another matter. In proposed section 15A, there are the words, " shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary," and I think it would be much more palatable if the word " evidence " were substituted for "proof."' The words, as they stand, are a strong presumption ; and they might have a very serious effect in case of appeal. It would1 be almost impossible for an appeal to succeed, because the Court might say that, while there was some evidence to the contrary, there was not what is called absolute demonstration. </para>

                        <para>- That would be simply a plea of not guilty, and some evidence would have to be given on oath, or, in answers to interrogatories, to rebutt the presumption. No doubt, as it stands, the Bill does not intend the proceedings to be according to the ordinary rules of evidence ; and I am asking that those rules should be observed. Of course, I know that an amendment such as I suggest would weaken the force of the Bill, but I have too great a respect for human liberty to say that on every occasion </para>

                        <para>- Because, although at that stage a man is thoroughly satisfied in his own mind, there may not be sufficient evidence to justify a sworn declaration as to the truth of the complaint.I have made careful inquiries, and I find I can safely meet the honorable member for Bendigo by accepting the proposed amendment with the omission of the words " on oath," which would only prove an impediment to the administration of the Act. If a man makes a complaint to the Comptroller-General the latter must satisfy himself that a combine exists. If my proposal meets the view of the honorable member for Bendigo I shall be glad to modify the clause in the way I have mentioned, or the honorable member may move the elimination of the words "on oath." </para>

                    <para>.  - I am sorry that the honorable and learned member for Bendigo has seen fit to accept the offer made by the Attorney-General, because he has asked for a loaf and the Minister has generously offered him a stone. ' The amendment which the Attorney-General offers will not carry out in any degree what the honorable and learned member for Bendigo seeks to achieve. In the first place it will not give. him the advantage of a complaint on oath, because a statement which may be made in writing is not attended with any sanction whatever. There is nothing whatever to prevent perfectly irresponsible persons from making totally irresponsible statements. A statement made in writing will not carry an inch further than one made verbally. The offer of the Attorney-General not only does not give the honorable and learned member what he wants, but deprives him of something that is already in the clause. The Minister says that we have a safeguard in the provision that the Comptroller-General must satisfy himself. But if the words " complaint in writing ' ' are introduced they will afford a lax Comptroller-General who does not desire to exercise his discretion too rigidly a very excellent excuse for saying, " I have here a complaint in writing, and I am practically bound to act upon it." Their introduction at all events would enable him to say, " I have a complaint in writing and find it difficult to decline the responsibility which that throws upon me to have an inquiry made." A complaint in writing would not bind the complainant. In an ordinary law case it binds the plaintiff, because he has to prove his case or pay costs ; he takes upon himself the responsibility of proving his complaint. But under this provision some one may write a letter complaining that there is a trust or combine in some part of Australia, and on that he  9216 <inline font-style="italic">Australian Industries</inline> [REPRESENTATIVES.] <inline font-style="italic">Preservation Bill.</inline> has nothing more to do. The complaint may be false, malicious or fraudulent; it is certainly irresponsible, but the Comptroller-General will say, upon receiving it, " Some one has made a complaint. I had better have some inquiry or I shall get into trouble." </para>

                    <para>. - Iwichnowtogive effect to the view I expressed last night that we should remove from this clause as far as possible the purely political element and surround by an additional judicial safeguard the very drastic powers which the Attorney-General purposes to take. I do not see why the Government should not proceed in these cases, as one would proceed in an ordinary civil case, to make interrogations. It does not detract from the powerfulness of the instrument to surround its exercise with judicial precautions and safeguards, such  as a Judge would' direct, and perhaps stipu-' late. We should not forget the tremendous nature of the powers given in the latter part of the proposed section. It is . provided that on the statement of any person in writing the Comptroller- General of Customs may require any person at all - not merely some one who may be connected with a trust - to answer any questions put to him, and to impose penalties for declining to answer any one of them. Such powers should not be put into the hands of a mere political and transient authority. We should proceed with the strictest caution and propriety, and I do not think we should allow the exercise of these tremendous powers except by the direction of a Judge. Without arguing the matter further, I move - </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot accept the amendment, because it would make the measure unworkable. We desire, when a trust is believed to exist, to get information concerning it, in order to prosecute it in the interest of the public; but, instead of the Comptroller-General, on a complaint being made to him in writing, which he has reasonable grounds for believing, being able to go privately to those concerned, to collect information, the honorable member proposes that there shall be a strictly legal procedure, an affidavit being filed and a summons taken out. In the affidavit the Crown would have 'to state all the circumstances in its knowledge, which would be filed, so that every one would know the information upon which it was acting, and then it would have to put before the Court what facts . it had gathered, the name of the person who made the complaint, the offence alleged, and other material, to obtain permission to put certain questions. </para>

                        <para>- The Inspector of Factories has power to require the production of all pay-sheets, books, &amp;c. These are very extensive powers, and necessarily so, ' because it is in the interests of the public that he should be clothed with them, notwithstanding that they appear to constitute an interference with the liberties of the individual. The procedure suggested by the honorable member for Parramatta would be cumbersome and harassing in the extreme,, and would make the clause practically unworkable. Consequently, I cannot accept it. The position is altogether different from that which arises under an ordinary civil action. </para>

It can further require them to .adopt a uniform system of accounts, and it can prescribe the form of such accounts. Under the Act of  1.906  these reports must be made on oath, and the Commission has access at all times to accounts, records and memoranda. It may employ special agents or examiners, and it has power to examine all records, accounts, &amp;c, kept by carriers. These are very extensive powers. </para>

I am surprised at honorable members opposing the amendment, especially when it has been shown that under this clause a fruitful soil, in which the microbe of corruption may thrive, will be provided. We do not wish to import American methods into our Australian legal processes. We do many peculiar things in this Chamber ; but the proposal of the Government, if carried, will certainly be one of the most objectionable we have ever dealt with. If an official happens to be amenable to bribery, a splendid opportunity is presented for him to enrich himself in a very short time, though I am happy to say, so far as my knowledge goes, that we have a very honest and trustworthy set of officials. </para>

All that is made public' is the affidavit, and the Judge may do as he likes afterwards with regard to the necessary interrogations. These interrogations may be made secret or not, just as the Judge pleases ; and who is better qualified to decide? Then the Attorney-General contended that under the amendment it will be necessary to make the complainant's statement public; but I do not see why a man who makes what amounts to a criminal charge should be afraid to have that charge made in open day. But if the complainant does not desire his name to come before the public, it need not be made public, because the Attorney-General is master of his own actions, and may treat the matter in any way he chooses after the information has been conveyed to him. The amendment only compels the Attorney-General to go to the Judge for direction and authority to make the interrogations ; in short, all the amendment does is to place these trusts and their proceedings under the public eye, rather than permit the possibility of their </para>

                    9221 working their sweet will in secret as they have been permitted to do in so many parts of the world. As the honorable member for Flinders has said, it is when such matters are dealt with in secret that evasions and contraventions of the law take place. There is safety in publicity, and the amendment only insures that degree of publicity and those judicial safeguards which are necessary in the institution of criminal proceedings.

                    <para>.- I was not present to hear the reasons advanced by the honorable member for Parramatta for this amendment, but I am satisfied that he is as anxious as any one to restrict detrimental trusts and combines. At the same time, I know that he runs the great risk of proving a friend of trusts and combines. The only reason 1 have heard in favour of the amendment is that without it there will be danger of corruption; but I point out that that danger exists to-day in regard to our Customs administration. The Comptroller-General may now bring merchants before him, for the purpose of obtaining information from them, so that there is just as much opportunity for corruption under the Customs Act as under the proposed Bill. </para>

I agree that there are detrimental combines in the country, and that they are a growing evil. We do not blame those who take advantage of this phase of the capitalistic system, but Parliament will be to blame if the danger is allowed to <inline font-style="italic">go on</inline> and grow. The whole of this legislation" is an innovation; but we pass measures to-day that forty years ago, or even twenty years ago, would not have been possible; and ten years hence there will be legislation that we should be afraid to touch now. The development of Australia must keep step with the practices and artifices of capitalists in all parts of the world; and the only protection the public have is that provided by Parliament. I am prepared to give the Government the full powers for which they ask, and to throw on them the responsibility of exercising them. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so, if it should prove necessary to do so. The right honorable member for Swan took an attitude in regard to legislation of various kinds ten years ago in Western Australia, that he would not be prepared to take to-day, because he knows that the ideals and claims of the community have advanced. As to any fear of corruption, we are singularly fortunate in the fact that the Judicial Bench, both Commonwealth and State, is absolutely Tree from suspicion, and I think the same may be said of all our high public officials, against none of whom have I even heard a serious charge suggested, much less proved. Inspectors-General of Police at present exercise powers quite as stringent as those it is proposed to give to the Comptroller-General, but we never hear of any complaint, except perhaps from criminals, that these powers are corruptly exercised, or that the freedom of citizens is interfered with in any way. On the Government lies the responsibility. </para>

                        <para>- It would be impossible to obtain information unless this power of inquiry existed. It is difficult to obtain information with respect to the operations of trusts unless it be secured from the parties interested. I take it that that is why the Government have not been able to launch prosecutions under the principal Act. The honorable member for Parramatta, like me, believes that there is in Victoria a combine that is detrimental to the retailers and consumers to whom its operations extend. The Government are unable, however, to take action against it under the principal Act, and the Attorney-General now asks for these additional powers. If a trust is not of a harmful character, why should it fear a proposal that its representatives shall appear, if required, before the Comptroller-General? </para>

                    <para>. - I am surprised at this sudden change of front on the. part of the Opposition. At the outset, we were told by them that the Government were seeking power to drag honest people before a sort of inquisition, where they would not have a chance of clearing themselves. It was said that the Bill provided that persons charged with an offence under it- should be held to be guilty before their guilt had been established, and, in short, that they should be treated as criminals. We are now told by the Opposition that the Government, and those who support them, propose to place members of a trust or combine in a position where they will be able to corrupt the administrators of the Act, and that it is not safe to permit these honorable men, who would not do anything harmful to the public interest, <inline font-style="italic">to \y=.</inline> brought into contact,  privately,  with those charged with the administration of the law. Such a change of front on the part of the Opposition serves to expose the  fallacy of their objections to the Bill, and I rose only to emphasize that point. </para>

                    <para>.- Some remarks made by the honorable member for Dalley, were not quite in accord with the object of the amendment now under consideration. That amendment will not in any way lessen the powers given to the Government under the clause as it now stands; it merely proposes that they shall be exercised in the light of day and that there shall not be anything in the shape of Star Chamber proceedings. The Bill relates to trusts, and in dealing with such gigantic combinations as the Government may have to cope with under this provision, the more publicity (we have '.the better. . It is said that opportunity makes the thief, and I do not believe that we should give more opportunities than we can avoid to gigantic trusts to bribe or corrupt officers who have to deal with them. In speaking in this way, I do not desire to cast the slightest reflection upon the Comptroller-General or any of the officers of his Department. We are now legislating for the future, and we can readily see how easy it would be for such a combine, as, for instance, the Standard Oil Trust on learning that a Comptroller:General proposed, as the Bill now provides, to make inquiries in secret, concerning its operations, to put down a bribe that would tempt almost any man. </para>

                        <para>- That is another matter that needs to be borne in mind, and serves to emphasize the demand for publicity. I do not think that we should give power to conduct these inquiries in secret. We know what is done in America where blackmail is often levied by Government officials, and we wish, as far as possible, to avoid the possibility of any officer squaring a case behind the backs of the people or the Legislature. In that respect alone, we find a very strong argument in favour of conducting these inquiries in public. It is necessary that the proceedings for which the Bill provides should be fair to both parties. There should be a feeling of absolute freedom from political bias - a sense of security such as would be given by a provision that these" preliminary inquiries shall be made under the order of a Judge. If they are conducted at the whim of a Comptroller-General, or a Minister, there will be possibilities of persecutions, instead of prosecutions, taking place. ' By the adoption of the amendment we shall have, at all events, an assurance that all proceedings will be above board, and free from political bias, or influence of any kind. For these two very strong reasons, I propose to vote for the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that the honorable member will allow me to have an opinion upon even the effect of my proposal. Its effect will be to change every inquiry under this provision from a political into a judicial one. It will not lessen the prosecuting power; it will affect that power only by purifying it and eliminating from it the (political element. May I remind honorable members of some scenes that have occurred in this chamber during the passing of the Tariff. Have they not seen Ministers rise in their places, and exhibit all the animus and bias of bitter political partisans against large firms ? Such a Minister is not a proper person to conduct a judicial inquiry into the <inline font-style="italic">bonafides</inline> of either a trust, or an individual. When men have criminal charges laid against them they should not be submitted to Star Chamber interrogations by. a Minister full of political bias and animus, and susceptible to the party influences of this Chamber. The amendment will not interfere in the slightest degree with the quality of the power proposed to be given ; we merely seek to purify it, and so to strengthen it for the purpose in view. </para>

                    <para>. - I am prepared to admit that there are harmful trusts in Australia, and I agree with those who say that we should endeavour to make our legislation effective. Prevention is better than cure, and we need some fairly drastic provisions to enable the evil to be coped with. At the same time I do not think that there is any necessity to go to the length proposed by the Government. The amendment might fairly be accepted. lt must be clear to Ministers that honorable members generally are .opposed tr&gt; trusts and combines of a harmful character, and if it be proved later on that this amendment does not go far enough, I, for one, shall be prepared to give the Minister further power. The Minister, so far as I have heard him, has not shown that the operation of trusts in Australia justifies the innovation in our judicial system which the Bill proposes. The measures goes far beyond any legislation in the United States." Although the American trusts have gone to great lengths, and  President  Roosevelt's latest message to Congress contains startling allegations concerning the purchase by these combinations of newspapers, of political officers, and even of State Parliaments, no Act has been passed there so "drastic as the measure before us. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but there is no need to administer a stronger dose than is required. In my opinion, ;the amendment goes sufficiently far. Under the Bill as it stands, the Comptroller-General of Customs may enter the office of any company, overhaul and make extracts from its papers and books, and question any one connected with it, to get evidence to justify a prosecution. Such a power is too great to give to that officer, and its existence would have a very damaging effect upon private enterprise. It is complained now that, although there is plenty of money in Australia, capitalists seem frightened to invest largely in enterprises employing labour, and the Bill, if passed as it stands, would increase the present uneasiness. If, however, the amendment be agreed to, all cases will have to be dealt with in the light of day, and that in itself should have a deterrent effect upon trusts. 1- shall support the amendment because I think that if it is passed, the Government will have sufficient power to bring to justice combines whose operations are harmful to Australian interests. </para>

                    <para>.The power to legislate in respect of combines and trusts applies under' the Constitution only to such as are trading with other countries or between the States, and does not apply to those whose operations are confined to any one .State. The fact that the Government, notwithstanding its declaration that these evils are rampant in Australia, has not caused one prosecution to be made under the principal Act, and now asks for further drastic powers, seems to me a confession of weakness. I should like to have more information as to the trusts which it is alleged are carrying on business to the detriment of the public. </para>

                        <para>- The Western Australian Timber Combination has been before the Arbitration Court, and has had its books and business overhauled several times;; but I do &gt;not think that this measure will interfere with it. If there are so many combines in existence in Australia carrying on their business to the detriment of the public, surely the ' Gover'nment might have picked out some particularly glaring case to prosecute, before asking for additional powers. Coming' to the proposed section more particularly under discussion, I wish to say that we ought not to give undue encouragement to irresponsible informers. A man who has a good cause of complaint should not be afraid to complain ; but 1 persons should not be encouraged to give information secretly against trade rivals. </para>

If those who have grievances are afraid to say anything about them, they must hot be surprised if their complaints axe not remedied. Even the Bill requires the complaint on which the Comptroller-General is to act to be put into writing, and I suppose the document will not be absolutely secret. But is there to be no penalty -for making false and defamatory statements against innocent persons? The complainant should not be afraid to sign his name to the complaint, and io add the declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, it is true. He should not be allowed to divest himself of all responsibility. The great trading institutions of the country, and those connected with them, deserve as much sympathy and support  from this House as any other section of the community. The traders do much for the development of the Commonwealth. But in some quarters it seems to be thought that they should be left open to anonymous attack, and subjected to annoyance on mere hearsay or gossip, and have no means of redress. </para>

                        <para>- It may be that the complaint would "be lodged by a business rival at least as strong as the Trust complained of. I am in sympathy with the desire to protect the public against combines and trusts which are detrimental to the common weal ; but we must not act unjustly .; we must not unnecessarily harass them in the "conduct of their business. Another point which occurs to me is that we have had a good deal of this class of legislation, and it certainly has borne very little fruit. We have not found out any persons committing these offences against the public, and it seems to me, therefore, that the evil has been greatly magnified. Otherwise we should surely have detected some one of the offenders. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member must think that he possesses great power if he imagines that he exercises any influence over me. I do not think that we require too much of this class of legislation unless some very good cause exists for it. We have been told that the provisions of the principal Act relating to trusts and combines are more drastic than are those to be found in- any other part of the. world, and yet we have nothing to show for them in the way of prosecutions. I do not know whether a large number of prosecutions will take place immediately this Bill becomes law, but I do say that even if under the Constitution we possess the power to do what the Bill seeks to do, we ought not to exercise it unless there is grave necessity for doing so. We do not need to enact more drastic legislation than has been found necessary in the older and more  densely  populated countries of the world. I am quite with the Attorney-General in his desire to safeguard the public interests, and I will assist him as far as I can. But so far I have not heard anything but general statements- </para>

                    <para>.- The motives actuating honorable members in their attitude towards this clause resolve themselves under two headings. Honorable members who do not agree with the amendment of the  deputy  leader of the Opposition are chiefly anxious that any person who is interested in trade and who wishes to give information to the Government concerning a combine whose operations are detrimental to the public, is adequately protected. I hope that that is a fair way of putting the views of honorable members opposite. Upon the other hand, supporters of the amendment are mainly actuated by a fear that if proceedings against a trust are not openly initiated, opportunity will arise for the same class of corruption that has .disfigured American history. </para>

                        <para>- I will deal with that point presently if the honorable member still wishes me to. So far as the person's who desire to give information against a trust are concerned, let them forward that information to the Minister in the way that he proposes. But if the Comptroller-General of Customs or the Minister who directs his action wishes to get into communication with a trust, let the necessary proceedings originate in a Court of justice, so that the organization, which has so many hundreds of thousands of pounds at its disposal as hush money, may be compelled to have its case publicly tested. The Parliament and people would thus know that proceedings had been initiated, and the likelihood of corruption to stop proceedings would thus be rendered more remote. Surely we ought to be able to fashion the clause on the lines which I suggest. </para>

                    <para>.- The originator of any prosecution of a trust under the clause in its present form and: under the amendment of the honorable member for Parramatta, will be the Comptroller-General. I wish to point out to those honorable members who fear that under the clause our officials might be corrupted, that that corruption could take place just as easily under the amendment. The clause provides - even in the form in which the honorable member for Parramatta desires to amend it - that upon a. well-founded complaint the Comptroller-General can take certain action. The honorable member for Nepean has cited the case of the Standard Oil Trust, and asked us to suppose that a similar trust existed in New South Wales. The mere fact that a combine had attained such dimensions would be sufficient evidence of its existence. The retailers would know all about it, as would also the consumers. That being so, after a complaint had been lodged with the Comptroller-General, he could not refuse to act upon <inline font-style="italic">it.</inline> The larger a trust is, the more apparent will it be to the general public, who will then protect themselves by compelling the Comptroller-General to initiate proceedings against it. The right honorable member for Swan objects to the drastic character of legislation of this kind, but he has been a member of most of the Federal Ministries, and, as. such, assisted in initiating the legislation under consideration, so that his lament about injuring traders and so forth is a. little belated. </para>

The honorable member for Moreton brought under the notice of this House a Shipping Combine which prejudicially affected the butter industry of Australia, he on one occasion moving the adjournment of the House on the question ; and the Government, of which the right honorable member for Swan was a member, proposed a mail contract which provided against excessive charges on produce, so that producers might be placed on level terms with the Combine. As to interrogatories, the honorable member for North Sydney will admit that Australian insurance companies and banking companies, who seek to do business in the United States, are subject to more drastic investigation than that for which the Bill provides. </para>

Last night the honorable member asked me whether it was intended that "Answer questions " should have reference only to the alleged offence, and I told him that that was so, promising that I would reconsider the drafting in order to see whether that intention was fairly carried out. If the honorable member looks at the definition of "Answer questions," in clause  2,  he will see that the person must answer all questions " on the subject mentioned." That does not mean on any subject mentioned by the Comptroller-General, but the subject mentioned in the proposed section to which' the interpretation applies. The words " answer questions " in the proposed section  15B,  means that a person may be required to answer questions with reference to the subject mentioned, and the subject mentioned is the alleged offence. I have put the matter again before the Draftsman ; and I think it clear that the. meaning is what I have stated. </para>

                        <para>- That may be; but I am going to try to assist its approach a little. The Minister has distinctly stated that only questions in regard to alleged offences will have to be answered and documents relating to them produced. Why should we not say so in the clause? I propose to make the point absolutely clear by the insertion of the words "relating thereto" after the word " documents." </para>

Then, again, in the event of absolutely groundless charges being laid against an individual, and the latter being put in consequence to great expense, would he have any remedy ? He certainly would have no remedy against the party giving information, and in some cases it may be desirable that there should not be a remedy against him. There is no recourse against the officer, and I desire to know, therefore, whether there is any remedy against the Government. We know that animosity against particular firms or individuals have manifested themselves in Parliament. Charges are often made recklessly in Parliament, and are found on inquiry to be untrue or exaggerated. A desire is exhibited to make things as uncomfortable as possible for a particular firm or individual, and the only check against acting on groundless charges, involving the parties complained of in considerable expense, is a liability to pay damages. A section of a Parliament having, for some reason or other, an antipathy to a particular firm or individual, in the absence of such a liability, would take care that a complaint was laid against that firm or individual for an offence under the Act. When that complaint was lodged with the Comptroller- General, they would urge the responsible "Minister to institute a prosecution, and if he were not a strong man or belonged to a weak and yielding Administration, such as we have seen too often, he would use his influence, or the influence of the Administration would be used, to initiate a prosecution.

                        <para>- If a certain situation demanded it, he might keep them back for a great length of time. It is said that the Comptroller-General will be independent, but as a matter of fact no permanent head of a Department can be. The head of a Department is often instructed by the responsible Minister to take a certain course. We have often heard a Minister say in this House : " I have instructed the head of my Department to take action. In the first instance, he did not think that anything should be done, but I have instructed him to take action, and my direction is being acted upon." That being so, purely political influences might be exerted as we' have seen them brought to bear out of antagonism to a particular firm or individual. I am not suggesting that this influence would come from any one section of any particular Parliament, but if it were brought to bear, it would lead to a complaint in writing being made, which would be followed by a demand in Parliament for the prosecution of the individual or firms concerned. To that demand a weak Minister or Ministry, in particular circumstances and conditions, would yield. A prosecution might then take place in respect of a case in which it is afterwards proved that no ground for the proceedings existed. In such circumstances, who would be liable? </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The complaint under this Bill does not initiate the legal proceedings. The Attorney-General if he prosecutes has afterwards to file his pleadings. The. answering of questions provided for is in respect only of the preliminary inquiry, and the question of costs should not arise in connexion with it. At the present time, any private person can write to the Comptroller-General of Customs, and we have had several letters so written, complaining of the alleged existence of combines. Moreover, honorable members of both Houses have publicly drawn attention to the matter, and an inquiry was instituted in one case, because of certain information thus made public, which seemed to justify it. </para>

                    <para>. - I have refrained from engaging in this debate because I feel that, no matter what arguments may be brought forward, the result will be the same. The serried ranks behind the Government are not prepared to listen to argument. They show absolute confidence in the Attorney-General's abilities and judgment by supporting him with, their votes without hearing the other side. In the speech which he has just made, he has shown a degree of simplicity such as is very rarely found in a lawyer.. He has stated, with praiseworthy candour, that, although the Bill may permit inquiries into the private and confidential communications between client and solicitor,' those inquiries are not likely to be made. I admit that  they are not likely to be made during his* administration. He may not have the wisdom of the serpent, but .1 am prepared to credit him with being as harmless as the dove. Still, we do not know who will succeed him, and we are legislating for the future. He evaded the objection raised by the .honorable member for East Sydney. Citing a passage from a law book, he showed that private and confidential communications between solicitor and client are privileged, and not to be inquired into. This privilege rests, not upon technical and fine .distinctions made by lawyers, but upon an inherent and fundamental principle of justice which has been recognised by British Judges ever .since we have had any legal system. It is held that a man must be protected in seeking advice, because, if his relations with his adviser are not privileged and confidential, he may be deprived of the opportunity to properly de-  fend himself against accusations. The Attorney-General has stated, very properly, that this privilege is not to be used as a cloak to cover crime. But he forgot to say that before it can be taken away, it must be shown that a crime has been committed If, when a man is in the dock, charged on a definite indictment, with a jury empanelled to try him, it appears that some communication' between him and his lawyer is one of the links in a chain of conspiracy, fraud, or crime, he is deprived of the privilege to which I have referred. But what does the Attorney-General propose? I can hardly allow myself to speak of this provision of the Bill, because I cannot express fully my  feelings  in regard to it. It is not brought forward to achieve any useful result, but merely as, a sort of political placard, to show a section of the community how far this particular Government is prepared to go to strike at certain persons, without regard to the ordinary principles of justice. I could point to several instances of the kind in the legislation of Victoria. This is what I might term poster legislation. It is so extreme, that it is not likely to be used, because the common sense and sense of justice of the community will prevent its use. </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend to repeat what I said on that subject last night. Probably the measures suited to the case of a man suffering from a raging fever would do. mischief if applied to a youth afflicted with some slight temporary ailment. If the privilege to which I have been referring is worth preserving, it can be preserved only by dealing with it in the Bill. As the measure stands, the Courts, in interpreting it, would have to say, "The Legislature gives unfettered and unlimited power in regard to the making of inquiries, power that is not limited bv the rules governing the admission of evidence in ordinary cases." As I have said, it would probably riot be used, because the common sense of the community would revolt' against such an atrocious thing. But it mav he used by an irresponsible officer, backed by  .1 Minister so weak as to yield to immediate political pressure, and its use mav inflict the greatest injustice, breaking- through rules which have always been considered necessary for the protection of individual liberty. </para>

The Postmaster-General must recollect how individuals who supplied information to the Royal Commission which investigated the working of the Factories Act in Victoria had to be sent away from Melbourne lest the highest legal talent available should be employed for' "the purpose of injuring them. He knows that that Commission had to request the press to suppress their names, because, had they been made public, the wealthy firms who comprise the friends of the honorable member for Flinders would have crushed them. On the present occasion, my vole will be cast as the  deputy  leader of the Opposition would have cast his vote len years ago, when he was more in accord with my views than he is now.

                    <para>. - In reply to the remarks of the honorable member for Melbourne, I wish to say that there is a difference of opinion between honorable members upon one question only. Those who support my amendment hold that a Minister who is full of political bias is unfit to wield an instrument of power such as this Bill will put into his hands. We are further inclined to believe that this measure will be an admirable instrument for political purposes. It will be of great service to the party in power. When honorable members in the Labour corner become restive, the Government will institute proceedings against a trust. These will be prolonged indefinitely, and, in the meantime, we shall hear honorable members opposite applauding the courageous action of the Minister in tackling these large combinations, whilst all the time the Minister will mean to do nothing of the sort. </para>

                    <para>.- When I last addressed the Committee, I foreshadowed an amendment which I intend to submit, and which there is no occasion for me to argue at length now. Under the clause in its present form, any person supplying the Comptroller-General with information concerning the operations of a trust will be safeguarded from the vengeance of that trust. I wish to insert a proviso which will insure that inquiries made of members of a trust into the affairs of any trust shall be initiated in public I can conceive of no better place in which' those negotiations can begin than a Court of Law. It is absolutely essential that, so far as we possibly can, we shall limit the ordinary opportunities that a trust possesses for bribing officials with whom it may be brought into contact. </para>

It must be remembered that this particular provision is not to be put in operation as against the trust or combine itself, but is for the purpose of obtaining preliminary information before proceedings are taken under proposed section 15c. In a great many cases we are not able to obtain evidence otherwise than by means of questioning individuals who have been more or less under the influence of a combine; and the object is to compel such persons to give information. </para>

                    <para>.- I am surprised at the attitude of the Attorney-General, because I should have thought he would have welcomed the amendment with open arms. I was much struck by the remark of the honorable member for Flinders, that it would be much more convenient to question the representative of a trust if he were safe in gaol ; and I think I may make a suggestion as to a method of torture which was suggested during the recent hot weather, and which, I think, would prove effective. It is . a method which I fancy was not known even to the Inquisition, but I think it could be applied to extract information from those who are brought before the Comptroller-General. When the heat was about 110 in the shade I discovered on the beach that throwing hot sand on to the back of a person caused considerable inconvenience and pain, and I suggest that the Attorney-General should consider the matter, with a view of trying this method in cases under the Bill. 'I think that the Attorney-General ought to accept this amendment.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HUTCHISON</inline> (Hindmarsh) [10.41]. - I am going to ask the honorable member for Wannon to withdraw his amendment. </para>

                    <para>- When the original Bill was under discussion, I urged that persons found guilty of a combination in restraint of trade, which is a very serious offence, should be liable to imprisonment. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> subsequently expressed the opinion that it was ridiculous to attempt to deal with trusts or combines by means of fines, and urged that imprisonment should be substituted for pecuniary penalties. He told us that the only other alternative was for the State to step in and take control; that he had found that the Meat Trust in New Zealand was so harmful that he intended to open State meat shops there. </para>

                        <para>- I said the other day that the great mistake which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> made was in allowing private companies to operate in New Zealand after the State had entered the field of insurance there. I ask that the amendment be withdrawn, because I should not like to see a man imprisoned against whom a serious offence had not been proved. The offence of merely refusing to supply to the Comptrollers-General certain information which might tend to incriminate the person giving it is not so serious as to warrant imprisonment, but if the principal Act were under review, I should have no hesitation in urging the Committee to adopt the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon's</inline> view, and to substitute imprisonment for fines in respect of combinations in restraint of trade. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> once 9234 <inline font-style="italic">Australian Industries</inline> [REPRESENTATIVES.] <inline font-style="italic">Preservation Bill.</inline> said, there is no difference between the action of a highwayman who forces an individual to give up his possessions and the operation of a trust, which forces from individuals something that they are unwilling to give. If the honorable member would propose a penalty, not of one month, but of five years in respect of certain offences, I should support him. My desire is that the punishment shall fit the crime, and I would give the justices a little discretion in the matter of ordering imprisonment under this law, just as they have a discretion in that respect under other Commonwealth Acts. </para>

                    <para>.- I compliment the honorable member for Wannon on the fact that he has seen fit to move this amendment, and am satisfied that he has a sincere desire to make the measure effective. I voted earlier in the day for a provision, which, in my opinion, would tend to make it effective, but the Attorney-General tells us that this amendment is not necessary, since the penalty relates only to the refusal to give information at a preliminary investigation. We have to remember, however, that a prosecution may depend upon the ability of the Comptroller-General to obtain information at a preliminary inquiry. The honorable member for Corangamite has suggested that the honorable member for Wannon is not sincere. A man who is sincere in any proposition that he makes can be submitted to no more refined torture than that of ridicule. When Pascal ridiculed the school-men, and when Voltaire scoffed at superstition, they indulged in the refinement of torture. I agree with those who say that the liability to pay a fine of <inline font-style="italic">£50</inline> will not prevent the members of a combine from refusing to answer questions or give in-, formation. My desire is to make this provision effective, and I hope that the honorable member for Wannon will not withdraw his amendment. </para>

                        <para>- According to the Attorney-General, there is no place for it in the Bill ; he says that it is unnecessary. The proposal to provide for a penalty of <inline font-style="italic">£50</inline> is absurd, seeing that in the Customs Act provision is made for higher penalties in respect of more trivial offences. It is all very well for -honorable members to attempt to throw ridicule on the amendment by suggesting that the penalty should be five years' or ten years' imprisonment. If I opposed measures of this kind, I should vote against their second reading. I should not attempt in Committee to take the virus out of them. I cannot understand the Opposition being opposed to the principle of a Bill and yet voting for its second reading, with the object of moving amendments in Committee that will take- </para>

                        <para>- In any case, the penalty may apply to all sorts and conditions of persons, not necessarily wealthy members of trusts, but possibly poor individuals unassociated with a trust, who may not be able or may decline to answer questions. A man may be asked a question today, and be fined for refusing to answer. He may be asked a question equivalent to the same one to-morrow, and be fined every time he refuses to answer it. I was surprised at the attitude of the honorable member for Hindmarsh towards the amendment of the honorable member for Wannon. He did not object to punishment by fine for refusing to answer a question, but objected to punishment by imprisonment for a month, and yet, in the next breath, he said he would be favorable to imprisonment for five years-for refusing to answer a question. This Bill is now deficient in only one or two particulars. It contains all the machinery of the Spanish Inquisition at its worst, and includes a Star Chamber procedure. All that is lacking is the torturer, the rack, and thumbscrew, and questions put by the public tormentor, to make it an absolutely complete measure worthy of the middle ages and the Spanish Inquisition. It is a marvel that those things have not been proposed, but I suppose the omission will be. remedied when the Bill comes back to us later. </para>

                    <para>.- I am rather disappointed in the action of the honorable member for Wannon. I looked forward the whole evening to his moving some amendment in which I understood that he was keenly interested, and which his party were determined to support with their full strength. It is rarely that we can congratulate the Government on successful resistance to pressure from friends in the corner, but I think we may safely compliment them on this occasion. Throughout the Bill we might safely have imprisonment penalties as alternatives to fines. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. If a person is asked to give information which will incriminate a trust, and if knows that by paying the sum of£50 on his behalf it can escape from the consequences of his evidence, what is easier than for the trust to hide the information which is necessary to the Department in order to carry but the prosecution?
