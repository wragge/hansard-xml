The Minister for Supply and Shipping and the Director-General of Labour and National Service, Mr. Funnel], proceeded to Queensland by air early to-day for the purpose of ascertaining whether they can take any action, on a Commonwealth basis, to assist in settling this trouble. So far, I have not received any report from them. </para>

Will the Prime Minister inform me whether the Australian Government has  considered whether the Executive is adequately armed by this Parliament to deal efficiently, and effectively with the problem created by these industrial disturbances? Is the Government satisfied that it possesses sufficient authority to deal with the matter? If not, will the Prime Minister introduce such legislation as he deems necessary to arm the Government with adequate power? </para>

                            <para>- The matter of the charge of 3i per cent, has just been explained by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. Because of the expense entailed in -carrying out administrative work associated with the supervision of investments in cases in which advances are .made by pastoral companies, they have been allowed by successive governments to charge a higher rate, of interest than either trading banks or the Commonwealth Bank. The maximum rate which can be charged by trading banks is 44 per cent. It has been claimed that certain organizations which make advances to borrowers, such as building societies and pastoral companies, are involved in more expense in supervising their investments than other organizations, and that is why they are permitted to charge a higher rate. However, that has nothing to do with the other, aspect of the honorable member's question, which was explained by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in his answer to a previous question. </para>

The term " Europe " is extremely broad, but I can say that it is generally thought that the political position has deteriorated.

                        <para>- I preface my question to the Prime Minister by pointing out that the Commonwealth Grants Commission, at its inception, had a more or less specific function, but that time and changing circumstances have caused it to evolve to a body .of authority and direction - a role never envisaged by those responsible for its appointment. Recent evidence indicates that at the direction of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, a sovereign Parliament has had to repeal legislation that has been passed by both Houses. In view of this development, and the present public prominence of uniform taxation, will the Prime Minister give consideration to the need for a full-dress debate on alternative methods for State-Commonwealth financial relations, not just to criticize the work of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, but rather to appoint a new body with more modern powers and functions? If such a debate is considered inappropriate or inopportune, will the Prime Minister give consideration to altering the constitution of the Commonwealth Grants Commission to provide for the appoint ment of parliamentary representatives on that body. As it appears that if the claimant States had adequate finance for their normal development much of the existing dissatisfaction would disappear, I ask the Prime Minister whether the policy of any Commonwealth Government operating under the uniform taxation system will be to ensure that the States shall have a balanced budget in each year following legitimate developmental expenditure by the States? Will the Government consider the replacement of the Commonwealth Grants Commission by a parliamentary committee to report to this Parliament upon State finances in each financial year? </para>

                        <para>- I did not know that the functions of the Commonwealth Grants Commission had changed very greatly over the years. It is perfectly true that the commission was appointed to determine the needs of the so-called claimant States so as to enable them to have proper financial resources for development, and I think it is true that changing methods have 'been applied to the work of the commission over the years. Generally speaking, honorable members devote very little attention to the annual reports of the commission when they come before the Parliament or to the appropriation measures which provide for grants to the States. Usually there is very little debate on these subjects. The annual reports of the commission are amongst the most informative documents ever presented 'to this House, but I have a belief that very few honorable members read them. They contain all of the information that honorable members could wish about the financial needs of the less populous States. The answer to the suggestion that a parliamentary committee be established to take the place of the Commonwealth Grants Commission is " No ". That would not be desirable. In answer to the question whether a debate should take place in the Parliament on the subject of the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the States, I point out that the tabling of the commission's reports and the presentation of appropriation measures providing for grants to the States give honorable members full opportunity to discuss that subject if they wish to do so. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the fact that secret Communist agents in Canada sold their country's vital secrets to the Russians, that Communists in Australia extend a greater loyalty to a foreign power than they deem necessary to render to their own country, played a traitorous role in Australia during WorldWar II. before Russia was attacked by Germany, and would do so again if war should come between Russia and the western countries, I ask the Prime Minister whether it is true that Communists in Australia propose to organize obstruction to the guided weapons testing range project in Central Australia. If so, does the Government propose any longer to treat the Communist party as an ordinary political group? If it does not propose to do so, will the Prime Minister immediately reimpose the ban that was applied to the party in Australia during World War II. but which was lifted in 1942 by the Labour Government then in office? </para>

                            <para>- What the Attorney-General said and what I say now is that certain people - whether they were Communists or non-Communists I do not know - threatened to interfere with, or to place a black ban upon, work at the testing range. Legislation was introduced at the time to take care of that. Apart altogether from Communists, I understand that some very reputable members of the community entered strong protests against the construction of the rocket range. Constant scrutiny of all persons associated with national and governmental works is exercised by the Commonwealth Investigation Service. With regard to the second part of the honorable member's question as to whether the Government intends to declare the Communists an illegal body, the Government has previously indicated that it does not propose to place bans on any class of political philosophy or thought. </para>

The statement added that the Government was determined to prosecute industrial lawbreakers. Has he seen the statement in the press this morning that the National Executive of the British Labour party declared yesterday, " Communists are the enemies of all who will not surrender unconditionally to them"? Since the Socialist parties of New Zealand and Great Britain have now at least clearly stated their hostility to communism and in view of the Australian Communists' serious threat to the Australian economy and way of living, will he now consider similar firm action by the Australian Government to counter their foreigninspired efforts? . </para>

I ask this question at the request of hospital boards in my electorate, whose members have informed mo that considerable delay occurs in the payment of fees by the Repatriation Commission in respect of ex-servicemen treated in their hospitals. I received to-day particulars of a case in which the hospital board concerned has been waiting for over five months for payment of fees for an accepted repatriation patient, and I am prepared to supply them to the Minister. </para>

As this substance deteriorates in strength if kept for any period, it is difficult to ensure that on arrival in Australia it will be sufficiently strong to be of use for the relief of cancer sufferers. If it proves to be possible to import radioactive iodine in a suitable condition, it will be used in cases where it is considered desirable to do so. </para>

                            <para>- With the concurrence and permission of the Prime Minister, I wrote to the right honorable P. J. Noel-Baker, the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations in the United Kingdom Government, a letter dealing with the question of the transfer of population and industries from Great Britain to the Dominions. In the absence of the Minister, the letter was opened by an official of the Commonwealth Relations Office. Mr. Noel-Baker was attending a conference at Lake Success in America at the time and returned to England only a week ago. Part of the contents of the letter was disclosed to the press by this official, who said that the questions to which it referred were of major importance and that a decision upon them could be taken only at the highest level, namely, by the British Cabinet. I did not disclose that I had written the letter. I have not yet received a reply from Mr. Noel-Baker, but I am anxiously awaiting it so that I may discuss the matter with the Prime Minister and take it to Cabinet. It is unfortunate that even a part of a letter of such importance should have been disclosed to the press, before I had an opportunity to discuss it with my colleagues in the Cabinet. I assure the honorable member that the matters are of great importance, but it would be improper for me to disclose the contents of the letter until a reply has been received from the United Kingdom Government. </para>

Is that report correct ? If so, is it the intention of the Government to permit all Ministers to deal directly with British Cabinet Ministers without going through the High Commissioner? If that be so, for how long is it intended to maintain the office of High Commissioner? Has the High Commissioner any jurisdiction over officers of the Departments of Information, Immigration and Commerce and Agriculture and other government officials stationed in London, or have they all autonomous status ? </para>

                            <para>- All official communications from the Australian Government to the United Kingdom Government are signed by myself, in many cases, in the form of a letter. "Whilst many go through the British High Commissioner in Australia or through the Australian High Commissioner in London, it is also true, of course, that I, myself, have personal communications with the British Prime Minister, or other leading Ministers of the British Cabinet, on various matters. It is not intended that individual Ministers in Australia shall address official communications to individual Ministers in the United Kingdom. The practice that has been followed for many years will continue. The letter referred to was, in effect, a private letter addressed with my approval to Mr. NoelBaker by the Minister for Immigration. It made certain suggestions and asked him to think them over. Its purpose was to get his reaction. No official proposal was made to the Government of the United Kingdom, and I do not think anything wrong was done. </para>

Can the Minister for Air say in how many cases this has been done? Is it considered that these aircraft can safely be used for the carriage of 28 passengers? Have aircraft of this type recently been involved in accidents? What check is made on their loading? Are the passengers weighed in order to ascertain the exact load carried ? In view of the fact that less petrol can be carried with the heavier load, will the practice of licensing these aircraft to carry 28 passengers be continued? </para>

                            <para>- At the present time, three aircraft are licensed in Australia to carry 28 passengers. One is owned by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and two by Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited, which is also having another Dakota aircraft converted to carry 28 passengers. These 28-passenger aircraft comply with the safety provisions of the regulation, which are based on the all-up weight carried. In the 28 seaters, the seats are lighter and less comfortable than in the 21-passenger aircraft, and so a greater number of passengers may be carried. It is true that 28-passenger aircraft cannot fly such long distances without refuelling, and must, therefore, descend at more frequent intervals. It is not now the practice to weigh passengers before they embark. It has been found that the average weight of passengers is less than 170 lb., and this has been accepted as a working figure in most parts of the world. Thus, allowing a weight of 170 lb. for each of 28 passengers, and allowing also for their luggage, the total all-up weight of the aircraft is still below 26,200 lb., as allowed by the regulation. Therefore, there is no authority for preventing the conversion of aircraft to carry 28 passengers. I believe, as I have said before, that if there should be a mishap, it would be more difficult for passengers to get out of a 28-passenger aircraft than out of one fitted to carry only 21 passengers. The accident at Mildura has been investigated, and, although I have not received the final report, I understand that the accident is believed to be due rather to an error on the part of the pilot than to any defect in the machine. Thus, so long as 28-passenger aircraft  comply with the safety regulations, they may continue to operate. </para>

                                <para>- It is true that the application of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited for permission to operate a service over the routes named has been refused, and it is our intention to continue to refuse it. There is no justification for some of the suggestions contained in the right honorable member's question. It has been stated publicly that the policy of the Government is that international transport services operated by Australia shall be nationally owned. The additional trans-Pacific service between San Francisco and Sydney which Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited wishes to operate is covered by a bilateral agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the UnitedStates of America. The agreement stipulates that each government shall provide the necessary capacity which might be reasonably considered as its share. The only agreement between the Governments of Australia and of the United Kingdom, the countries concerned with the terminals of the other two services applied for, provides for a regular service between those countries to be operated by companies already nominated. While an international agreement gives transit rights in many of the countries through which permission to operate is sought, such an agreement does not confer traffic rights. Attempts made to conclude an international agreement on traffic rights have so far been unsuccessful. Although these companies are not operating over the whole of the route now proposed by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, the question of the route does not alter the Government's decision as to policy, that is, that it will not nominate for international services, nor accept applications to operate those services, from other than its national airlines. The Government has nominated British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines as its operator, and it is our intention that that operator shall develop whatever capacity is considered necessary, having regard to the whole of the traffic offering. As to the suggestion that the Government is frustrating the efforts of certain Australian companies to establish airline services, the right honorable gentleman knows very well that if more services are provided than the traffic warrants, all operators must suffer some loss. It may be the desire of some people to see Australian Government airlines go out of business, but the Government will prevent that. </para>

I did not read the article appearing in the journal <inline font-style="italic">Aircraft,</inline> but I read a somewhat similar statement which was published in the daily press. Many flamboyant statements are made from time to time with regard to this matter; and the honorable gentleman has committed himself to one such statement in respect of what is happening in connexion with airways being operated by the United Kingdom. He asks me to reconcile that with Australia's policy. I made known the Government's policy when replying to a question asked earlier to-day. With respect to the losses incurred by two of the three lines operated by the United Kingdom, I point out that in the days when Imperial Airways operated, when, air traffic was much less than it is to-day, that organization was given large subsidies which enabled it to operate without a loss, whereas to-day the equivalent of the subsidies is regarded as a loss. </para>

                            <para>- I am not able offhand to furnish the honorable member with figures relating to the cost of the New Zealand scheme. I shall endeavour to obtain them. Inquiries made in New Zealand, principally by the Dominion Government, indicated that the scheme there was being greatly abused, though it was not suggested that these abuses and the consequent increased cost could be attributed generally to the failure of the medical profession as a. whole to carry out its responsibilities. Our advisors in New Zealand recommended that we should not adopt the principle of either medical payments or of hospital medicine payments as applicable to the New Zealand scheme. The Government thereupon decided to adopt a -different scheme from that operating in that Dominion. I do not believe that what happened in New Zealand will have any effect on the principles laid down for the application of a free medicine scheme in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know where the press got the information that 200 scientists are coming from Great Britain for the purpose mentioned by the honorable member. I assure him that the figure published is quite inaccurate. The number of scientists who will be coming to Australia for that purpose will be much fewer than the number quoted. There is a grave dearth of scientists throughout the Commonwealth and, indeed, throughout the world. Every country is finding great difficulty in obtaining scientists to undertake the research activities in dozens of fields of inquiry where their services are required at present. As many scientists as can be found to undertake this work in Australia are engaged on the guided weapons testing range. Should the honorable member desire further information on the matter, I shall be glad to supply it to him privately. </para>

                    <para>This problem is of such a nature and magnitude that, obviously, it will not be possible for me, in three-quarters of an hour, to adequately discuss the whole subject. Therefore, I propose to deal largely with the declining birth-rate. My remarks will be on a strictly non-party basis, and I hope that other honorable members who participate in this debate will follow my example. The problem is far beyond the scope of the operation of any one political party. The policy formulated must be on a national basis, and cover certain phases relating not only to the future but also to the past. We cannot afford to neglect the general development of our resources, nor the encouragement of immigration, but, above all, we must promote in Australia conditions which will tend to increase the birth-rate. </para>
                    <para>In the words of the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> our birth-rate is now alarmingly low. The decline is not a new problem, and is not peculiar to </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia. At present, the whole of western civilization is confronted with it. En Australia, the problem has become acute for several reasons. Our population is small, and in a world which is now experiencing so much distress and poverty, has a moral obligation to make the best possible use of the large area that we control. The gravity of the position was stressed recently by certain figures which the Minister for Immigration issued in connexion with the various age groups. From 1861 to 1945, the papulation figures for Australia showed an almost continuous decline. In the five-year period beginning 1861, the birth-rate per 1,000 of the population was 42.44. .In each successive five-year period it declined, until, in  1901-05, it was 26.35. In 1915,' it had risen slightly to 27.78, but in 1925 it had fallen again to 25.36. In 1940, the figure was 17.53. During the latter part of World War II., aud particularly since the cessation of hostilities, the birth-rate increased slightly, but. in general, the decline has been almost continuous for the last 80 years. </para>
                    <para>Earlier, I stated that the gravity of the situation had been stressed in figures relating to various age groups. That, of course, has a close bearing on certain policies of social services which we in Australia have adopted. According to these statistics in 1901 the number of persons per 1,000,000 over 65 years of age was 39,761; but in 1946 that number had increased to 78,870. At the same time, the birth-rate continues to fall, with the result that an ever-increasing number of aged and incapacitated people must be maintained by an ever-decreasing number of producers. This position is further aggravated by the fact that modern methods of organization, which mean that fewer members of the community can be actual producers even within the normal age-group. Social services to-day, in my opinion, stress the repair of our social fabric rather than the laying of foundations for a. new fabric. The social services that we do provide to promote family life and to ease family burdens do not help the large family to the same degree that they assist the small one. I have in my possession a copy of a lecture delivered in Tasmania by a woman who is herself a mother of several small children, and also apparently a woman of some humour. Dealing with this problem, she points out that it is the first and second children of a family who benefit from social services such as welfare institutions and so on. Beyond that number, she says, the benefits become increasingly difficult to obtain by the mother. The lecturer expressed this view - </para>

                        <para>The child endowment she will receive after the birth of her second child will really be financial help, since it is not unreasonable to expect a woman to be able to look after home, husband and two children. She will have the leisure to visit the ante-natal clinic (and what is the benefit of this if she does not intend to have more children?). She will take her babe off to the baby health centre, to have it weighed every week, and will fret herself into a nervous state if it loses <inline font-style="italic">$ ox.</inline> Then she will lose her natural milk supply, and will be advised to give it  Karilac.  She will come home and give it Lactogen, and proceed to deceive the clinic until heT baby is on solid food. </para>

                    <para class="block">This woman apparently has had some rather unhappy experiences with a public health clinic, although she has managed to treat the general situation with considerable humour. She continues - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>From the third child onwards, extra help is essential, and this necessity is aggravated with each additional child. Child endowment covers the financial strain of providing this extra help, and this leaves no actual financial gain of 7s. lid. per week, as it does to the small family. The 30s. per week received by the mother of five children will pay for twelve hours' help per week at 2s. Gd. per hour. Twelve hours' help in her weary drudging 112- hour week. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The woman goes on to say that the mother, with her extra hours of labour and reduced time of leisure, will have no opportunity to fake her children to a clinic and will not in actual fact derive the same benefit from the institutions provided for her assistance as will the mother of a small family. I would suggest therefore, that our institutions at present do not in actual fact give that degree of encouragement and assistance to larger families that they give to families in which there are only one or two children. We must, therefore, if we wish to increase our birth rate appreciably, give more protection to the larger family and overhaul a great many of the institutions which at present we accept as part of our economy. We must, then, I believe, look for . the reasons for the decline of our population. It so happened that when I first placed this subject upon the notice-paper, there came into my hands a book by a <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. "Wallace</inline> of Melbourne, who has made in that publication, a splendid attempt to cover the whole problem from every possible angle. He has endeavoured to employ scientific methods of survey to ascertain the exact nature of the problem, what remedies can be applied, and which factors are operating against an increase of the birth-rate. I must confess that I find myself in distinct disagreement with some of his conclusions.  His  interpretation of certain aggregations of fact are a little outside the realm of reason; but, in general, I warmly commend this book, which is entitled <inline font-style="italic">Women and Children First,</inline> to all honorable members interested in the population problem. The writer lays the greatest stress, I consider, upon economic reasons for the declining birthrate. To a substantial degree he has my complete agreement in this regard, although I cannot help feeling that the economic aspect has been, and is being, greatly overstressed. The fact that the decline has been going on for so " many v years would support that conclusion. In all ageing civilizations, the same process has taken place. This leads to a further bolstering of the opinion that I offer. History shows that primitive civilizations have, as a general rule, very high birthrates. Civilizations which are strongly religious also maintain a healthy birthrate. Parents who are not able to provide all the things that they would wish in this life look to the life in the next world for these things, or, on a more mystical basis, they say : " The Kingdom of God is within us ". But in an age where physical well-being, comfort and other material standards have taken the place of those older standards, we must of course regard a declining birth-rate as absolutely inevitable. It stands to reason that, the larger the family the less can its members conform to the standards of comfort and entertainment of- present day life. I should suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. "Wallace</inline> that although his survey is on the right lines, it has been confined to a doctor's surgery where, inevitably, there must be a limit to the number of people with whom contact is made. He deals with people who seek his help rather than with those who are sought by an investigator. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. "Wallace</inline> suggests that the economic reasons advanced are purely valid in all cases. Possibly I am not accurately interpreting his views, but that is my impression of them. He says that those who suffered hardships naturally do not want hardship to be repeated in the lives of their children; that those who are comfortably off wish to give the same degree of comfort to their children; and that those who have achieved affluence do not wish to see- the heritage of their children divided into too many parts. That argument is true enough, but if we are to accept it as a valid reason, obviously we cannot get anywhere, because, those who are satisfied to-day with one standard of comfort will to-morrow demand another. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. "Wallace</inline> says that in his opinion the real reason for the higher birth-rate amongst the poor is the lack of knowledge of methods of contraception. Apparently the remedy that he would suggest for this situation would be to supply the poor with such knowledge. In actual fact, of course, the only constructive answer to the problem is not that these people should be provided with some means for the prevention of life, but rather that they should be provided with means to maintain the life that they will bring into  the world and responsibility for which they are quite, willing to assume. He discusses the problem of contraception at some length. He says many people believe that this is a major factor in the declining birth-rate, and, to a degree, it must take a very large share of the responsibility for the immediate position, although the root causes no doubt go deeper than that. </para>

I suggest that, having eaten of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, no ban imposed by any government is likely to take away from the people the potency of that particular weapon. However, I suggest that there is room for a reform by means of control of the traffic in these things. A ban could be placed on their sale to people not bearing some medical certificate or doctor's prescription. This would have the effect at least of modifying promiscuity among the young, and would also destroy the frequent advertising campaigns which tend to promote the sale of contraceptive devices. </para>

                    <para>One other problem has a distinct bearing on this subject because it, too, relates to insecurity, though not to economic insecurity. It is the general problem of divorce. Anything which tends to make less stable the institution of marriage must, of necessity, make less stable the institution of the family. As the stability of the family declines, so, of course, its numbers must decline also. However, I suggest that the real reason why there is a higher rate of birth in the lower income groups is that, in that section of the community, there is a less free acceptance of the artificial standards of to-day, and a greater appreciation of the simpler joys of home life. The problem can be solved, not by suggesting to the poor the use of means of preventing the coming of children, but by supplying them with the means wherewith they can lead happy and well-balanced home lives. </para>
                    <para>The whole current of modern life seems te me to have set definitely against motherhood and family life. First, there are the social customs of the day. Our methods of entertainment frequently take people beyond the home and generally involve the expenditure of money. There a re also the conditions which life in cities inevitably imposes. These conditions make it more and more difficult for normal family life to proceed. At present we have a tragic lack of transport facilities. One of the saddest sights in any city today is that of a mother coping with the inevitable daily problem of carrying to and from her home the commodities which must be consumed within it and the articles which must go out for repair from it, burdened with small children and fighting her way through crowds, often having the greatest possible difficulty in finding any means of transport at all. There is a lack of delivery services. These disabilities certainly arose from the war, but there seems to be very little prospect of services being restored now that war has ended. As one woman has put it to me, " We act now a? unpaid staffs for our butchers and our bakers ". I am delighted to learn that, in New South Wales at least, there is to be some effort to impose upon retail traders in the cities some obligation to make deliveries to families. </para>
                    <para>There is also a tragic lack of housing. What can a mother do to make a home when she is sharing a house with many other people? I have said before in this House that more friendships are broken and more family relationships are destroyed in shared kitchens than anywhere else in the world. Many young people to-day are having the greatest possible difficulty in maintaining happiness in their marriage relationships because of the infringements and the constant pressure of frictions arising from living in a house occupied by many people. There is, further, a shortage of children's clothing to-day. I have said that I have no intention whatever of making any criticisms of the Government as such, and I refer in all these instances to the effect of what I shall call national policy. Our present policy of price control is, in fact, operating against the family unit. Because of the system employed, manufacturers do not make clothing and footwear for children in such large, quantities as they do for adults. Prices are high in spite of all efforts to keep them low, and the quality is not good. </para>
                    <para>Within the last few weeks, I had occasion to buy a pair of shoes for a child eighteen months of age. I had to pay 13s. 6d. for them. Probably, becausethey happened to be of fairly good quality, they will last longer than domost of the shoes that are sold for children to-day, although that price is not unusual. However, .the child will have grown out of the shoes before they can give 13s. 6d. worth of wear. Thesethings are hitting very hard at family life. They make very difficult indeed thelot of the mother who is struggling to rear her family and to make her home aplace of happiness and rest. </para>
                    <para>There is a lack of domestic help. This is a far-reaching problem in relation to which, in the course of a report to theMedical Research Council in 1944 in conjunction with Lady Cilento, I gavecertain suggestions for remedies. However, there is not only a lack of domestic- help. There is also a lack of the means to pay for such help, if it were available. I should like to know what has happened to the " aunties " and the " grannies " of an earlier day. Where are the kindly neighbours of other times? We are inclined to talk as though the world progresses always and, if selfishness is mentioned in connexion with this age, we laugh. But there was an unselfishness in the past which made the lot of mothers much lighter than it is to-day. Those who criticize might well lend a helping hand. </para>
                    <para>Then there is the curtailment of trading hours. Once more I may seem to encroach upon party political problems. In this regard I suggest that, whenever a reform is considered, it should be considered in its relationship to the family, and particularly the mother of the family, in view of the vital need for a population policy. The present method of fixing the trading hours of shops imposes a very great deal of hardship on many housewives, but not upon the housewives of the well-to-do. It is upon those who lack storage space and refrigeration space in their homes that the real hardship of keeping sufficient supplies to provide for a lengthy period really falls. In all measures .of reform sponsored by the industrial movement, the emphasis is on the improvement of the conditions of the worker in industry, while the worker in the home is overlooked. I freely admit that this is only natural, but the two needs really should be considered as one. In fact, because of the vital necessity for the family to be maintained, the conditions of the worker in the home should even be regarded as of the first importance. In making any adjustment of working hours, I suggest that the needs of the housewife receive official consideration, because I believe that such consideration is absolutely essential. Furthermore, the whole problem of determination of the basic wage still remains to be  solved. Our present system must be overhauled, both in its theory and in its practice. The basic wage is at present determined on a theory which attempts to fit the family to that wage, instead of fitting the wage to the family requirements. The only satisfactory way to solve the problem is to ensure that the family wage is, in fact, a wage to maintain the family. We strike at the problem in various ways, and attempts have been made to solve it by the payment of child endowment. However, any effective attempt to restore the birth-rate by payment of family endowment must be based  on an increased payment for each extra child in a family, otherwise the whole scheme degenerates into a mere palliative. </para>
                    <para>Tn all the respects which I have mentioned it is the mother of a family who suffers the greatest hardship. However much other women are handicapped and subjected to difficulties, the difficulties and worries of a mother are intensified at. least three or fourfold. She is the one who really " feels the pinch " ; and yet she is the one who is carrying the life of the nation in her hands. Let me quote  from Eleanor Rathbone's book, <inline font-style="italic">The Case for</inline><inline font-style="italic">Family</inline><inline font-style="italic">Allowances,</inline> in which she states - </para>
                    <para>Children are not simply a private luxury. They are an asset to the community. But the community can no longer afford to leave the provision for their welfare solely to the accident of individual income. </para>
                    <para>I believe that any approach to the problem of providing an adequate family wage must en visage each child born, not merely as a unit of a -family, but as a very necessary component of the whole community. </para>
                    <para>Furthermore, the mother of a large family to-day suffers from a sense of social inferiority. I once expressed that view to some one, who replied, "You do not appear to suffer unduly on that account". Nevertheless, it is a fact. Of course, if one does things on -a grand enough scale one can get away even with murder. The fact remains that the mother of to-day who voluntarily sacrifices many material advantages in order to bring a family into the world, lays herself open to a charge of foolishness. Frequently, she is regarded with little sympathy; and that may be one of the reasons why she finds it so difficult to secure the neighbourly help to which I referred previously. We must endeavour to overcome that attitude by adopting means such as those which .1 have just indicated. Of course, there was a time when the mother's place of honour was the greatest in the community, but T doubt if that is so to-day. The false standards of glamour which prevail now have robbed the mother of her rightful place. There can be no doubt that many a poor, foolish and misguided young woman to-day is led astray by the frothy reading matter presented in the daily press, magazines and books which suggest that the only way in which she can hold her husband's affections is by endeavouring to maintain all the physical attractions of extreme youth. She knows that if she ventures on the path of motherhood she is likely to lose one or two of those attractions, but she does not seem to realize that there are still men who believe that a woman has attractions other than those provided merely by the accident of her age. I suggest to all young women that the gain which they make in their husbands' affections when they embark on motherhood, even on the grand scale, more than compensates for the loss of physical attractions which are made to appear so completely essential to-day. </para>
                    <para>I believe that fear of the physical processes of childbirth is insidiously instilled in the minds of women, and that the medical profession must assume some share of the blame. Members of that profession overstress the dangers of childbirth. Whilst they are naturally conscious of those dangers and must be fully awake of the remedies and safeguards provided by modern science, nevertheless, they are apt to repeat too often the story of those risks, and many women are thereby inclined to overlook the important fact that by far the greatest proportion of births nowadays are quite natural, and that modern science has provided many aids and safeguards for expectant mothers. Of course, it is a fact that the  mortality rate in childbirth cases showed no improvement for 30 or 40 years, and that it is only in the last year or so that it has shown a marked decline. In 1905, the mortality rate was 5.87, and in 1940 it was as high as 4.08- </para>

                            <para>- However,, whatever the cause, considerable improvement has been made, and I emphasizethat the cause of that improvement is not primarily connected with the hospital accommodation provided for maternity cases, and that is a point which I havemade again and again. The provision of a home-nursing service is vitally necessary, first, to provide an atmosphere of naturalness and of family living, and,, secondly, to afford expectant mothers thebenefit of their home surroundings, wherethose surroundings are of a satisfactory standard. I know that there are difficulties in the way of achieving that end, and I do not propose now to go into the whole subject. However, I am sure that" there are many cases where the provision of a home-nursing service would be a. wonderful boon. I am convinced that it can be achieved by a proper reorganization of our social services and the extension and improvement of our present hospital facilities. </para>

                    <para>What remedies are suggested to combat the decline of our birth-rate? I havealready said that, as part of an ageingcivilization, we are paying the penalties of all ageing civilizations. It is difficult toarrest the downward trend of a birthrate that has continued to decline for many years. The Australian birthratehas . shown such a decline under conditions which, speaking comparatively, were infinitely better than those obtaining in most parts of the world. Even if it were demonstrated that all these measures have noeffect in promoting the birth-rate in other - countries, I should still urge the institution of reforms such as those I havealready mentioned and others to which I shall refer later. At the very least, wemust ensure that justice is done to those who are prepared to undertake the responsibility of maintaining the life of the community. If only as a measure of justice, we must see that the production, of families for the maintenance of our- community life does not impose too great a hardship upon parents. I suggest, therefore, that those who have already shown themselves as willing and able to accept this responsibility should be given certain privileges that are at present not accorded to them. </para>
                    <para>I have already spoken of the need for an enlargement of our view of the purpose and final operation of child endowment. I propose now to say something about the marriage loan proposals. They are generally accepted as constituting an admirable scheme, and I believe they have a great deal to commend them. There is, however, a better scheme, incorporating the same basic ideas, to which I- believe preference should be given. The great need in Australia to-day is not for an increase in first or even in second births, although all births are desirable, and particularly the latter. The greatest need is for an increase in third and subsequent births. </para>

                            <para>- That is true, but they do not meet the needs of the situation as well as another scheme that I propose to mention. The figures in my possession show that the marriage rate in Australia has never declined, except for brief periods such as in the years of the depression of the 1930's. It has remained fairly constant and would appear to give no cause for alarm. There has been a decrease in the birth-rate, and particularly in the rate of births of -children other than first and second children. I suggest that the proposals for a marriage loan should be altered to provide for a loan to be granted after the birth of the third child. </para>

                            <para>- I should make it a loan, given under certain conditions. It should be on generous terms, with provision for the remission of portions of it, on the birth of the fourth child subsequent children. In i.hat way I feel that we should be ^getting at the heart of the problem and encouraging those who have already demonstrated not only their willingness but their physical ability to produce further children. It must be realized that there are people who marry but who are physically incapable of producing children, and those people must always be considered in relation to a scheme such as this. I believe that a provision like that could have nothing but a good effect. </para>

                    <para>Home ownership is, I believe, essential, and this scheme would make it more easy of accomplishment. . Our system of education should be revised and a compulsory place given to the arts of the mother and the housewife. Most girls eventually become homemakers, but even if they do not they lose nothing by having some knowledge of those arts. I go farther and say that boys should have some knowledge of home-making and home-keeping. I feel that it is sadly needed in Australia. This question of family life should be part of the curriculum in all schools, so that the children may be prepared for what is, after all, the main business of life in any community. We must -try to achieve a degree of adult education and must attempt by means of propaganda on the radio, in the cinemas and in the press to reinstate family life to the position of honour it formerly occupied. Our medical services for women must be reorganized. </para>

                        <para>It is strongly recommended, however, that the maternity hospital be separate from the general hospital ; this for several reasons. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The maternity hospital would be a centre in each district provided with modern medical equipment that was available freely to all mothers, whatever their financial position and from whatever doctor they were receiving treatment. The head of the maternity centre would bc an obstetrical or gynaecological specialist, whose services as a consultant would be available to any doctor at any time, free of charge. The whole of the maternity services provided would radiate from there. They would he, first of all, the hospital block, providing for the antenatal and pre-natal periods, and for the period of confinement. There would be a clinic and a domiciliary midwifery service. In addition, provision would be made for a home nursing service and for an ambulance unit fully equipped to give blood transfusions and to deal with all the accidents that occur during confinement, and that are so well known to the medical profession. In districts where there was sufficient scope there would be a medical school for the training of obstetricians and a nursing school for the training of nurses. There would also be a domestic training school for home helps. On some other occasion I hope to lay before the House the whole of the details of the scheme, but I suggest that in the meantime the Government might well study it with a view to providing better maternity services and a better future for mothers, thereby promoting family life and a possible increase in the birth-rate within a comparatively few years. </para>

                            <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) that there is no question confronting Australia of greater gravity than that of the national birth-rate, and I agree with her, too, that the stability of marriage is very much a factor in promoting a satisfactory birth-rate. For instance, in the United States of America, to cite only one country, the divorce rate has grown to such an extent that earnest thinkers there are appalled at the possibilities which the breakdown of marriages brings in its train. The honorable member spoke of the declining birthrate in Australia. It is not actually true to say that the rate is declining. As a matter of fact, it has risen in recent times. The improvement may not be permanent, but it is, at any rate, substantial as compared with the rate which prevailed from 1930 to 1940. There has even been an improvement as compared with the figures between 1940 and 1943. </para>

                            <para>- No, the percentage has risen, and the number of births has - increased. We are in thi9 fortunate position in Australia that on the figuresavailable - and I stress the qualification, about available figures because, owing, to the disturbed state of Europe, it is hard to get figures - Australia has the second best birth-rate of all countries in the world inhabited by people of European stock. The only country that has a better birth-rate than Australia is Holland. It will be observed that I make a comparison only with countries inhabited by people of European origin. Of course, some of the Asiatic countries have a much higher birth-rate. It is possible, also, that Russia has a higher birth-rate, but we cannot get reliable figures, or, indeed, any figures, from that country. The available figures show that we have a higher crude birth-rate than the United Kingdom, where the rate has been lower than that of Australia for some years. The Australian rate is also higher than those of Belgium, Denmark, France and Greece. It is substantially better than the birth-rate in those countries where the population was formerly noted for its fecundity, namely, Italy Poland and Portugal. </para>

                    <para>It is to be hoped that the Australian birth-rate will be maintained, though whether it can be is a matter of some conjecture. The information availableshows that in 1947, on the figures sofar to hand, the actual number of births in Australia was 180,000. Prior to that,, the greatest number of children born in Australia in any one year was in 1946, when the number was 176,379, representing a rate of 23.6 per thousand. That rate was the best since 1923 ; that is, for a quarter of a century, while the figures for last year were even better. The improvement of the birth-rate towards the end of 1946 can probably be attributed to abnormal factors such as demobilization and the withdrawal of women from industry, resulting in the taking place of postponed marriages. Until census tabulations of the female population according to age. conjugal condition, size of family and duration of marriage are available, so that a detailed analysis may be made, it will be difficult to form a reliable opinion as to the relative effects of the various causes underlying the present trend of the birth-rate in Australia, and to decide whether the pre-war decline of fertility has been arrested more than temporarily. The pre-war decline of fertility has been attributed almost entirely to the effects of the economic depression. During the depression, marriages had to be postponed, while people who ordinarily might have had children postponed their birth. The fact that the birth-rate has shown a decline in many countries in the latter part of 1947 is significant, but it would be impracticable, without further information, to indicate the likely level of fertility in 1948 and future years in those countries. </para>

                    <para class="block">Why the birth-rate should increase in desolated Europe is one of those phenomena which statisticians cannot explain, which baffles sociologists, and which is even beyond the speculation of psychiatrists. However, it is a fact that, wherever people of European extraction have settled throughout the world, the birth-rate suddenly increased during the war. It is true of rich and of populous countries like the United States of America, of war-desolated countries such as those on the continent of Europe, of countries like the United Kingdom, struggling for survival and revival, and of countries like Australia, where conditions are good and food plentiful. </para>

                            <para>- lt would appear to be so, and then, when peace is restored, and people become contaminated once again by easy living, they forget their responsibilities to society and themselves, and the birth-rate falls again. However, the fact remains that the birth-rate has risen ; but, unfortunately, children take a long time to mature. When the birthrate declines, the effect is not felt immediately - not, indeed, for a number of years. Honorable members may have read in that excellent production of the Department of Information, <inline font-style="italic">Facts and Figures,</inline> No. 17, that in 1940 the number of people in the age-group between fifteen and nineteen was 644,100. Businessmen, professional men, and all other employers of labour are finding it extremely difficult - indeed, almost impossible - to obtain the services of boys and girls between the ages of fifteen and nineteen. But bad as the position is to-day, it will become worse. Next year there will be only 558,700. In 194)0, there were 644,100, but by 1947 the number had dropped to 582,000. In 1948, it will be 558,000. It will drop in 1949 to 545,000, and in 1950, to 525,000. We shall not reach the nadir until 1951, when, we shall have a total in that agegroup of 516,000. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member should contain himself a little. I am speaking of the children in the fifteen to nineteen age-group who were not born between 1932 and 1939. Simple arithmetic shows that children who should have been born in 1932, but who were not born, will not be available in 1947, fifteen years later. I am saying that the decline in the birth-rate in 1932 was reflected in the number of fifteenyearold children in 1947. </para>

                                <para>- I cannot quote all the figures from 1931 to 1939, but I assure honorable members that we did not reach full employment in this country until Japan came into the war. The figures I am quoting now, as showing the reflection of the decline in the birth-rate, are such, that they must give anybody who wants to consider the problem seriously very grave food for thought. Even in 1956 we shall have only 578,000 children in the fifteen and nineteen years agegroups and, accordingly, we shall not then be in any better position than we had reached in 1933 or 1934. In the  intercensal  period between 1933 and 1947, the Australian population increased by 900,000, but some of the most vital sections of our people in the younger age-groups either did not show a proportionate increase or showed an actual decline. I am merely interpreting figures supplied to us by the Commonwealth Statistician, and I am not interpreting them in this way for the purpose of casting reflections on any one in connexion with the depression. Like the honorable member for Darwin, I take the facts as they are, examine them and form opinions on them. </para>

                        </continue>
                        <para>The honorable member for Darwin appropriately spoke of the lack of domestic help in Australia to-day. The shortage of domestic help has been brought about partly because of the expansion of our industries, which have attracted more and more girls into textile factories, woollen mills, and the like, taking them away from domestic service, and partly by the fall in the female birth-rate, which has been as great as that in the male birth-rate. That is one reason why in our immigration plans we are trying to bring greater numbers of young people to Australia to take the place of those who were not born during the depression, and whose absence to-day makes our problems so greatly felt. I am trying to bring a number of young people from Europe to fill their place. On <inline font-style="italic">General</inline><inline font-style="italic">Heintzelman,</inline> which brought displaced persons from Europe recently, the average age of immigrants was only 24. I hope that on the next ships bringing immigrants to Australia the average age will be equally as good. In these ships young women are greatly outnumbered by men, but we are hoping to attract more and more young females to this country. I hope that when we have satisfied the needs of all repatriation and general hospitals throughout Australia we shall be able to make assistance available to young mothers who need the services of domestics so that they may feel that their health will not suffer merely because they have performed a public duty in bringing children into the world. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member for Darwin has said that in many instances young women bearing children are scoffed at or made to feel their position. The first observation I want to make on that is that those who are most cruel to an expectant mother are other women, many of whom do not want children and will not have them. In the words of George Bernard Shaw, many of these people are "using the instrument of marriage as a form of legalized prostitution ". Motherhood should be ennobled and women with families should be as highly regarded in this country, and in this generation, as they were in earlier times. It was the spread of the doctrine of Malthus that nearly brought European countries to disaster in recent years. If honorable members seek an example of what a nation should not do in the matter of the birthrate, they have only to look at the unfortunate position of France. Had the Germans waited another decade or two after 1939 they need not have gone to war with France. They could . have spilled over the border into that country almost without opposition, because the German birth-rate was so much greater than the birth-rate in France. My second observation upon the fact that women who have children are made to feel that they have almost committed a crime against society because they have done their duty, is that men can play a great part in stopping that sort of criticism. Not only the ordinary members of society, but also State governments and municipal and local-governing bodies and other authorities could help mothers in many ways. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member referred to the burdens placed on the housewife by the struggle she has to undergo travelling in trams, trains and buses in order to pro. cure the requirements of herself and her family. There is nothing to prevent municipalities and State governments setting aside special buses, trains and trams, or portions of them, at stated times during the day, for women with children. In some States that is already being done ; but more could be done and more must be done to ease the burdens of mothers. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member also spoke of the shortage of housing. I do not want to indulge 'in any criticism of the housing shortage on party lines. "We have the problem and we must resolve it. It is a legacy of years of neglect. It was a chronic problem as far back almost as 1910, and little, or nothing, was done about it. I do not believe that Australia became home-conscious until about 1938 ; and .even now we are not yet building sufficient houses throughout Australia to meet the ordinary needs of replacement. Not only must we build for those who are marrying, but also we have to overtake the lag which some who have studied the problem estimate to be approximately 300,000 houses. </para>

                                <para>- Recently, the Public Works Committee, of which the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin)</inline> is a member, had occasion to investigate the subject of bricklaying in Canberra. The committee was told that bricklayers were laying only 300 bricks a day, but, subsequently, officials of the unions concerned were able to prove that the reason bricklayers were not able to lay more bricks a day was because sufficient labourers were not available. Consequently, in many cases bricklayers themselves had to carry their own bricks. In other cases, shortages of materials held up construction and bricklayers very often laid only 300 bricks a day, not because they were " going slow ", but because they were unable to get sufficientquantities of bricks. I do not excuse any one who " goes slow ", and I have no sympathy with any one who does not work to the maximum of his, or her, capacity while on the job in order to produce the needs of the community. We shall not get out of our difficulty until everybody works at a reasonable rate throughout the whole of the period they are engaged at their work. That applies to persons who occupy high positions as well as to those in lowlier positions.' This is a community problem. </para>

                        <para>The honorable member for Darwin also spoke about the lack of shoes and clothing for children. Nobody agrees with the high prices that are being charged for footwear to-day. Why the cost of footwear for children should be so high I do not know. I can speak on this matter as a father. My wife tells me that she has great difficulty in obtaining clothes and shoes for our children. Neither the Commonwealth nor the .State governments can be held responsible for this position. There is something wrong somewhere, and perhaps the explanation again is inability on the part of manufacturers to obtain sufficient labour to enable them to produce the quantities of footwear required to meet the community's demands. I believe that if we could find more labour, conditions, would be better; but I say this to the honorable member for Darwin: To-day our people, have at least got boots and clothing. There was a period during the depression when they did not have the necessary money to buy boots and clothing. </para>

                        <para>There are organizations in the community which for years conducted propaganda among working women and others urging them not to have children. They were told that if they had one child they could make him a university professor, ignoring the fact, of course, that in any community there can be room for only a certain percentage of university professors and that there must be a percentage of people to do all of each of the other classes of work to meet the needs of society. The effect of that propaganda was considerable; but those very organizations themselves are, to-day, alarmed at the success of their propaganda. They have even renamed their organizations. They now exist as societies for planned births. They tell women that they ought to have children, but not to have themtoo frequently, and that families should be limited in number. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member for Darwin also spoke about the shorter working week. I believe that the introduction of the shorter working week was a social and economic necessity, and the judges of the Arbitration Court, when they prescribed the 40-hour week, said that in most cases industry was making sufficient profit to be able to accept the shorter week. The fact is that a judgment of the Arbitration Court in this country established the 40-hour working week. </para>

                        <para>- As I revealed  in  my opening speech, conditions  in  New Guinea are generally unsatisfactory. This position is due largely to the Government's muddling and neglect. Although hostilities ceased nearly three years ago in that territory, this valuable area is the plaything of a government department and the  Minister  for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward).</inline> When other honorable members and I have voiced  from  time to  timecomplaints about  con- ditionin  Papua  and New Guinea, the Minister has replied with abuse,and expressed his disbelief. He would not agreethat anything was wrong in the territories. Perhaps recent revelations will convincehim of his error. </para>

                <para>The. administration which the Lyons Government set up in 1933 was suspended during World War II. That was natural, and the control of the territories was placed under the military authorities. However, local' government should  now be restored, in order that white settlers may have an opportunity to express their views upon the administration of their own affairs. At present, officials in Canberra control this rich and valuable area, and the settlers have many grievances. Unfortunately, they have no legislature in which their representatives could voice their complaints. Yet the white population of the territories is equal in number to that of the Northern Territory, which has a representative in this House and its own legislative council. Apart from the white settlers, there are. between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 natives in the territories, and we are responsible for their welfare. If we do not develop those rich areas, and govern them in the interests of the white settlers and the natives, we might ultimately lose them. The Australian Government asserts that its policy is designed to serve the best interests of the natives. I agree that the native population should receive the best possible treatment, but the Government has adopted the wrong approach. It believes that it is serving the best interests of the natives by increasing their wages by 5s. a week, and paying them compensation for their properties which may have been damaged during World War II. At that point, the Government's practical interest in the native ceases. I shall give to the House some information which should startle- the Minister for External Territories out of his inactivity, that is, if he has not already been sufficiently startled by recent revelations. </para>
                <para>It is possible that, at some time in the future, this territory will have its own native members in the local legislative council.  Fiji,  which has set an example to 'the world in this respect, is a triumph <inline font-style="italic">for</inline> British administration. The standards of the Fijians have been raised from those of savages - they were the greatest cannibals in the world - to the point where educated Fijians now take their place in a colonial legislature. This consists of an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. In the Executive Council, there are five official and *wo unofficial members, including the Governor. In the Legislative Council, there are sixteen official and fifteen unofficial members. Three of the European members are elected and two are nominated by the Governor. Five of the Fijian members are nominated. Three of the Indian members are elected, and two others are nominated. </para>
                <para>In 1933, the Lyons Government set up in the territory a similar administration, but did not consider that the natives at that time were sufficiently advanced to take their place in the legislature. The Chifley Government, which pretends to be most democratic, has abolished that form of administration, and the Minister is practically the dictator of the territory. With a few officials, he controls the whole destiny of the territory. White settlers, many of whom served in World War I. and who were evacuated when the Japanese threat became serious, have not been permitted to return there. For all the average Australian can learn about the local conditions, the territory might well be Siberia, Tibet or one of the countries behind the Soviet's "iron curtain ". The Minister promised that he would visit the territory. I wonder what has delayed him. He certainly made a fleeting visit some time ago, but he did not continue his journey into those regions where most of the trouble is occurring. A cordial invitation awaits him whenever he decides to proceed there, and to the timber districts. Perhaps he will inform the House, after his visit, what is happening in the timber industry in New Britain. I shall not refer here to another matter which might be <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline> Recently, I received a letter from a resident of Papua, who has spent most of his life in the territory. He is highly respected by every section of the community, and greatly loved by his native employees. He wrote - </para>

                <para class="block">I do not deny that the peoples of Asia should be given self -government. After centuries of rule in India., Great Britain has magnanimously granted self-government to Pakistan, India, Burma, and Ceylon. In Java, which is only one day's flight from Northern Australia, a civil war has been raging, and the conflict has been accompanied by torture, cruelty and misery. This overcrowded island, containing millions of people, is almost contiguous to our territories of Papua and New Guinea. Consequently, the possibility of a movement of population from Java to our own territories must always be kept in mind. </para>

                    <para>It is with the utmost difficulty and only after a lot of " red tape " that an old resident of the territories is allowed to return to his former home, or what is left of it, yet, a real red Communist is allowed a. permit, and has taken up residence with the natives of  Hanuabada  and is teaching them the ways of Communism and how to become a nuisance, which will eventually lead to inter-tribal war, as the small minority of natives at Hanuabada are thoroughly disliked by the other Papuans, lt is very much like the situation in Indonesia, where you have a small minority of semieducated natives, trying to lead a large population of uneducated, but happy people, into socialistic or communistic ideas, when already these large populations have their own social systems established hundreds of years ago. It is to be hoped communism will not spread to Government House as it is only a few hundred yards from Hanuabada. </para>

                <para class="block">I pause there in order to report to the House on activities around the model native village of Hanuabada. This, is the most sophisticated village in Papua. That it is to be re-constructed now at a cost of £118,000' does not compensate for the fact that natives around Rabaul are dying because of lack of attention. This " posh " village, with modern conveniences, is not required. Natives from this village are being employed in the vicinity of Government House and at Port Moresby. They are carried by motor truck to Port Moresby, where they " potter " around the gardens. The unfortu nate result is that they are neglecting their own horticultural and fishing activities to such a degree that they now depend on tinned foods from Australia. I have received this information from a prominent resident of the territory who lives near the model village of Hanuabada. These facts show how the Government believes in " petting " the natives instead of encouraging them to do the work for which they are best suited. This policy is spoiling them, and is making us ridiculous in their eyes. My correspondent continues - </para>

                <para class="block">This Government is hypocritically telling the people of this country that it is doing something for the New Guinea natives that has not been done in any other part of the world. Honorable members will recall that during the debate on the New Guinea Administration Bill in 1945, those budding  Wilberforces  on the Government side of the chamber told the Parliament how the Labour Administration was releasing the natives from slavery. They were unaware, obviously, that for many years the native population working for Europeans in those tropical areas had been well cared for under strict laws administered by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hubert</inline> Murray, whose qualities as an administrator were second to none. The Minister for External Territories will say, no doubt, that he has given the natives an increase of 5s. a week in their wages. He probably has, and no doubt he is also organizing trade unions amongst waterside workers and other natives in those territories. I understand that something of that kind is going on. But what does all that mean to these people? What they require is paternal care. The letter further states - </para>

Here again, the Papuan and New Guinea natives are being indirectly taxed. Apparently the rubberproducers are in an even worse position than the copra producers. In 1937 I went to New Guinea for the Lyons Government to try to encourage rubber growers toextend their plantations. That was doneand Australia was able to take all the rubberthat they produced, but I am informed that to-day most of the rubber plantations are beingabandoned largely through Government frustration and the unsympathetic treatment accorded to planters.

It. has placed the Agricultural Department on first priority, not realizing, apparently, that if the natives die off there won't be any peasant farmers. The only logical plan for the native races is to concentrate upon their health first, with hygiene, sanitation. Sc., and an increasing birth-rate. </para>

Copra production has declined very considerably although the world is crying out for f at3. Great Britain's greatest need is for fats. It needs them even more urgently than it needs meat. Animal fats have preference, but vegetable fats are also welcome, both in the United Kingdom and in starving Europe. A little more consideration by the Government and a greater measure of co-operation with New Guinea residents would enable copra production to be increased to a very high level in that great territory. The Government is giving the copra producers very much less than is their due. The Minister has explained that the Government takes a certain percentage of the price paid to the producers and pays it into a fund. Instead of doing so, it should give every encouragement to these men to increase production at this time of urgent need so that they could help the peoples of Great Britain and Europe. I could say much more on this subject. </para>

                <para class="block">Although it may seem to those who have no knowledge of conditions in New Guinea that the shortening of labour contracts will be of great benefit, actually it is detrimental both to the natives and to the planters, especially to the small planters. The big planter who can buy a flying-boat and use it to bring natives to his property from distant parts is able to  prosper.  Small planters whose plantations were selected because the land was arable and would produce coconuts, can only engage native labour often from distant districts for a term of one year. Just as the natives are becoming of use, their term of engagement expires and the planters' labour forces are dispersed. The shortage of labour is so acute that a number of small planters have already left New Guinea and returned, to Australia. .Some of the larger employers find that they cannot obtain native labourers who are prepared to sign contracts of service and are therefore engaging natives as casual labourers. When those labourers fall ill they are not then a charge on their employers. Nevertheless, most employers take them in and look after them. The paradox of the Government's plan to improve the lot of the natives is that it is working exactly the other way. Instead of employers having the full charge over their native employees, they are not officially responsible for their welfare under these circumstances. The consequence is that natives are not receiving the medical treatment and the attention which is necessary if they are to advance <inline font-style="italic">tn</inline> the  stage which we wish to see them attain. -My correspondent makes a specific recommendation in the following terms: - </para>

                <para class="block">Governments fail when they attempt to operate simple services such as those; they cannot operate either local shipping services between island ports or major air services. My criticism applies to governments of all political colour. Government enterprise does not provide the incentive to service and efficiency which actuates the pioneers, who strive to succeed, and thereby create work and employment. It was that incentive which actuated the pioneers of Australia, but, unfortunately, the development of that spirit in the pioneers of New Guinea is being frustrated because of the attitude and activities of the present socialist Government. The Government labours under the old-fashioned idea that there can be an equal distribution of everything, notwithstanding that its members and supporters know that there is no such thing as a dull level of ability amongst human beings. They know that it does not exist even amongst themselves. Yet, they are satisfied to encourage in their caucus the continuance of the herd instinct, the sheep mind, which believes that a simple native or cannibal is on the same level as the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt).</inline> Of course, I do not agree with that. Honorable members opposite want to " liquidate " - a word used by their fellow travellers, the Communists - private enterprise. Of course, they have learned that that theory will hot work, but they still persist in their efforts to bring about a socialist world, one which would not be too " red ", but something in between the socialist state and the present order. </para>

It would be of benefit to all concerned if notice of motion No. 2 were cleared from the notice-paper immediately.

Now, however, the opportunity presents itself for a debate, seeing that Government business will not be called on before  9  o'clock this evening. Therefore, the attitude of the Government is very difficult to understand. I should have thought that the Government would be glad to clear the item from the notice-paper by affording the honorable member for Warringah an opportunity to discuss the matter. </para>

                        <role>It is not often that back benchers have an opportunity to air grievances, particularly honorable members representing outlying areas of the Commonwealth. As the representative of the Northern Territory, I take this opportunity to air at least one grievance con cerning the administration of the territory. Before very long, however, there will have to be a full-dress debate on the administration of the principal territories controlled by this Parliament, namely, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and New Guinea. In Canberra there has been established an Advisory Council; in the Northern Territory there was recently established a Legislative Council; but New Guinea is left without either a legislative or an advisory body, and the admirable speech delivered this afternoon by the honorable member for Balaclava (Mr. White</role>

                    <para>indicates that all is not well there. We know from the reports of the Advisory Council of the Australian Capital Territory, where bureaucratic ordinances are promulgated, that all is not well in that Territory. It needs no words of mine to indicate that the Northern Territory is the Cinderella area of the Commonwealth. I bring to the notice of the House a case which demonstrates the need for a revision of the administrative policy adopted in the Northern Territory. Some time ago, the owner of Beswick station in the Northern Territory sold his property to the Commonwealth through the Native Affairs Branch for use as an aboriginal station. His neighbour claimed that some of the cattle sold with the station, which were subsequently branded with the government broad arrow, were his and not the property of the seller, and that accordingly they could not become the property of the Commonwealth. It is repugnant to me to have to read correspondence dealing with the affairs of two cattlemen in the Northern Territory, but it is necessary to do so in order to place the facts before the House. I also propose to read a letter written to the complainant by the Administrator, who is Commissioner of Police in the Northern Territory. The case originally came before the court at Darwin. The aggrieved cattleman lost the case and appealed to the Administrator, who must have obtained legal advice on the matter before he replied. The first letter I propose to read was sent to me by the complainant, one of my constituents named Mark O'Connor, formerly a policeman, who acquired a station near Marranboy, 60 miles from Katherine. The letter reads - </para>

                    <para>Early in January of last year I reported to the local policeman at Mata ran ku (Constable Burman) that I had caught a half-caste named " Campfire" who was employed on the Beswick station illegally mustering my country and being illegally in possession of some of my , cattle.

                    <para class="block">Constable Burman refused to take any action in either case and I have since learned that he was instructed not to have anything to do with cattle stealing cases whatever and not to have anything to do with assault cases unless he actually saw the assault committed. </para>
                    <para>This illegal mustering and thieving still  continued and twice more during the following months I again caught them red-handed. "However, eventually the Beswick station was sold to the Native Affairs Branch and they commenced bang-tailing and crossbranding. </para>

The Crown Solicitor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson)</inline> came all the way from Darwin to watch the case in the interests of the Government. Why, I do not know, as I had assured them I had no intention of taking any action against any one except the person who f believed had stolen them. The fact of the Administrator sending the Crown Solicitor nl] that way to watch the interests of the Crown would suggest that he thought if the present owner of Beswick was convicted that the Native Affairs would also be liable to an offence for buying them. I always knew ir was no good trying to fight the Government., but this also taught me it was no use fighting any one who was able to put it oyer the Government. So, after 32 years in tinNorthern Territory, I sold out in disgust and left it. I am afraid many more will be doing the same under the present circumstances. </para>

                    <para>First of all, I would like to know why it is that I am told by the police that they have nothing to do with cattle cases and that when 1 find cattle thieves illegally mustering my cattle and stealing them, that I must take civil action. 1 have tried this procedure and found it u complete farce. </para>
                    <para>I had plenty of evidence that my cuttle were being constantly stolen and some of them were eventually found in the Beswick bullock paddock; taken to the homestead yard and Cross branded with the Native Affairs brand. The previous owner of Beswick Station was charged with illegally using these bullocks, but the magistrate said there was no case to answer as the act was only intended for working bullocks and that having bullocks in the paddock iui'1 droving them to a yard for the purpose of receiving payment for them was not illegal! v using them. ° ' </para>

                <para>Now the position is this: The police inform me I must take civil action j I engage a solicitor and he charges me 30 guineas to conduct the case. The magistrate throws the case out and orders me to pay the previous owner nf Beswick Station's solicitor 20 guineas. Th, trip to Darwin cost me about another £10.

                    <para>.- I regret that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. .Menzies)</inline> is not present, because I propose to comply with the requests of some residents of New South Wales who live in my electorate, that 1 complain about and criticize a speech made by him last Monday night in the electorate of the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale).</inline> Certain statements were made by the Leader of the Opposition to which exception was widely taken. I personally strongly object to them. Ruffling the lace at his wrists in true cavalier fashion, the right honorable gentleman took New South Wales to task and made a jibe at members of the Australian Parliament by referring to them as a lot of cheap Jacks* When we com' pare what he said in that speech with what he said previously, we can readily decide who is the cheap Jack. The honorable member for Parramatta, who was present at the meeting which the Leader of the Opposition addressed, will agree I am sure, that the following report of the speech is accurate, because it was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald -</inline></para>

In view of the fact that only half of the senators are voted for at each general election, there are serious difficulties about introducing new methods oi voting. But it is, we believe, true that the present system, under which all the candidates elected iii any one State are inevitably of one side of politics, is basically unsatisfactory. Thus, at the present election it happens that every Liberal party and Country party senator retires. To secure a majority in the Senate as a result of this election, we will need to have a complete victory in every State. </para>

" Let me talk to as great a number of ladies in the win-the-women campaign as possible, and let me get back as soon as I can to our more salubrious climate," his manner implies. Liberal publications have announced in reasonably good English that the Liberal party stands for an increased membership of the Parliament. So the right honorable gentleman should recant what he sneeringly said at Parramatta. He reminds me of the famous leader of the French Revolution who said : " I like people, but I do not like the people ". He keeps his nose high in the air as he talks about the suggestion that there ought to be pensions for politicians. As the leader of the rump of a once great party and a man of distinction, he displayed an amazing lack of ethics. The committee dealing with this subject has not yet made an official announcement, and its findings have not yet been placed before any properly constituted authority for examination. Consequently, the Leader of the Opposition was prepared to accept a rumour published in the press, gathered from God knows where, in order to make a statement which, he thought, would tickle the' ears of the groundlings in Parramatta. "When I look at the honorable member for Parramatta, I am convinced that there must be a considerable number of groundlings in that constituency. </para>
                <para>The matter of pensions for ex-members of this Parliament should be considered on the basis of the necessity of the occasion. Those honorable members possessing considerable financial resources which they accumulated over a number of years, may be able to speak disdainfully of a pension; but honorable' members on this side of the chamber consider that the labourer and the Labourite is worthy of his hire. In due course, I shall be vociferously in favour of any proposal to grant a pension to me when I become eligible for it, because I have attempted to perform my parliamentary duties as efficiently as possible. The Leader of the Opposition attempted to whip up public opinion on this matter, and referred, in a most contemptuous manner, to a subject which a considerable number of his own followers will, no doubt, support. If they are sufficiently courageous, they will support a  pensions proposal from their places in this House. They will support it, I am sure, in their own letter-boxes at the end of each month, as they supported the increase of the parliamentary allowance last year. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Opposition also made disdainful references to the increase of the parliamentary allowance. This is an economic problem. Some honorable members experience the greatest difficulty in fulfilling their parliamentary duties honorably and efficiently without demanding what Labour has always unashamedly asked for, namely, a fair rate of pay for the work undertaken. Some honorable members opposite, full of windy phrases, righteously vowed that they would not rob the public. From an examination of the kind of service which some of  them  have rendered to their country for nearly twenty years, I believe that they have fallen strangely from grace. They fulminated in this chamber in no uncertain terms against the proposal to increase the parliamentary allowance, and the Leader of the Opposition also " pontificated " to his constituents upon this matter, saying that the increase was disgraceful. Although some honorable gentlemen opposite were opposed to the increase while the Parliament was in session and the press was actively using the proposal as a subject for headlines, their degree of intolerance of the position diminished with the waning of publicity. A person of an inquisitive turn of mind would probably find that three months after the parliamentary allowance  was  increased, the little fish were nibbling again. They were darting around the worm dangling in the water before their eyes. The Auditor-General's report, in due course, will, no doubt, reveal that all of them reluctantly - oh, so reluctantly - yielded to the temptation to accept the increase, while feeling that their hearts and souls had been torn that these things should be. They all have taken the increase. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Wimmera has misunderstood me. I said that the little fish were nibbling, and were swimming around the bait. The worm is still dangling there, and the honorable member is still here. The evidence is irrefutable. It has happened before, and I believe that it can happen again. There are various reasons why the honorable member has not needed to bother about accepting the increase. During the debate on the Parliamentary Allowances Bill last year, he was very sharply reminded by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> that he should not make a virtue of those reasons. Members of the Opposition eventually came down to earth, and got the increase " the back way". It is of no use to beat about the bush. The same thing will occur in regard to pensions for defeated members of Parliament. Some honorable members opposite will be full of pious wrath, and will be almost shaken to the tips of their toes about the proposal. Speaking in New South Wales on the subject, the Leader of the Opposition explained that he had learned confidentially that caucus was on the point of announcing to an astonished world the introduction of the pensions scheme. The right honorable gentleman described the proposal as amazing. He pointed out that after a person had been a member of Parliament, for six years he would be eligible, if defeated, for a pension of £500 per annum for the remainder of his life. I believe that, in secret, the Leader of the Opposition smacked his lips over the proposition. I am certain that a number of his followers did. Let us put an end to this hypocrisy in politics, especially among the leaders of the political parties represented in this House.

                <para>The hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition, and his cohorts who are supporting him in his absence, is regrettable. Particularly is it regrettable on big issues which should be debated in a non-party spirit. The honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) said this afternoon, in reference to another matter, that she hoped that some subjects could be discussed in this House on a non-party political basis. The welfare of men who enter the political sphere in order to serve their country to the best of their ability should .be so treated. However, some honorable members opposite, particularly the honorable member who lives in the .salubrious city of Parramatta, have used  the subject for personal and political reasons, and I object most strenuously to it. This criticism does not redound to the advantage of the Leader of the Opposition. I believe that the miscalling of the mother State, and its people, is a dangerous thing. Another remark which the Leader of the Opposition made was that we had lost our sense of moral revolt and of being amazed at anything. Personally, I am revolted, annoyed and dismayed by the speech which the right honorable gentleman made to some of the people of Parramatta last Monday. </para>

                <para>I rose to take this opportunity to direct attention to what all honorable members and discerning people in Australia, particularly in Queensland, will regard as the apathy and absolute lack of responsibility of this Government in connexion with, the industrial crisis iii Queensland. This deplorable disturbance has now reached such grave proportions that its repercussions have extended far beyond the borders of that State and the Australian Government cannot divest itself of all responsibility. The Prime Minister has sought to wash his hands of the whole affair, but there is an obligation upon his Administration to co-operate with the Government of Queensland. Everybody will recognize that the Queensland Premier has taken a most determined stand. The issue is clear - the upholding of lawfully constituted authority and the enforcement of the laws, or the sanctioning of the revolutionary methods that are being introduced into industrial life not only in Queensland but also, throughout Australia by the Communists. It is useless for this Government to endeavour to evade its share of the responsibility. The dispute, I emphasize, is now interstate, and for reasons that I shall now give, this  Government  cannot continue to ignore it. Certain unions, which have now instructed their members to cease work in sympathy with the original strikers, are subject to Commonwealth and not State awards. I refer particularly to .waterside workers and seamen, whose participation in the strike has paralysed the carriage of goods by sea between States as well as intra-state. That in itself is a matter of Commonwealthwide importance. Also, a large number of unionists, who have been stood down from their employment through no fault of their own, have applied for and are receiving unemployment benefits which are financed by the taxpayers  of  Australia as a whole. Consequently, it is in the fiscal interests of Commonwealth taxpayers generally that the strike should be terminated as soon as possible. But what has this Government done? In reply to questions, the Prime Minister has informed us that he has had a short conversation with the Queensland Premier and is co-operating with him. We gather by inference that the degree of this co-operation is to make available sufficient air transport to carry essential supplies to remote areas of Queensland which have been isolated by the strike. But there is another reason why the Australian Government is definitely and directly concerned with this dispute. Should civil violence occur in Queensland on a large scale, the Australian Government will be bound to assist the State Government to protect the civil population should the Premier of Queensland requests such assistance. The Crimes Act provides for the issuing of a proclamation should &gt;a serious industrial disturbance threaten trade or commerce amongst the States. When such a proclamation is issued, action can be taken by the Commonwealth against any one who incites strikers or encourages the continuation of a strike. Section 30j of the Crimes Act reads -  (1.) If at any time the Governor-General is of opinion that there exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries or among the States, he may make a Proclamation to that effect, which Proclamation should be and remain in operation for the purposes of this section until it is revoked. (2.) Any person who, during the operation of such Proclamation, takes part in or continues, or incites to, urges, aids or encourages the taking part in, or continuance of. a lockout or strike - </para>

If ever there was a situation that demanded the invoking of the Crimes Act it exists now in Queensland. The Crimes Act is still on our statute-book. . It has not been repealed by this Government. I emphasize that every member of this ch amber, including, of course, members of the Chifley Government, has sworn to carry out the laws of this country as and when required without fear or favour. Consequently, it is useless for the Prime Minister to pursue the tactics that he has adopted during the past few days when answering questions. First, the right honorable gentleman said that he has not had time to look into the matter. Then, in reply to the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> who asked to-day whether the Government had sufficient power to give effect to the regulations relating to industrial dislocation, he said that he would look into the matter and advise the honorable member in due course. Answering a question that I asked a few days ago relating to the application of the Crimes Act to those engaged in this transport strike, the right honorable gentleman said that he would confer with the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> on that matter. Nobody will be deceived into believing that the Prime Minister does not know of the existence of the Crimes Act and its provisions. The act is explicit. It was enacted for the very purpose for which I now advocate - its use which is the bringing about of a better state of industrial affairs. </para>
                <para>Let us examine the available evidence of Communist influence in the strike in Queensland. There is plenty of such evidence, and it is indisputable. The Queensland Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon</inline> has stated in no uncertain terms that communist influence is responsible for this upheaval, the effects of which are extending to other parts of Australia. He declared, too, that the Communists were responsible for the meat-workers' strike in Queensland some months ago. It appears that only the Prime Minister refuses to recognize the existence of Communists and their white-anting tactics aimed at the disruption of peaceful industrial life and the well-being of decent Australians. On Monday, the national secretary of the Federated Ironworkers Union and the federal  president  of the Australian Railways Union interviewed the Prime Minister to urge the payment of unemployment benefits to members of unions sponsoring strikes. A statement made by the assistant general secretary of the Federated Ironworkers Union, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhillips,</inline> provides further evidence, if such evidence be required, of communist influence in the dispute. He said, " I am one of those to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon</inline> has referred as a muttering  M'olotov, a budding commissar come from the south to take charge of the strike ". Instructions have been issued by the communistcontrolled Waterside Workers Federation to all Queensland waterside workers to refuse duty until the strike ends. That is further evidence of communist influence. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon</inline> made clear in a broadcast statement that the Communist party was largely responsible for the strike. He declared that, since the dispute began, the high command of the Communist party had invaded Queensland. Leading Communists from Victoria and New South Wales went to that State and actually took control of the disputes committee. A well known Communist has been appointed organizer of the disputes committee. </para>
                <para>What has this Government done? Has it made any declaration of support for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon</inline> and the definite attitude which he has taken? Has it made any declaration condemning the strikers and the Communists? Has it issued any warning to these people, who are inciting the workers to impose an economic ban by tying up the transport system of Queensland, that the Crimes Act will be invoked against them ? Of course, it has not done so. I put it straight to this Government that the time is over-ripe for it to make a pronouncement in unequivocal terms that, if the Crimes Act is contravened, its provisions will be invoked in order to bring about peace and goodwill in the industrial life of this community. It should take a leaf out of the book of the Premier of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. "ollway,</inline> who recently enacted a special State law in order to discipline strikers. </para>
                <para class="block">As a consequence of his determination and intestinal fortitude, the strike dissolved like ice cream in the sun. The men went back to work and the Communists were defeated. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon</inline> is endeavouring to do likewise. On the statute-books of Queensland is an emergency act designed for the purpose of creating harmony in industry and enforcing observance of the principles of arbitration and conciliation. When the strikers refused to adhere to those principles, he invoked the act and its provisions are being implemented in Queensland to-day. Yet the Crimes Act, which is the key to the general industrial situation to-day, simply remains inoperative on the bookshelf of the Attorney-General. It is not even looked at, much less invoked, by this Government. </para>
                <para>The time has come for the people of Australia to recognize that this Government is not prepared to carry out its own laws, which its members have sworn to implement without fear or favour. This Government must declare where it stands in relation to communism.. It must declare whether it believes in the British way of life and constitutional authority or not.' The Hanlon Government of Queensland has stated its position in no uncertain manner. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon</inline> has thrown down the gauntlet. He  ha3  stated that the present dispute in Queensland is a fight to decide whether the laws enacted for the people shall- be carried out or whether the industrial life' of Queensland shall be controlled by a coterie of Communists, which has been reinforced by Communists from other States. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon</inline> has said, leading Communists from other States recently invaded Queensland, and took control of the strike. What practical steps has this Government taken to co-operate with the State Government and to render assistance to it? It has failed to declare its attitude towards the Communists and the strikers, and has disregarded the existence of the Crimes Act, which its members have sworn to implement in the interests of the people. </para>

                <para>However, I am not here to reply to the honorable member, but to speak of grievances, and my particular grievance to-night relates to the eagerness with which the Leader of the  Australian  Country party, and those who surround him, want to bring the Crimes Act into force. Honorable members opposite showed what they thought about the Crimes Act and punishment when the Commonwealth Conciliation and  Aribtration  Bill Was being debated in this House last year. They waged a great fight in favour of the inclusion of provisions for severe penalties. I have no illusions about the attitude of honorable members opposite. I know very well that the spirit that has always been behind the opponents of the workers throughout the years is still behind them and their schemes. </para>
                <para>I agree that the strike in Queensland should not have occurred. I do not pretend to uphold anything that I believe to be wrong, and that Ls why I deplore the strike. . However, I say to honorable members opposite that, if they try to enforce the Crimes Act, they may find themselves in the position of a government of their own political colour, which tried to invoke that act, or some similar legislation, in order to deport Walsh and Johnson. Most honorable members opposite can remember the sorry experience of the Bruce-Page Government. It is all very well for the Leader of the Australian Country party to advocate to-day that people should be deported, but to-morrow he and his colleagues will be complaining that the Government is ignoring the rights of men. However, when a person whom members of the Opposition do not like is involved, he has, apparently, no rights. I say that the people have every right- </para>

Does any honorable member opposite imagine that if he told a meeting of Queensland miners tomorrow that the Crimes Act had been Invoked, and that their leaders would be thrown into gaol, they would return to work? If I know the miners at all, they would certainly not run counter to the interests of members of other unions by assisting to force them back to work. That is not done, and it is contrary to the history of industrial disputes. </para>

I know of dozens of cases where hold-ups and delays have been caused deliberately by the shipping authorities. Only a few weeks ago a vessel arrived at Outer Harbour South Australia, for unloading. At 5 p.m. only a few motor bodies remained to he unloaded, and the waterside workers were quite prepared, on payment of the small amount of overtime  involved,  to complete the un loading of the vessel. However the shipping authorities decided that the job was not to be completed, but that the men should return for ah hour's work On the following . day. The vessel could have sailed that night except foi' the attitude of those in authority. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot furnish it now, but I can in a day or two. Unfortunately the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> has such a suspicious mind that he imagines I would make a false statement on a matter of that kind. When I make a statement such as that I know that what I am saying is correct, and that. I can produce evidence to support it. However, whether the honorable member accepts my assurance or not does not worry me, because I know that he is not concerned at all about the welfare of waterside workers. He may make out that he is, but the only concern which he has for them is to discover how much they can earn for the shipowners iri return for the wages paid to them. There are fair-minded men amongst the shipowners who are anxious to do the right thing, just as there are fair-minded members amongst those opposite. However, there are honorable members opposite who are just as unfair as the Communist industrialist leaders of whom they go often complain. One thing which my  long experience of industry has taught me is that although there are men of extreme views amongst employers and employees, it is usually possible for representatives of both sides to arrive at an agreement in conference. Nevertheless, one usually encounters some one who is so biased and unfair that even his own colleagues have to restrain him. I was in Melbourne twenty years ago assisting a union in its negotiations with a body of employers, who were very' fine men. However, one of their number was so unfair and objectionable that I had the pleasure of hearing his colleagues argue against him and in favour of mv contention. That particular conference achieved a great deal because, with the single exception which I have mentioned, we were ali prepared to approach the difficulties confronting us from a realistic point df view. We Were prepared to deal reasonably  with the matter and to have regard to the opinions of both parties. If that attitude had been adopted during the last twenty years, Communists would not now occupy influential positions in some trade unions. 1. agree that that is the present position, and I deplore it as much as honorable members opposite, but I feel it would be wrong to attempt to alter it by the methods they suggest. Undoubtedly, the waterside workers are in a militant frame of mind, but that is due to the fact that when conditions were bad for them their employers were militant. Those employees did all that they could to hold on to the " best end of the stick ". They were prepared to sacrifice the Australian workers and to employ foreigners. There was no outcry by honorable members opposite about the slow turn-round of ships when the maritime strike occurred in 1928. At that time, the shipping companies gave preference to volunteers and employed Italians who had just arrived in this country. Those men had no experience of stevedoring and consequently took much longer to turn a ship round than experienced waterside workers would have done. The ordinary waterside workers were denied employment in their industry and were issued with tickets entitling them to some 5s. worth of goods a week, whilst men who did not know how to do the work properly and who had only recently arrived from foreign countries were employed at good wages. It is that sort of thing that has created the present situation. Honorable members opposite should be reminded of that fact because they are saying continually to the people of Australia that the workers are always wrong. I agree that many of the hold-ups taking place at the present time should not occur. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1947 provided a means by which the men could have their claims dealt with in a proper manner, and I agree with the Prime Minister that disputes should be dealt with by the Arbitration Courts. "When discussing the present dispute between the Premier of Queensland and the militant unions in that State, it should not be forgotten that some of the conditions for which the men are asking are fair and reasonable. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that it is not fair and reasonable to hold up the whole State, but my point is that the Opposition wants a return to the old state of affairs; it wants to get back to the use of the " big stick " and the Crimes Act. 1 have probably spoken somewhat strongly on this matter. For many years, I was president first of a local branch and then of a State branch of a trade union. During the whole period I was employed in that industry I did not lose a day's pay owing to a strike. Honorable members opposite will therefore appreciate that I did my best  to  see that work continued whilst negotiations for awards were in progress. The workers in Queensland and other States should rely upon arbitration and should not indulge in continual strikes. If these frequent stoppages continue the public will ultimately lose confidence in the men, and we must try  to  make them understand that. </para>

Lord Bruce, as he now is, was defeated in his own district by a great margin of votes because of his desire to. do away with arbitration. We in the Labour movement will do all that we can to get the men to refer disputes to the arbitration courts and to work in the interests of the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - We have before us a subject about which I shall not say very much because, in common with other honorable members, including the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction(Mr. Dedman), who participated in the negotiations, I do not know very much about it. I am reminded somewhat of a huge rabbit warren into which you chase a rabbit. From a distance you do not know into which hole it went, and you are quite certain that you cannot possibly know where it will come out. The Minister has placed before us a mass of documents. I wish to get down from the high level of debate about history and international affairs, and examine what the Minister says he has achieved. I propose to discuss the tariff concessions, and how they will affect Australia's trade and commerce. Two different sets of documents have been submitted by the Government, and both are voluminous. One set deals with the concessions which were offered to us by certain countries. I cannot understand why so much paper was used to tell us so little. In these documents there are pages and pages of items upon which tariff duties have not been changed at all. An example of this is furnished in the arrangement entered into with Czechoslovakia. This arrangement is of particular interest because of the very doubtful state of affairs in that country. I am not sure just what will be the result of the trade negotiations between Australia  and Czechoslovakia, or what effect they will have - whether  Czechoslovakian  trade will be carried on under what might be considered normal conditions, or whether we shall have to enter into new negotiations with the new government there. According to the Minister's statement, the negotiations with Czechoslovakia covered certain items, and at the head of the list we find apples. That is reasonable enough, I suppose, because, if it had not been for the apple, none of us would be here to-night. We are informed that the tariff on Australian apples imported into Czechoslovakia is to be reduced from 300 crowns per 100 kilograms to 75 crowns. The apple-growers, looking at this concession, might be disposed to think that they are being well treated, but statistics show that our total exports of apples to Czechoslovakia during the two full years before the war amounted to 3,061 bushels in 1937-38, and 24 bushels in 1938-39. We turn then to' skins and hides, raw, green or dried. They were always admitted to Czechoslovakia, free of duty, according to the Minister's own documents; yet he informs us that from now on they will be free. Another item is tallow, raw and rendered, but our trade in tallow with Czechoslovakia was never great. During 1937-3S, it amounted to only 15 tons, while in the following year it was 95 ions. Tanning extract is given a special place. The duty on this item was previously thirteen crowns, and now, since the making of the agreement, it is still to be thirteen crowns. The amount of tanning extract we sent to Czechoslovakia was so small that it does not even appear in the customs export records. On opals- the duty was 3,000 crowns per 100 kilograms before the Minister went to Geneva, and it is the same since he came back. I turn now to France, a country which does a considerable trade with the Commonwealth. The duty on beef, chilled or frozen, has been reduced from 50 to 40 per cent., and on mutton and lamb by 15 per cent. On rabbits - but they must be wild, frozen and not truffled - the reduction is 5 per cent. We come now to eggs of poultry in shell. We are not exporting emu eggs at present as far as I know. For eggs of poultry in shell the reduction is 5 per cent. Sausage casings, dried or salted, are still free as also are horns of cattle and mother-of-pearl shell. On apples, according to the time of the year in which they happen to be exported to France, the reductions vary from 7 to 3 per cent.  Acaroid  gum - whatever that is - is free now and used to be free before the Minister went to Geneva. Next we have eucalyptus. That is still free, notwithstanding the Minister's exertions at Geneva. We come then to sheep skins, in which we have a considerable trade. Sheep skins were made the subject of an embargo by the former member for Capricornia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forde,</inline> who, with one stroke of the pen, completely wrecked the sheep skin market in Australia for a considerable time. The Minister's efforts are still praiseworthy because sheep and lamb skins are still free of duty. For zinc, so long as it is in lumps, ingots, pigs or slabs, the reduction is 5 per cent. For lead in lumps, pigs or slabs, the reduction is 2 per cent. Incidentally, there is a chance that some of the lead we send to Czechoslovakia might bo heaved back at the Minister. I make that remark now because I recall what happened to some of the scrap-iron we sent to Japan. On tallow the duty is reduced by 5 per cent. Hides and skins, raw, green or dried, still remain free, notwithstanding the Minister's exertions at Geneva. Then, we come to the French colonies, on the goods of which purely revenue duties of 1 or 2 per cent, are imposed, and in some cases as little as one-half of 1 per cent. It is true that the Minister has succeeded in getting some of these customs tariffs reduced. The duty of 2 per cent, still remains on wheaten flour if it goes to French establishments in Oceania. If it goes to other French possessions, no duty is imposed. There is a 1 per cent, reduction of duty on potatoes going to French Oceania. As this item has been given a separate line in the document, apparently the Minister has given it full consideration. We pass on now to French Indo-China. Only eight items are listed and only two changes have been made. For wheaten flour the reduction is 3 per cent. A reduction of 15 per cent, is made in respect of fresh apples sent between April and June. For apples sent at other periods of the year the duty remains the same. </para>

                    <para>I turn now to the United States of America. For his efforts there, the Minister is entitled to some commendation. Dealing with our trade relations with the United States of America, the honorable gentleman said - </para>
                    <para>Of all the bilateral negotiations conducted at Geneva, those with the United States of America are considered to be by- far the most important. A substantial agreement with the United States of America is vital to a successful outcome of the whole project from the Australian point of view. </para>
                    <para>Imports from the United States of America to Australia cover a considerable range of manufactured and unmanufactured products, the principal items being motor chassis, lubricating oils and petrol, tobacco, machines and machinery, timber, textiles, paper and stationery and industrial chemicals. </para>
                    <para class="block">Before these documents, or some of them, were tabled in this House, or at least before copies were made available to honorable members, the Government had already availed itself of one of the many escape provisions in Chapter XXII. of the agreement to impose certain restrictions through dollar exchange. Does it not stand to reason that if those penalties are imposed by unilateral action, without consultation with or agreement by the United States of America, there will be a tendency for the United States to go rather slowly on concessions which it may contemplate granting to us? </para>

                            <para>- .Splendid ! I accept the Minister's assurance for the time being, carefully index it, and put it away to see how it works out in due course. Of the concessions which the honorable gentleman says we have received from the United States of America, one of the most important is in regard to butter, because it represents one-half of the duty. Another is the admission into the United States of America of Australian wool at a lower rate of duty, but not at as low a rate a.i one might have expected, considering that American wool does not come into competition with Australian wool. The Americans grow a different class of wool from that grown here. By an action arising out of exchange control, on the </para>

                    <para class="block">Minister's own showing we have virtually destroyed an agreement arrived at with the United States, and thus very largely the foundation on which this whole international trade organization is built. As far as Australia is concerned, it crashes to the ground. I shall not weary the House with a long recitation of other items - not one or two, but dozens, from this document. We should look at what the Minister has achieved in the way of reciprocal reductions from other countries associated with the International Trade Organization at the discussions at Geneva, and, no doubt, later on, at Havana, where the Minister spent some time. One of the main matters at stake in these negotiations was the continuance of Imperial preference. It is interesting to note that, in some instances, the Minister has been able to maintain certain preferences as far as amount is concerned. In other instances there have been slight reductions. In still others the preference has disappeared altogether. . I cannot understand why there was any necessity for a first-class, full-dress "all-in" conference at Geneva to make some of the concession? which are listed here. 1 need not go beyond foodstuffs and clothing in order to make my point. First on- the list - and I do not know why they arc placed first - are alcoholic liquors, in respect of which a reduction of 5s. a gallon applies in the United Kingdom and France. A similar reduction in favour of Benelux has been made in respect of gin. A concession in respect of  rum  amounting to 4s. a gallon has been made in favour of France and Cuba.  There  are no records of any rum imports  form  Cuba in the reports I have been able to secure from the Parliamentary Library In respect of bitters, there is a reduction of 2s. a gallon in favour of Benelux, and in respect of liqueurs a reduction of 2.&gt;. a gallon has been made in favour of France, the British preference being reduced accordingly. Then we have this delicious item, " Perfumed spirits ", provided they come from France - a reduction of <inline font-style="italic">7i</inline> per cent. Primage duty on " ethers and chloroform ", provided they come from France, is reduced by 5 per cent. We find that we may obtain champagne from France at 3s. a gallon " less. Then we have another gem relating to aerated waters, in respect of which we find one hitherto unpublished concession made by the Government to Communist opinion. "Whilst new .rates of duty, involving reduction of from 7£ per cent, to 15 per cent., are to apply <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> such aerated waters as "  Contrexeville,  Evian, Pander. St.  Galmier, Vals  and  Vittel"  the one French aerated water which is not mentioned is Vichy water. That is a well-known export from France, and I suppose that it was fear of Communist influence that prompted the Government to exclude Vichy water from that concession. No alteration has been made in respect of tobacco and cigarettes. The duty on cocoa from Benelux countries is to be reduced. Our imports from China during the last two years were valued at £2,466 and £2,771, respectively, but in the schedule, duty on egg albumen imported from China is to be reduced by ls. 9d. per lb. One would have thought that we could produce in Australia all the egg albumen that we could possibly want. The duty on banana flour imported from Brazil, and that on asparagus tips imported from the United States of America, is to be reduced by 10 per cent. The duty on  Petits Pois  and mushrooms is listed. Why the French term is given for one article and English for the  other  T do not know, but duty on imports of these items from France is to be reduced. The duty on ginger,  unground,  is unchanged. Then we have this delicious item : So 10ug as lark pates are imported from France the duty is to be reduced. The schedule has something to say also about an item which I understand is " fat goose's liver ", on which t]ie 'duty is to be reduced if it be imported from France. The duty on duck paste also, so long as it be imported from France, is to be reduced. The primage duty <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> walnuts and rice from France is to be reduced by 10 per cent., whilst that on sago and tapioca, if imported, apparently from the Netherlands East Indies^ is to be reduced, by 10 per cent. Likewise the primage duty on sausage casings imported from the United States of America is to be reduced by 10 per cent. Then we find another item which no doubt will set the French mercantile marine rushing  in our direction - soap - toilet, fancy or medicated on which duty is to be reduced by  2¼d.  per lb. A most interesting lot of spices is catalogued, including: chillies and pepper, on which primageduty is to be reduced by <inline font-style="italic">2\</inline> per cent, if imported from India. Duty on clovesimported from France is to be reduced by <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent., and the duty on cinnamon imported from Ceylon by 10 percent. The duty on mace, nutmegs and pimento is not reduced at all, whilst aniseed will be admitted free if it be imported from Syria-Lebanon. Then, as though the seal had to be put on everything, we find that waxes - carnauba,.  ouricury, <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> licury  - if imported from Brazil are also to be admitted free. </para>
                    <para>These are typical of the duties which we are asked to approve in respect of items which are set out in 170 pages of typescript ; but in respect of many of them no variation of duty at all is to be made as the result of the Minister's visit overseas. One thing I should like him to explain is why in respect of several items the word " exempt " is crossed out in ink and the word " free " substituted therefor. What is the difference between " exempt from duty " and " entry free of duty " ? According to this document there must be some reason for that alteration. Turning now to clothing I find that the duty on neck ties for human wear, provided they come from France, is to be reduced. What neck ties are imported other than those for human wear? We find also that concessions in duty on rabbit skins imported from China are to be made. Those concessions, no doubt, will help considerably to stiffen up the Chinese against Communist aggression from the north. Then I find the interesting heading " Socks and stockings for human attire ". I have seen a few animals and birds in my time, but I have never seen any wearing socks and stockings. What is the difference between neck ties for " human wear " and socks and stockings for "human, attire"? We find also the word " apparel " creeping in. No doubt, in negotiating international trade arrangements in relation to these items we have been obliged to make some fine distinctions. " Wear ", " attire " and " apparel ", apparently, mean three different things, because the three terms are included in the one document in three different places. I shall not worry the Minister about that technicality. So  long as one has a sense of humour and can spend a week-end in Canberra going through documents of this kind one can be highly amused without having to pay amusement tax, and that is a consideration in these days of high taxes. </para>
                    <para>I now wish to make a few remarks on a very serious note. One criticism which has crept into this debate inclines me to the belief that certain honorable members are determined to go on the rampage against the United States of America. I have been a. critic of the United States of America on many occasions. In 1943, when speaking in this chamber, I said that when the war we .were then waging was over the world would face an economic dictatorship by the United States of America such as it had not seen since the days of the Roman Empire. I believe that that dictatorship is here now ; and we in British countries must accommodate ourselves to the new set of world conditions which include new world trade conditions. But I see very little indication on the part of the Australian Government and still less on the part of the Australian Labour party to make such a move. First, once and for all, and the sooner the better, we must get to an understanding as to whether we are going to remain part of the British Empire. That term seems to be a misnomer to-day when we see the Union Jack being hauled down in so many countries. Other honorable members prefer " the British Commonwealth of Nations ". But, we must decide whether in trade, political and diplomatic matters we are going to act as one family; and there is not very much indication of that in these agreements. On the other hand, if we are not going to act as part of that family then we must come to a very much closer arrangement with the United States of America than is indicated in these documents. There is no other course of action open to the Commonwealth that I can see. I shall declare my own position, if it is necessary to tell the Government what my position is. I consider that our duty, interest and everything we have and hold should lead us to the closest possible arrangement with all other British countries. There is a very good reason for that. We have all sorts of difficulties ahead of us with which, owing to the limitations of this debate, I am not now. allowed to deal; but before very long there must be a conference not at Geneva, but at some town, or city, in one or other of the British countries. I am speaking of the English-speaking British countries. Great Britain, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, because. I think that, for all practical purposes, India and Pakistan  can  be counted as being virtually outside the Empire, notwithstanding the Minister's great achievement, according to these documents, in securing a reduction of the duty on bacon and ham into Moslem Pakistan. I looked through the documents to see whether Mecca, Iraq, Egypt and other Moslem countries are mentioned, but they are not. I should congratulate  the Minister if  he can  arrange  for the export of bacon and ham to Mecca. But, from the viewpoint of practical politics and speaking of the real trade difficulties that lie ahead and of the financial and currency difficulties with which we have to reckon, I say that a meeting between the representatives of Great Britain, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia is overdue. The greater the degree of freedom of trade that we can get between those British countries the better it will be, not only for ourselves but also for every other part of the world, the future of which depends to a very large degree upon the strength and stability of the British countries. So far  as:  the United States is concerned I shall make one or two observations, I hope in a kindly spirit. The United States has suddenly found itself, I think in many respects unexpectedly, in the position of being one of the two greatest military and economic powers in the world. It has probably  the  greatest productive and military potentialities  that  the world has ever seen, but it has neither the experience nor the training that a far-sighted democracy requires. But democracies are never far-sighted ; they live from day to clay, and it is only dictatorships that look ahead. In due time, however, the United States of America will learn that there are certain things that can be done, and others that cannot. The dollar crisis, I believe, results from the  fact that the United States of America has <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> learned that a country that is an international investor must have an unfavorable trade balance. That is its trouble. It has a. great industrial potentiality that it wants to use. It wants ti: invest overseas and to have the surplus production of its great factories  overflow  onto the market in other countries; but it does not want to be paid for those goods with the goods and services of those other countries. Out of that, and nothing else, arises the dollar shortage that confronts the rest of the world. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> agreement at Geneva, no trips ro Havana or anything else will solve the dollar crisis except the method that I have mentioned. The United States of America must accept the goods and services of other countries in payment for the goods it sells to them and as the interest on the principal it has invested in them. We see the United States of America spreading out its investments, but with Great Britain the opposite process is at work. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> one with any understanding of the position could view with other than grave concern recent  statements  in the press that Britain has had to sell £115,000,000 worth of its investments in railways in Argentina. It had to sell those investments to Argentina in order that the people of Great Britain may live; The same process is at work in Uruguay. The United Kingdom's overseas investments are drying up and the United Kingdom that we wore brought up to think of before, during and after World War I. has gone. That is history, and there must be a re-alinement of the English-speaking countries outside the United States of America if we are to maintain our position in the world as a family, and if Great Britain, is to maintain its position on the western borders of Europe in any way comparable with its principles and history. Having said that, I simply ,?.ay of the Minister's negotiations that the Australian Government has, rightly or wrongly, entered into all sorts of obligations in connexion with the United Nations, without any assurance, in my opinion, that it is capable of carrying out the purposes for which it was created. Its objectives are not worth the paper they are written on. I do not think we shall get from the United Nations anything more than we got from the League of Nations in the nature of effective international security, international currency or international trade arrangements. Only recently, we had a debate on what is commonly called the Bretton Woods Agreement, which is intimately related to the proposals that we are now discussing. The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> disappeared from the chamber in a great hurry when that debate took place. Already we have seen France, one of the most important signatories to that agreement, repudiate its signature. I am not a financier or the son of a financier, but my estimation of the financial set-up of the world to-day is that we are approaching the point at which other countries will have to follow very closely in the footsteps of France. Currency is undoubtedly related to trade. Only two things in the final analysis matter in value when the printingpresses are set to work, as they have been in every country. Internally a country . has land and gold. Externally you have gold. Weare trying to establish a trade organization on a gold basis which says that we shall sell gold at £10 15s. 3d. per 07... when every man jack of us knows that on the market gold is worth much more. Even in France, if newspaper reports areto be credited, United States gold dollarsare selling for three times as much ssUnited States paper dollars. I haveonly newspaper information, which may be astray, but conditions of complete chaos, in international finance are the basis on which the Australians Government has committed Australia in an international trade agreement. I simply say that I do not think it will bemany years before the Government will be seeking radical amendments to the agreement. </para>

                    <para class="block">Very little has been published in the Australian press about what has taken place there, but the English press reports considerable disagreement and dissension. For instance, the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of the 14th February, under the heading " World Trade Charter ", reports disagreement on the 12th February as to the number of nations that should sign the Charter of the International Trade Organization before its implementation. It was intended at first that when twenty countries had ratified it, it should be brought into effect, but Mexico and  Uruguay  have proposed that a majority of the 58 nations represented should ratify the charter before it comes into operation. It was also pointed out, in discussion among smaller countries, that, under their constitutions, they would be unable to ratify the agreement before the end of 1949. So T say that we are dealing with something that cannot be. operative until probably 29 nations have signed it, and it may be greatly amended in the future. It would have been much better had the Government issued a White Paper bringing our information up to date. 'The draft charter is one of a series of documents designed to improve world conditions, and rehabilitate the damaged economies of war stricken nations. It was also allegedly drafted to assist world trade and the people of all nations.

                    <para>The fatal nature of that provision is shown by the fact that Australia has been prevented from exporting its goods to such countries as Palestine and British East -Africa, because those countries have been obliged to restrict the entry of similar goods from the United States of America. The effect of this provision can be shown 'by specific instances. Three firms in New South Wales lost  an  export market in Palestine valued at £171,©00, and two other firms in the same S'ate lost ari export market in British East Africa rained at <inline font-style="italic">£6%-Q0Q.

Whilst Great Britain is trying to reduce its dollar expenditure, Australian markets are flooded with Virginian tobacco purchased from Great Britain. This tobacco had  f©  be paid for originally in dollars. However, the position can be easily understood when one examines the ninth provision of the American loan to Great Britain. If Great Britain desires to reduce its imports of Virginian tobacco, it must, at the same time, .reduce its imports of tobacco from Rhodesia and other Empire 'countries. These rigid provisions are detrimental to the whole economy of Australia .and the British Empire. </para>

                        <para>Yet it has nothing to say as to the " muddlemindedness" of committing ourselves to this very course by linking the pound to the dollar at a fixed rate of exchange. The rigidity of the exchange which all we signatories imposed upon ourselves with our eyes open, is one of the causes preventing the trade of Great Britain from developing as it should. The fixation of rigid exchange rates means that if the internal value of the currency alters and the purchasing power is reduced, as is the case in Great Britain to-day, the country is not able to place its goods in the markets of the world in competition with those of certain other countries. Consequently, this rigidity in relation to the dollar is probably injuring the whole Empire. </para>

                    <para>The draft charter and the International Trade Organization are designed to achieve full employment and raise the living standards of the people of the world. Whilst that objective is most desirable and estimable, the question which honorable members should ask themselves is: Will this charter achieve .that aim? According to the draft charter, the  object  is to be achieved by multilateral irade agreements, stabilized exchanges, the lowering of tariff barriers and the abolition of Empire preference, lt is a doubtful proposition to argue that multilateral agreements, with the lowering of protective barriers, is advantageous if the removal of those protective barriers means that the internal economy of Australia, for instance, and its primary, secondary and tertiary industries are to be destroyed by outside competition. It would have been much better had the Australian and United Kingdom delegates who negotiated these agreements studied the lessons of history instead of laying down the absolute theory that free trade is the best system for the world, and that no benefits or blessings can be derived from protective tariffs. Will anybody deny that the great maritime power of Great Britain was largely the result of the navigation laws passed in the days of Cromwell? Those laws, which were distinctly protective and restrictive, developed  the fleets  of Great Britain in the face of competition from other countries. </para>
                    <para class="block">To-day, there is a great unevenness of manufacturing capacity throughout the world. Largely, this capacity <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> centralized in the United States of America. In these circumstances, there must be a flexible economic policy. No one oan say that free trade is the solution of world trade problems, or that the solution lies solely in protection. "We must select the economic policy most suitable to any nation at a particular time. I ask the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction whether he thinks that the International Trade Organization would have built up the manufacturing resources of the United .States of America and Germany against tb , British industrial development in the nineteenth century. If honorable members will cast their minds back, they Wl recollect that in that century Britain stood in the same predominant position in the manufacturing world as the United States of America occupies to-day. By the invention of the steam engine, the power loom, and other manufacturing machinery, Great Britain had captured the world's markets. At that time, the doctrines laid down by Adam Smith in his <inline font-style="italic">Wealth of Nations</inline> as to the benefits of free trade were preached in exactly the same way as the delegates of the United States of America and the theoryridden delegates of our own and other countries to which free trade is not nearly so suitable as it is to the United States of America preached them at the international conferences held recently. In those earlier times, of course, Britain preached free trade because it held the world's markets, as America does to-day. But there was another voice in the land, that of Frederick Lizt, who wrote in his <inline font-style="italic">National System of Political Economy</inline> that while free trade was an excellent doetrine for the British people, it was- not so good for countries which were lagging behind Great Britain in manufacturing capacity. He also pointed out that, under the famous Methuen treaty between Great Britain and Portugal, in the eighteenth century, Britain permitted Portuguese wine - afterwards known as port - to come in at a lower rate of duty than the wines of France, and that the immediate effect on the Portuguese manufacturing economy was that fourteen cotton mills in Portugal were closed down within two or three years, and all the cotton requirements of that country were imported from Great Britain. "While that may have been excellent for Great Britain, it was not so good for Portugal. If multilateral agreements are to whittle down Empire trade preference, we shalnever be able to restore Britain's great manufacturing capacity to what it was in the nineteenth century and we shall always be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water for countries like the United States of America, which has the greatest manufacturing capacity in the world to-day. I remind the House, also, that America has within its own boundaries the greatest free trade area in the world. There are no tariff barriers between the States of that nation. There is, of course, the encircling tariff protecting the nation as fi whole. There is a difference in degree, but not in essence, between the position of the United States of America and that of the British Empire. "We have felt for many years that the manufacturing capacity of the Empire should be dispersed instead of being concentrated in one small island in the northern hemisphere. Consequently, Dominions erected tariff barriers to encourage the establishment of manufacturing industries in Canada and Australia. South Africa, too, is following suit. But, as an overall guardian, like the tariff of the United- States of America, we have the system of Empire preference which has dammed back the goods of other countries and enabled the nations within the British Commonwealth to strengthen their own industries, and in the case  of  the Dominions to attract industries from the United Kingdom itself. However, if these international trade agreements become operative all the work of the past will be destroyed. "We shall lose our great manufacturing capacity, and we shall never have an opportunity to restore it. Multilateral trade agreements are not the solution of our difficulties. ' Again I refer to the writings of Adam Smith in his <inline font-style="italic">Wealth of Nations.</inline> He points out that the internal trade of a nation is of much more value to it than its external trade. Is it not  of  much more advantage to us to be able  to  supply our own requirements by manufacturing goods in this country? The turnover of capital and goods is much quicker, and clearly the finished! product must be much cheaper than it would he if the raw material had to be transported overseas at considerable cost, and the manufactured article returned to this country, again subject to a substantial freight charge. Multilateral trade agreements and the breaking down of tariff barriers can only paralyse existing industries, and prevent the development of Australian manufacturing capacity with its consequent scope for the employment of the many thousands of migrants that we must bring to this country. Before the revolt of the American colonies, the great. Pitt, Lord Chatham, said in the House of Commons that the American colonies should not be permitted to manufacture so much as a single horse-shoe nail. The result of the proposed world treaties may well be that. some, day another nation may say that Australia should not be allowed to manufacture so much as a single horse-shoe nail. I do not believe that there is any reason why our present dollar shortage must be solved by a system of restrictions within the British Commonwealth. I believe that if we were cut out of the Bretton Woods-. Agreement and also- the linking clause with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the exchanges of the world were freed, there would be a rapid development of international trade because the devaluation of the currencies,, which to-day are overvalued in terms of dollars, would have the effect of restricting imports of goods from dollar areas because they would become too- expensive. It would also, have the effect of encouraging exports to dollar areas from countries <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> which currency devaluation had taken place because the. goods exported would bo much cheaper in terms of dollars than they were before. There are only three methods by which dollars can be obtained' - by the interchanging of goods, by public loans from the United' States of America to countries which are clamouring on America's doorstep for assistance, or by private investment by the United States of America in those countries desirous of securing assistance. I think that the best method of all is' that, of private investment. In " Can Dollars Save the World ? " Hazlitt has written on this subject as follows: - </para>

                    <para class="block">The gap in the dollar requirements of Great Britain that must be closed this year is about £600,000,000 sterling. If the collieries of Great Britain, a country which should not need to import coal, produced the 80,000,000 tons per annum that is being lost, the financial return to Great Britain would be about £stg.320,000,000, calculated at the present export price of about £4 per ton. This would go a long way towards balancing the deficit of £600,000,000 because, in addition to the actual monetary return, the necessity for purchasing large quantities of expensive American coal would be avoided, and other imports from the United States of America would be reduced because the commodities could be  imported from Europe in exchange for coal, which is urgently needed on the Continent to-day. </para>
                    <para>Therefore, the solution of our problems does not lie in multilateral trade agreements. The signing of such agreements appears to me to be rather like trying to put a roof on a house before the walls, the floors, or the foundations have been constructed. The solution lies in increas- ing production and in bringing about a condition of prosperity amongst the members of the British Empire and the nations of the world. After that has been achieved and we have a comfortable surplus of exportable goods over our own needs, then by all means let us enter into multilateral trade treaties and agreements if they will prove advantageous to Australia and the British Empire. This wild, mad desire that we should enter into multilateral trade treaties so as to develop our foreign trade leaves me "s'.one cold", because I believe that the happiness and prosperity of the peoples of the British Empire can be assured only by their own efforts. .That condition will certainly not be brought about by flooding our markets with manufactured goods. </para>

                            <para>- I shall tell honorable members. In his speech last night, the honorable member for Watson approached the subject of international trade and Empire preference in exactly the same spirit. He denounced Empire trade and British preferential duties and accused Britain of greed and selfishness in its dealings with this country. I, for one, found his remarks particularly hard to listen to, especially since the honorable member, who trades with countries outside the Empire, dared to criticize an agreement which has served this country and the Empire so well. The point of attack on the Ottawa Agreement chosen by the honorable member was rather extraordinary. He said, in effect, that it was a foolish system, and one ' quite unworthy to be followed. The reason which he advanced to support this contention was that, while the Ottawa Agreement conferred certain advantages on Australia, it also benefited Great Britain. That is an extraordinary point of view. Apparently he objects to the Ottawa Agreement because it is a " two-way " agreement and he- is only accustomed to " one-way " contracts. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>What are the merits of the Ottawa Agreement as compared with the merits of the nebulous scheme now before us? No one can point to any specific advantage to be gained by this country by its adoption of the proposed charter. I was very young when the Ottawa Agreement was signed, but I remember quite clearly the large number of cartoons and special articles which appeared in the press when its terms were announced to the country. One cartoon showed the delegates to that conference " Bringing home the bacon ". It was typical of the Ottawa Agreement, which brought to Australia certain definite benefits in respect of beef, mutton, bacon, dairy produce, fruit and sugar. Because of the Ottawa Agreement markets were created to absorb our entire exportable surplus of primary produce. That was something tangible and definite. Therefore, I say that it is ludicrous for honorable members opposite to compare the Ottawa Agreement with the draft agreement now before us, which offers us absolutely nothing,  whereas the Ottawa Agreement resulted in the development of the substantial overseas trade which we have enjoyed during the past fifteen years. </para>
                    <para>I do not set my face against international agreements and organizations as such, but only a fool would believe that the creation of those organizations will, in itself, confer benefits upon us. That comment applies equally to " organizations set up for defence and the promotion of trade. Let us consider the history of some of those organizations. The League of Nations was, in itself, a most beneficial organization, and the mere fact that it existed enabled the leaders of the nations to meet together and to settle minor differences. However, as events proved, the League of Nations was quite incapable of averting a major conflict of any kind. The security of British countries rested entirely on. the strength of the British Empire, and their development and prosperity depended on the agreements which they were able to make amongst themselves and with their allies. The same comment might be applied to the United Nations. On the rare occasions when the Minister  for  External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> - appears in this House he tries to lead us to believe that, because the United Nations organization is in existence, there is no' need for us to pay attention to our defence or to the security of Great Britain and the Empire. However, when we review what the United Nations has accomplished, we realize that it has done very little. It was not able to prevent the recent occurrence in Czechoslovakia, and its intervention in Palestine has only succeeded in aggravating the unfortunate disputes in that country, which will presently culminate in a major tragedy. The same comment applies to the international body set up to manage world economics and finance. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which was established with such a fanfare of trumpets, was quite impotent when Prance decided recently to alter the basis of its currency. The French Government took action without the slightest consultation with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Exactly the same thing will happen when the proposed Inter national Trade Organization is established. As the Prime Minister said, that body is, in a nebulous way, a beneficial one, inasmuch as it is helpful to have in existence some organization of the kind in order to minimize the worst consequences of commercial Avar, such as the imposition of the restrictive tariffs. At the. same time, it must be realized that the creation of such a body will not by any means ensure that markets will be opened for our goods or that our economy will prosper. One has to be particularly gullible to believe in the benefits proposed to be conferred by this idealistic organization. </para>
                    <para>Australia's representatives at the conferences which . resulted in the recommendation to establish the International Trade Organization have fallen into the trap of believing in the efficacy of that 'body. Those representatives were, almost without exception, bureaucrats. They .believed in the efficacy of control by officials, and they thought that even international trade should be regulated by officials. They had no confidence whatever in the ability of people or of nations to make arrangements to ensure their own prosperity. By and large, I think we sent abroad men who were theorists, who  lacked  personal experience of these matters, and who accepted very easily the arguments put to them in favour of abandoning the concrete advantages of the British preferential tariff system, and accepting this shadowy scheme. If the International Trade Organization means anything at all, it must mean that other countries will have far greater access to the  Australian market than formerly, and that we must be prepared to import far more than we do now. "We cannot afford to allow goods manufactured in countries with a lower standard of living to compete with goods manufactured here. The standard of living in Australia must ultimately be undermined by the importation of cheap goods. Honorable members opposite may deny my contention and say there are many provisions that will enable us to protect ourselves. That is quite true, because this agreement does not really mean a thing. Just as we can, on one pretext and another, prevent the entry of goods into Australia, so other countries can prevent us from exporting our goods to them. I see very little of concrete advantage that this agreement has to offer to Australia, and I can see a great deal that is distinctly to our disadvantage. We are already sufficiently weighed down with licences, officials, directors, deputy directors, commissioners and so on, but this agreement will transfer the existing regimentation from the national to the international sphere. Not only are we to have directions from Canberra at every hand's turn, but apparently we are also to have them from the head-quarters of the International Trade Organization. The people who trade, produce goods and add to the nation's wealth are to have upon their backs not only a national but also an international army of bureaucrats. </para>

                        <para>s.-On the 25th Feb ruary, the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Howse)</inline> asked the following question :  - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Can the Minister for the Army inform me whether an order has been issued by Army Head-quarters to rifle clubs in New South Wales directing them to reduce their effective membership by 20 per cent.? This direction seems to be unreasonable, inasmuch as rifle clubs in that State have, for some time past, been limited to an overall membership of approximately 11,000, and in the case of at least one club, namely, the OrangeRifle Club, 80 per cent of the members are ex-servicemen. Will the Minister review the extraordinary direction issued by Army Head-quarters ? </para>
                    <para>I have investigated this matter and now inform the honorable member as follows :  - </para>
                    <para>No orderwas issued by Army Head-quarters for  a  reduction of the membership of rifle clubs in New South Wales, but it has been ascertained that an instruction was issued by the local rifle club authorities in that State that the membership should be reduced in certain cases. A direction has been given for this order and any restrictions imposed in regard to the enrolment of new members to be withdrawn. </para>

The Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following information: - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>During the recent review of import licences, it was ascertained that considerable quantities ofcyanogas were in transit to Australia. In view of this fact, the licences for these shipments were revalidated. However, in accordance with the necessity to reduce imports, from the dollar area to the indispensable minimum, import licences were cancelled in cases where shipment had not been made. The matter of granting licences for the importation of goods from the dollar area after the 30th June, 1948, is under consideration and it is not possible at present to' indicate the quantities of rabbit fumigants for which import licences will be authorized for the year ending the 30th June, 1949. </para>
