                        <para>- As the Minister for the Interior is, no doubt, aware, the position of divisional returning officers in Tasmania is different from chat of their colleagues' in the other States because Federal and State boundaries in Tasmania coincide and an agreement has been reached. However, « considerable injustice is done to one section of the electoral officers. As divisional returning officers in Tasmania are not permanent officers of the Electoral Office, and receive only a £50 allowance co supervise returns, tile real work falls upon the permanent clerks, whose salary range is not in any way commensurate with that of divisional returning officers in the other States. In view of the proposed redistribution of electoral boundaries, will the Minister inquire into the possibility of raising Tasmanian divisional .returning officers to the status of such officer? in the other States, with a consequent increase of the status and salary of the permanent clerks who at present are mainly responsible for the work performed? </para>

                    <para>- I have no knowledge of any other rackets in which the- honorable member for Gippsland may have been engaged, either before he entered the Parliament or since. 1 think he used an unfortunate turn  of phrase. If he had used the positive degree, he would have been safe; if hp had used the comparative, he would  not  have been in the position in which he finds himself now through indulging in superlatives. Perhaps when the Estimates for the Postmaster-General'^ Department are under discussion he will enlighten the honorable member  for  Griffith and others who believe that there may have been something in what b&gt; said. </para>

                        <para>- Can the Minister for Labour and National Service state the reason for the payment of subsidies to apprentices in certain trades during and after the recent war? Was the policy under which the payments were, or are made, intended to be a permanent or only a temporary one? Is the Government now withdrawing those subsidies and, if so, is it, by doing so, violating any agreement entered into with unions and employers? </para>

                        <para>- The reason for the introduction of the policy of subsidizing the wages paid to apprentices was that during the war years Australia suffered from a shortage of labour, as honorable members know, and " green or diluted labour was introduced into many trades. Amongst other methods adopted in an endeavour to achieve greater production was the payment of full rates to apprentices in the final year of their apprenticeship. That applied usually in the fifth year, but in a few cases the sixth year of apprenticeship. That policy was very successful but it was intended as a temporary war-time measure only. The policy was agreed upon by conferences in which representatives of employers, employees and the Australian Government took part. The parties agreed on the payment of subsidies during the final year of apprenticeship bringing the apprentices' wages to the full tradesman's rates, the cost of the subsidies to be shared equally between the employers and the Australian Government. As a natural result of the effluxion of time most of the apprentices who worked under the scheme have now completed their apprenticeship and are no longer entitled to the subsidy. At least 99 per cent. of apprentices are how working apart from the subsidy scheme. There has been no violation of any agreement whatever. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member will appreciate that the allocation of dollars to obtain imports is often difficult to -decide. Applications are received for permission to import tractors not only for agricultural use, hut also for industrial purposes. Before any restrictions were imposed on imports from the dollar ,area a thorough survey was ma'de by an inter-departmental committee of the reasonable requirements of all sections of industry, and subsequently the committee's investigations and recommendations were reviewed by a Cabinet sub-committee, which continues to review the position from time to time. The importation of tractors and tractor parts has been mentioned several times by the Leader of tn&gt; Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden), to whom I have pointed out that approval has been given for the 'imports tion of sufficient tractor parts to meet requirements. I understand that production  of tractors and other agricultural and industrial machinery by the Inter national Harvester Company of Australia Proprietary Limited and another manufacturing concern 'will commence this ;year, and it should be possible, by supplementing the supply with a limited number of imported machines, to meet demands. Th* allocation of dollars for importations of machinery requires that consideration be given to the plant requirements of * large number of industrial undertakings As an example, the continued development of the newsprint industry in Tasmania requires that a certain amount of machinery shall be imported, -and important industrial undertakings such a* those of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and Australian  Iron  and Steel Limited depend, to a consider able degree, on imported machinery. Thihonorable member referred to the  importation  of bottle-labelling machines I 'believe that  a  number of requests have been received from Australian Consolidated Industries Proprietary Limited and other firms for the importation of plant, and the honor able member will realize that the task of discriminating between the various  appli  cations is not very pleasant- </para>

                                <para>- I can assure the honorable member that he would find the task equally trying. All applications receive a thorough examination, and it i? inevitable that differences of opinion will arise about the priority which should he given to various industries seeking to import machinery. After all, the determinations .made are necessarily nothing more than the application of personal judgment to conflicting claims. A? an example of the difficulty which confronts the Government, I mention the applications made by newspapers from time to time for authority to import newsprint. It might be said that the curtailment of newsprint does not warrant theexpenditureof dollars ata timeof scarcity,and I do not suppose that the country would "gobung" ifthe newspapers hadto curtail further their circulation. However, the printing of newspapers is an industry, and the Government tries to meet thereasonable demandsof newspaperproprietors. However,the newspaper industry is onlyone of manywhich desire to import goods from the dollar area, and the selection of those industries which are most in need if imports involves the exercise of sound judgment. The honorable memberreferred to bottle-labelling machines. I think it is desirable that bottles should be correctly labelled. I shall have a statement prepared . onthe subject and shall furnish a copy to the honorable member assoon as possible. </para>

                    <para>-It is well known that there is a shortage of labour in South Australia. Strange as it may seem, on the cessation of hostilities it seemed likely that difficultieswould be experienced in providing peace-time employment for persons employed on war work in that State. When the war endedbetween 7,000 and8,000 employees inwar industries had to be permanently fitted into peace-time employment. As an indication of the successful absorption of those employees, I may mention that only twelve persons inSouth Australia are receiving the unemployment benefit. In collaborationwith the Ministerfor Immigration and his department, I am doing everything possible to provide additional manpower in South Australia. A great problem confronts the Ministerfor Immigration inimplementing his migration policy because of the shortage of housing accommodation. No migrants may be brought to this country unless a guarantee is furnishedthat accommodation has been provided for them. While it is true that more migrants have been brought to South Australiathan to any other State, that does not mean that no more will be provided for that State. Already plans are inpreparation for the building of a hostelat Gawler, and a conference is at present being held between representatives of the Australian Government, the South Australian Government and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limitedto consider the erection of large hostels for the workers at IronKnob and Whyalla. The Minister for Immigration is endeavour ingtocarry out his migration programme in such away as to ensure that the arrival of the newcomers shall not worsen the accommodation problem already existing in Australia. The honor able member mayrest assured that we are doing everything possible to obtain additional labourfor South Australia. </para>

I produce copies of schedules of reduced petrol rations to be applied to all issues of petrolration ticketsfromthe 1st January, 1948 and the 27th September, 1948. These schedules specify that the consumers' licences for class 21 users shall be printed onbuff or striped paper, and from the wording of the schedule this applies to New South Wales users only.What conditions prevail in New South Wales which render it necessary to have specially printed licences and a special class of users in that State? </para>

                        <para>- I do not knowthe exact reason why licences printed on buff coloured or striped paper are issued in New South Wales. After an investigation had been made of the issue of licences and petrol coupons the Director of Rationing, . Mr.Cumming,who controls petrol rationing on behalf of the Minister for Shipping andFuel, was asked to ascertainwhether it was possible to arrange for licences and coupons to be printed on paper of a kind which would render forgeries most difficult.Certain types of paper which were shown to me andwhich Idiscussed with the Minister and the Director of Rationing, were selected for that purpose. The precautions taken to prevent forgeries of petrol licences and coupons were the same as those taken in regard to food ration  coupons.  I assume that action will he Taken in the other States similar to that which has been taken in New South Wales. </para>

By way of explanation, I point out that, at the beginning of June of this year, Mrs. E. E. Miller, of Birdsall-avenue,  Condell Park, Bankstown, received a letter from the Department of Social Services, based on the assumption that her husband was dead. Enclosed, was a form upon which  she  could claim funeral expenses, and a request that she should return to the department her allowance book. Her husband had been discharged from hospital, and was at home when the letter was received. He visited the office of the  department  and protested, and. his wife later received a memorandum from the department containing the following passage :</para>
                        <quote>
                            <para> - it is regretted that, owing to the  department  being wrongly advised of the death of your husband, your Wife's allowance was  cancelled  in error.</para>
                            </quote>
                            <para> As this is not the first case of the kind to come to my notice, will the Minister ascertain the source of the department's information? Will he endeavour to arrange with the Registrar-General in the various States for the issue of death certificates, without which the Department of Social Services would not suspend pensions? </para>

                                is not the national secretary of the Communist party in Australia. He is the national secretary of the Federated Ironworkers Association, and I saw him in that capacity.

Actually, I was not so much concerned about their employment in the iron and steel industry as I was about their membership of
                                Mr. Thornton's
                                union if ' they should be employed in that industry. 1 intend to have a further discussion with
                                Mr. Thornton
                                after he has consulted the council of his organization, and I hope that it will not be long before employment is found for quite a number of displaced persons, Polish ex-servicemen and others, in various industries, including the steel industry, which are at present very much undermanned. The products of those industries are vital to the housing programmes of the Commonwealth and the States. 1 remind the right honorable member thai it is not only Communists in charge of certain trade unions who have offered, or are offering, objection to the employment  of immigrant labour. Many other people have wrong ideas about these matters. The British Medical Association, and some other organizations, might well have another look at this question with a view to deciding whether those persons who come to Australia possessing special skill and aptitude should not be given an opportunity to serve the country to the bes of their ability by using the talents they possess.

                        <para>- Last week I asked the Minister for Air whether he was satisfied with the rate of recruitment for the Royal Australian Air Force, whether squadrons are up to strength, and how many squadrons, other than those stationed in Japan, would be available for service in an emergency. In reply, the Minister stated that recruiting for the Royal Australian Air Force is on a satisfactory basis. However, it is stated in this morning's press, that only six men - three pilots and three ground staff - have been enlisted in Sydney's Citizen Air Force Squadron since its formation five months ago. Is the Minister still of the same opinion that recruiting for the Royal Australian Air Force is proceed- ing satisfactorily, and can he say if the statement in the newspaper article is correct? If it is, in view of the need for strengthening our armed forces because of the present international situation, will the Government consider adopting other methods to bring the units up to full strength? </para>

                            <para>- I answered a similar question by the honorable member for Balaclava last week by saying that recruiting generally is satisfactory. So far as Sydney's Citizen Air Force Squadron is concerned, I do not know whether the figures quoted by the' honorable member are correct, but I do not accept them as accurate. If the honorable gentleman has quoted from a newspaper article I should say that that sourceis extremely unreliable because many in correct reports have appeared in the newspapers from time to time, including some recent statements. I propose to deal with the matter of recruiting when the Estimates are before the House and shall make a statement then. I qualifymy previous reply that recruiting is progressing satisfactorily by saying that owing to attractive conditions obtaining in civil life for men following technical occupations, we are not satisfied with the number of technicians enlisting, but in other directions it has been reported to me that recruiting is satisfactory. I repeat that I do not accept figures from any newspapers in regard to these matters in the light of experiences I have had, which have been anything but satisfactory. </para>

I inform the House that yet another economic survey is being made of the Northern Territory, this time by the Division of Agricultural Economics. I met a representative of What division between Wave Hill and the Western Australian border a few weeks ago, when I was travelling through my vast electorate.. Will the Minister for Commerce, and Agriculture- say whether or not the purpose of that survey is to check up on opinions expressed by the honorable member for the Northern Territory? Will he also expedite the report of that officer' and table it in the Souse prior to the extension of: the  Rovril  and Vestey leases to 1980? </para>

                            <para>I address a question to the Prime Minister, not only in his capacity as head of the Government, but also as Treasurer^ in which capacity he is responsible for the allocation of money for the development of the- Northern Territory. Recently, in the guise of being philanthropic- to ex-servicemen, the Vestey interests surrendered an area of 9,000 square miles, 90 per cent, of which' was inferior land. The Minister for Transport is not yet able to announce what developmental or strategic railways are to be constructed in the Northern. Territory, and the Minister for Commerce and, Agriculture, has not yet received a report from his economic advisers who are: now. investigating conditions in the Territory. Notwithstanding, these facts, the Minister for the Interior has stated that he is about to extend for 30- years certain leases of land in the- Northern Territory which are held by Vestey and Bovril organizations: Will the Prime Minister prevent the Minister for the Interior from extending these leases and will he refuse to allocate money for the developmental work until the Minister for Transport has made a statement with regard to the construction of railways in the Territory and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has received the advice of the economic advisers to whom I have referred, and it is known whether the development of the Territory is to be done by  family  settlers or large interests? </para>

                            <para>- In conjunction with the Ministers concerned, I have devoted a good deal of personal attention to plane for the development of the Northern Territory and of similar areas in Western Australia. After studying all the report* that were available, including those that were made by the British experts who visited this country, it seemed to me that the only way in which to develop the Northern Territory on a large scale was to expand the beef producing industry there. Questions arose regarding the land in the Territory that is held under lease by the Vestey and Bovril interests. I do not want to comment upon the business methods of the Vestey organization, but I do not consider that its land ha?  been  used to its fullest extent. The Minister for Works and Housing, who is  familiar  with this kind of country, and also the Minister for the Interior and myself have given a great deal of thought to what should be done in respect of the land held by these companies, the leases on which: do not expire- until 1965, and proposals, were made for them to surrender a considerable- portion of the land and for the period of the leases in- respect of the remainder to be extended, subject to- the imposition of stringent conditions regarding its development. The arrangements that have- been made with Lord Luke in regard. to&lt; the areas; which are held under lease by the Bovril organization! are&gt; very satisfactory. They provide for a great deal of developmental work to be done, including the construction of fences and homesteads, and the provision of water. Frankly, I was not satisfied with the first proposition that was put forward by Lord Vestey. The Minister for the Interior has re-opened the negotiations and is insisting upon developmental work being done by Vesteys. The honorable member for the Northern Territory knows that the raising of stock and the production of beef in the Territory has been a haphazard business. Without the construction of fences, the provision of water and other facilities the land that is available in the Territory will not be used to the best advantage. It may be possible at a later stage greatly to increase the production of beef in the Northern Territory, to that large supplies may be exported to the United Kingdom. I discussed that matter with highly placed Ministers of the United Kingdom Government. Mr. Strachey, the British Minister for Food, recently made a statement in London in which he indicated that the proposals that had been made were receiving the earnest consideration  of the United Kingdom Government. I shall obtain a copy of the honorable member's question and ascertain whether there is anything I can add to what I have already told him. However, .he may rest assured that the Government is just as anxious as he is for a sound developmental scheme to be put into effect in the Northern Territory. [ 'believe that the major project awaiting development in the Northern Territory is beef production. This view is supported by Sir Henry Turner, who came to Australia with the British Food Mission. </para>

                            <para>- It is reported in the Melbourne press that the Prime Minister has said that consumption of aviation spirit will be limited to the present figure of 2,000,000 gallons. Does that mean that there will not be any reduction of the supplies of aviation spirit? As aviation plays only a minor part in production and as petrol supplies to farmers and other producers are being reduced, is that decision in accordance with the Government's plan for increased production ? </para>

                            <para>- The rate of consumption of aviation spirit has been under review for some time by the Minister for Civil Aviation, the Minister for Shipping and Fuel and myself as well as by departmental officers. It is quite evident that the rapid increase of the demand for aviation spirit for purposes other than aviation cannot be allowed to continue. The matter also involves the ever-present problem of dollars. The primary need 5s to maintain -existing aviation services and, perhaps, allow for the establishment of additional services in special circumstances. With that object, after an examination -of all aspects of the matter, the Government decided 'upon the arrangement, the details of which were announced last evening. That announcement sets out the special conditions under which aviation spirit will be made available in the future. If that statement does not completely explain the position to the honorable member I shall arrange to supply any further information he may desire. </para>

If not, will the Minister take steps to have the relevant legislation amended to prevent the re-entry of such "persons into this country, as such action is necessary for the purpose of safeguarding the internal security of this nation, particularly in view of the report of the Commonwealth Investigation Service released to the press last evening. </para>

                            <para>- An Australian cannot be refused the right of entry to his own country. It is the one country to which he can return. He has no right of entry to any other country. To suggest that an Australian-born person who leaves this country should be refused the right to return to it is to propose a new principle in immigration legislation that has never been advanced anywhere before. It is the most novel and also the most reactionary suggestion I have ever heard. To exclude permanently from their country of origin persons whose opinions one does not like is not the best way to deal with them. The suggestion made by the honorable member has not even been thought of by any government in any part of the world. Such things are not done by Great Britain or any other country of the British Commonwealth, or by the United States of America, where the immigration laws are much more rigorous than our own. I do not propose to do anything to prevent persons with valid passports coming back to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister for Information said in this chamber yesterday that the Government had an excellent precedent to guide it should it decide to nationalize broadcasting. That was a reference, of course, to a statement made by Sir Harry Brown and to certain events which have taken place in the United Kingdom. However, the Postmaster-General has said that there is no nationalization or socialization about the proposed new form of control of radio in Australia. In view of the confusion thai those conflicting statements may create in the public mind, I ask the Prime Minister whether he will make a clearcut statement that the Government doe not intend to assume control of commercial broadcasting or to nationalistic whole broadcasting system of Australia ? </para>

                        <para>- I made it perfectly clear a few days ago that Cabinet had recommended to the Parliamentary Labour party, that legislation should be introduced to establish a national broadcasting board. The functions of that authority, and the ambit of its operation* will be extensive, and they will be explained to honorable members when the  relevant bill is introduced. I assure tie honorable member that it will not contain any reference to the nationalization of broadcasting. The Government has nOt considered that matter. </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Manchester Guardian</inline> to. which the honorable member has referred. Indeed, I have not yet been able to oblige the honorable member for Moreton by reading the article in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> which he gave me. As the result of requests from the Malayan Union through the United Kingdom Government, Australia offered to supply small arms and even military equipment that was available here for the maintenance of law and order in the Malayan Peninsula. I have already given details of the kinds of equipment which we have despatched at the request of the Malayan authorities. I also informed the Governor-General of Malaya, Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, that if the authorities later required more equipment of the type with which they had been experimenting, such as Australian " walkie-talkie " radio sets, that were sent with the first consignment, we would be prepared to arrange to supply more of them. We have not considered doing anything in addition to rendering that assistance. No consideration has been given to sending any Australian forces to Malaya. I have not heard any comment from honorable gentlemen opposite about the decisions of the United Kingdom, India and New Zealand to withdraw their components from th, British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Through circumstances over which they have no control, the governments of those countries have either recalled their forces or have indicated their intention of doing so. They had strong reasons for their decisions, but the fact remains that Australia is now playing a greater part in the East and will continue to do so. At the request of the Malayan authorities, transmitted to us through the United Kingdom, we are contributing assistance to preserve law and order in the Malayan Peninsula, as far as we physically can do so, but we have not considered sending any forces to that area. </para>

                        <para>.- The proposed vote for the Prime Minister's Department provides for an estimated increase of expenditure of approximately £350,000 by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. This includes £31,750 for the investigation of nuclear energy. I believe that the committee is entitled to some information about the kind of research work that is to be performed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, particularly that associated with secret defence projects. Quite recently a controversy arose in this country over reports that the United States of America was reluctant to pass on to Australia information on atomic research for fear that it would leak out to Russia through Australian </para>

                    <para class="block">Communists!. The inference was that the United States, of. America, was not surethat the Council for Scientific and- Ind,ustrial Research, could, be; relied upon- to&gt; observe secrecy.. The Minister in charge o£ the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman),</inline> who is also: Minister for' Defence, rightly defended the council.. Hie said that there was no. basis- for the reports. However, the reports persisted, and caused quite a lot of concern to the1 people of this country, particularly in view- of the repeated disclosure: <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> this- chamber of the close association of members' of the staff of the Council for- Scientific andi Industrial. Research with Communist activities.. The people of this country areseeking a clear cut statement from' the Minister on- the extent to which theCouncil for Scientific and Industrial Research is to be engaged in atomic research', and is- to share defence secrets. Throughout World' War II., the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research cooperated closely with the services on secret defence projects'. The- controversy on the reported American attitude towards sharing atomic energy secrets with Australia,, drew statements from some highly placed officials of the Council for Scientific, and Industrial Research. Although the Minister for Defence said chat there was no foundation for the reports, no less a person than the  chairman  of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett, was subsequently reported as. having said that military science should be dealt with in special laboratories under- the- control' of military authorities. He added that secrecy and integrity in science could not flourish together, and that those who; preached secrecy for security were false guides. Those are interesting observations by a gentleman who knew quite well that the instrumentality which he controls had co-operated closely and successfully with, the defence, authorities during the.. war. Significantly, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David's opinions</inline> are supported- by Communists who themselves are participating- in scientific investigations. For. instance, Dr: R. E. B-. Makinson, senior lecturer in physics at the Sydney University, said that science,, to, develop,, must have a free interchange: £ ideas- and; information. That, in&lt; effect, is. the opinion expressed by Si:. David Rivett. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr., Makinson</inline> admitted that he was.  chairman  of the Science Committee of the Communist party ye? he is senior lecturer- in physics at th». Sydney University and, as we all know, physicists have played a. prominent pan in the atomic bomb and' atomic energy experiments. The Minister- for Defence stated that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research had nothing to dfc with secret defence- work, but I have already pointed out to the Ministerand it is common knowledge amongst members- of this: chamber, and1 in the community generally - that during, the war the Council' for Scientific and Industrial Resea.rch worked in close co-opera1 tion with various defence organizations and the services, and that, in connexion with the guided weapons experiments ii Central Australia, which is a joint United Kingdom and Australian project, scientists of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research have been sent te the British atomic research establishment at Hartwell. I understand that arrange ments are in hand' to send more Australian officers to- Hartwell. Thi? would indicate that the Minister's assurance that the Council for Scientific and Industrial. Research has nothing to do with secret defence projects- i* so much eyewash. The investigationswhich will be carried out by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research oithis year's vote will include radio ann aeronautical research, which may or mav not be related to.- secret defence work Similarly, the nuclear energy investigations, may or may not be of a. secret' defence nature.. 1 do not know. What I seek, from the. Minister is a clear-cu statement to set the mind of the genera public at rest, and I ask him now to say to what extent the Council, for Scientific and- Industrial Research will share top. defence secrets, particularly those relating to the guided weapons range and atomic research. I should like to know, also, why scientists' are being sent to Hartwell if the Government does- nol intend to&gt; associate some section of. the Council, for Scientific, and. Industrial Research with atomic research.. If the. Minister can make these- things, clear: tei tha committee, and. to the country,,  w*--  shall know! whether our. fears, are' well-founded; or. whether we, can leave, the matter entirely to tha Minister, knowingthat: the- military authorities, will eventually assume control of all those investigations. I am not at all. satisfied that secrecy can be observed when, associated, with, this department, are men who have, definitely communistic ideas and who are closely associated with.  Com.munist  bodies. Such individuals! have the. opportunity to come into contact with defence secrets. The existence of those secrets is,, in: fact,, the present, cause of. most of the world's unrest. I. put it. to. the Minister foc Defence that if there is »ny suspicion in his own. mind that his department is likely to harbour a. " leak." with regard, to matters that may be con: /eyed. to. it through its scientists at Hartveil or through other scientists connected, with the. guided weapons, range or who,, because of their standing in science, are consulted' with regard to developments in1 atomic energy research in the United1 States of America, he must take steps to see that such secrets- are safeguarded. Ct is of no use to tell the Parliament that Australia has an investigation- service: which can keep a close watch on the pos* ability of leakages, because1 honorable members know that the investigation!, service- is neither big enough nor efficient! enough' to do- <inline font-style="italic">so,</inline> nor has; it the informawon necessary to give to the. Government! » clear-cut report. Honorable members know full well that in another part- of the British Empire which relied on- a body, almost simi'lar to our' own investigation service&gt; it was only by chance that the discovery was1 made that' within that country's borders- espionage over1 a- wide field' was being* conducted1 toy Soviet Russia. In that" portion of the Empire there- were men- in high government positions; in departments^ in diplomatic circles, in science institutes, and even in the- country's' parliament itself; who had: revealed" to- Russia secret information1 relative to atomic development. Honorable members know that the uncovering o£ that espionage organization resulted' in those, individuals* being placed behind bars, as traitors to their country; No such action has- been instituted in- Australia, although. I refuse- to&lt; believe- that there is» not in* this country, ato this very moment, a counterpart-, cf that espionage organization. I believe' that such an* organization is, indeed, well established her.e.. We have in this country the  chairman  of the Communist part? science committee occupying the posit tion of senior, lecturer in. physics al the University of Sydney. He is. a physicist; who, by the very nature- of the university faculty, to which he if. attached, has. close contact with nuclear energy, investigations and must know a great deal about, that branch of science. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I repeal that in our midst in Australia we have a body of' men who are avowedly foreign agents, and have set up a science committee to which the chief lecturer in physics- at' Sydney University deliverslectures; That gentleman has1 made a statement which tallies with the statement made by the  chairman  of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to the effect that if there was to be scientific development scientific subjects must be freely discussed and not kepi secret.. I say- to the Minister- thai he' has- a1 great- responsibility on hisshoulders1 to-day. World' conditions border closely on another world' war. The very factors1 I have- enumerated to-day are1 the' basis of the failure' of rival powers' to come to- an agreement: which would, give the world a promise of peace1. One nation possesses' the- secret of atomic energy and. another, is. desirous- of obtaining, that, secret. There can be no rapprochement between- them, until their differences in, that regard' are resolved. If there, is. one weak. link, in the. chain of democratic countries, which, are seeking, to protect their democratic ideals- and? which, to some extent, share the knowledge of atomic developments, and information of a. secret defence' character that weak, link will endanger the strength of. the. whole chain. Honors able members know- that the United States of America is. reported to. have announced that it will, not communicate information, concerning' developments, <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> atomic energy and. scientific defence, research to- Australia, because it fears.-, that, there may- be. a leakage of it. to: Russia through, the Communists  here. That in itself should be sufficiently serious to cause the Australian Government to take steps to ensure that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and all other departments through which such information might leak to the enemy, will be purged completely of the Communist element. I very seriously direct the attention of the Minister to those considerations, although I am certain that he is aware of them, as they have been the basis of discussion in the Parliament. The Minister is perfectly well aware of the charges that have been levelled against Communist sympathizers within the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. He was party to the appointment to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, of a man, who, I am satisfied, has Communist sympathies. I do not know the whole of that man's family but I know that his brother was a reporter on the Communist newspaper, <inline font-style="italic">Tribune,</inline> which he represented in the press gallery of this Parliament. That man was an acknowledged Communist, yet he is a member of the executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. He is a possible " leak ". Perhaps he would not give away information intentionally, but he might do so in discussion in the family circle or by chance, perhaps by a loose word. On the other hand he might intentionally divulge secrets, and that information might flow through to the Soviet authorities. </para>

                    <para>If we value our freedom, there must be no weak link in the chain of democratic countries with regard to defence secrets. I believe that there should be a thorough tightening-up throughout the democracies, so that the secrets of atomic energy, which they hold in trust for the world, cannot be discovered and exploited by some other power whose ideology embraces the objective of the crushing of democracy. The secret of atomic energy, while it remains a secret, is the best form of defence the democracies could have. I hope my remarks will open a discussion in this Parliament during which the Minister will take the opportunity to assure honorable members and the country that the most complete precautions have been taken against the possibility of any leakages of top secret information from his department or through men connected with nuclear energy research. Such an assurance is necessary, because, as ] have stated, information from Australian scientists at Hartwell and others who are in close touch with atomic development comes to Australia and might, if there were a leakage, be passed on from this country to Russia. Australia is not trusted by America with any information about atomic energy developments, and, being suspect, we should clear ourselves of that suspicion. The Minister now has an opportunity of either making a statement for the satisfaction of the committee and of the people of Australia on what precautions are being taken to prevent the disclosure of secrets, or of at least advising the committee and the country that he proposes to take the necessary action to give some sense of security to the people he represents. </para>

                        <para>. - The Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> has raised a matter of some delicacy. He has, however, made a number of statements which I must deny most emphatically. From time to time I have stated in this Parliament that the press of Australia and the Opposition parties generally, have done a great disservice to the country by the wild charges which they have made in relation to security matters. Recently an article appeared in » Sydney newspaper to the effect that the Government of the United States of America was withholding from Austral all information regarding atomic energy, and although there was no truth whatever in that allegation, the Acting Leader of the Opposition has just made a similar assertion. The truth is that under an act of Congress, the Government of the United States is not permitted to pass on to any country information about atomic energy. </para>

I have examined the relevant United States statute, which is described in the preamble as " An act for the development and control of atomic energy ", a copy of which I have in my possession. Section 10 of that act, which is headed Control of Information ", provides - Until Congress declares by joint resolution that effective and enforceable international safeguards against the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes have been established, there shall be no exchange of information with other nations with respect to the use of atomic energy for industrial purposes. </para>

                    <para>Mi-. DEDMAN.- If the Acting Leader of the Opposition knew anything about atomic energy, he would realize that any information concerning its use for industrial purposes could also be applied to military purposes. Although that should be obvious to any one who reflects on the matter, a Sydney newspaper did not hesitate to make sensational allegations in headlines 1 inch deep, and the Acting Leader of the Opposition has repeated those false aggregations in this chamber. In order to emphasize the true position 1 repeat that the United States Congress has prohibited the release of information regarding atomic energy except by a joint resolution of both Houses of Congress- </para>

Tt is true that the Estimates for the 'Council for Scientific and Industrial Research 'include an item to cover expenditure on a 'series of experiments in nuclear physics that are being carried -out at the University of Melbourne. Those experiments, which have been undertaken at the instigation of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, relate. to atomic research. The reason why such research is being conducted now is that in the event of -war occurring we shall have available the services of at least a few scientists who know something of atomic energy. I have been assured that no classified information regarding the progress of the research being made at the University of Melbourne is supplied to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. For many years past the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has " farmed out" research work to universities and other scientific institutions, such as the Waite Institute in South Australia, 'but apparently honorable members opposite are suggesting that that practice should cease immediately- </para>

Since I have been Minister for Defence T have taken a keen interest in security measures, and other Ministers of the .Government have given continuous attention to security considerations. I assure members of the committee that the Government will take every step necessary to safeguard our security. During the war the Council 'for 'Scientific and In dustrial Research engaged  in  research work connected with the defence of the country which was of an extremely  secret  -nature. The staff of  the  council carried  out  a great deal of highly secret research  in  the development of 'radio physics - and the evolution of radar devices, a matte; about which I can tell members of tincommittee an interesting story. When 1 became Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research 11 the latter part of  1941  I discovered tha only one radar device was operating it Australia. That radar device  wa*  operating near Port Kembla. Instead of having radar devices all round the coast of Australia  to  detect enemy submarines or vessels approaching our coast, only one existed, and that  was  the one at Port Kembla. The second installation erected was established at South "Head, Sydney, and was made of bits and pieces taken from the laboratories of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Had all of the* work of the most highly secret character been developed much earlier we should have been able more adequately to protect this country when Japan declared war upon us. When the installation was established at Port Kembla I  inspected  it and took some part in. its operation. Opposition members should be ashamed of" themselves for their lack  of  initiative in developing these device* before the war. </para>

                            <para>- Of course I do,  and  I shall 'state it. The reason was because the Opposition, when it formed the  government  of this country, so starved the Council  for  Scientific and Industrial Research of the necessary funds  to carry on  its work, and so neglected opportunities  fox developing the secondary industries of this country,, that, these- devices were: [lot: available to us. I mention this because I. want to make it clear that, during, the whole of the war period, the Council for. Scientific and Industrial Research was engaged in most highly secret work. There was never one single leakage then, and there has- never, been one since. </para>

Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, have nothing to them. The Acting, Leader of the Opposition quoted' a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett and sought -,o make capital out of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> is not alone in expressing the view that in order to advance in the field of knowledge generally science must be completely free. That opinion is shared by <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> great many scientists, throughout the  world.  In fact, because of certain allegations made in the United States of America, 40 per cent, of the scientists engaged on a particular project there have resigned their positions. They say that they will not carry on under conditions which, 'leave them open to be continually sniped at merely because they uphold what they believe to be their right to be completely free to publish the results of the experiments they undertake. </para>

                            <para>- I am sorry to have to say this, but I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. David</inline> Rivett that science will progress more speedily only if there is a complete exchange' of information. I say that deliberately; but I also say that in certain circumstances, such as those which prevail to-day, it is absolutely necessary that some scientific experiments- and research work, should .be kept entirely secret. "When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett made hisstatement! he- was merely repeating what <inline font-style="italic">et</inline> great many other scientists, have said the world over. In-, order, to ensure that the work of the Council for Scientific a,nd Industrial. Research shall be of: the- kind in. respect* of which there can be complete freedom, of exchange of information, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. David.</inline> Rivett suggested that if defence scientific research projectswere undertaken in. Australia they should be undertaken, not by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, but by a special defence scientific research, section, established in the Department, of Defence, or. some other appropriate, department. As I. said earlier,, the Council, for .Scientific, and' Industrial Research was engaged- in very highly secret work during, the war. ! also said, not long ago,, that the council, was not now engaged in any work of a, secret character. That state, of affairs- may not continue. In. fact, the position, is.- changing, at the. present- time. If defence scientific work is, to he. undertaken in. Aus.tralia, and it. will be undertaken in the. not distant future, the.- Government will make the, necessary changes, either by altering the structure of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research or by transferring, certain work from the; council to a special defence scientific research division of the Depart-1 ment of. Supply and Development. What the Acting Leader of. the Opposition has. suggested has already claimed the atten-tion  of the Government.. I propose to quote from a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr., David.</inline> Lilienthal;  chairman  of the Atomic Energy Committee in the United States of America. Prior to occupying, thai important post, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lilienthal</inline> was  chairman  of the Tennessee Valley Authority. I quote his. -words to. show that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David.</inline> Rivett is not the only scientist, of authority who believes that there is some.thing in the claim of scientists that there should be complete freedom of exchange of information. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lilienthal</inline> said - </para>

                        <para>America's leadership in this new and fateful field of knowledge requires a stupendouseffort.

                        <para>Our leadership, depends upon developing new knowledge, and the new applications nf that knowledge. Guards, and fences, and investigators ... all these have a place; an important, place. But guards and fences, and investigators do, not develop new knowledge, about atomic energy,, nor new application.of knowledge, and our position in- the- world and' our progress in- this-- field requires that we know more and more, and that we know? it first . . . This takes people, a particular kind of people . . . We must have the very best qualified people in the United States . . . otherwise we face the imminent threat of stagnation. </para>

                    <para class="block">That statement shows not only that it is necessary to allow a certain amount of freedom to scientific investigators if they are to make any progress in the field of scientific knowledge, hut also that a great deal of what amounts to pure " bunkum " has been talked about this question of locking up the secrets of atomic energy. In fact, what a great many people call " secrets " in relation to atomic energy are widely known and may be read in any text-book. All that is hidden from the outside world is the technique of the application of knowledge which is already very widespread and is held by almost every country in the world. The Acting Leader of the Opposition quoted the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett, to which I have referred. He said that that statement was similar to statements made by Communist leaders. He almost went so far as to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett was capable of doing what the Communists had done. </para>

                            <para>- The Acting  Leader  of the Opposition does not accept my assurance. I am just as much entitled to refuse to accept his denial that he was ever a member of the New Guard. 1 have gone into this matter closely since I have been the Minister for Defence, and, indeed, even before that. It is true that certain persons, who are engaged in activities on behalf of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, are reputed to be Communists. It is not  easy  to prove whether a particular person is, or is not, a Communist because it is not easy to get evidence. It must be remembered that about 5,000 persons are employed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and it would  not  be surprising if among that number there should be one or two reputed Communists. I have seen in the office of the Commonwealth Investigation Service the tiles dealing with these persons, and I assure honorable members that none of them is connected with any matter relating to defence, or defence scientific  research </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it applies to him. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> has referred to a man who was appointed about twelve months ago as a photographer in the plant investigation section of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. What kind of defence secret could come into the possession of a photographer in the plant investigation section? The method of appointment of officers and members of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is exactly the same now as it was when it was first fixed by the nonLabour government that was in office in 1926. It has never been altered. As a matter of fact, one of the persons who, according to the files, is reputed to be a Communist was appointed to the staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research during the time that the Communist party was banned by a non-Labour government. </para>

                            <para>- The point is that the Menzies Government banned the Communist party; and yet, while that party was banned, it was possible for a person, who was reputed to be a Communist, to be appointed to the staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. As I have said, the method of appointing employees of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has not varied since the council was first established. The executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research makes a recommendation to the Minister, who, of course, has to deal with a great number of appointments every week.  The staff of the council is constantly changing. Persons move from the universities to the council for longer or shorter periods in order to conduct certain specific investigations. When their work is finished, they may go back to the universities again. Thus, the council is not like the Public Service in which persons usually remain all their working lives. Moreover, the staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is growing. I said earlier that non-Labour governments had starved the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, but since I took charge of the Council its expenditure on scientific research has been multiplied fivefold. It is true that a comparatively large number of appointments are continually being made to the staff of the council. Changes of personnel are taking place all the time. Some of the council's staff go to the universities, whilst some from the universities are taken on to the staff of the council. I am not satisfied with the method of appointment of staff to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which has been in operation since 1926, whereby the executive makes a recommendation for approval or otherwise by the Minister. I did not introduce the method. </para>

There are -some very difficult matters of procedure to be .settled, and <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> am not, at present, going to suggest the way in which <inline font-style="italic">.1</inline> would like that done. -Let us consider what might be the position where, in relation to a particular vacancy, two persons apply. One of them, let -u3 say, is described :as :a  "fellow  traveller ",, that is, not :a member of the .Communist party, but a person who has, by a public statement, made lit clear that he has views somewhat resembling those of the Communists. Supposing that individual is an applicant for a job in scientific research which "has no connexion with defence at all, but is perhaps in the division dealing with plant investigation The other applicant let us say, is a person whose qualifications are very poor. Who should be appointed? Should the individual with the high qualifications be eliminated merely because of his political views? That is -a difficult matter to settle and [ am not going to deal with it .too deeply 'at the moment "because, as I have said, in the not far distant future, honorable members opposite will have an opportunity of perhaps giving me .some  advice as  to howa .situation of that kind  should  :be dealt with. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw the words " lying statements " and substitute for them " the usual Dedman statements The Minister at the conclusion of his speech said that the press of Australia was untruthful and misleading and did Australia a disservice in publishing reports to the effect that, because of uncertainty concerning adequate security measures against communism in this country, certain information had been withheld by the United States of America from the United Kingdom Government as well as from the Australian Government. I shall quote a confidential statement. I challenge the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> and the Minister for Defence, to deny that the Prime Minister told the British Cabinet, on the 8th July, at a meeting held at No. 10 DownLngstreet, at 10.30 a.m. - that he understood the United States authorities were reluctant to communicate to Australia certain specially secret information about the progress of research and development on atomic energy. This reluctance might be due, in part, to their belief that the Australian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research was not fully under control of the Australian Government. And it was true, that in a public speech delivered some months previously, the head of that council had stated his view that his organization should not concern itself with secret work. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> was most anxious to remove any impedimenta to the free exchange of secret information about atomic energy development between the Governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Australia; and he was prepared to make any reasonable adjustments which might be necessary for this purpose in the constitution of the scientific organizations serving the Australian Government in this matter. If necessary he would he prepared to arrange that the scientists engaged on this work should form part of a regular government department and undertake the corresponding obligations in respect of official secrets. He would be glad of an opportunity to discuss this matter with the appropriate United Kingdom Minister. </para>

I also give him the opportunity to deny the truth of another confidential communication which is that he told the executive committee of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research on the 6th July of last year that - the Prime Minister had told him that  information  from high sources in the United Kingdom had been received which made it quite clear that a number of United Kingdom Government departments were not certain that the Council for Scientific and Industrial  Research  could be entrusted with certain documents, and that feeling militated, in turn, against the United Kingdom as regards obtaining info,mation from the United States of America. </para>

                            <para>- I challenge the Minister to deny it. The Minister told that meeting - that American authorities had made n quite clear that they would not pass on to the United Kingdom any information unless it was certain that such information would nol be passed on to Australia. The Prime Minister could give him no details, but was, nevertheless, certain, in view of the source of hit information, that the feeling in the United Kingdom definitely existed, that was the important consideration. Unless something was done to retrieve the position, Australia would not get certain information of a  scientific  nature that affected defence matters. </para>

The charges made by the Acting Leader of the Opposition have been admitted by the Minister and are well known by every other member of this committee to be true. Briefly, the Acting Leader of the Opposition said that numbers of men who are either member? of the Communist party or closely associated with it are employed by the Council for .Scientific and Industrial Research and other government instrumentalities, and that, because of this fact, the Government of the United States of America has refused to supply to Australia secret, information about atomic energy. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister definitely did say that. Everybody in this chamber heard him. It is useless for him to be evasive on this matter any more. His talk of secrets in the past and secrets in the future reminds me of the passage in <inline font-style="italic">Through the Looking Glass</inline> - " Jam to-morrow and jam yesterday - but never jam to-day ". The facts have been proven. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to-day, as in the past, is dealing with important secrets. </para>

                    <para>In order to explain why the Government of the United States has not passed any secret information to the Australian government, the Minister quoted an act of the United States Congress. What does that act state? It provides, almost in these words, that " under this act no information concerning the use of atomic energy for industrial purposes is to pass to any other country ". Having quoted that provision, the Minister - and this is the cream of his whole argument - asserted that the use of atomic energy for industrial purposes is the same as the use of atomic energy for military purposes. The Minister has been in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for three or four years- </para>

                            <para>- It must have been an extremely bad lecture. Atomic energy was first developed for military use. The secret was discovered and a technique was worked out so that atomic weapons have nOW passed the experimental stage and are actually in existence. The first atom bomb has been improved to such a degree that the latest bombs are far more destructive. However, the development of atomic energy for industrial purposes is still in its infancy. The whole technique is entirely different from that required for military purposes, as the Minister knows well. The latter is merely a process that produces a reaction from uranium leading to a terrific and prolonged explosion. The use of atomic energy for industrial purposes requires conservation of power and its gradual release without ' bad effects to men or equipment. </para>

"When he declares that the- Government of the United States will not pass on. the secret of the atom, bomb because of the act which he quoted, he says something which he knows, to be untrue. I know that the report read by the Leader, of the Australian Country party is very close to the truth. At present,, representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States of America are in close consultation, not regarding the use of atomic energy for industrial purposes, but for the purpose of developing atomic power still further for military use. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> repeat that the Minister has endeavoured to mislead the Parliament and the country.

                        <para>All secret research in days of peace should be done in government laboratories, arsenals and proving grounds. [n the event of war, all our young scientists who for years have been absorbing the doctrine that there shall be no scientific secrets in peace-time, will be suddenly transferred to laboratories, arsenals and proving grounds, which have yet to be built, because the Minister has stated that atomic research cannot be undertaken in the laboratories of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. He makes statements of that kind because he wants to protect certain shibboleths and faiths, to the detriment of the interests of Australia. He has also stated that those laboratories, arsenals and proving grounds will be constructed in war-time. All honorable members know that once a war breaks out the greatest strain is imposed on all our resources. But, presumably, provision will be made for the building of laboratories, arsenals and proving grounds, in which the scientists will can? out their experiments. Both the Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett are living in a world of unreality. They have a hazy kind of faith in the honesty of a man in whose honesty we cannot trust. Since the conclusion of "World War II. we have learnt from bitter experience how badly the late  President  Roosevelt was advised by the late  President  Benes. He had assured  President  Roosevelt that he could trust the word of Stalin, even if he could not trust the word of any other Russian. We see what is happening in the world to-day. There is a cold war in progress. Last week I visited the migrant camp at Bathurst, where I met a sad-faced young woman. I was told by others that her mother had been raped seventeen times by Russian soldiers and then murdered before the eyes of this woman. Those are the people who, we are told, love all the world and are attempting to impose their beneficent democracy upon the peoples of the earth. These are the people that the Minister has defended. 1 claim that the address that was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett was a most dangerous one. In a period almost of war he preached, wickedly and wrongly, the most dangerous doctrines to. our young scientists. Nevertheless, the Minister has defended it. </para>

                            <para>- In the estimates for the Prime Minister's Department, under the heading " Council for Scientific and Industrial Research ", appear the words "nuclear energy". That phrase, I assume, refers to the splitting of the atom and the use of that process to cause an explosion in a bomb known as the atomic bomb. The atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were prototypes of the atomic bombs that are now being developed. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett said in his address that the secrets of the atomic bomb are only a set of engineering procedures - he dismissed it lightly in that way - which other nations are certain to develop in a few years. That statement would encourage young scientists to believe that it was not necessary to be secretive about the processes at all. Some months ago the United Kingdom Government sent to this country <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Percy</inline> Sillitoe, the head of MI5, which is, I understand, the security department of the United Kingdom Government. I do not know whether he came here at the request of the Australian Government. I am informed that his report upon security arrangements in Australia was of such a devastating nature that he would not disclose it to the Australian Government, but took it back to the Prime Minister of Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- My information comes from a high authority, who knows the Minister and with whom the Minister is acquainted only too well. I may disclose his name on some future occasion. I understand that the Prime Minister of Great Britain was so horrified at the contents of the report that he treated it as a key matter in his discussions with the Prime Minister of Australia when the right honorable gentleman visited Britain I understand, further, that the PrimE Minister of Australia himself was shocked when he saw the report of  what  this British expert on espionage had discovered in this country. Would anybody expect discoveries of any other kind to bf made? Many honorable members  have  studied the report of the royal commission which inquired into the activities of Russian spies in Canada, and many of us have read Victor  Kravenchko's  book. <inline font-style="italic">I Chose Freedom,</inline> and studied other accounts of Soviet espionage and fifth column work throughout the world. There is every reason to suppose that the Russians are doing the same in Australia as they are doing and have done in other countries. The Minister for Defence is now leaving the chamber, driven out by the cogency of my arguments, to warn the Prime Minister not to tell a different story. The security of Australia is supported by very thin threads. What has happened in other places in the world must undoubtedly be occurring here to-day. For those reasons, and because of what was said by the Leader of the Australian Country party and the attitude adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett in the address, " Science and Responsibility ", which was delivered at the University College in the City of Canberra, the greatest need exists for the Government to realize its responsibility and to take the strongest possible action to drive fifth columnists and Communists from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the defence departments and arsenals of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norman</inline> Sheppard, the chief metallurgical engineer in the Lithgow Small Arms Factory, is 'the secretary &lt;of the Lithgow Communist party. Lithgow is a town in the electorate of Macquarie, which -is represented by the Prime Minister. Australia needs patriots at its head, and not flirters with communism. </para>

The Minister 'for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">"Mr. Dedman)</inline> is the Minister who s charged with the responsibility for answering to the Parliament for the leeds .and misdeeds of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.

The Minister was followed by the Leader of r,he Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> who quoted from two documents hat he declared were confidential documents. Having regard to the spirit in which the Ministry has so frequently acted, I say that 'the right honorable gentleman was perfectly right in not disposing 'the source of his information. One of those documents, which I have now seen, concerned a statement which The Minister for Defence is alleged to have made to the executive of the Coun:11 for Scientific and Industrial Research a't Wentworth House, Me].bourne, on the '6th July of this year. The Minister made no attempt to deny or qualify the statement that was -made by <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> Leader of the Australian Country party.

To me, his face, -after the Leader of the Australian "Country party had dealt with .him, looked like » human Hiroshima after the atomic bom! had 'f allen. The Minister "has said thai the United Kingdom could safeguard itown atomic secrets. According to prem reports - -the Government has gray doubts about press information, but the Minister may have something to say about this - the United Kingdom Government has just fitted two aircraft -carrier and, 1 think, a 'cruiser for tests wit! atomic weapons. An endeavour is being made, of 'course, to make those vessel, proof against gamma rays and mother radio-active radiations 'from 'nuclear fission. T'he -ships are to 'carry animaLduring the tests. All this would indicate that the United Kingdom is now in -a position to produce atomic weapons ox its -own account, .and I -should like <inline font-style="italic">tiknow</inline> from the Minister whether  &gt;or  -not that press report is correct. <inline font-style="italic">M</inline> it i*correct, I should like to (know to whan extent -the Australian Government daware of the progress made in the production of atomic weapons' in the United Kingdom. In Australia to-day, are many officers -and men 'of the United Kingdon forces. 'Some of them are in "uniform and others in .civilian clothes. You have ruled, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> 'thai in 'discussing this item reference cannot be made to the Woomera guided weapon? testing range: but T invite you tto have  a 'look at 'the list -of kerns now 'before the committee. We are discussing radio research. Has that no relation to the guided weapons range ? I invite '£he Minister to deny that there is such an association. We are discussing aeronautical research. 'There, again, I suggest there is a relationship to 'the Woomera range. We are discussing  tribo-physics.  I admit, quite frankly, that I do not know what that is, but I "am certain that it does not have any relation to the Arunta. We are discussing radio physics and physical metallurgy. Surely without 'a proper 'investigation of physical metallurgy there will T&gt;e 'hold-ups 'at the Woomera range. That is one item, therefore, 'that "is intimately and inescapably connected with the development of the range. The next item is nuclear energyWill the Minister deny 'that jan investigation of t'his subject also is vital to the  successful  development of the Woomera range? Then comes meteorological physics. That term might cover -a .multitude of things. Fuel research, too, must be intimately connected -with guided  weapons,  because their propulsion depends upon fuel -of various kinds. Then we  come  to .item 25 on the list,  which  is " Unforeseen .and Urgent .Investigations ". That could cover :anything from Genesis .to "Revelation .and from Dan to Beersheeba. Therefore, it cannot be .argued that in .discussing this proposed vote we are not entitled to refer to &lt;he development of the Woomera guided  weapons  testing range. Is the Minister prepared to say that there will not be 40mA interest on the part .of the Aus.tralian Government .in the -development of gas turbines? <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> doubt these, too,  will  be tested in the interior, unless the Government is utterly .negligent .of its  duties in  this direction. </para>
                    <para>This &lt;deba'te hinges &gt;'on two .things': The first is the degree to which the Council for .Scientific and Industrial Research is to be trusted by the Governments of the United Kingdom &gt;and the United States of America with military secrets. The second is the degree to which the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett, speaks with the consent and the approval of 'the Australian 'Government. Had T 'been a member of the Government when certain -statements were made last year, I should have thought that the proper 'thing to do with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett would be to relieve him of his duties. He should "he reminded of the old adage. " He who pays the piper calls the tune " Ti <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> is not prepared to engage in defence research on behalf of the Australian .Government which pays him with the Australian taxpayers' money, the sooner 'he leaves t'he 'government service  the "better. There is no place for hin. in a properly -conducted government. He should -either obey the will, and conform to -the policy of the government which pays him, or get out and continue hit research at Iris own expense. 'Having done that, he could do what he liked with his findings, -within, -of course, the limitations imposed hy any common-sense government. The Minister is an old regular soldier and he knows perfectly well that in the United Kingdom, which gave 'him birth, there is the severest limitation on the right -o'f citizens to -convex military information out of the country Certain organizations about which  very  little is known or said, but much can bt imagined, are charged with the duty  of  ensuring the country's safety, and I nave no doubt that they are not unaware of some o'f the things  that  are going or in  the  Commonwealth to-day. Now thai the Minister has returned to the chamber I say to him that things have come to a sorry pass when we have the head o'f a great 'instrumentality like the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research virtually saying, "Although .1 ,get  my  money from the Government, and my job depends upon the Australian taxpayer, ] do not regard him in the slightest degree Who is the Australian taxpayer? Who is the Australian Government? 1 shall pursue my research and make the results known to the four winds, regardless o'f the effect on the Australian people, and regardless of whether the transmission of this information to some other country may result in -the death of '.thousands &lt;of Australian people ". That is .as near to treachery as one can get, and we must face that situation. </para>
                    <para>I repeat 'that in my fourteen years' experience in this  chamber  I have never witnessed a scene such as that -which occurred  this  afternoon when the veracity <inline font-style="italic">&gt;f</inline> a Minister was questioned by the Leader of an Opposition party. The Minister has not denied the charges that nave been made by the Leader of the Australian Country party. I hope that when I resume my seat we shall hear from the Minister in unequivocal language whether he did or did not, at Wentworth House on the  6th  July, make to the executive of the Couscil for Scientific and Industrial Research the statement attributed to him by the Leader of she Australian Country party. Finally, r.he state of the Council for Scientific «id Industrial Research to-day is such that it will not be long before private members of this chamber exercise their right to seek the appointment of a select committee to investigate the composition and the activities of that instrumentality. That is something that is urgently necessary. In the interests of Australia it is wise and just that we should know how the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is at present functioning. I shall not repeat certain names which have been mentioned during this debate. I have my views regarding those individuals which I have expressed on other occasions in this Parliament. As I have also stated on previous occasions, I have the highest admiration for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Its work in the field of agricultural research has been without equal anywhere in the world. The Parliament, however, is not now concerned with agricultural research. As the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> has stated, we are living in a state of " cold war ". That " cold war " may become hot at any time. Because of world conditions at the present time it is necessary that we should treat defence matters, or those which might impinge on the realm of defence, in an entirely different manner from that in which we treated them during the period between the two world wars. </para>

                        <para>. - At an early stage in this debate I attempted to draw a distinction between work of a defence nature and other types of work which are performed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The Opposition has continually brought into thisdebate the question of defence scientificwork. I have already made it quiteclear that if, at some time in the future - and that time is likely to be in the near future - work of a defence scientific research character has to be undertaken in this country, special arrangements will be made with regard to it. Honorable members of the Opposition have made certain statements and I shall refer particularly to those made by the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> and the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron).</inline> The honorable member for Barker said that he had read in the press a statement published a few days ago to the effect that the United Kingdom Government had fitted two aircraft carriers with &amp; device which would prevent radio activity, following upon an atomic explosion, from having any effect upon persons aboard the vessels. He asked me a specific question whether that was a fact and whether would I say- </para>

                            <para>- The question in thai form will serve my present purpose. The honorable member asked whether I would inform the House whether such tests were taking place. I say to the House, and to the country, that that question gives the measure of the responsibility or irresponsibility of the honorable member for Barker and other honorable members opposite. If I did know that the United Kingdom Government had had tests of that kind made and that everything that might be alleged in the press about this matter were true, would it be correct for me, as the Minister for Defence of this country, to say so to this House and thereby make it known throughout the world at large that those tests were in fact taking place? </para>

I do not intend to  tell the country, the honorable member for Barker, or anybody who might learn it through the medium of newspapers which circulate perhaps as far away as Russia, what tests are being undertaken dither in this country or in the United Kingdom, about which I may have some knowledge. The same remarks apply to the statements made by the Leader of the Australian Country party, who quoted from what appeared to be a semi-official document relating to discussions which had taken place at No. 10 Downing-street, London, between the Prime Ministers of Australia and Great Britain. I do not know whether what he quoted was a true account of what took place at No. 10 Downing-street, hut if I did know, ,the last thing I should do would foe to divulge in this House that the account was either correct or incorrect. In connexion with any statement which I am alleged to have made at a meeting of the executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, I say that what takes place at such meetings is supposed to be regarded confidentially. </para>

I am not going to take part in any debate about what happened at any meeting of the executive which I attended, the proceedings of which are assumed to be confidential. In relation to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the measures being taken to safeguard security in this country. I have already made it perfectly clear that the. Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is not at the present time in possession of any military secrets at all. That institution has nothing whatever to do with the guided weapons range project. Honorable members of the Opposition are hammering away at this question, although they know perfectly well thai everything they are saying about security in the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and scientific defence research is entirely untrue. </para>

                        <para>.- In the last few minutes the Parliament has listened to the most pitiful series of evasions from the Minister in charge of this department. It was obvious to-day, as it has been on other recent occasions, that the Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> will say anything at all in support of his case and that he has not even the slightest regard for the veracity of his statements. I propose to deal now with two matters in regard to which the Minister's attitude was most unsatisfactory. Certain definite charges: were made against the Government this afternoon, and: the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> produced documents and read a verbatim report on which he based charges of a most disturbing nature. Although members of the committee anxiously waited for the Minister to reply to those charges, the honorable gentleman simply stated that he refused either to confirm or deny that he had addressed certain remarks r,o members' of the Council, for Scientific and  Industrial Research. Similarly, he refused, to commit: himself in: regard to the conversation between, the British Prime Minister and. the Australian Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> although, be must be perfectly aware of the gist of that conversation and thecircumstances surrounding it. The reasonwhy he refused to make a definite- statement is that he knows- that he-- cannot deny those allegations. It is of no use for- him to endeavour to mislead the committee, because1 anything said at- the meeting- of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is recorded and its' utterance  cannot be denied. </para>

                    <para>The Minister had a great deal to say about leakages of information from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and challenged honorable members, on this side of the chamber to give specific instances of leakages which have occurred. Qf course, we cannot give any such details. In Canada, no one  could  have revealed the leakages that were taking place until a member of the Soviet legation informed the Canadian Government of what had been going on. for years under its nose. Are not similar ideal conditions for espionage present in this country? Are there not people associated with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, whom, no- one in his senses would, trust with confidential information? Are there not Communists in positions of authority under the- Government, and are there not " fellow- travellers " even <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> the Government itself? Does not the Soviet embassy maintain a swollen staff; which is very actively- employed ? Do not Communists like Jones and. Lockwood"attend overseas conferences, and meet representatives of foreign powers to whom they can confide any information, thai may be of-' value to those foreign powers f Circumstances similar to those which obtained, in Canada before the revelations of. the treachery which was occurring in that country were made, exist in Aus' tralia. It is utter nonsense to contend that,. Because no. public disclosure ha/ been, made of any leakage of vital information, such leakages are not. occurring. The time will come when the discovery of some particular breach, of security will reveal the degree of. espionage which is. occurring, and then we shall hear, a sorry tale of the leakages that are nov occurring under the present Government. </para>
                    <para>Although specific- allegations of a- most serious nature have been made against the Government no attempt has been made to refute them. The- Leader of the- Australian Country party said, in my opinion quite rightly, that Australia is not trusted by either the United Kingdom or the United States of America. In the  light  of the- serious state of affairs- that has been revealed' this- afternoon how could we possibly, be trusted by those countries? Indeed, we know that we are not trusted by the United Kingdom, and no one is more aware of that than is the Minister. Some time ago the United Kingdom Government sent to Australia members of M.I.5 for the purpose of inquiring into the security precautions taken in this country, and those officers will report to the highest authorities in the United Kingdom. Doe. the Minister see the reports of that organization ? </para>

                            <para>- I refer to Division, No.  12,  "Public Service Board, and I intend to say something in regard to the conditions of women employed in the Public Service. I have received a .number of letters from women employed .in Commonwealth departments and from various organizations of female officers, which reveal the existence of considerable dissatisfaction. Grave dissatisfaction is expressed that women who perform work similar to that of male officer* receive lower salaries than are paid to men, and it is alleged that women cannot expect promotion to senior positions unless they possess higher qualifications than male officers of the departments in which they are employed. Other grievances relate to salaries and .security of tenure. I am aware that section  49  of the Commonwealth Public Service Act restrict* the employment, of married women in the Public Service, and that only certain Commonwealth departments find it expedient to employ them. Married -women employed in the Public Service -suffer serious disadvantages compared with men in that they can not become permanent officers and their superannuation rights ar&lt; seriously affected. Apart from the restrictions imposed by 'section  49  of the act, 'the 'board 'has officially stated that it 'regards the employment of married women in the Public Service as undesirable, and that, " apart 'from other considerations, it is not considered that Australian conditions 'are such that the employment -o'f -married women -would be advisa'ble from a social 'viewpoint." "What exactly "does that mean? The women concerned -would certainly 'like the Government or the board to clarify that -statement. Recently, the Canberra Association of Women Graduates discussed "the 'employment of women in the Public Service, and those discussions -were concerned 'mainly 'with 'four matters : the salaries :of departmental 'librarians, 'the sentry of women 'into the Third Division. the  "temporary "employment of women in ^permanent 'positions, and 'the 'employment of married 'women. The association pointed out that women employed as librarians -in the .Commonwealth departments .are '.at 'a disadvantage -compared with those engaged as librarians in the Parliamentary and National libraries. Departmental librarians are paid not more than £304 per annum plus certain margins and cost of living adjustments, whereas male librarians with similar qualifications can rise to more than £600 a year. It has been suggested that girls should be permitted to sit for examinations for entry to the Third Division, if they so desire, and that they be appointed &lt;&gt;n a competitive basis to such vacancies as may occur. It has also been suggested that women graduates seeking appointment to the Public Service under section 36a of the Commonwealth Public Service Act should not be debarred from permanent appointment because of their *ex. In reply to these suggestions, the Public Service Board has stated that continuity of experience in the Public Service is essential to promotion to senior administrative posts, and for this reason it is regarded as undesirable that, as a general rule, women should be employed in clerical and professional positions. Women are permitted to compete, with men for appointment to the British civil service and the New South Wales public service. At the 1st April, 1947, there were employed in the various sections of the British civil service 423,496 men and 264,206 women; but in the Third Division of the Commonwealth Public Service at the 30th June, 1947, only 65 women were employed, as compared with 14,079 men. Some women university graduates have complained that they have been given temporary employment in permanent positions for which they applied, and that no reason has been advanced tor this action except that of sex. It is claimed that it is not always possible to obtain immediately the services of a suitably qualified man, and that a woman may be employed temporarily until a suitable man can be secured. Sometimes women with the highest qualifications have had to give way to men with much lower qualifications. Women are not convinced that the practice followed by the Hoard is the only course to be pursued, md they recommend that, if a woman applicant for a permanent position is regarded as fulfilling the educational, medical and other requirements of a position she should be appointed to it per- <inline font-style="italic">\frs.

                    <para>Finally, I propose to speak of the position of married women. Owing to the present labour shortage, married women are now freely employed in  a  temporary capacity, not only in the Commonwealth Public Service, but also in the public services of the various States. Some women who have married have continued to be employed in the positions they occupied prior to marriage, but, as the result of their marriage, they have been re-employed on a temporary basis, with loss of salary increments and rights to accumulated sick leave and recreation leave. This is unjust and unnecessary, and is certainly not conducive to efficient work. The British civil service and the New South Wales Education Department have lifted th, ban which previously existed on the employment of married women. Why should not section 49 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act be deleted, thus allowing Australia to take its place in the forefront of progress? . It seem* that in this respect we are sadly out of date. </para>
                    <para>These are only some of the mattersconcerning the Public Service Board that have been brought to my notice. My attention is constantly being drawn to unsatisfactory features of the board'* administration. I have brought some matters forward at question time and I understand that some of them are already being dealt with. The organization of the Commonwealth Public Service needs to be revised. I suggest that women should be appointed to the Public Service Board and take part in the discussions with other members of the board on all matters relating to the appointment and employment of women. Women members of the board would also be helpful in giving advice relating to difficulties that may arise when men and women are working together. They would also be able to give valuable advice on the employment of juniors. I trust that, for the benefit of women generally, the suggestions which I have made wil1 receive the early consideration of th* Government. </para>

                        <para>.- -Like the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mrs. ^Blackburn)</inline> I, too, wish to raise a matter which comes under Division No. 12, Public Service Board. I propose, however,  to deal with an aspect of the board's administration different from that dealt with by the honorable member. During the last fortnight or to we have heard many statements by Ministers and by honorable members  opposite  relating to what they describe as the wonderful prosperity which this  country  is now enjoying. We have been told that everybody in Australia to-day is prosperous, happy and contented. The honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Langtry)</inline> said that prosperity reigns everywhere. I marvel at these statements, because it seems to me that honorable members opposite, particularly the back-benchers, should at least know that in the Commonwealth Public Service here is a great deal of dissatisfaction, particularly amongst those on the lower ranges of salary. Ministers and honorable members opposite generally should know what these people feel when they are told, as they so often are told these -lays, about the wonderful age in which we live. To many of our public servants those words must surely sound like i hollow mockery. It has recently been brought to my notice that a great deal if dissatisfaction exists among Commonwealth public servants in Victoria, and probably throughout Australia, because salary adjustments have not been made to meet the rising costs of living. I understand that no changes have been made in the salaries of public servants for many months, notwithstanding that, -luring tie last six months or so, the cost -&gt;f living has risen by approximately 14 per cent. According to the Commonwealth Statistician the cost of living is mow 43 per cent, above the pre-war figure. It may well be a good deal higher than that. The claims of our public servants  should be carefully investigated by the Public Service Board, either of its own volition or at the instigation of the Government. It is most important for the good government of our country that the members of the Public Service be contented. Public servants express a good deal of dissatisfaction about their plight, particularly when they recall how members of this Parliament last year gave themselves a 50 per cent, increase of their parliamentary allowances. Noi all honorable members have accented that increase. </para>

                            <para>- No. I believed then aI believe now that we had no justification for doing so until we wen satisfied that the wages and salaries of all members of the Common wealth Public Service had  been  adjusted to meet the steeply falling purchasing value of money. The  honorablemem ber  for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> pointed out with great justification that' the Government seems to be mesmerized by figures. Ministers note that public servants who. a few years ago, were receiving £5 a week, are now receiving as much as £9 a week, and they say how wonderful it is. They overlook the fact that £9 will not nov. buy as much as £5 would buy then. Public servants have, therefore, cause to be dissatisfied. I do not propose to say what increase of salaries is justified ; that is not my province, but the matter should be investigated  without delay. </para>

                        the need to discover, if possible, some way to eradicate onion weed, which is rapidly taking possession of the country in the vicinity of Swan Hill, with a consequent loss of production. The Government says that it wants more production. At Labour party conferences, resolutions are carried stressing the need for greater production; or, at least, thai is what we are told. If we are to increaseprimary production, the fertility of the soil must be maintained and noxious weeds controlled. The Swan Hill Shire Council has repeatedly asked me to bring before the Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research its request that onion weed be scientifically investigated. I brought their representations before the Minister, and in reply he wrote saying that the officers of the council were too busy to undertake .the work. The shire council was persistent, and wrote saying that the Minister evidently did not understand the seriousness of the onion weed menace. It pointed out that the Council' for Scientific and Industrial Research was financed out of the taxpayers' money, and that the taxpayers of the Swan Hill district were entitled to benefit from its work. The Minister, however, persisted in- his refusal to help. I now ask him what- he proposes to do about it. He may accuse me of working the parish pump, but this is a matter of more than local interest. The Minister is not listening- to me, and Joes not know what I have been saying. When he was- attacked this- afternoon for permitting the leakage of information about atomic- energy; he was stung to reply in his defence, but he now sits at the table deep in conversation with- the Vice-President of the Executive Council(Mr: Scully)', and' ignores what I anr saying to him on behalf of my constituents. Now that he is giving me his attention, I ask' him whether he is aware if' the nature of the replies which he sent in response to my representations, or- did he sign the letters without reading diem? Is he- prepared to accede- to- the request of the Swan Hill Shire Council ? Does he propose to reply in this chamber to- the representative of the farmers who have- asked, him for help ? Will he ask his officers to investigate the onion weed menace?,

                <para>The General Agreement on Tariffs; and Trade, the: second, document with, which this bill is concerned, is closely linked with th&amp; charter of the International Trade Organization. It. contains- the tariff rates negotiated at Geneva, in 194? on the basis of. mutual, concessions between, the participating countries. Honor able, members will recall, that the- agreement was-, laid before the Parliament earlier this year and debated by thiHouse in February and March. That debate was followed .by legislation ratifying changes- in the rates of duty to bring them- into accord with the agreement The agreement1 is at present being operated provisionally &lt;by 22 countries which were concerned' with its construction. While operation is provisional, any member country maj withdraw on 60 days' notice and need not take the full legislative steps- regarding trade policy which are required by full adherence: Full adherence- pledges member countries- not to withdraw before 1951. It is, I think, unlikely that any . country will make full acceptance of the General' Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, as distinct from applying- it provisionally, until a decision has been made on the entry into force of the charter. I. might point out to honorable members that once b sufficient number of countries are apply ing the agreement definitively, they ar* empowered to declare, that a country which is only applying, it provisionally i* no longer a contracting, party to. the agreement.. </para>
                <para>Some amendments were made to th»terms of. the general agreement at session*of the- contracting- parties- at Havana it March of this year, and again at Geneva in August and&gt; September. The main purpose- of these amendments-) which weneffected by a series of protocols, was to bring the general agreement, on its. rulemaking and structural sides, into line with amendments made at Havana to thitext of. the International Trade Organization charter. Two of those protocols are concerned' entirely with rectifications of the tariff, schedules contained in the general'- agreement, but these only pick up slips andi misprints between the schedules as&gt; negotiated' and as originally printed Copies of. all these- latest- documents-. together with copies of the articles of the general agreement have been supplied to honorable members. I have also placed several copies of the original three volumes of schedules of tariff concessions, which form part of the general agreement previously dealt with by this House, in the Library, as there are insufficient copies of that large item for me to be able to supply a set to each honorable member. </para>
                <para>As honorable members will observe when reading the bill, Australia signed the protocol modifying Part II. and Article XXVI. with a reservation as to acceptance. We did this because the United Kingdom also signed with a reservation as to acceptance. We have asked the United Kingdom for its views on the reservation, and we desire to consider further the matters arising from them. There is provision in the terms of the protocol for those countries which signed with reservation to deposit an instrument of acceptance with the United Nations, and the Government accordingly asks in this bill for approval to deposit such instrument when thoroughly satisfied. Honorable members have been supplied with a copy of this as of all other protocols. </para>
                <para>Now I desire to say something about the charter of the International Trade Organization. It is designed - (a) to establish an acceptable commercial code of rules and mutual obligations which the member governments undertake to observe in their relations with one another; (b) to set up an International Trade Organization which is intended to act as a means of consultation, collaboration and joint action for member governments in the field of international commercial policy, and to provide a medium of settlement of trade dispute among its members. </para>
                <para>I have supplied honorable members with a detailed statement describing the provisions of the charter and the manner in which they will operate and will therefore confine my remarks to an outline of the broad implications confronting Australia in accepting or rejecting them. </para>

                <para>I believe that the charter can be examined in the light of the foregoing objectives and will be found to meet them. It has been the policy of the Australian Government that no commitments in relation to commercial policy, particularly those which required a reduction in restrictions on imports, could successfully be maintained unless the conditions under which Australia could continue to export to the full capacity of its industries are maintained. Primarily this requires conditions of full employment and high levels of effective demand in the major industrial countries of the world. In recognition of this the charter contains a chapter devoted to employment and economic activity and in Article 3 each country accepts an obligation to take notion designed to maintain full employment and a large and steadily growing demand. In the event of a failure of  others to maintain employment and demand, the provisions of the charter unable a country, such as Australia, whose exports would be affected, to seek from the organization a review of its obligations on commercial policy, or even to obtain release from continuing obligations fo maintain low levels of tariffs or from other responsibilities under the charter. Tn any case there is provision within the charter for a country to take emergency action with respect to tariff concessions wanted if conditions threaten domestic industry. </para>
                <para>One of the principal duties of the organization will be the promotion of agreements between governments relating to the international marketing of primary commodities. The purpose of these agreements will be to ensure that producers can plan their production ahead with a knowedge of a guaranteed return for their exportable surpluses. Such agreements are not for the purpose of reducing the return to producers hut for overcoming the wide fluctuations in the actual returns ro growers and, consequently, to give to hem a greater stability of income. Commodities for which such special interna; 10na 1 agreements are completed will then bo exempt from the other provisions of he charter which might conflict with any undertakings in those agreements. </para>
                <para>The development of Australian industry has for many years been encouraged by tariff protection granted by Parliament after inquiry by the Tariff Board. The charter imposes no restriction on the raising of tariffs and the only obligation is in respect of duties that are bound against increase for a period of time under the general agreement.  It  was the policy of the Government in the course of the Geneva negotiations to refrain from negotiating items whose future industrial development it was felt might require the raising of the tariff sooner than the expiration of the three-year period for which the general agreement will initially be in force. Moreover, the charter recognizes the right of a country to seek to withdraw from the general agreement its commitment under any tariff items before the end of a three year period in order to raise the duty for the purpose of assisting industrial development. Whilst this procedure requires the consent of substantially all the affected parties it is a clear and important recognition of the right to seek to re-negotiate a duty in special circumstances. </para>
                <para>Past experience has shown that countries must, at times, take immediate action to protect their international monetary reserves. Balance of payments difficulties are, at the present time, a matter of concern to most of the countries in the world and the use of quantitative restrictions to control a decline in their foreign exchange reserves is an essential part of the policy of those governments. The charter recognizes completely the need of countries to use quantitative restrictions to safeguard their balance of payments and a special exception for the&gt;purpose is contained in Article 21. Thi.article, and the provisions of Article 23. relating to the discriminatory use of quantitative restrictions, are highly technical and complex. However, they cover our need to apply and maintain quantitative restrictions if there should be a decline, or a threatened decline, in out international reserves. </para>
                <para>For many years domestic marketing schemes, such as those covering butter and wheat, have operated in Australia for the purpose of stabilizing returns toprimary producers. These schemes, with which honorable members are full; familiar, have resulted at times in higher prices being paid by Australian consumers than by overseas purchaserswhile at other times the reverse has been the case. Recognition of this type of marketing scheme has been obtained for  the purposes of the charter and the provisions of the charter restricting export subsidies do not apply to these Australian stabilization arrangements. </para>
                <para>Article 16 of the charter, which contains astatement of the most favoured nation principle, specifically excludes from that generalization preferences exchanged between members of the British "Commonwealth prior to various dates laid down. There is no obligation for these margins of preference to be reduced except by agreement of all the parties concerned. Any such action would be taken only in return for tariff concessions made by other countries as part of a bargaining process having mutually advantageous results, as was the case with the Geneva tariff negotiations. It is to be noted that no new preference may be created and that this extends in principle to all the members of the organization. However, as honorable members are aware, no other British country has extended a new preference of importance to Australia for many years, and the Government of the United Kingdom is, irrespective of the charter, formally committed against such an extension of preferences. It is also known that the Government of Canada is opposed to an extension of, or the creation of, new preferences. On the other hand, this prohibition on the exchange of preferences applies generally to all other members of the organization, and it has been apparent in the course of the negotiationsleading to the formulation of the charter that a number of those countries which are in the same economic region or have complementary economies would, but for this obligation, have sought to create new preferences to a far greater extent than the charter now permits. New preferences may be permitted only in the interests of economic development orreconstruction or under a customs anion arrangement, and in all cases with the approval of the organization. Detailed criteria must be complied with before consent will be forthcoming. Past experience has shown the extent to which overseas markets for Australian exports of agricultural products have been closed by the imposition of quantitative restrictions. These restrictions have been imposed by the older industrial countries, which have sought by this means to pro tect high cost agricultural production. The charter provides for a general prohibition on the useof import quotas in this manner except in temporary circumstances or under conditions in which the domestic production of the article is also restricted.Rising living standards in the under-developed countries of the world would increase the demand for imported goods, particularly foodstuffs. More than a recognition of this need for development is required, and the charter placet on the organization the responsibility for actively encouraging the development of these areas by advising members and providing them with assistance in their planning. Positive action of this type should ensure an expanding volume of international trade from which Australia, as an important supplier of food, would benefit considerably. </para>
                <para class="block">I think honorable members will agree that these points amply show that the charter includes provisions which meet the main requirements of Australian interests. In making a decision whether it would be advantageous to become a member of the organization, we should,I think, consider a little further the following four aspects of the question: - <inline font-style="italic">(a.)</inline> the contribution that the organization can make to the solution of world economic problems and to the maintenance of healthy economic conditions; </para>
                <list type="loweralpha">
                    <item label="(b)">
                        <para>the effect of the charter on Australian export markets for primary products and manufactured goods, by its application to the economic policies of other countries ; </para>
                    </item>
                    <item label="(c)">
                        <para>the effect which the charter may have on the economic policies of Australia; and (d)the attitude of other countries. On these points, I shall make some observations for the consideration of honorable members. The charter requires, as a condition for freer commercial policies, an undertaking by all countries to pursue policies designed to maintain high and stable levels of employment and effective demand. The present world conditions of shortages of goods and scarcityofhardcurrenciesmask the ultimate need to ensure that there are maintained. in our overseas markets steady levels of employment and consequent increasing demand for our primary exports, [f these obligations are successfully carried out, these market conditions for all internationally traded goods will be assured. If there is a failure to carry out these undertakings by the major marketing countries, then Australia and the other countries adversely affected will have strong justification under the terms of the charter for taking emergency action to protect their own economies against the impact of adverse economic conditions overseas, and also a sound basis for urging in the organization international action to correct the decline of demand. </para>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <para>Members of the organization undertake, in Article 4, that, if their balance of payments shows a persistent excess of exports over imports and is thus creating balance of payments difficulties for other member countries, they will play their full part in restoring equilibrium. This, for instance, would require such a country as the United States actively to pursue policies designed to correct a disequilibrium between dollar and non-dollar currencies. The absence of successful action provides a basis for complaint by affected countries and for the urging of international action through the organization. On the other hand, for countries whose balance of payments is unfavorable, provisions have been inserted to ensure that measures to prevent a continuing decline in monetary reserves may be taken. </para>
                <para>Although some of the principles set out in the charter are subject to exceptions which may be applied to meet the specific needs, for example, of underdeveloped countries, countries in balance of payments difficulties, and countries dependent on primary exports, the general effect of the charter will be to  secure  recognition of the need to follow non -restrictive trade policies to the fullest practicable degree. Some of the main industrial countries may require to make use of some of the exceptions until the war damage to their economies has been overcome, but others, notably the United States, will be in a position to apply the charter terms from the beginning practically without recourse to the exceptions Provided in the charter. This alone will undoubtedly be to the benefit of the rest of the world because of the expanding, market which the United States provides for exports -from other countries, especially in view . of the. restraint imposed by the charter upon the adoption of restrictive practices which may have the effect of providing unreasonable protection for domestic industries and so limiting competition with those industries. </para>
                <para>Honorable members are well aware that international trade disputes in the past have frequently had widespread and detrimental effects resulting from action taken by individual countries without regard to the effects upon others. The establishment of the International Trade Organization will provide a forum in which there can be prior consultation  tending  to limit the scope of trade disputes and lead to their earlier settlement. For this reason Chapter VIII. of the charter provides for extensive consultation and arbitration. It will also be possible for members to refer to the organization, for advice and study, developments inimical to international trade as they become evident. The adoption of a generally accepted code in international trade, which provides adequately for the realization of legitimate national and commercial objectives, will also tend to eliminate the detrimental effects resulting from the grosser forms of national self-sufficiency. </para>
                <para>Australian  exports  will benefit directly from the maintenance of good demand conditions in the world and particularly from the adoption of non-restrictive trade policies by highly developed countries such as the United States of America. Future tariff negotiations of the kind concluded in Geneva can lead to further benefits for our industries. The development of new export markets for Australian goods will increase the benefits to be obtained from direct negotiations with those countries and indirectly from the negotiations which, may be undertaken by other countries. The limitation on the use of quantitative restrictions by importing countries, from which Australian exports of primary products have suffered in the past, will also strengthen our export position. Moreover, our existing schemes for the stabilization of primary export industries are fully protected. </para>
                <para>On the other hand, the charter leaves the main structure of existing imperial preferences substantially preserved. Although new preferences cannot, except as provided in the charter, be established by any country, existing preferences obtain international recognition and we are not required to surrender the preferences we enjoy  except  in return for compensating benefits in other countries' markets as a result of a mutually satisfactory bargain. The need for development of sound export markets for Australian manufacturing industries increases the interest of this country in the provisions of the charter which provide for freer trade and a reduction of trade harriers. [ have already dealt at some length with the relationship of the charter to Australia's particular interests. It is evident from what T have said that the Australian delegation has secured recognition in the charter for the basic elements of policy followed by Australia in connexion with international trade. This relates particularly to the protection for Australian manufacturing industries, stabilization plan for primary industries //.nd restrictions necessary for the  protect l (: Il  of the balance of payments. It can be said, that the charter requires no change in Australian policies and few, changes and. those only minor, in the present Australian commercial legislation or practices, and that it will not prevent our dealing adequately with any economic problem likely to arise in the future as a result of our adherence to the charter. </para>
                <para>Of the 56 governments represented at Havana, all except Argentina and Poland signed the final act of the conference authenticating the text of the Havana charter. The United Kingdom delegation stated that its Government, in deciding to sign the final act, had also decided to submit the charter to the Parliament with the Government's support. It seems likely that the charter will not be submitted to the Congress of the United States of America until 1949. </para>
                <para>This bill makes Australian acceptance of the International Trade Organization membership conditional on United States and United Kingdom acceptance. It is provided under this bill that Australia shall not deposit an instrument of acceptance of the charter until this has been done by the governments of Britain and the United States. The usefulness and success of the organization will depend upon the willingness of such major trading nations to accept membership. As joint sponsors, the United Kingdom and the United States are indispensable to the organization's effectiveness. For this reason, I feel that some honorable members on both sides of the House will agree that the Government has acted wisely in making our own acceptance of both the charter and the agreement conditional in this way. On the other hand, it would be almost certainly disadvantageous for us to decline membership if British and American acceptance is forthcoming, because the organization and its members would, in fact, constitute a large and powerful trading group whose members would exchange most-favoured-nation treatment from which we would be excluded. </para>
                <para>There is no need for me to enter here into details of the International Trade Organization. As honorable members are aware from, previous debates, the powers and duties of the organization given to it by the charter will be carried out by the conference of the members. The conference will also determine the policies of the organization. It may, by a simple majority decision, assign to the executive board any power or duty of the organization. The executive board is to consist of eighteen members selected regularly by the conference. In the event of our accepting membership of the International Trade Organization, Australia would appear to have an excellent chance of election to this executive board. There should be ample room, therefore, for Australia to take an active part in the formulation of the policy of the International Trade Organization when it is established, both in the conference and the executive board. Outside the organization, we could have little or no voice at all in formulation of world trade policies. </para>
                <para>I turn now from the International Trade Organization charter to the distinct but related General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In pursuance of the principle of reductions in tariffs, the  members of the Preparatory Committee present in Geneva negotiated last year the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The agreement is in practice intimately linked with the charter. Any tariff concessions which may be agreed upon as a result of any future negotiations completed under the charter, will be fitted into the framework of the general agreement on terms to be agreed upon by the parties concerned. By the operation of the general most-favoured-nation treatment provided for in the charter, Australia stands to gain from such negotiations, even though it may not participate in every one of them. When the charter comes into force, the general clauses of the agreement will be suspended, or rather merged into the corresponding sections of the charter. The agreement will then consist of the tariff concessions and the unconditional most-favoured-nation clause, together with Part III., which contains certain machinery provisions directly related to the operation of those concessions. </para>
                <para>If the charter is accepted by the Australian Government, there will be no purpose in failing to accept the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has been provisionally applied by Australia since the 1st January, 1948. The period of the agreement is initially for three years, but may run on thereafter, subject to withdrawal by individual contracting parties on six months' notice or to the re-negotiation or withdrawal of individual tariff concessions. The Government is now seeking authority for the definitive, as distinct from provisional, application of the general agreement at such time as the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America shall have taken action to apply the agreement definitively to their respective countries. I have explained earlier in my speech the practical distinction between provisional and definitive acceptance and application. </para>
                <para>In preparation for the first conference of the organization, an Interim Commission has been established, and an executive committee of eighteen members has been elected. Australia was one of the countries elected, and is participating actively in the work of the Interim Commission, thus preserving a link that was established when the project . was commenced. A session of the executive committee of the Interim Commission has been concluded at Geneva during this month. Thus it is hoped to assist in the determination of the early policy of the organization in a manner that will ensure its development on sound lines and in the interests of Australia development in international trade. </para>
                <para>The charter should provide conditions in which an expanding volume of international trade will be secured, and Australia, as a large and growing export country, has a very material interest in such a development. The charter does not require important changes in our present practices. If our hopes for expanding world trade are not realized, then the conditions which restrict our exports will provide an acceptable reason for a review of our own commitments in respect of the charter, and we shall therefore be no worse off for having attempted to co-operate with other countries in the achievement of this objective. The price of isolationism will be at the least  a  failure to derive benefits from tariff concessions exchanged between the major trading countries of the world that are members of the organization. But there are wider reasons, equally compelling, for giving- the International Trade Organization every opportunity to prove, itself. As I suggested earlier, success by this body could go very far indeed in creating conditions of stability, cooperation and trust among the nations on which alone we and all nations may live together in freedom and good neighbourliness. For these reasons, the Government has decided that, on balance, it will be in Australia's interest to accept membership in the organization and to accept the general agreement, and therefore it commends the bill to the House.

                    <para class="block">This is an historic occasion in the life of our nation. The bill which I have the honour to present this evening seeks to establish for the first time the principle of Australian citizenship, while maintaining between the component parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations the common bond of British nationality. The importance of the measure lies in the fact that it marks another step forward in the development of Australian nationhood. This step is a logical one, and is- the inevitable consequence of the decisions of successive Imperial conferences. They culminated in the Statute of Westminster, which established each dominion of the British Commonwealth of Nations and Great Britain itself as equal partners, independent of each other and joined together in a legal sense only by the bond of a common allegiance to  His  Majesty the King. </para>
                    <para>The bill is not designed to make an Australian any less a British subject, but to help him to express his pride in citizenship of this great country. That is a. pride which is praiseworthy, because it is based on a belief that Australia has done as much as any other British nation to develop, expand and improve the free institutions and systems of organized society that had their origin in the United Kingdom. Our friendly competition to excel, not in conquest or power, but in the development of decent and democratic social structures is not, unfortunately, as well understood as it should, be in some parts of the world, but the success that has been achieved to date is a legitimate cause for satisfaction. To say that one is an Australian is, of course, to indicate beyond all doubt that one is British; but to claim to be of the British race does not make it clear that one is an Australian. The time has come for Australia and the other dominions to recognize officially and legally their maturity as members of the British .Commonwealth by the passage of separate citizenship laws. Therefore, it gives me great pleasure to introduce this bill that will enable Australia to proclaim its own national citizenship and establish theduties and responsibilities as well as the rights and privileges that are inherent in it. </para>

                    <para>Subject to certain modifications designed to meet conditions peculiar to Australia, the bill puts into effect the principle on which the United Kingdom Nationality Act 3948 is based. In that act, the British Government recognized that the people of each of the self-governing countries of the British Commonwealth of Nations had a particular statu* as citizens of their own country as well as their wider status as British subjects. The bill makes other changes in nationality law, and in particular it achieves an end which the Australian people have long sought, which is, the removal of the disabilities imposed on married women and their placement, so far as their national status is concerned, on an equal footing with men and single women. </para>
                    <para>Nationality legislation is without question a difficult and complicated matter, and it may be worth while to review briefly the historical position in relation to British nationality. Originally British nationality was only conferred under the common law by birth within the legiance of the Crown. If a person was born in England, he became at birth an Englishman, irrespective of the nationality of his parents. Having been born an Englishman, throughout his life he was able to assume the obligations and enjoy the privileges acquired by birth  on British soil. With the growth of the King's dominions, complications arose in regard to the children of Englishmen born outside England, and legislation become necessary to recognize such children as British subjects by virtue of the fact that their fathers or paternal grandfathers were born on British soil. The question was further complicated by the development, within the British Commonwealth, of dominions which were, in fact, sovereign States with power and authority equal to those of the United Kingdom. Such countries made their own laws, laying down the conditions under which British nationality was acquired or lost so far as each individual country was concerned. The legislation passed by the various Dominions had local effect only, with the result that a person who was recognized in one British country as a British subject was regarded in others as an alien. In 1914, however, the United Kingdom Government introduced a bill for the purpose of consolidating the British law and applying it uniformly throughout the whole of the British Commonwealth. At various stages the parliaments of the Dominions passed legislation along similar lines, thus bringing into effect what is known as the " common code " system. While the introduction of this system marked a definite advance on former British nationality legislation, it was found not to solve all difficulties, and a new method was sought which would retain all of the advantages of the " common code " system and. avoid its defects. The only workable plan that could be found was based on the principle of combining local citizenship of an individual member of the British Commonwealth with the maintenance of the general status of British subject. This method has been decided upon after consultation between the various members of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>The question of the relationship between the common status possessed by all subjects of His Majesty and the particular status of membership of any one of the individual communities forming the British Commonwealth of Nations is by no means a new one. The con.sideration of legislation to define who were the- nationals or citizens of a particular community did not begin, as some may think, with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act in 1946. The subject was dealt with in the Report of the Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation, 1929, and in the Sum. mary of Proceedings of the Imperial Con.ference. 1930. The report of 1929 pointed out that British subjects not only have the common status but also, generally speaking, have a particular connexion with one or other of the members of the British Commonwealth. It also pointed out that, in the absence of rules for determining the part of the Commonwealth to which any particular person belongs, practical difficulties arise, or might arise, with regard to such matters as immigration, deportation, diplomatic action, extra-territorial legislation and treaty rights and obligations. The suggestion was made that these difficulties could be overcome if each of the member states of the Commonwealth were to introduce legislation defining its nationals or citizens, but it was found that some member states were not then disposed to introduce such legislation. </para>
                    <para>The matter was again considered at. the Imperial Conference of 1937. In its report the conference stated - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It was recognized that, to a greater or les* extent members of the Commonwealth, whether or not they have given legislative definition to such a concept, do distinguish for some practical purposes between British subjects in general and. those British subjects they  regard  as being members of their own respective communities. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The report went on to say that the phrase " members of the community " of a particular member of the Commonwealth was intended to have rather a technical meaning, as denoting a person with whom that member of the Commonwealth had, either by legislative definition of "its nationals or citizens or otherwise, decided to regard as " belonging " to it for the purposes of civil and political rights and duties, immigration, deportation, diplomatic representation, or the exercise of territorial jurisdiction. In the light of these considerations the conference reached the conclusion that - </para>

                        <para>It is for each member of. the British Commonwealth to decide which persons have with it that definite connexion envisaged in the Report on the Operation of Dominion Legislation, 1929, which would enable it to recognize them- as members of its community. rt is desirable, however, to secure, as far  ais  possible, uniformity in principle in the determination by each member of the Commonwealth, of the persons, being British subjects, to be regarded as members of its community. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The difficulties which have arisen under the system of nationality legislation which now operates, and which is generally known as the " common code " system, are set out at some length in the explanatory memorandum which has been supplied to honorable members. There is, therefore, no need for me to labour this point. It will be sufficient for me to say that these difficulties did cause the Australian Government concern and that it felt impelled to introduce special legislation in regard to. the status of married women and residents of the Territory of New Guinea, although this involved a departure from the " common code ". In 1945, the Government considered the question of legislation to provide for a legal Australian citizenship, combined with the maintenance of the common status of British sub.jects in Australia. About the same time, advice was received that the Canadian Government proposed to introduce a Canadian citizenship bill in the near future, and it was decided, in the circumstances, to defer consideration of the question of Australian citizenship legislation for the time being. The passage of the Canadian act in 1946 was followed in February, 1947, by the Conference of Nationality Experts of the various countries of the British Commonwealth, convened at the invitation of the United Kingdom Government, to discuss a draft scheme prepared by the United Kingdom authorities. Their plan combined local citizenship with the wider status of British subject. The conclusions of the conference are embodied in the explanatory memorandum. The United Kingdom and New Zealand Governments have passed nets, which will come into operation as from 1st January, 1949, on lines similar to those of this bill, and other British Commonwealth countries have indicated that they are willing to do the same. </para>
                    <para>It should be clearly understood, and this is a point which I cannot too strongly emphasize, that creation of an Australian citizenship under this bill will in no way lessen the advantages and privileges which British subjects who may not be </para>
                    <para class="block">Australian citizens enjoy in Australia. British subjects, whether they are now in this country or enter it in future, will continue to be free from the disabilities and restrictions that apply to aliens. They will qualify for the franchise and have the right to become members of Parliament or to enter the public services. A British subject who is not Australianborn will be able to become an Australian citizen by a simple act of registration, but he will not suffer in any way whatever should he fail to do this. No doubt a great many British people not born in Australia will seek citizenship, but they will not make the move as a means of obtaining any practical advantage whatever, but purely as an expression of pride in this country and its achievements, which I have already mentioned as being strong in the breasts of native Australians. Let me make it plain that the " common code " system has, in effect, broken down, and that the only means of maintaining the existing common status of British subjects throughout the British Commonwealth is in the concept that citizenship of an individual member of the Commonwealth shall carry with it the common status. This is effected by clause T (1), which is the key clause of the bill. It provides that - </para>

                        <para>In the first place, let me say that the bill as a whole seems good, wise and tidy. I congratulate the Government upon it and upon the understanding with the Dominions upon which it has been founded. The bill is an example of our present constitutional practice in Commonwealth affairs of bringing the legal structure of the Commonwealth into as complete consonance as we can manage with reality - and by " reality " I mean the way in which the King's lieges think and feel, both as nationals of their own country and as members of a world-wide community. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Lord Tweedsmuir expressed the view that the real basis of the measure was that it would give clear recognition to the separate identity of particular countries. He believed that the word " identity " was an important part of their strength and the encouragement of that " identity " would be a source of continuing strength. Such opinions will, I hope, convince any one who may still doubt the fact that this bill is not, in any particular, opposed to the wishes of the United Kingdom. It is, in fact, a measure of a kind which the United Kingdom Government, and the leaders of opinion in all classes in the United Kingdom, wish to see enacted in the British Dominions. It is designed to eliminate complications in the matters of nationality and citizenship that were not more irritating to us than they were to the authorities in the United Kingdom itself. The explanatory memorandum will give honorable members a comprehensive view of the general provisions contained in the bill and I do not, therefore, propose to deal with all these matters in detail. Tt is desirable, however, that I should refer to some of the more important matters. The first of these is. How will Australian citizenship, which will carry with it the wider status of British nationality, be acquired? It will be achieved in a number of ways such as (i) by birth in this country; (ii) by descent if born outside Australia; (iii) by registration in the case of British subjects other than Australian citizens, or Irish citizens; and (iv) by the grant of naturalization in the case of aliens. These provisions will operate only in the a case of persons born after the commencement of the act or of those who apply for registration or naturalization after that date. Provision has, however, also been made in the transitional clauses which are clauses 24 to 31 to cover the cases of persons who are British subjects immediately before the date of commencement of the act and by reason of these " provisions they will not only retain their British nationality but also will acquire Australian citizenship automatically if they have a definite association with this country. </para>
                    <para>In the provisions in regard to loss of citizenship two new principles have been incorporated in the bill. The first is that an Australian citizen, who is also a national of another country, and who serves with the enemy forces in any war in which Australia is engaged, shall forfeit his Australian citizenship. The second provides for loss of citizenship in the case of a person who becomes a citizen by registration or naturalization, if hu continues to reside outside Australia for a continuous period of seven years without registering annually at a consulate, unless he is abroad in the service of thu Government. The House, I am sure, will agree that those provisions are both justifiable and desirable. </para>
                    <para>I pass now to the status of married women. It is my belief that our proposals in this regard will have not only the full backing of every member of the Commonwealth Parliament and every woman in Australia, be she British or alien, but also of every male in our community who has given any thought to this subject. I have always held the view that it was most objectionable that solely because a woman married a man of another nationality, she was obliged to accept his nationality. Because this has been the case, Australian women have, from time to time, been placed in worrying and even humiliating situations, and it has long been agreed by enlightened people that the citizenship rights of a woman should not be in any way inferior to those of a man. Efforts have been made to ameliorate the position by prescribing that on marriage a woman should not lose her British nationality unless she acquired her husband's nationality. This did not completely satisfy the Australian Government, which in 1946 passed special legislation to provide that British women who married aliens while resident in Australia, should not, . in this country, be deemed to have lost their British nationality. It is our wish, however, that every woman, whether married or single, shall equally as free as a man to determine what her nationality shall be. The bill provides for this, and moreover, restores their British nationality to women who by reason of marriage may have became aliens. Such women who are resident in Australia and comply with the transitional provisions of the bill will also become Australian citizens. </para>
                    <para>Under existing law certain children born in foreign territory are under some practical disadvantages. For instance, the child, born out of wedlock, of a British mother does not acquire British nationality, even if his father is British. In 1946 I appointed a. committee of women, representative of the main political bodies in Australia, which was presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Tangney,  to consider the problems arising from the possession by mother and father of  different  nationalities. Following on a recommendation of that committee, provision has been made in the bill that a child born in a  foreign  country, whose mother was an Australian citizen or was a British subject ordinarily resident in Australia, shall be an Australian citizen, provided that such a child is eligible for admission to Australia as a permanent resident. Provision has also been made in the bill that children born out of wedlock, on foreign soil, of British fathers and alien mothers shall become,  according  to  circumstances,  Australian citizens or British subjects if their  births  are made legitimate by the  subsequent  marriage of the parents. An anomaly in regard to the position of posthumous children is also rectified by the bill. Such children will in future become Aus7 tralian citizens if at the time of the father's death he was an Australian citizen. </para>
                    <para>The position of Irish citizens under the bill has been clearly defined in the explanatory memorandum and I feel that there is little I can say by way of further observation. Briefly, this is a  question  which mainly concerns the United Kingdom and Irish Governments ; and by Irish Government I refer to the Government of what was formerly known as the Irish Free State, now .sometimes known according to its Gaelic title as the Government of Eire. The Irish Government .has made it clear that, whilst it has objections in principle to an Irish citizen still being regarded as a British subject as a matter of course, it raises no objection to any Irish citizen who has association with a particular Commonwealth country - by descent, residence or otherwise - becoming a citizen of that country. * Under the provisions of the bill, which are identical with those of the United Kingdom Act. it rests with an Irish citizen to declare that by reason of his association with this country he wishes to become an Australian citizen, and on doing so he will acquire Australian citizenship. British subjects in Ireland enjoy certain material advantages which are not afforded to aliens, and, as a reciprocal measure, the bill provides that Irish citizens in this country who do not become Australian citizens shall not be treated as aliens. </para>
                    <para>Clause 41 calls for special mention, lt provides for arrangements to be made for the oath of allegiance to be taken in public before a judical office, and to be accompanied by proceedings designed to impress upon applicants the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizens. In a statement on government policy made by me in the House on the 22nd November, 1946, 1 said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It is my belief that the present procedure connected with the taking of the oath of allegiance by applicants for naturalization leaves much to be desired. At present the prospective new -citizen merely attends hi.» local courthouse and takes the oath before a magistrate or clerk of courts. It seems to me. however, that such an occasion calls for o dignified induction ceremony that would serve to instill into the minds of applicants n proper appreciation of the value of the new citizenship, which carries with it certain obligations and  responsibilities  as well asprivileges and benefits. Such a ceremony, based on the American practice, would, I feel sure, produce the same excellent results as have been achieved in the United States. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Provision has been made in the bill to give effect to the views then expressed. It is proposed that the oath of allegiance shall be taken in open court, when the Australian flag shall be prominently displayed and have pride of place, and that an appropriate address shall be given by the presiding judge or magistrate. He will impress upon applicants the responsibilities as well as the privileges and benefits which will follow from their new status. The old system, under which a man's naturalization papers came to him through the mail, like his annual- licence for his dog or his motor car, was most inappropriate. A man from a foreign country makes one of the greatest decisions of. his life when he decides to migrate to Australia. If he finds life here so satisfactory that he decides to become an Australian and to establish his family of new citizens here permanently, that is another of the great decisions of his life - a great and joyful decision. It should be marked by a solemn ceremony, an impressive occasion which he and his children will remember. He should not simply receive a paper that entitles him to certain new privileges. He should be made aware in warm, spoken language, of the responsibilities he is assuming, and officially welcomed as a New Australian. The Government now proposes that that shall be done, and that a matter affecting the whole of a man's- life and that of future generations of his family shall no longer be merely a piece of office routine. </para>
                    <para>Another innovation so far as naturalization in Australia is concerned, which has been included in the bill, is the provision that normally an alien wishing to become naturalized shall first make a declaration of intention. The reasons why this requirement has been adopted are set forth in the explanatory memorandum. </para>
                    <para>No honorable member will, I think, deny that it is most desirable to formulate some method under which a common nationality will prevail throughout every part of the British Commonwealth, and that we should avoid, if at all possible, the situation that a person is recognized as a British national by one community and not by another. There are only two ways by which the conception of a common nationality can be achieved. One is by having a common code under which every member-nation of the British Commonwealth must legislate in the same way and practically at the same time. That method has been tried and found wanting. The second way is the concept under which the Government of each Commonwealth community shall decide for itself who are to be its citizens, and that the gum total of the citizens of the various members of the British Commonwealth ball 'have the common status of British subjects. The principle embodied in the latter  conception  is expressed in this bill. </para>
                    <para>This legislation, which is similar to that already passed by the United Kingdom and New Zealand Governments or likely to be passed in future by other Commonwealth countries, is a logical development of the Statute of Westminster. That Statute created no new status, to the  members  of the British Commonwealth; it merely gave legal expression to an existing state of affairs, namely that the self-governing Dominions were free and independent nations, equal in status to the Mother Country within the boundaries of. an agreed Commonwealth of Nations. The statute has in no way weakened any of the ties between the various nations which comprise the British Commonwealth. In a similar fashion this bill, by fully and properly recognizing the individual identity of each Commonwealth community and at the same time preserving the status of a common nationality possessed by all1 these people, will prove a binding and unifying factor between the various communities comprising the British Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>Incorporated in the Australian flag <inline font-style="italic">itthe</inline> Union Jack,' and similarly in this bill there is complete recognition of our close ties with the United Kingdom and the other countries of the British Commonwealth. Provision is made for us. while identifying ourselves as Australian citizens, to remain British subjects, and. having regard to legislation passed, or about to be passed, in other British countries, we must adopt this bill or Australia will be the only unidentified country from the point of view of citizenship in the British Commonwealth, and Australians the only members- of the British family without a name of their own. </para>
                    <para>When this bill becomes an act. it will be proclaimed on Australia Day, the 26tb of January, 1949, and the occasion will he a memorable one. It will symbolizenot only our own pride in Australia, but also our willingness to offer a share in our future to the new Australians we are seeking .in such vast numbers. These people are sure of a warm welcome to our shores.. They will no longer need to strive towards an intangible goal, but can aspire to the honour of Australian citizenship. They will be able to say, just as proudly as any of us, " I am an Australian ". Perhaps those words will mean even more to those who remember life in less fortunate lands than to us who enjoy the freedom of plenty, the sunshine and social equality, of this great democracy. </para>
                    <para>My aim, and that of the Government, is to make the word " Australian " mean all that it truly stands for to every member of our community. We shall try to teach the children that they are fortunate to be British, and even more fortunate to be Australian. We want to emphasize the brief but glorious Australian history, in which so much has been accomplished so quickly, and to foster and encourage our young but vigorous traditions of mateship, cooperation, and a fair deal for everybody. Therefore, I commend this legislation to the House, deeply conscious that it marks yet another historic advance towards national greatness. </para>
                    <para>This vast and virile country, which we are privileged to hold, and for the development of which we are responsible., can be made as great and noble a land as we, with our collective brains, muscles, and devotion to a high* ideal, wish it to be. We owe that much to our forbears who pioneered this country, with few of life's amenities but with stout hearts and limitless courage. They opened its fertile plains, explored its rivers and won the bounty of its soil and the mineral treasures below. We owe it, too, those who will come after us to develop the splendid heritage that is ours. We must hand it on to them untarnished. This bill is more than a cold, legalistic formula. It is a warm, pulsating document that enshrines the love of country of every genuine Australian. </para>

                    <para class="block">One of the greatest tasks confronting the nation at this time is the maintenance of national health. One of the most serious diseases, and at the same time one of the most readily curable when found in its early stages, is tuberculosis. Contrary to the old belief, tuberculosis is not hereditary, but it is infectious and can strike any one, and at any age. The eradication of tuberculosis should concern every Australian citizen. The disease is difficult to control because in its early stages it gives little or no warning of its presence. It has been said very truly, in another place, and by a greater  voice  than mine, that " Peace hath her victories, no less renowned than war ". </para>
                    <para>One of the greatest victories which we could achieve in this country would be to destroy or reduce, by combined action, the scourge of tuberculosis. This disease is as much the enemy of our people as is any military force which confronted us in the recent war. However, it is an enemy that can be destroyed, or at least reduced to impotence, by means within the knowledge of the medical profession, and at hand. </para>
                    <para>The measure now before the House is designed to enable battle to be joined with this enemy, to co-ordinate the forces available to the attack, and to bring all the efforts of governments and the medical profession to a close focus on the disease, so as to eradicate, or at least reduce it to minor proportions, in this generation. The bill seeks to initiate a campaign which will call for a high degree of co-operation from the people, their governments, State and National, organs of publicity, and the members of the medical profession. A high degree of co-operation and assistance has "been  forthcoming from ex-servicemen's organizations and other voluntary associations conducting sanatoriums in directing public attention to the need for a campaign against the disease. Their efforts have been a most valuable contribution to the education of the public, and it is hoped that this co-operation and support will continue and integrate with the wider campaign. I think, and I am sure honorable members will agree with me, that the cause is a worthy one, and that the victory to be won will confer great and lasting benefit on this and succeeding generations of our people. </para>
                    <para>Tuberculosis strikes at men and women in their most vigorous years, which is their most productive and reproductive period. It causes far more deaths among women of child-bearing age than all the risks of pregnancy combined. The incidence of the disease is highest among the young and active, who have their most useful years before them. Its attack is insidious, and frequently its presence is unsuspected until its ravages are so far advanced that the sufferer is doomed either to long years of incapacity or to early death. I am sure that many honorable members will recall among their acquaintances young and brilliant men and women who were first crippled, and then killed, by this disease, which, in Australia, is by far the greatest individual cause of death among men and women in the prime years of adult life, that is between the ages of 20 and 40 years. In 1946, the latest year for which details are available, tuberculosis was responsible for 27.6 per cent, of deaths from all major individual causes among people aged from 20 to 39 years. It caused more than twice as many deaths in this age group as did cancer and tumors, and exceeded by more than 50 per cent, the total of deaths from diseases of the heart and circulatory system among people of these ages. 'Since tuberculosis takes its large toll of adults in the prime of life the total mortality, measured in years of expected life lost, reaches very large proportions, and, even excluding all other aspects, this is a very serious economic loss to this country. </para>
                    <para>Though the incidence of tuberculosis in Australia has shown a decline in re cent years, and is in fact much less than in older settled countries, the disease remains one that takes a grievous toll in human suffering and distress, and in loss to the nation. The fall in the morbidity and mortality rates of tuberculosis may be related to the general rise in the standard of living, of nutrition and housing. In fact, an eminent doctor has suggested that when every one has enough room in which to live, enough to eat, and proper working conditions the incidence of tuberculosis will diminish to vanishing point. </para>
                    <para>All governments in Australia are interesting themselves increasingly in the matter of housing. The Commonwealth is concerned also in the raising of nutrition standards, and there is increasing recognition of the need for improvement of factory and workshop conditions. The Commonwealth has recently approved the establishment of a Unit of Industrial Hygiene at the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at the University of Sydney. I do suggest, however, and the Government recognizes, that we cannot afford to wait for the fall in mortality and morbidity rates brought about by improvements of living, housing and working conditions. There are still between 30,000 and 40,000 known sufferers from tuberculosis in Australia. There may be many thousands more unsuspected cases. The disease in some forms is highly infectious. Administration cannot, of itself, add one iota to medical knowledge, or suggest new solutions to medical problems,  but it can make known solutions effective. Known solutions exist for the problems of tuberculous infection. This Government, and the several State governments, recognize their duty to safeguard and protect the people from the dangers of tuberculous infection. Medical science needs the assistance of governments to apply the measures of knowledge which can overcome tuberculosis in this country. </para>
                    <para>Commonwealth entry into this field of  health legislation is enabled by the amendment of section 51 of the Constitution authorized by the people at the referendum in September, 194.6, which confers power on the Commonwealth to legislate for the provision of medical services. </para>
                    <para class="block">The hill gives authority to the Commonwealth to take measures for the prevention, treatment and control of tuberculosis, lt gives legislative effect to a campaign for a bold, imaginative attack: on the scourge of tuberculosis, aimed at reducing the disease to negligible proportions in the shortest possible time. The campaign against tuberculosis is planned largely along lines recommended by the Commonwealth Director of the Division of Tuberculosis, after a survey in all States. The plan has been drawn in consultation with all State Ministers of Health, and has been approved by the Premiers in conference at Canberra. The Commonwealth is rightly giving a lead in what is a national problem, to supplement and extend the efforts of the States. </para>
                    <para>I repeat that the means of dealing with tuberculosis are already thrown. These require, in the first instance, the location of the infectious case, isolation and medical treatment, after carp  and  rehabilitation. There are, in addition, social implications. Too often patients restored to health by good treatment have been forced, perhaps by lack of opportunity, or because of financial difficulties, to return to the same conditions of living and of working as led to their breakdown in health in the first instance. The plan to be implemented under this measure ensures that after-care and rehabilitation shall be given the fullest consideration. Further, the measure provides for adequate financial assistance to sufferers and their dependants to remove the worry factor which in prolonged illness so often militates against recovery. The campaign against _ tuberculosis authorized by this measure is an example of Commonwealth-State co-operation and collaboration at its best, working on a uniform plan for the positive health of the people. The States will continue to administer, control and utilize their existing organizations and facilities, expanding them to provide adequately for growing needs. The Commonwealth will bear the cost, by reimbursement to the States, of all new approved capital expenditure of the States from the 1st July, 1948, for land and buildings, furnishings, equipment and plant for use in the diagnosis, treatment and control of tuberculosis. Estimates of expenditure in this field alone, approach £500,000 for the current year. The Commonwealth will bear also the whole cost of maintenance expenditure of the State? approved by the Commonwealth in excess of the net maintenance expenditure incurred by the States in diagnosis, treatment and control of tuberculosis in th&gt;financial year 1947-48. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth has established » Division of Tuberculosis in the Department of Health and will assist the State,with medical and technical advice on the highest level to co-ordinate their activities and to shape the policy to be followed in all aspects of the campaign It is recognized that there is need to encourage more people in the medical and nursing professions to undertake training in the treatment and care of patientssuffering from tuberculosis. It- isnecessary also to overcome the fear of the disease which is at present a very real factor in reluctance by some to undertake this work. The Commonwealth will encourage the establishment of  thoraci  wings attached to teaching hospitals, foi the investigation and treatment of diseases of the chest, including tuberculosis. Medical students and traine,nurses will thus secure training in th early diagnosis of the disease, familiarity with its treatment, - and experience in the care of patients suffering from tuberculosis. In addition, the bill provide.' that the Commonwealth may pay subsidies to universities or other institution"to promote and assist investigation and research, and to develop courses of training in branches of medical science relating to tuberculosis problems. ThiDirectorGeneral of Health is empowered by the bill, subject to the direction of the Minister, to conduct, assist and provide for research, investigations, experiments, studies and training in relation to the detection and diagnosis of tuberculosis, and the treatment and after-care of sufferers from the disease. He may also arrange for the provision of scholarships for the post-graduate study of tuberculosis. </para>
                    <para>I have mentioned the social implications of the disease. There is a very real need for measures to educate the public about the means to combat the spread of tuberculosis and the value of early diagnosis and treatment. There is need in this way to destroy the fear of the disease and to overcome the reluctance of some people to undergo radiological examination. A big step towards achieve-  ment of these aims can be taken if the sufferer or the suspected sufferer can be assured that he and lis family or dependants will be relieved of financial worry during the period of his treatment and rehabilitation. The Commonwealth has for some years set aside for the States a sum of £250,000 annually for this purpose. It is proposed to continue this assistance and extend it to whatever degree is found to be necessary. Payments will be made to sufferers and their dependants, to encourage sufferers to refrain from working and to undergo treatment, to minimize the spread of the disease and to promote the treatment, after-care and rehabilitation of sufferers, [t is essential that people who suspect that they have tuberculosis should be encouraged by positive measures to overcome their fear of the disease and to seek examination and early treatment, secure in the knowledge that those in their care will be looked after and provided for. </para>
                    <para>The bill empowers the Director-General, subject to the direction of the Minister, to provide facilities for the examination of sufferers or suspected sufferers, for the medical care of sufferers, and for their after-care and rehabilitation. The Director-General is also empowered to take steps for the establishment of hospitals, sanatoriums, laboratories, diagnostic centres, after-care, radiological and other units and clinics for the diagnosis, treatment and control of tuberculosis. The bill makes provision for the setting up of an advisory council. This body, which will be representative of both State and Commonwealth interests, will include in its membership experts in the field of tuberculosis throughout the Commonwealth. The functions of this council are set out in the bill. Primarily, the council will advise the Minister on measures to be adopted to prevent and control tuberculosis, on <inline font-style="italic">standards</inline> of equipment and apparatus, standards of training of personnel, and standards of hospitals and sanatoriums. </para>
                    <para>It will be noted that, because of doubt as to Commonwealth power, the bill makes no provision for the compulsory radiological or other examination of the public.' nor does it attempt to make pro vision for the 'restraint of' recalcitrant infectious patients, or for the compulsory treatment of persons suffering from tuberculosis. These aspects, however, have not been overlooked, and the State* have asked the Commonwealth to prepare model legislation dealing with these matters for consideration by State governments where provision does not already exist in State law. </para>
                    <para>The campaign against tuberculosis provides for radiological and bacteriological examination to locate infected and infectious cases; for increased accommodation for sufferers and staff to care for them; for financial assistance to sufferers and their dependants; for after-care and rehabilitation of sufferers: and for research and ' development in methods of diagnosis, ' treatment and control of tuberculosis. As in the military field, so in this, attack is the best means of defence. The measure:" planned in this campaign are designed, not only to find and treat cases of tuberculosis, but also to safeguard healthy persons from infection, incapacity and death. With full implementation of the techniques of case-finding through radiological and other surveys, this protection will extend throughout the community, safeguarding Australians yet unborn. </para>
                    <para>Expenditure under the bill will be borne by the National Welfare Fund, established under the National Welfare Fund Act 1943-1945, except that expenditure of a capital nature on buildings, plant, equipment and furnishings, together with administrative costs, will be met from moneys appropriated by the Parliament from time to time. </para>
                    <para>The mere passing of legislation by this or any other parliament will not achieve a miraculous reduction of the incidence of tuberculosis. However, the campaign upon which we are now embarking can, with 'the co-operation of the public, the State governments and the medical profession, do much to improve the present position. The bill represents a contribution by the governments of Australia to positive health in the community. I feel sure that honorable members will endorse the Government's action in initiating these proposals. </para>

My sex is represented by two members only. As a matter of fact, we have 100 per cent, attendance at the moment, while the other sex is not so strongly represented, at any rate on the Government side of the chamber. For further proof of the truth of my statement that this is a man's world, let any one look at the constitution of our municipal councils and business firms. Let him consider our wages system, and, finally, let him look at any crowded tram car. Recently, I heard a woman say that she had had practical proof that the age of chivalry was not dead. "When she fell in attempting to board a tram car, the men behind stepped over her. They courteously refrained from treading on her. However, things are improving. Men no longer entirely dominate the scene, and women no longer accept without question that male notion of the inferiority of women. I am delighted that the Canberra Association of Women Graduates is attempting to remove some of the disabilities under which women labour, as was mentioned by the honorable member for  Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mrs. Blackburn)</inline> this afternoon. Some time ago, I was told that women were not eligible for appointment to permanent positions in the Commonwealth Public Service. 1 doubted the truth of this, and wrote for information to the Secretary of the Public Service Board, who replied as follows: - </para></talk.start><quote><para>In reply to your letter of 13th July, 1948, I desire to advise that it is not a fact that women are not eligible for permanent appointment to the Commonwealth Public Service.

Indeed, I believe that if the Minister and I were to have a contest at digging post-hole.» 1 would not he a had second. I am anxious to know who decides what appointments are suitable for females, and on what grounds certain of the positions in the list were selected. What is it, for instance, that constitutes the particular adaptability of a female to the office of librarian? Has she any superior ability in the mounting of a step-ladder ? On the other hand, is it, perhaps, that she has  a  nicer literary discrimination than men have? Just why in the world a female should be regarded as a better librarian than a male, but inferior as  a  clerk, I cannot understand. Discrimination of this sort against a female <inline font-style="italic">v</inline> similar to that which, in- the United States of America, is exercised against negroes. I propose to read part of a letter addressed by the women graduate? of Canberra to the Public Service Board seeking the removal of certain anomalies. The letter is divided into four parts, and particular emphasis is laid upon that section which deals with the position of librarians. One paragraph in the letter from the Canberra Association of Women Graduates to the Public Service Board reads - </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>We consider that the employment of women should be placed on such a basis that their training and education may be utilized to the best advantage and opportunities for advancement opened freely to them. </para></quote><para>Under the heading relating to salaries of departmental librarians, the following is stated: - </para><quote><para>We understand that the position of departmental librarian is open to women graduate? only. In addition to holding a University degree-  and I direct the attention of honorable members particularly to this portion -  appointees are recommended to take an approved course in librarianship of six to twelve months' duration. It appears, therefore, that each candidate for such a position has to undergo a qualifying minimum of three  to four years' professional training. The position of Assistant Librarian (F.), range £9G-£2Q8 (S.), is open to both graduates and non-graduates. </para></quote><para class="block">Apparently the assistant librarian may be a person who has had to undergo no particular training at all. The letter continues - </para><quote><para>The present salary range of the position &gt;f Librarian is- £238-£3U4 (S.) per annum, with no prospect of advancement beyond the maximum of the range which is only £6 higher than that of Assistant Librarian. </para></quote><para class="block">Setting aside the comparison of the two positions, this is in keeping, largely, with the general type of development that is taking place to-day. No recognition of additional skill is granted. It is only fair, at this stage, that I should read the portion of the letter from the Secretary of the Public Service Board, relating to the salary range, which is as follows: - </para></speech><para>Salaries of Librarians</para><para>In regard to your statement that the margin between the maxima of the salary ranges of the positions of Assistant Librarian and Librarian is only £0, it might be pointed out that this is not quite correct. The difference on standard salaries is only £30, but whereas the occupant of the position of Assistant Librarian is not entitled to payment of " marginal allowance ", the occupant of a position of Librarian is entitled to such an allowance. The actual difference in salary at the maximum of the two positions is £51 per annum as shown hereunder: - </para><para class="block">After setting out the table, the letter continued - </para><quote><para>The Board has noted your statement of the rates paid to Librarians employed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the Parliament, but could not agree that because these rates are paid by these bodies, Public Service rates should be increased correspondingly. Bates in the Public Service must, of necessity, be fitted into the whole structure of Public Service clasifications, and the board can see no reason for their variation as proposed by your Association. </para></quote><para class="block">The letter then deals with the entry of women into" the Third Division of the Public Service, which is the clerical division, as I understand it. </para><para>I shall now read another extract from the women graduates' letter, from which honorable members will gain a little more detail in regard to the position of women, that will give them food for thought - </para><quote><para>There appears to be no reason under the Public Service Act why girls as well as boys should not be permitted to take the competi tive examination for entry into the Third Division. We draw attention to a statement ou page 13 of the 23rd Annual Report of the Commonwealth Public Service (1048) that " the number of lads seeking employment in the Third as well as the Fourth Division falls very much below the needs of the Departments, resulting in unbalanced staff establishments While we do not suggest that the difficulties of finding junior staff to " do the simpler and more routine tasks of the Third and Fourth Division " would be solved by the recruitment of women, we do urge that girls be permitted to sit for the examination for entry to the Third Division if they so desire, and be appointed on a competitive basis to such vacancies as occur annually, and that women seeking entry to the Public Service under section 30a as graduates should not be debarred from permanent appointment by reason of .sex. </para></quote><para class="block">The position in Great Britain is then mentioned. I remind the House that the British Civil Service is regarded as one of the finest in the whole world. That service has a tradition that is beyond reproach, and women have been appointed to most exalted positions in it. The table shows that, in the administrative section of the British Civil Service there are 3,718 men and 567 women. The corresponding section of the Commonwealth Public Service is completely closed to women. In Great Britain there are women heads of departments which make the departments here look completely puny and relatively unimportant. In the executive section of the British Civil Service there are 40,030 men, and 10,273 women. By contrast with the large proportion of women in the British Civil Service, of 14,079 permanent employees in the Third Division of the Commonwealth Public Service at the 30th June, 1947, only 65 were women. The letter continues - </para><quote><para>We strongly urge, therefore, that women be encouraged to seek entry to the Third Division. </para></quote><para>The reply from the Secretary of the Public Service Board to that very convincing statement by the women graduates reads - </para><quote><para>In some special cases women may be employed in Third Division positions of a professional or clerical nature. This occurs when the positions concerned are of a type which may be lulled by women more appropriately than nien,  as, for instance, Librarians. Generally, however, females-  not " women " this time -  are not employed in administrative, professional or clerical, positions. </para><para>Those-  officers  who are. employed in clerical or professional positions may advance by way nf promotion to the highest administrative positions in the Service, and, in fact, the source of recruitment of senior administrative officers is from those officers who have filled clerical or professional positions. In these cases, therefore, continuity of experience  in  the Public Service is regarded as essential, and for this reason the employment of females in clerical or professional positions is regarded as undesirable. The Commonwealth Public Service Act forbids the employment of married women unless  in  a particular case there are special circumstances which would, from the point of view of the Service, warrant employment of a married woman. The predominant marrying age of women in Australia is twenty-four years and in view of this, and the embargo on the employment of married women, it is obvious that there would, of necessity, bc a fairly large turnover of officers in clerical and professional positions if females were freely employed in such positions. As stated above, continuity of service in these positionsis desirable, and this could not be obtained if women were employed therein. </para></quote><para class="block">Honorable members may be interested to hear that six members of the library staffs are about to marry, and that is causing considerable commotion among the staffs concerned. </para><para>The third point raised- concerns the temporary employment of women in permanent positions. The women graduates, in their letter, said - </para><quote><para> Some of our members have complained that they have been given temporary employment in permanent positions for which they have  applied,  no reason, except that of sex, being advanced for such/ action. We feel that this policy is not in the best interests of women, particularly graduates. Although we recognize that there are possibly good reasons for making temporary appointments (both male and female) to permanent positions and that in cases, for example, of inability to satisfy standards of health demanded, it is desirable to oiler temporary employment, we recommend that if a woman applicant for a permanent position is considered to satisfy educational, medical and other requirements of the position, she .should be appointed permanently after serving a satisfactory probationary period. </para></quote><para class="block">The board replied to that as follows : - </para><quote><para>Referring to your representations regarding the temporary employment of women in permanent positions, it might he pointed out that it is not always possible to obtain, immediately, the services of a suitably qualified male. In such circumstances, a female may be employed temporarily in the position' until the services of a suitable male can be secured but for the reasons stated above, the Board could not agree to the permanent  appointment  of women to positions of this nature. </para></quote><para>With regard to the final point, th, employment of married women, the honorable member for Bourke hasmentioned that in New South Wales and Great Britain the disqualification of a woman for service on the ground of marriage has already been removed. Bui on this point the Public Service Board says - </para><quote><para>Apart from other considerations, it is not considered that Australian conditions are such that the employment of married women won l(i be advisable from a. social viewpoint. </para></quote><para class="block">I should imagine that no one in Australia would regard me as holding marriage lightly. Indeed, I am a champion of marriage. I know of no institution which can bring greater happiness and I believe that all our laws and customs should be directed towards the maintenance of that institution on a stable basis. Nevertheless, I say that in the circumstances which obtain to-day the debarring of. married women from any service of a permanent nature or, indeed, from any employment within the Public Service, except under extraordinary conditions, is a very foolish practice indeed. There are many women who are childless and must of necessity remain childless whose marriage, therefore, is not likely to offer them sufficient employment to keep . them healthily engaged. Such women should not be debarred from entering a service for which they are fitted. I remind the committee that during the war no bar was placed upon, the- service that was accepted from women. ' The bar that now exists should be removed. There will always be in Australia a far greater proportion of married women who will remain in their homes because of work which they have to do in their homes than will accept work outside. At the same time there will always be great numbers whose qualifications are such that they can give even greater service after marriage than before. I mention for instance the teaching profession, although my point in that respect does not  apply  so much in the Commonwealth sphere a? in the State sphere. A married teacher who, herself, has children is a particularly suitable person to carry on the education of .children. The Government, which  is composed of a party which for many years has included in its platform the principle of equality for men and women in all spheres of citizenship, should be the very last to maintain the disabilities under which women work' in the Commonwealth Public Service. I remind honorable members that on a previous occasion I had reason to draw the attention of the Government to certain press advertisements of positions at a certain salary for male applicants and a lower salary for female applicants although the qualifications demanded in each instance were very high and they were completely equal. I commend to the Government the respresentations placed before them by the Canberra Association of Women Graduates; and I congratulate those women upon the action they have taken in this matter. </para><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1073</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KHL</name.id><electorate>Melbourne PortsMinister for Labour and National Service</electorate><party>ALP</party><role /><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLLOWAY, Edward</name><name role="display">Mr HOLLOWAY</name></talker><para>. - I wish to refer to an incident which occurred in the chamber just prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner.

The incident in this chamber this afternoon was a very sad one. The word " liar " was bandied about, and men's reputations were besmirched. The honorable member for New England made a very nasty remark, which I resent strongly, but unfortunately, the attention of the  Chairman  was not drawn to it. He suggested that the Minister for Defence left the chamber in order to confer with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> so that the Prime Minister would not afterwards come in and contradict anything that he had said. That was a rotten thing for the honorable member to say. In my opinion, the honorable member for New England is not fit, morally or in any other way, to clean the Prime Minister's boots. I resent the suggestion that the Prime Minister would lower himself by conniving with anybody to support some statement that he did not believe to be right. Nobody in Australia but the honorable member for New England would suggest such a thing. I think honorable members ought to think seriously about the nature of these accusations and imputations. Such incidents are unusual.I have been a member of this Parliament for about seventeen years, but never before have I known the leaders of two parties in opposition to swallow their words after deliberately calling another honorable gentleman a liar. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1074</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>F4T</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">FADDEN, Arthur William</name><name role="display">Mr Fadden</name></talker><para>-  I did not call the Minister for Defence a liar.

I believe that 90 per cent, of honorable members opposite have been quite sincere in expressing dissatisfaction with the Government's defence plans and have asked for information about them in all seriousness. However, when the defence work being carried out by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research came under consideration this afternoon, they almost turned the matter into a joke. They ridiculed matters about which, earlier in the week, they had expressed grave concern. I cannot understand why they chop and change in this way. One honorable member attacked <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett, the  Chairman  of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, because he had told a scientific gathering that he deplored the tendency not to treat scientific research as being international in character. I have been associated with scientific groups for many years, and was particularly interested in their work in my youth. I have attended the discussions of many such bodies, and I took part in numerous meetings of the Universal Union on Saturday afternoons and evenings. I have heard Professor Oliphant, and other eminent scientists and scholars declare that investigations of the commercial potentialities of atomic power have been in progress for the past 20 or 30 years. Such men have often said that science, like music, is essentially international in character. I presided over a  meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall at which the people of Melbourne welcomed delegates to the first international science congress held in Australia. Amongst other projects, the visiting scientists were engaged in making an international map of the zodiac. Representatives of various countries had been allotted zones to chart, and they were engaged in completing the task as an international undertaking. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett was speaking on those lines when he made the statement to which the honorable member for Barker objected. The honorable member suggested, quite wrongly, that it was not nice to say that scientific studies should be carried out on an international basis. All scientific men make declarations like that from time to time. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1075</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KEP</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">FALKINDER, Charles</name><name role="display">Mr Falkinder</name></talker><para>- Did <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett's statement refer to the study of atomic energy? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1075</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KHL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLLOWAY, Edward</name><name role="display">Mr HOLLOWAY</name></talker><para>- Yes, atomic energy was included.

Knowing the man, I am confident that he could not have suggested such things as honorable members opposite assert. When Professor Oliphant returned to Australia, I had the privilege of hearing his report to Cabinet on the subject of nuclear physics. I also heard him lecture about it publicly. He said that scientists had known about atomic energy for 20 or 30 years, but had not hastened their experiments because they were destined for commercial use. Research work was not speeded up until, during the war, somebody suddenly . suggested that atomic power might be harnessed for the purposes of war. That brought the matter to a head. For 30 years, scientists have known as much about the commercial uses of atomic energy as they know now. But the oil companies and other profitmaking organizations were not anxious to encourage this development. However, as soon as it was suggested that atomic energy could be harnessed for war purposes, everybody became excited and experiments in the production of atom bombs were hurried forward. 'Some countries may have more information than others about this subject. I do not know, and the honorable member for New England does not know. In any case, I am sure that any information in the possession of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is as safe as it would be in the hands of scientists in any other country. While <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett is in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, I am certain that the Australian people will be confident that there will be no leakages of atomic secrets. The Leader of the Australian Country party quoted from a confidential document, which is not available to other honorable members. I do not say this in a nasty way, but I point put that the right honorable gentleman said deliberately, " This is a confidential document, and therefore it cannot be tabled in the Parliament ". When he read the statement from that confidential document, he implied that some other person was the source of the leakage of information - some one who was disloyal and was giving away secrets. He read from a confidential document which had come to him in an almost criminal way and contained information that neither the right honorable gentleman nor any one of us had any right to possess. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1076</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KNX</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HARRISON, Eric</name><name role="display">Mr Harrison</name></talker><para>- Is this a hush-hush policy? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1076</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KHL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HOLLOWAY, Edward</name><name role="display">Mr HOLLOWAY</name></talker><para>- Why has the Leader of the Australian Country party refused to lay the document on the table ? </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1076</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>F4T</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">FADDEN, Arthur William</name><name role="display">Mr Fadden</name></talker><para>- If I am permitted to read the whole of the document, I shall lay it on the table.

The Minister for Labour and National Service criticized some observations which I directed to the Minister for Defence after he had reflected on my personal integrity. The Minister for Defence knows that I have repeatedly refuted that allegation by personal explanation in this chamber, but because he was stumped for an answer and was losing the argument, he repeated it. I told him that he was lying, and the Minister for Labour and National Service has taken rue to task for making that statement in my own defence. I propose to show precisely how the Minister for Defence has gained his reputation. When I commenced this debate this afternoon, I directed the attention of the Minister to reports that the United States of America was reluctant to make available to Australia information dealing with atomic and other high defence matters, because of a fear that there would be a leakage to Russia through Australian </para></talk.start><para class="block">Communists. I remarked that I had noticed that, in the Estimates, provision had been made for nuclear investigation, and I expressed the opinion that the facts called for an explanation as to how far the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research was involved in atomic investigation and high defence secrets. ] considered that the Minister should make that explanation so that the Parliament should know the facts. The Minister replied that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research was not concerned with secret defence measures. But the Minister for Labour and National Service has told us that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is concerned with defence secrets. I suggest that both Ministers should get together and clarify their minds about the position. Either the Minister for Defence is right or the Minister for Labour and National Service is right, but both of them cannot be right. Immediately 1 resumed my seat, the Minister for Defence rose with a display of righteous indignation, and told me that the report that the United States of America had refused to permit atomic information to be made available to Australia was false. He then engaged in a lengthy dissertation to prove that the report was partypolitical propaganda, in which the press and the Opposition had indulged. Indeed, he said that the press and the Opposition had combined in this way to do a great disservice to Australia. When the Minister resumed his seat, the Leader of the Australian Country party asked him to confirm or deny a few matters. First, he sought some information about persons who were present at a meeting at Downing-street, London, on the 8th July at 11.30 a.m. He failed to draw attention to the fact that the British Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Attlee,</inline> was in the chair, and that the Australian Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley,</inline> was in attendance. Others present were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> Morrison, Lord  President  of the Council; <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stafford</inline> Cripps, Chancellor of the Exchequer; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> H.

I shall read one extract from that document to prove how the Minister for Defence sought to mislead this chamber and the country when he said that the American authorities were not reluctant to communicate to Australia certain secret information on atomic energy. Facts are facts, and if this statement is not correct, let the Prime Minister deny it. The extract reads as follows: - </para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Attlee</inline>asked whether there were any specific questions which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> would like to discuss with Ministers generally or individually during the course of his stay in this country, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> stated there were four other points that he would like to take up.

That is the only interpretation that can be placed upon it. I was not aware that such a paper existed until I opened the debate on this item. I am certain that this paper would never have seen the light of day if the Minister had been frank with the committee and had not sought to mislead it and the country in his usual manner.  His  statement was only one of a succession of mis-statements. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has had to take the honorable gentleman to task before. When the Minister's attention has been drawn to quotations that he has made from documents, he has thereupon claimed that they are confidential and has refused to table them.

I do not propose to allow any Minister to chide me about having made allegations against the veracity of another Minister when the Minister himself has provoked me into doing so by making what he knew to be a lying statement. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1078</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K0K</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CONELAN, William</name><name role="display">Mr Conelan</name></talker><para>-  I rise to order.

It is a sad commentary upon the morality of persons who have been Ministers of the Crown, and presumably have some regard for the principle of cabinet secrecy, that they are prepared to quote from a document containing a record of what is alleged to be a British Cabinet meeting and which has been purloined from some source.

Such a discussion was not one of the purposes of my mission to the United Kingdom. My mission was to deal with purely economic subjects.

If there are any secrets associated with atomic research they relate to the industrial technique for the harnessing of atomic energy hut that has not been a subject for discussion between the two governments because we have no atomic stock-pile.

As I have said, any country that has the physicists, scientists and the money could develop the atomic bomb over a period of years. But there is quite a lot of industrial technique to be learned before atomic energy can be harnessed. There never was any agreement between the British Government and the Government of the United States of America to disclose to each other the results of. research or experiments on atomic energy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> and the late  President  Roosevelt did reach an agreement about atomic bombs, but not about atomic energy.

When I say that there is not the faintest evidence that there has been a leakage of secret information from any public authority in this country, I am speaking from my own knowledge and the investigations of men of the highest calibre who are charged with the responsibility of finding out these things. I have no doubt that individuals who may be called "fellow travellers " get into various organizations. There may be some such person at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research wheeling a barrow or cleaning windows; but these people do not have anything to do with secret information or experiments. I spoke with leading scientists in Great Britain who are engaged on highly secret defence work. The statements made about <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett had been brought to their notice and they expressed, without qualification, their complete confidence in him and in the work he was doing for Australia. Those opinions were expressed by men who knew <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett, not only by reputation, but also knew him personally. I do not propose to go into al) the details of security measures taken in this country, disclosure of which is not usual in any country. As I said before, I do not know of anything more indecent than the action of the right honorable member for Darling Downs. I do not resent the charges that the Opposition might believe it necessary to make if it considers that the security provisions made by the Government are insufficient. That could be a reasonable charge in the light of the incomplete information in the possession of the Opposition. Honorable member? of the Opposition are not as well informed as I am on this particular subject. 1 am particularly well informed as to whether there is any evidence of any leakage of information of a scientificnature. I am in a position tq state, to the British Cabinet, the American Government, or to the people of the? country, that there is not the faintest proof that secrets of that kind are going out from any government department ot any individual in any government department in this country. It is perfectly true that nobody can know anything with complete certainty. Even the exact time of birth or death is not known with certainty, although one may have some reasonable certainty regarding the hour of sunrise. However, with all the certainty possible  to me, I say that no secrets have been communicated to any one not entitled to know them, and 1 defy anybody in this or any other country to prove the contrary.

I am not in that fortunate position. As I have said, after the war there was some relaxation in security services and a reduction in the number of individuals employed in them in various countries. It is true that the Australian Government, which had utilized services of a number of special directors such as the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> who was -Commissioner of Police in New South "Wales, allowed them to return to their ordinary duties after the war was over. It is also true that the number of people engaged in the security service in Australia was reduced. In that respect, however, I may remind honorable members that one of the most frequent charges made by the Opposition is that there are too many persons employed in the Public Service. Since the war, to our bitter disappointment and contrary to our hopes, there has arisen a degree of tension in the world which has caused a fear of another war, and as a result security services and counter-espionage services in all the allied countries have been built up again. It may be perfectly true that Australia has not reconstituted its security services as rapidly as have other countries. The Australian Government has not directed a special staff to engage in counter-espionage work. Instead it has retained on that work men who seem to me and to the Minister for Defence reasonably competent and able to fulfil its requirements. I am not in a position to disclose all the security matters with which I have had dealings, hut I repeat that nobody has been able to produce any evidence that any secrets in regard to defence scientific experiments have leaked out through anybody. In that statement I am backed by the opinion of people more competent to express an opinion on this subject than I am. These matters have been thoroughly investigated. It may also be true that in view of world events at the present time the security services ought to be strengthened and more highly qualified men ought to be recruited to them. 1 have had discussions on that matter, and I do not deny the truth of that proposition, because I am just as anxious about the security of Australia as are those who shout and make false statements about it, and by doing so could very easily do this country more harm in the eyes of other nations with whom it is associated than the Russians themselves could do. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1082</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JLL</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">ABBOTT, Joseph</name><name role="display">Mr Abbott</name></talker><para>- That is pretty low. </para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1082</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KNX</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HARRISON, Eric</name><name role="display">Mr Harrison</name></talker><para>- The Prime Minister is descending to the level of the debate. </para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1082</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JWR</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CHAMBERS, Cyril</name><name role="display">Mr Chambers</name></talker><para>- Does the Acting Leader of the Opposition admit that the level of the debate has been low? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1082</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>A48</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CHIFLEY, Ben</name><name role="display">Mr CHIFLEY</name></talker><para>- It may be that I am very sensitive in these matters, but <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> consider that members of Parliament, who have a responsibility to the country and ought to be regarded by other nations as responsible persons with a sense of decency, should never have made the statements that I have been told were made here to-day.

There is not the slightest evidence anywhere that anybody associated with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research or any officer of the Government, has divulged any secrets whatsoever. In saying so, I am confining myself to the attack that has been made here to-day, upon that particular body. Honorable members opposite may say that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has grown up in a loose fashion so far as its administration is concerned. I remind them that that body was not established for the purpose of dealing with defence research. It was established to conduct experiments in connexion with civil production and economy. It was not established by this Government, and it did grow up in a rather loose manner. It has been enlarged in recent years and now has about 5,000 employees. It is possible that from time to time this Government, or some other government, may find it necessary to review the form of that body's administration. Some years before I became Prime Minister I considered that aspect, and as the result of my consideration the employees of the Repatriation Commission were placed under the control of the Public Service Board. Possibly, the employees of some other government instrumentalities should also be brought under the control of the Public Service Board. Be that as it may, I desire to emphasize the magnificent work done for this country by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Although I feel sure that the economic and political views of the  chairman  of that council, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Rivett, would not coincide with mine, I should be doing him an injustice if I did not point out thatno servant of the Commonwealth is held in higher respect or is more trusted than he is. Furthermore, I am convinced that no one is more loyal to Australia, or is more conscious of his country's interests, than is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David.</inline> I know that he would not do anything to the detriment of the country's interest or its security. </para></talk.start></continue><para>To revert to the subject of national security, although I do not propose to reveal details of the precautions being taken, because it is not customary for responsible members of the government of any country to discuss such matters in public, I can assure honorable members that I have given the closest attention to this matter.

If there is the slightest evidence that more drastic measures should be taken to safeguard our security, that more competent or highly trained officers should be engaged on security, or that action should be taken of a kind different from that taken hitherto, the Government will not hesitate.

Their tasks include preparation of material for Radio Australia, the short-wave division of the department, and for the Film Division in Sydney. They issue seventeen periodica] newsletters for overseas on specialized subjects such as agriculture, tourist activities, sport, women's interests, the arts in Australia, and so on. They prepare and arrange all the material for two quarterly and two monthly printed and illustrated publications, and carry out the research for and writing of at least 60 full-length, illustrated magazine articles each month. They constantly revise and bring up to date major publications on Australia, and have just completed six separate editions - one for each State - of a book called <inline font-style="italic">A Handbook for Hie New Australian.</inline> They are expected constantly to plan and carry out as many journalistic, educational, film, booklet and radio activities as their numbers and available finances will allow in the interests of Australia overseas. They also spend much time attending to special requests from overseas for information and for articles for specific magazines, and are thus fully engaged on journalistic, educational and public relations work on so high a level that none but experienced and highly competent men could handle it. </para>

                        <para>d. - On the 16th September, the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mrs. Blackburn)</inline> asked whether consideration had been given to requests from the Australian Association for Better Hearing regarding the abolition of customs dutson all hearing aids and the batteries required to operate them, the allocation of sufficient dollars to ensure the necessary quantity and quality of such hearing aids, and the removal of any prohibition on the importation of suitable ingredient? for batteries for these purposes. The Minister for Trade and Customs has now advised as follows : - </para>

                        <para>The matter raised by the association hu&gt;&gt; been considered, but as electric hearing aids of United Kingdom manufacture, which are free nf customs duty, are available to the Australian market, it is not possible under Australia'* commitments with the United Kingdom to remove the duty of 174 per cent, ad valorem applicable to similar hearing aids imported from the United States of America. The position in..regard..to. dry.Jiatteries.iB._at present being examined, and if the Minister is satisfied, as a result of the inquiries being made, that the locally manufactured batteries, are not of satisfactory quality, consideration would be given to the. admission at concessional rates of duty of these goods or of any type of batteries of a class or kind not commercially manufactured in Australia, The allocation of dollars which has been made for the first two quarters nf the current financial year would enable importers to provide essential replacement parts (which would include batteries) and a number of' new instruments for use by persons whose requirements could not be met adequately by a hearing aid of United Kingdom origin. The allocation of dollars was approved by the Government after sympathetic consideration bad been given to needs of the members of the community whose hearing is impaired and was in consequence relatively substantial. There is no prohibition upon the importation of essential materials or components for use in the manufacture of batteries for hearing aids. Licences have been issued for the importation from dollar areas of certain mercury type batteries owing to the inferiority of similar types of batteries from easier currency sources. </para>

                        <para>Twenty positions were created by the Public Service Board in the Prices Branch gazetted on 9th September, 1948. The reason was to provide an avenue of promotion for a limited group of permanent officers who have been on temporary transfer to the price administration for a considerable period, and have missed opportunities of promotion which would otherwise have been available to them in their own or other departments. The classifications have been fixed by the Public Service Board on a basis which will readily permit the absorption  if  the officers in the Department of Trade and Customs and other departments. </para>
