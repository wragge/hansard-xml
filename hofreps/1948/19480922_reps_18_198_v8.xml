                        <para>- In view of the fact that Sir Thomas Blamey's visit to Japan waa arranged by the Department of External Affairs, and that his fares were paid by the Government, will the Prime Minister say- whether the same arrangements have been made for those who accompanied him? Is it a fact, as reported, - that Mr. H. G. Alderman, K.O., was sent with Sir Thomas Blamey as a special representative of the Government to attend to his public relations? If Mr. Alderman did not go in that capacity, was he given any credentials by the Government, and has he been authorized to enter into any negotiations while in Japan for the purchase or acquisition of any broadcasting stations, air lines, or other commercial enterprises or agencies on behalf of the Government or the Australian Labour party?  Is the Government paying Mr. Alderman's fares, and is he in receipt of any retainer by the Government in connexion with the visit? </para>

                            <para>- I was informed that it was indicated in a newspaper article that Mr. Alderman was to accompany Sir Thomas Blamey to Japan. Sir Thomas Blamey went to Japan at the invitation of the Commander-in-Chief, General MacArthur. Sir Thomas Blamey was formerly Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Army, and General MacArthur  invited him, as an act of courtesy, to visit Japan. I understand that the opportunity will be taken to discuss various matters while he is there. Accordingly, arrangements were made for him to visit Japan, and for  Colonel Dwyer  to accompany him. I saw a statement in a newspaper that Mr. Alderman was accompanying Sir Thomas Blamey. I had no knowledge of any such arrangement,either as Prime Minister or Minister acting for the Minister for External Affairs, but I assumed that it was only natural that the press should know more of the matter than I did I made some inquiries, however; and learned that Mr. Alderman knew nothing about it either, apart from the newspaper report. Therefore, the answers to the honorable member's questions are that no arrangements were made for Mr. Alderman to go to Japan; Mr. Alderman has not gone to Japan ; Mr. Alderman did not accompany General Blarney; and, therefore, he has received no commission or retainer to inquire' into anything in Japan. </para>

                        <para>-- -Recently, I drew  attention to a statement made by a member of the Queensland executive of the Communist party that Australian Communists would fight on the side of the Soviet Union if Australia were involved in a war between Russia and the Western Powers. The Prime Minister undertook to have inquiries made by the Acting Attorney-General. I remind the Prime Minister that shorthand notes were taken of the speech. As it is important that action be taken promptly because of the special circumstances in which the subversive statement was made, can the Prime Minister say what action he proposes to take, and what recommendation he has received from the Acting Attorney-General ? </para>

                    <para>- In connexion with the action proposed to he taken to stabilize, the wheat industry, it has- been rumoured that farmers will receive only 6s. 3d. a bushel at Australian ports for all wheat sold overseas. My interpretation of the proposed plan is that while we have guaranteed 6s. 3d. a bushel to the fawners, irrespective ofwhat price is received is Australian wheat should realize prices in excess of that figure they will receive the full benefit of the guaranteed price, plus the profit made at a result of such higher prices, during the currency of the plan. I should be glad if the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture would explain to the House the exact provisions of the scheme. </para>

                    <para>- There is no truth whatsoever in the rumour mentioned by thehonorablemember for Riverina. The position is perfectly clear, and the system that has hitherto' operated' will continue. In all cases where the guaranteed price  is  exceeded, the proceeds from external and internal sales will be equalized, and the farmers will receive the additional amount. The guaranteed price of 6s. 3d. a bushel is related to the index figure for the cost of production.In some cases it may be substantially more than 6s.3d should the cost of production rise. In the event of the export price falling below 6s. 3d., in association with the index figure for the cost of production: the farmer will receive from the Commonwealth the price guaranteed as ascertained in association wilh the index figure for the cost of production. It would take a considerable time to explain complete details of the plan.I do not desire to intrude on the patience of honorable members, for I think that all intelligent people fully understand the position. It is quite clear that the farmer will receive the benefits of any prices received in excess of the guaranteed price as a result of overseas sales. </para>

                <para>Will the Prime Minister inform the House whether the switchover to frequency modulation will  cost ai least £5,000,000 in the next five years? "Will he say also whether the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which has a monopoly of frequency modulation, cannot now, from 'licence-fees, meet its current expenditure, and that the cost of the 'change-over to frequency modulation will be met, probably, by direct government payments, 'and increased wireless, licence-fees? If so, in view of the urgent -need for greater economies to be -effected in Commonwealth expenditure, and the desirability of devoting all available -moneys to 'Schemes of national development, -will the Prime Minister 'defer any 'further action in this regard?

                        <para>- The question comes most appropriately from a member of the- ".hill-billy " party. The Government will not stand in the way .of progress, and any developments in technique or improvements in the .method of broadcasting .will be placed at the service of the .Australian people, to their advantage. Frequency modulation is not an experimental process any longer in the .United .States of America or  Great  Jiri tam, nor is .television facsimile broadcasting. .Progress is being made in all those fields, .and the Government considers that the Australian people should have the benefit of the developments .as they become available. All that we are doing .is to ensure -that the developments shall be utilized .to ;the best -possible advantage. This Government always acts in the national interest in everything that it does, and in the matter of broadcasting, we consider that it is more important that the people should have service than that some other people should have the advantage of exploiting the product of the inventive genius of mankind for their own particular benefit. Contrary to the best advice of men like the former Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, Sir Harry Brown, certain people in the past were given opportunities to invade the public domain in broadeasting to make profits from it. The Government desires to produce order out of chaos, and, therefore, is pursuing itf present policy. </para>

                        <para>- I shall answer the question that the honorable member for Bourke has asked, because it relates to a matter within the jurisdiction of the Public Service Board, which is administeredby the Prime Minister's Department. The honorable member referred to the salaries and working conditions of officers in the lower grades of the Public Service, especially those in the Postmaster-General's Department. She will recall that some time ago the Public Service Arbitrator made an award applicable to officers in the higher divisions of the Public Service, particularly the third division. Numbers of requests have been received for a reconsideration of salaries of employees in the fourth division, particularly in the Postmaster-General's Department. I have discussed the matter with the Public Service Board which is dealing with it on behalf of the Government, and I have been informed that certain consultations will take place in the near future. I assure the honorable member that the matter is now being examined by the Public Service Board. </para>

There are some who have not obeyed the law, and they will be prosecuted. The first prosecution will be launched against Lars Gustav Brundahl, who has failed to register, and whose contempt for the law is quite notorious. He has been 32 years in this country, and he has never tried to become naturalized. He has failed to obey the law recently enacted. He will receive a summons, and he can explain to the court why he has not registered. He might also tell the court what his real nationality is; and that might help in other directions. </para>

Is the Prime Minister aware that although Australians are British subjects and travel on British passports they still have to obtain vises, because Australia has failed to make a corresponding arrangement with the French Government or to participate in the British scheme ? "Why was this not done? Will the Prime Minister take steps to rectify the position so that Australian passports will be worth the paper they are written on? </para>

                        <para>- I wish the honorable member for Parramatta had seen me before he asked his question.I could have put him on the right track. Agreement has been reached between the British Government and the governments of a number of other countries to abolish vises. The Australian Government was asked to do the same thing. We have refused to abolish them for the time being because the issue of a vise to a person who possesses a passport gives us at any rate some check for security purposes. In the present disturbed condition of the world we like to know who is coming into this country from abroad We think that we shall be better able to protect the interests of Australia if our consular or diplomatic representatives have an opportunity to keep a check upon the people who want to come here. </para>

                            <para>- The views of the British Government and the Australian Government are not necessarily the samp upon all questions. Security may not be as vital to Britain, having regard to its geographical position, as it is to us, with our wide open spaces, experiments on the guided weapons range, and other circumstances. We have to weigh, first the claims of the travelling public who are generally wealthy people with plenty of time on their hands and ability to move around without difficulty, and, secondly, the claims of the security of the nation. Whilst world conditions continue to be unsettled, we think that the security of the nation should be given first con- sideration. The time may come when we shall be able to abolish vises, but we do not propose to do so at present. It may be some years before we can do what is suggested. The obtaining of a vise does not involve any serious inconvenience. Some people have gone from Britain to Switzerland without obtaining vises and as a result have experienced some difficulty, but if they had gone to the Swiss Consul-General in London and obtained vises from him they would have encountered no difficulty. I am sorry if the honorable member for Parramatta suffered any personal inconvenience whilst he was abroad, but he will agree chat the claims of the nation are greater than those of any individual member of it. </para>

                        <para>- I am very interested in the establishment of an Australian Government shipping line. Will the Prime Minister say whether the Government has decided to establish such a shipping line, to include all ships at the present time owned by the Australian Government and chartered to private companies? If a government shipping line is to be established, will it be administered by a commission, and will its fleet consist only of cargo vessels or will it also include passenger vessels which will call at overseas ports? </para>

                            <para>-There has been a great deal of comment in the newspapers regarding the possibility of the Australian Government engaging in shipping operations. I told the ship-owners some years ago that the Government would probably decide to continue to conduct a shipping line. The questions which were being discussed at that time were the building of ships in Australia and the type of engines with which they should be fitted. There was no secrecy about the matter at all. It would pro bably be correct to say that, in general, the Government's proposals cover the matters to which the honorable member for Wilmot has referred. It would, however, be much better if I furnished a statement setting out those proposals in detail. Final decisions have not yet been taken in regard to certain matters of administration, but in general, it can be said that the Government proposesto conduct shipping operations with shipsat present owned by it and, at a later date probably with ships built inGovernment shipyards. The shipping industry has known that for years, because I conveyed the information to the shipowners when I discussed with them the question of building ships in Australia. </para>

No good purpose can be served by blathering while negotiations are proceeding. There are far too many blatherers in the world to-day. The Minister for External Affairs and I have discussed with representatives of other countries, not only the question of human rights, which the honorable member for New England rightly raises, as a matter of great importance to the world, but also other matters associated with it, including human liberty and. the application of democratic practices. </para>

                            <para>- Tam endeavouring to answer as clearly as possible the numerous questions asked by the honorable member. I have given the assurance that I do not know Mr. Campbell, and that, so far as I am aware, he has never approached me or my department. There i"s no truth in the suggestion that I' might secure the cancellation of Mr. Wood'*licence. The Department of Civil Aviation has a responsibility to the public to ensure that trained engineers are capable  of performing their work, in an efficient manner. If Wood has been proved to have done his work in an inefficient manne] the suspension of his certificate will have been fully justified. However, as  this matter  is one on which a decision hae been reserved by the tribunal inquiring into it, I do not wish to pass judgment on the matter at all. Wood's work was brought under the notice of the proper authorities. He was suspended and  exercised his  right to appeal. The appeal was heard and a decision was reserved. Probably the honorable member will have- his curiosity satisfied, when, the decision is announced.. </para>

                        <para>- The question! which I am about to ask the Minister for Commerce and: Agriculture' is founded upon; a. report" which appeared in a Queensland newspaper about a. week ago to the effect that the National Security Regulation,which controlled the appraisal of tobacco, have been repealed and thetobacco grown in. North Queensland1  during last season can now be sold literally on the open market. As the Minister is aware, approximately 90 per cent, of the Australian tobacco crop had to be sold by the growers under strict government supervision. Can the Minister explain why the balance of the crop, which was grown in an electorate that is represented in the Parliament by a Minister &gt;f the Crown has been left free- </para>

                            <para>- I can assure the honorable member that the fact that part of northern Queensland is represented in this House by the Minister for r.he Navy has no connexion with the state of affairs which is alleged by the honorable member to exist in northern Queensland. No unfair discrimination is being exercised against tobacco-growers in other States because almost all the tobacco grown in those States has already been sold under the appraisal system. Furthermore, as the honorable member is doubtless aware, because of adverse local seasonal conditions, there is practically no tobacco left for sale in his own electorate. It is possible that a few outstanding parcels may remain unsold. If so, arrangements could probably be made for their sale on the open market. A substantial quantity of tobacco remained unsold in Queensland, and the tobacco-growers of Mareeba expressed great dissatisfaction with the appraisal system which had been in operation for some considerable time. Indeed, they were so dissatisfied with it that, in effect, they did what the worker so frequently does, and for which he is so frequently condemned. They went on strike, saying that they would not sell their leaf. Under the regulations tobacco-growers are required to deliver their tobacco for appraisal- </para>

                            <para> When I was so rudely interrupted by that ignoramus, the honorable member for New England. [ was about to say that tobacco-growers were required to submit their leaf for appraisal, and although there was no power under the regulations to force than to sell, they were prevented from selling at a price in excess of the appraised price. The position was further complicated by the fact that under the regulations they are required to submit their leaf for appraisal not later than the 31st December, the date upon which the regulations expire. The position became so difficult that the tobacco-growers of Mareeba, who did what the workers do when they are not satisfied and, in effect, went on strike, were so circumstanced that they could have refrained from selling their tobacco until the 31st December, the last day upon which the regulations are to operate, in which case satisfactory sale arrangements could not be made. In view of all the circumstances, and as Commonwealth control over prices was to cease on the 20th September, but only after I had made a factual and independent survey of the whole situation, I decided that the most sensible and satisfactory course to pursue was to allow them to sell their leaf on the open market by auction or through cbe Queensland Marketing Board. I make no apologies for that decision. Generally speaking, the appraisal system has been accepted by growers, and apparently it has been reasonably satisfactorily carried out in all States. </para>

As the honorable member for Barker realizes, such legislation would have to bo comprehensive and would require a. great deal of investigation before its provisions could be finally determined. I have always considered that it would be far more satisfactory if there were a Commonwealth company law. Some investigations have been made and reports furnished, but the Government has not actually decided to introduce such legislation. The matter is still being considered by the Attorney-General and his department and a report will be made to Cabinet later. </para>

                            <para>. - Contrary to popular belief there is no standard of living at all in this country. We have substituted instead a standard of spending. We have little conception of what a standard of living really means. We have a system of pensions  of  which honorable members opposite are inordinately proud. These pensions are, a? these things go, in nominal amount, relatively high, but for those who have  no  other resource they are barely a means of subsistence. We have high wages that benefit only those with no family responsibilities, and finally go to promote th, well-being of only bookmakers and brewers. We have short hours of labour, and it is generally admitted that during those hours of labour very few of us perform to the full extent of our powers. We have long hours of seeking for pleasures, every one of which is costly, and, indeed, it has come to be believed that only in the spending of money on pleasure do we achieve happiness and happiness therefore eludes us. I repeat that we have no standard of living, but only a standard of spending. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> made this clear in a trenchant attack upon the budget. He stripped it of its tinsel and showed it as the unhappy thing it is. He put his finger right on the spot that really matters when he said that the Government appeared to be mesmerized bv figures and had forgotten that the problems of the Government were human  problems and were not, after all, purely business problems. He showed just bow far the pound ' has 'lost its value and just how little can be bought to-day with money that a few years ago would have bought very much more, and when he was speaking on this very point, a stupid interjector asked, "Why did you vote 'No' at the referendum?"

                        <para class="block">I hope that those figures for last year will not be forgotten when price increases are discussed at the- end of another year, when the States are in control of prices. But this budget is a disquieting  documenfor  other reasons also, and for two in particular. The first is the confirmation which it gives of the knowledge that th, Government has .constantly infiltrated more and more into the whole social structure. I refer not merely to thai indirect influence which is inescapable with any form of government, but to direct government supervision, interference and control. The second reason for disquiet .is that the budget reveals in all its completeness the control .which the Commonwealth has achieved over the governments of the States. Many people will believe this <inline font-style="italic">te</inline> be due to the accident of war which brought about the system of uniform taxation. .1 challenge that -view. .1 believe that it is part of a deliberate plan "for the assumption of control by the Commonwealth over matters which should be controlled by the States. It is not generally known, I believe, that just a few weeks after the first agreement was made in respect of uniform taxation - an agreement which was to last for the duration of the war, and one year afterwards - the .Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> said, " This has come to stay. This is permanent ". And I do not think it is generally remembered that, in 1943. at the Australian Labour party's conference, a resolution was carried urging the movement to undertake a wide campaign to invest all controls in the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, I used to belong to the Australian Labour party. I shall go over that story at any time the .Minister wishes. That conference was .in 1943. In 1944, after the failure of an attempt. to induce the States to hand over certain powers that would trave made the Commonwealth Parliament supreme in a great many fields, the Government submitted proposals to the people in a referendum. That appeal failed, but the effort to obtain more power has been continuous, and it has not stopped yet. At the last conference &gt;f Commonwealth and State Ministers we noted the attitude of Commonwealth representatives, and of the Prime Minister in particular. In spite of the protests of all the State Premiers against the retention of the uniform taxation system, the Prime Minister remained adamant. Be would not even consider a, review of die present arrangement. </para>

                        <para>Now, it is a strange thing that the Premier of Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cosgrove,</inline> had just come through a general election in which it was generally believed that he stood for the return of taxing powers to the States. A resolution to that effect had been carried unanimously in the Parliament of Tasmania. Immediately afterwards, however, at the Premiers Conference <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Cosgrove repudiated  the idea in that he said that, for Tasmania, the old system would not work. The Prime Minister tried to set at rest the fears of the State Premiers by issuing a set of figures showing the savings of most of the States, and notably Tasmania, under the system of uniform taxation. From these figures he made out a very good case for the retention of uniform taxation, but I maintain that there is no comparable basis from which to draw conclusions. The Commonwealth could  not possibly have entered into some of its present commitments had the system of uniform taxation not been in operation. The financial and other conditions at present obtaining are wholly dependent upon the provisions of uniform taxation. Thus the Prime Minister's argument falls to the ground. But in any case, are we to accept the view that cost is the finalargument in matters of this kind? That is a suggestion which I strongly repudiate and which I shall deal with later. </para>
                        <para>I propose to refer to one other item in the budget, an item which was discussed in greater detail in some sections of the press. I quote from the budget the following passage : - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>At the  Baine  time the Commonwealth has made clear to the  Premiers  that, in its view, the States might reasonably be expected to make greater efforts to exploit their own revenue resources and, in particular, to ensure that the costs of business undertakings were as far as possible covered by the charges for the services rendered. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">That statement comes well from the head of the Government in view of the record of Trans-Australia Airlines, which lost £255,000 in the last financial year. Other recommendations which the Treasurer made included the raising of railway freight charges by the States. Is he aware that, as the result of financial undertakings entered into by the Government of Tasmania with the Commonwealth during the war, the railways in that State are hardly in a condition to carry freight? The Treasurer spoke of raising motor registration charges. I remind him that Tasmanian charges of that nature are the highest in the Commonwealth. I must say that I regard as pure effrontery on the part of the Treasurer the use of those arguments to the Premiers of the States. </para>
                        <para>I return now to the validity of th economic argument in all human and government relationships. We hear all too frequently in this House the .suggestion that all action springs from an economic motive, and that everything we do is governed by the profit  motive.  The acceptance of that view has led to a state of affairs which brought forth that speech from the honorable member for Reid to which I referred. When the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> was speaking about Communists he said that the only answer to communism was an economic answer, and that the only way to check communism was to abolish poverty. Surely the Minister knows that at this moment communism is flourishing in Australia as never before, and yet this Government continues to assert that Australia has never before been as prosperous as it is to-day. The argument falls very flat. </para>

                                <para>- If the Minister and the Government believe that, it may explain the inactivity on the part  of this Government in dealing with communism. If the Government believes that communism is not nourishing in Australia, no wonder it is prepared to say, " Don't put a ban on communism because it will merely be driven underground ". It is underground, largely, all the time and if the security service keeps the Government no better informed than that, it is time that the security service was overhauled. Are any of the Communists with whom we are familiar to-day other than prosperous? Does any one of them look poverty-stricken: does he preach his gospel in the slums? He does not. On the contrary, he moves amongst the people who have other reasons for discontent. I shall refer to this matter again later. </para>

                        <para>The Prime Minister said that the Government had always realized that security must be provided for the people of this country. I do not want to be misunderstood or misquoted in what I am about to say, and I hope that honorable members will pay particular attention to my remarks. I believe that every community has a responsibility to ensure some degree of security for all of its members. I said that on the first occasion on which L spoke after becoming a member of this Mouse, and I have repeated it since. Whilst every action I have since taken in this Parliament has been towards that end, I warn this Government against making that the final objective. Those who seek only security generally perish of their own inertia and inactivity. Any young country that encourages its young people to look only for security 18 losing the greatest thing that those people can give to the country, which is the fruit of their youth. Australia was not developed by those who sought only security, but rather by those possessed of a spirit of adventure who went out to win new places and make new homes. In people who are not already partially dead there remains an urge to express themselves in a field of wider endeavour. I believe that the Government by its continued reiteration of the word " security " is in some danger of stifling such incentive. Life itself involves a struggle which, in one form or another, must continue or we reach a point where life itself begins to die. That law of life has always operated. It was such a conception that Mussolini, in hi9 arrogance and stupidity, completely misunderstood, and misapplied, when he said that life meant all strife. It means "striving" not " strife ". </para>
                        <para>Honorable members have talked often of the philosophy of communism, but let us consider the philosophy of socialism. Let us also look at the fruits of that philosophy as we see them to-day.  Id  the near future we are likely to see them further developed. If there is one part of the constantly-repeated programme of this Government which makes a greater appeal to me than any other, it is that of full employment. That is  a  thoroughly admirable aim, and  I  have no patience with people who  say,  "What is full employment? We do not know what it means." It is not  a  matter of splitting straws about definitions, for we all know what is meant, but  I.  want to sound a note of warning to the Government and to those who may misquote me. I believe that the idea) that the Government has in mind is full of very grave danger. For a long time I have been convinced that such policies as it espouses must lead eventually to  a  form of industrial conscription in this country. Indeed that has already occurred in the stevedoring industry, as honorable members are well aware. Any extension of that principle will result in the complete conscription of industry. Look at the implementation of the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme. We know, and have heard the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> say in this House that some students were not allowed to undertake a course of their choice, because in the view of the Government there were already too many people in that industry, or that that waslikely to be the position in the future It was not because of their lack of ability to pursue such a course, or because the equipment was not -available with which to teach them the trade or profession that they wished to learn. That reveals what is taking place in the mind of this Government. When a government has a policy of full employment it should  assume the responsibility to provide opportunities for employment for every one. But when the Government assumes full and complete responsibility for the actual provision of work for all, theremust logically come a time when the Government takes the responsibility of deciding how many and who, shall work in a particular {industry. When the honorable member for Reid was speaking an honorable member asked by interjection, " Why did you have dole inspectors ? ". The reason is clear that there must be inspectors to control any dole system. Any system which attempts by government action to provide justice for one must observe justice for ali and if it would provide justice for all, it must ensure that none exploits his privileges and his opportunities. That was the classic argument of the Labour party in by-gone Jays with the other side of politics. It is a sound and proper argument to be used on either side. But I issue a warning that the Government is rapidly heading towards the same position in the opposite direction. We are moving to a point where all industry and all workers may be at the immediate direction of  the  Government. </para>
                        <para>There are other fields in which government penetration is likely to do almost incalculable harm. I propose to refer for a few moments to the Government's health schemes. Again, the conception that the Government should ensure that the community is healthy is good; but I should like to know whether this Government believes that health is merely a matter of medicine. ' Had I sufficient time, I should deal more fully with that aspect. The Government proposes to persist with a nationalized health scheme. Any system under which all  doctors  are the servants of the State becomes another form of conscription and regimentation. If the Government makes itself completely responsible for the employment of the community, it must assume complete responsibility for health. A man cannot work if he i3 ill, and if he must work, in justice to other people, when work is provided, the Government must also ensure that he is kept in health. In that way, the Government assumes responsibility for sending a man to a dentist, or to a surgeon in order to undergo an operation. The individual will have no choice in the matter. To some people, that view may seem to be rather far-fetched, but the system is already in operation in countries which have a completely socialized form of government and in an even more extreme form. For example, honorable members know that there is a gradual movement in the public mind towards the practise of euthanasia, which is the painless despatch of people whose life's span has nearly ended. We could quickly move from a point where the idea of euthanasia is tolerated to another point where euthanasia is legalized, and, under a system of complete nationalization of health, we can move to a point where legalization extends to compulsion. </para>

However, I know the honorable member better than he knows himself. I remind him that the execution of a criminal <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> undertaken in his name and my name. In other words, we shelve our individual responsibility by making it a collective responsibility. Not lone ago a noted surgeon said to me, "When you have nearly murdered a man as I have many times, you are overcome by a sense of intense horror. However, if you call in a medical colleague for consultation about the case, some of your load immediately lifts. If you call in half a dozen colleagues for consultation, you may even manage a smile or a laugh in a room next to that in which your patient is dying." The surgeon said that, for that reason, he would always oppose the idea of a nationalized health scheme, because under such a system his personal responsibility would be completely removed from him, as our individual responsibility to-day is taken from us in regard to capital punishment. Those are Logical ends to certain processes which are taking place to-day, and I should like honorable members to discuss them among themselves and not dismiss them as figments of my imagination. The developments which I have described are the inevitable results of socialism. In Germany and Russia, the only two countries where socialism has become complete, euthanasia was practised at the will and command of the State. People were removed as soon as they became useless. That process continues in certain parts of the world. </para>

                        <para>Some people in Australia still express grave doubts as to whether the Labour party really stands for socialism. I propose to address a few remarks to them. We all know what is the expressed objective of the Labour party. People who imagine that that expressed objective has nothing whatever to do with present-day practical politics should examine the decisions of some Labour conferences in recent years. In 1943, delegates carried a resolution urging the party to put in motion a campaign for vesting all power in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Two years later, the conference agreed to a motion urging the Commonwealth Parliamentary Labour party, when complete power had been vested in the Parliament of the Commonwealth, to give effect to the party's policy of socialism. There is one point which will he of particular interest to those people who seek some connexion between the policy of the Labour party and that of the Communist party, and the methods that they espouse. The motion to which the conference in 1945 agreed, originally included the significant words, " within the limits of the Constitution ". Clearly, that qualification made an important difference between the methods which the Labour party and the Communists respectively proposed to adopt for the establishment of socialism in Australia.

We should not pass lightly   over that point. Again, to those who  havsome  doubt about the real intentions of the Labour party, let me say - and I cannot say it too often - that every member of the Labour party must sign the well-known pledge of loyalty to the party's objective. But, there is a further pledge - at least I have seen it in the New South Wales section - and I shall quote it carefully </para>

                                <para>- I have dealt with that conference, and I am prepared to debate the matter at any time with the honorable member. I come now to the subject of communism. The Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duthie)</inline> and other honorable members opposite who have spoken in this debate made use of this argument - I admit that they mad« pretty good play with it - "Remove the seed bed of communism and you remove communism ". They said that the seed bed was the lack of economic security. I admit that their argument is, to some degree, just; but, as I have already said, those in this country who support communism are not poverty stricken. Furthermore, the Government claims that this if the most prosperous era that Australia has ever known. I put it to honorable members that the seed bed of communism is very different from what honorable members opposite say it is. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> at the conclusion of a speech he made on the subject of communism  - a speech which, unfortunately, he did not continue after he had exhausted his time - said that this thing seemed to be growing throughout the world and the world was seeking the answer. The answer, as I see it, is that we are losing faith in the democratic system, but faith in the democratic system is not sustained  merely by the provision of economic benefits and systems of security and pennons. After all, faith is not a thing that is bought, although it is true that we look to the fruits of any system. "We are losing faith in our own system. In Australia, particularly, we seem to be losing faith in parliaments and politicians. I am glad to be able to speak asa member of  a  parliament in this country and to refer to this loss of faith in politicians. There are very few people to-day outside the Parliament who do not believe that every man has his price, that he goes into parliament for what he can make out of it and that he frequently makes out of it much more than he has any legal, or moral, right to do. There is also loss of  faith  in our administrative services. Wherever you go to-day some one will tell you where to go to get something that is forbidden, whom to approach for a  permit  and what way you should go about the matter. There is whispering all  around  the place. In other words, people generally believe that opportunity now goes by favour and not by justice. There is something rotten in any community that shares that view, and I  believe  that this and every other Parliament in the Commonwealth shares respon- sibility for it. We are not free  from Teproach.  I believe that the standards of governmental integrity to-day are not what they used to be. Years ago, the mere hint of the prevalence of such asystem, or any real suspicion of such  a  thing, would have swept from office any government, regardless of itspolitical colour. That is not the position to-day. I remember very well that during my husband's term of office in this Parliament one member of his Government discovered that  a  company of which he was a director had entered into a contract with a government department. I believe - although on this point I am not completely sure - that it was merely  a  small day-to-day contract of practically no significance at all. </para>

                                <para>- Yes; but immediately he became aware of that fact, he resigned from the Government. May I say that had he not voluntarily resigned he would 'have been asked to resign. That was hard on that man, because he was not guilty of any impropriety.He did not know thathis company had tendered for the contract. But his action in resigning was completely right, because our system depends for its very existence upon the integrity of those who uphold it. Dictatorships have no such need ;they depend upon force whereas we depend upon our own interior integrity. Only a few days ago the case was brought up in the Parliament of the Government's participation in the formation of a company to control a radio station. Honorable members opposite viewed that matter lightly, and said that it should never have been brought up for discussion. Any one who is getting 16 per cent on an investment is making a very substantial profit judged by any standard; but when that is being done by a party which constantly shouts against the profit motive and the profit system such action must create in the public mind the very serious doubts as to the political integrity of the members of that party. That is a political matter, and we must look at it squarely. I  Temember  on a previous occasion in this chamber defending politicians against the charge that they broke promises because certain parts of the programme they enunciate at elections are not fulfilled during the life of the ensuing Parliament. That is something which is almost inescapable. If the members of a party which is successful at the polls are honest, they make an effort to put into operation the whole of the programme they enunciate  foT  the ensuing period. But sometimes circumstances do not permit of that being done. However, when a government deliberately says that it will not do a certain thing and then proceeds to dothat thing it is guilty of political dishonesty to a serious degree. That has happened in the lifetime of the present Government. I refer to the pledge it gave to the people that it would not nationalize anything during the war, and its attempt to nationalize air services during the war. I could refer to other incidents of a similar nature. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad that the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> has mentioned the referendum on rents and prices. That is another case in point; The campaign on that referendum was fought not on the basis that all price controls should immediately be swept away but on the basis that the price control powers which normally reside in the State governments and which are exercised by the Australian Government only in times of war and the periods which succeed them, should be retained by the State governments. Honorable members on this side of the chamber gave a pledge that they would support any legislation introduced by this Government which was designed to continue for a certain period the controls it was then exercising. Notwithstanding that, immediately the result of the vote on the referendum was made known, the Government said, " This means that the people do not want Commonwealth controls. Let us give them back to the States ". That was a completely dishonest decision. The Government, having argued that the assumption of the control of rents and prices by the State governments would create chaos, immediately transferred those powers of control to the States in an attempt to create the chaos that it professed to fear. That was the most wretched and miserable political conduct that can be imagined. The time will come when the Labour party will be faced with the realization that the public conscience sometimes awakens, even after long periods of sleep. There does not seem, </para>

                            <para>.- The speech of the honorable member for Darwin was a strange mixture. It was delivered with a great deal of passion and sincerity. The honorable member said that one characteristic of the public conscience is that of waking after long periods of sleep. It awoke in Tasmania a few weeks ago, when the people of that State' gave a decided answer to the vicious propaganda that was indulged in by the anti-Labour parties in the course of the recent Tasmanian elec tion campaign. The banking legislation that was passed by this Parliament last year, nationalization, communism, uniform taxation, the taking away of State rights and other issues were raised .by the Opposition parties. The people of Tasmania answered <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> G. Casey, who said that the election was fought on local issues only, in no uncertain terms. The anti-Labour parties threw everything at us but the kitchen sink. </para>

                                <para>- I agree that the campaign was a very clean one. When I said that the anti-Labour parties threw everything at us but the kitchen sink. I was referring to the kind of propaganda that was indulged in. National and local issues were put before the electors in the press and over the radio for weeks before the polling date. The Opposition said that the eyes of Australia were upon Tasmania and that the result of the election would indicate the general trend of Australian public opinion. They prophesied that the Cosgrove Government would suffer a crushing defeat When the result was announced, it was found that the Cosgrove Government had not been defeated but had lost only one seat. One had to examine the mainland newspapers very closely to find a- report, of the Tasmanian election result. Th? anti-Labour parties received a shock then from which they have not yet recovered Many honorable members opposite to-day are whistling to keep their courage up. </para>

                        <para>By their vote at that election the people of Tasmania also expressed their opinion of the propaganda that was poured out in the course of the campaign on the referendum on rents and prices, and showed that they realized who had "led them up the garden path" a few months previously. We left them in no doubt about who had urged them to vote " No '" on that occasion. The people decided that in future they would trust the . Cosgrove Government which urged them to vote " Yes ", and not those who told them to vote " No ". In my opinion, the honorable member for Darwin is mistaken when she argues that the vote of the people at that referendum was not a vote against the control of rents and prices that was then being exercised by this Government. The issue was confused by propaganda. The people were urged to uphold State rights and it was claimed that the State governments could administer prices control. The people believed that they were voting against all control of rents and prices by this Government. The anti-Labour parties are now trying to excuse what they said on that occasion and to blame this Government for the transference of prices control to the State governments. The newspaper headlines read, " No more Canberra control </para>
                        <para>The States can handle prices control effectively" and "Put it where you can watch it ". This Government gave effect to the people's decision, and it would have been dishonest not to do so. The people said in unmistakable terms that they wanted State control, and not Canberra control. The State governments have now assumed respon  sibility  for the control of rents and prices. "We claim that theycannot do so as fairly and as equitably as can the Australian Government. Time will tell who is right. The anti-Labour parties are now saying that this Government is to blame for the price increases that will occur. In my opinion, the Opposition will have to take 80 per cent of the blame for the whittling down of the value of the people's income because of the higher prices that will have to be paid for goods from now on. All the big business interests of Australia backed the Liberal party and the Australian Country party in their efforts to force this Government to relinquish control of the prices that could be charged for even essential articles. They wanted the sky to be the limit again, and in the referendum campaign they poured out thousands of pounds in order to achieve that objective. They won the day. We shall see who will be the sufferers.  I  contend that they will be the ordinary people. </para>
                        <para>The present budget is a cautious one. It is designed to ensure the internal stability of Australia for at least the next twelve months and to safeguard us against the threatening external financial storm.  It  has, in effect, lifted the burden of taxation from the lower and middle income groups, and considerably eased the burden on the higher income groups. The taxes paid by members of the lower income group will be reduced by 331/3 per cent. The tax payable on incomes of £15,000 a year will be reduced by 3.1 per cent. A 3 per cent reduction of taxation on an income of £15,000 a year means a reduction of approximately £5 a week. That is more than some people earn in a week, and represents a considerable reduction of tax. In the lower income groups, of course, the tax reductions are not so high in money value although in percentages they are greater. </para>
                        <para>The budget proposals mean, in effect, the complete exemption from both income tax and the social services contribution of many thousands more people. In view of the statements of the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr.Fadden) last night, it is well that the people of Australia should know just how the taxation remissions will operate. A single man or woman earning £400 a year from personal exertion paid £48 12s. tax last year, and will pay £34 14s. this year, a reduction of 28.6 per cent. A single taxpayer earning £1,000 a year receives a reduction of 19 per cent in his tax. A man with a dependent wife, earning £400 a year, will pay £21 9s. this year compared with £30 7s. last year, his reduction being 29.3 per cent. A similar taxpayer receiving £1,000 a year - and the people who are screaming most are those earning from £1,000 a year upwards - will have his tax reduced from £19318s. to £157, a reduction of 19 per cent. I am taking two or three illustrations from each income group. A married man with one child, earning £400 a year, will pay only £8 compared with £.12 7s. last year, or a reduction of 28.6 per cent. A man in the same category earning £1,000 a year will have his tax reduced from £1711s. to £13811s., or by 19 per cent. The reduction in respect of a man on £400 a year, with a wife and two children - the average Australian family unfortunately - is from £12 a year to £811s., or 28.8 per cent., and the corresponding reduction for a man earning £1,000 is from £159 13s. to £129 6s., or 19 per cent. These figures convincingly disprove some of the wild statements made last night by the Leader of the Australian Country party.I can only describe his speech as "'Fadden's flight of. fancy with figures ". </para>
                        <para>Another frequent criticism of the- Government's taxation policy is that overtime earnings are too heavily taxed. This * has been adjusted by the new rates, which, E believe, represent an adequate attempt to revise what in war-time was a very severe tax on all workers in industry. E should have welcomed the complete elimination of tax on overtime earnings but, having seen the figures of the latest, adjustments, I am sure that there is no real burden. Let us consider, for instance, the worker earning' £6 a week. If he is single' and works three hours overtime a. <inline font-style="italic">week,</inline> earning an aditional 13s. 6d., he pays 2s. Id. in tax, retaining 84.6 per cent of his overtime earnings. If he works six hours overtime, he receives an extra £1 7s., paying 4s. 3d. in tax and retaining the remaining 84.3 per cent. </para>

                        <para class="block">Those figures, which are official, illustrate the fantasy of the claim of the Leader of the Australian. Country party that Australian industry is being stifled by excessive taxation. Of course, honorable members opposite advance these arguments merely to further their own political cause. They must have something on which to attack the Government, so they attack it on the budget, making extrava-gant claims, about, taxation and endeavouring in that way to delude the people of this country into believing that it is a vicious budget. Actually it is nothing of the sort. As I have shown, it provides a substantial reduction of taxes on over- time" earnings.

Prior to the introduction of uniform taxation in 1942. eleven separate taxes on incomes were levied by the six States. Individual taxpayers  deriv-ing  income from more than one State were required to make separate income tax return* to each State from which income was derived if the income exceeded the taxable exemption allowed to absentees. Companies trading in more than one State were required to keep separate records of the profits earned in each. State for State income tax purposes. There was some reciprocity between States, but because of differences in State assessment acts, double taxation was common. </para>

                            <para>It is probably true to say that, those tu, payers who profess to favour the return .of State taxation rights do so in the mistaken belief that their liability to taxation would thereupon be. reduced.. It is most unlikely that  the Commonwealth Government would reduce its taxation by more than the minimum amount required by the States for their purposes. But, apart from the question of the severity of taxation actually imposed, uniform taxation possesses great advantages from the taxpayer's point of view. There is a considerable saving in clerical work when only one income tax return has to be prepared. In addition, the taxpayer is able to assess more accurately his liability for taxation. Its comparative simplicity is a strong argument in favour of the retention of uniform taxation. . . . There is a stronger community  if  interests and sense of nationhood through&gt;ut the Commonwealth than in Canada. . . . Australia is .a nation and not merely a temporary union of States. For those reasons, it is necessary that uniform taxation should be considered from the point of view of the Commonwealth an a whole and not merely from the point of view of " State rights ". </para>

                        <para>Income tax is an important instrument of economic policy. With the reduction of  Commonwealth  expenditure since the end of the war, the financial justification for the continuance of uniform taxation has been weakened.

Uniform taxation, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Binns's  close analysis of the subject, is justified when it is purely economic. In Tasmania there has been a hue and cry for the return of the State's taxing rights.

                            <para>It would be a very strong argument in principle for the abolition of uniform taxation if the States would thereupon be relieved of all financial dependence on the Commonwealth. This, however, would not be so, as can be seen from the financial position of Tasmania. Each year since 1912, that is, for thirty years prior to the introduction of uniform taxation, Tasmania has received a special grant from the Commonwealth under section 90 of the Constitution. If the Tasmanian Government were now imposing its own income tax it would have required to  raise  in 1947-48 approximately £1,050,000 in order to balance  the  budget, assuming no alteration  in  the special grant of £747,500 for that year, or £2,400,000 if there had been no special grant. To raise this revenue  would  have involved the imposition of State income taxation rates at least 10 per cent, and 60 per cent, respectively above those levied in 1941-42, the last year of State income taxation. Such heavy rates of State income taxation would obviously be impossible. </para>
                            <para>It should also be remembered that Tasmania in one respect stands to gain less than other States from the abolition of uniform taxation due to this State's lower  relative  taxable capacity. The average of personal incomes per head for 1940-47 was lower in Tasmania Ulan in other States, being only £144, compared with £108 for Australia as a whole. This lower level of incomes means that higher  rates of State income taxation would require to be imposed to realize the same revenue per head as in other States. </para>

                            <para>In other words, the Tasmanian Government would need to tax about 50 per cent, more severely on the average than the New South Wales Government to obtain the same revenue per bead of population. It follows, therefore, that uniform taxation has the advantage, do far as the smaller States are concerned, of  tending  to lessen their financial inequality. </para>

                        <para class="block">That is a considered statement, worked out after a long study of this difficult problem. There is no doubt that a single man earning £150 a year in Tasmania would be required to pay income tax under the dual system of taxation. To-day while the uniform system operates, a single man is not required to pay income tax until he earns £350 a year. To raise the amount of money required by the Tasmanian Government at the present time, a single man earning his income in that State would have to be taxed as soon as his earnings reached approximately £150 a year.

                        <para>A comparison of the incidence of taxation in Australia with that in other countries is interesting. In Australia a married man with two children who receives an income of £300 a year pays no taxes whatever. In New Zealand, a man in similar circumstances pays £22 10s. in taxes, and a man in similar circumstances in the United Kingdom pays £12 lis. in taxes. In Australia, a man with a similar family who  receives  £400 a year pays in taxes only £8 lis., whereas a taxpayer in similar circumstances in New Zealand pays £30, and an </para>

A married man with a wife and two children to support, who receives an income of £1,000 a year, pays £129 6s. in taxes in Australia. £172 16s. in New Zealand and £192 lis. in the United Kingdom. Those are facts, and I stress them in order to disprove th* fanciful story told by the Leader of the Australian Country party last night, when he claimed that taxes imposed on the people of this country were excessive. Since the war ended, the Government has reduced taxes by £110,820,000. In view of the criticism of the Government'* taxation policy made by honorable members opposite, it is of particular interest to read the report of a statement made in the Parliament by the honorable member for Wentworth, the present Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> on the 19th May, 1942, when the Income Tax (War-time Arrangements) Bill was being debated. As honorable members are aware, that is one of the measure* which implemented the uniform tax system. The report of the portion of hi* speech to which I refer appears at page 1730 of Volume 171 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and is as follows : - </para>

                                <para>- Honorable members opposite speak of war as if it were an inevitable catastrophe. Of course, they have a right to express that opinion, but honorable members on this side of the chamber also have a right to express their opinions. We had a global war only three years ago; is it not right that we should now seek to establish a global peace for the peoples of the world? Deliberately to stimulate fear of war is certainly not to perform a service for global peace. Furthermore, honorable members opposite think of war in terms of battalions and rifles and other weapons used in World War II. They overlook completely the fact that we are now living in a highly scientific age. Since World War II., eminent scientists have been constantly devising more potent forms of destruction and more deadly weapons, and that is a fact which no one can deny. I am amazed that honorable members opposite, who claim to possess such a complete knowledge of the technique of waging war, overlook so completely the menace to mankind of the latest developments of atomic warfare. When the Acting Leader of the Opposition spoke on the budget he devoted 22 minutes to discussion of Australia's defence. In that time he never once mentioned atomic warfare, the atomic bomb or the atomic age. </para>

                                <para>- One would imagine that the Acting Leader of the Opposition when speaking on such a vitally important matter as the defence of the country would not leave out of consideration the paramount importance of atomic warfare. Surely it has occurred to him that we are living in the atomic age! Is he aware that the United States of America is now manufacturing atomic bombs 600 times more potent than the one which was dropped on Hiroshima, and that methods of waging atomic warfare are being studied carefully in that country as well as in the United Kingdom and Russia ? Does he realize that guided missiles fitted with atomic warheads and projected in supersonic flight may do away altogether with the necessity for using aircraft? Does he know that 90 Super Fortresses could drop atomic bombs which would inflict damage so great that 79,000 bombers carrying bombs of the type used in World War II. would be needed to effect the same destruction? Does he appreciate that our guided missile or rocket range is intended to perfect the technique of atomic warfare, and that the guided missiles, with an accurate range of 3.000 miles, will be fitted with deadly atomic warheads? Surely the Acting Leader of the Opposition realizes that only one of the latest atomic bombs would be required to wipe out Sydney, and that six of them could wipe out the six capital cities of Australia. Six atomic bombs would kill in a flash approximately 4,000,000 people and destroy 80 per cent, of our war factories. One hundred atomic bombs could possibly immobilize Great Britain for 100 years. Surely members of the Opposition realize that germ warfare is also still a grave menace, despite the fact that it was not used in World War II. Yet, members of the Opposition continue to talk of war in terms of battalions and rifles. There will be only one more war for white civilization. That will be the third world war.. What chance has an army against germs? How can it fight germs? What chance has an army, even fully equipped, against an atomic bomb? Weapons are changing io rapidly that one which waa considered effective: a year ago may be regarded as ineffective now. The changes which have taken place in any three years in the twentieth century are equal to the changes brought about in any period of 30 years in the nineteenth century. This Government has realized the importance of this very potent feature of defence. It is impossible to say at this stage with what weapons the next war will be fought. The Government is encouraging the development of scientific planning and is conducting the most comprehensive investigations in its attempt to keep fully abreast of the latest developments in the application of science to warfare. I am not speaking as a warmonger. I am merely pointing out that, in their criticism of the Government's defence policy, the self-styled defence experts on the other side of the chamber completely overlooked the importance of atomic weapons, with which the next war will be fought. "Who would survive an atomic war? The white races have been slowly exterminating themselves during the last 50 years. If the next war is an atomic war - and who doubts that it will be - it may well reduce the white races to sheer impotency and wellnigh exterminate them. I have no doubt that the world will be an oriental coloured man's world after the next war. An American writer recently said - </para>

                                <para>- I have, been talking about the dangers of war. Millions of people in this country and in other countries who will not be consulted before the next war is forced upon them, will suffer most, from its devastating effects. Unfortunately, Gallup polls are not taken in order to obtain a cross-section of the view of the people as to whether or not war should be declared; they are restricted to matters of only minor concern such as the party most favoured to win the next election. We have been kept in the dark by Opposition members as to their real views on the subject of defence, about which they claim to have all knowledge. The awful effects of the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki have demonstrated, that a future war might very well sound th death-knell of white civilization. The coloured oriental races: would then have s glorious opportunity to take control &amp; world affairs. </para>

The speech, as a recognition of the facts in relation to the well-being of Australia, is an honest document, but it is essentially dishonest in the application of the principles that arise from the facts. For example, the Treasurer said in his concluding remarks - </para>

                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">That statement recognizes a principle about which there can be no dispute. Yet, all through the policy of the Government there runs the illusion that something can be had for nothing, that free medicine -;an be given out, that pensions and other social services can be increased and that new services can he provided without cost &gt;o the beneficiaries. They can be provided only if the production from which they oan alone be paid for is sustained. The budget does not provide the incentive for increased production, without which pensioners cannot hope tor real and permanent improvement of their conditions, and other sections of the community cannot expect the security, <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> provision of which is the policy of ill political parties in Australia. We realize that all people in the evening of their lives, and during their working lives, need security against want, unemployment, sickness and the other hazards involved in the complex life of to-day. There is a growing recognition by those with responsibility in this country, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and elsewhere, that the only real basis for security is work and production, and that there is no substi tute for them. Yet throughout the Labour party's propaganda there is an attempt to inspire in the minds of people the hope that they can get something for nothing merely by the passage of an art of Parliament. </para>
                        <para>Some fine speeches have been delivered in this debate. I refer, without desiring to discriminate, to two which struck a note that I also will endeavour to strike. They were the speeches of the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> and the honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons). The honorable member for Reid and I are on opposite sides of the committee, but he pointed out that, although wages had risen and people had more money in their pockets than ever before, they were less able to buy the necessaries of life and that, as far as real progress was concerned, they were farther back than they were before the last depression. Those are truths thai cannot be denied. He said that it now took two weeks' wages to buy a suit of clothes, whereas it took only one week's wages to do so in  1939.  He said that the thrifty public-spirited citizen who wanted to buy a house could have done so with his income for three years in  1939,  whereas it now required his income for six years. The same situation exists in relation to the time required to do certain things. If that is progress in the standard of living ana social security, it is intelligible to only members of the Labour party. It is certainly not intelligible to housewives who have to balance their budgets or to married ex-servicemen who want to build homes. </para>
                        <para>In a speech of more than twenty printed pages the Treasurer said not one word about the most important subject in the world to-day, which is the rising tide of communism. Ministers have said thai communism is not an issue. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman),</inline> in an interjection during the speech of the honorable member for Darwin, said thai communism did not really arise. Yet, in every country that values its democratic rights, the first consideration is the rise of communism and what can be done about it. We have in Australia a Government that can be charged with being, if not openly sympathetic with the Communists, at least their very good friends. One could not perhaps say that Ministers are " fellow travellers " of the Communists, but one can say that no administration of Australia that was not a directly elected Communist administration could be more helpful to the Communist party than is the present Government. Everything that the Communists want done is done. No effort is being made by the Commonwealth Investigation Service to stifle them or to prevent their inroads on the life of the community. Not one word has been said by the Prime Minister or any of his Ministers to discourage the growth of the insidious cancer of communism in the community. On the contrary, when the Communists want to acquire property and other assets they are able to get by the Capital Issues Advisory Committee and the Land Sales Control, whereas other citizens are placed at a disadvantage. Communists can get 'passports to travel abroad when other people have to wait. Not the slightest effort has been made by the Government to counter the attempts of the Communists to bring Australia under the domination of the Soviet. It is all very well for the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> to be parading in Paris declaiming on the rights of small nations, and pulling strings to get himself elected  President  of the United Nations General Assembly. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> may know something about the Earle Page scheme for stabilization of the wheat industry, but he obviously knows very little about foreign affairs. The election of the Minister for External Affairs as  president  of the United Nations General Assembly makes it more than ever necessary that Australia should lead world opinion in recognition of the need to take effective measures for defence if the United Nations is to be a power in the world, but one of the principal planks in the platform of the Australian Labour party is that there shall be no conscription and no compulsory military training. Yet the United States of America and Great Britain, with which we shall have to aline ourselves in the event  of  a third world war, have already instituted compulsory military training. In the United States of America, the scheme will come into operation almost immediately, and in Great Britain it is to be put into effect at the beginning of next year. Those two nations, with a realistic outlook on world politics, and with thineed to defend their territories, have embarked upon a system of compulsory military training, while honorable member* opposite talk about rockets and atomic bombs, and the development of scientific methods of warfare which will make it unnecessary to have large bodies  of  trained soldiers. According to them,  no  one will have to fight in the next war except the boys who take up the aeroplanes, and the scientists in charge  of  various devices. Is that what the Russians think? Is that why the Prime Minister told us, after his return from Berlin, that the Russians, in the event of war, could sweep across the Continent of Europe because they had 5,000,000 men under arms? Russia does not rely on scientific gadgets or atom bombs or rockets. Russia relies on man-power. Lord Montgomery has said that no matter what advances may be made in methods of scientific warfare, it will still remain true that there is need for the man with a rifle and bayonet to finish off the business. </para>

                        <para class="block">External Affairs can be very courageous in Dublin, or Paris or London, 13,000 miles away from home, but his courage runs out of his boots when he faces the bosses of the Seamen's Union or the Waterside Workers Federation, who imposed a ban on Dutch shipping and took the foreign policy of Australia out of his hands. Evidently, the Minister, so far as his foreign policy is concerned, is content to tag along behind  the  Communists. Quite recently, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burns,</inline> who is a member of the Central Council of the Communist party in Queensland, stated in reply to an interjection during a public debate, that in a war' against Russia the Communists in Australia would fight on the side of Russia. Such a statement does not really surprise any one, because we know that that is Communist policy all over the world. That is why, in Great Britain, Communists have been removed from positions where they had access to secret information. That is why, in the United States of America, Communists have been deprived of every opportunity to betray their country. Only in Australia are Communists tolerated in high places, and the person who is most tolerant of them is Australia's Minister for Defence. He appointed to a responsible position a person who had been sentenced in Perth to six months' imprisonment for treason during the war. That individual was a national guard with access to certain defence information, and he was caught trying to convey information to a Communist agency in Russia before Russia came into the war. After his release from gaol, the Minister for Defence appointed him to a position in the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, a statutory body under his control. That example indicates very clearly just what communism means to the men who are in charge of Australia to-day. I say that the Communists in this country have only one objective, to create and stir up discontent and mischief. They organized the campaign for shorter working hours and having been successful in obtaining a shorter working week and thereby, as a result, raised the cost of producing commodities and the cost of living, they have started a campaign against higher prices. First they promote the reason for the unrest, and they then stir up another section of the population to resist it. Their tactics are similar all over the world. Their aim is to prevent the democracies from re-arming, either economically or militarily. They are probably acting under instructions from Moscow. If they can slow down production in a war factory or in a business concern, whether it be in the United States of America, Canada. Australia, or Great Britain, their master? are happy. That is part of the technique Yet the Government says that they are not traitors, but merely people who subscribe to a certain kind of political philosophy. The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> who has a great deal of responsibility in connexion with industrial matters in Australia, said that they are almost Christlike in their ideas, and that they are carrying out Christ-like activities. He has been challenged on that before, and .1 shall not worry him further with it now. Neither shall I review his long record as the father and fountain-head of communism in Australia. He was the  chairman  of the 1921 conference of trade unions which set forth a manifesto urging, as a matter of trade union policy at that time, the abolition of the Parliament and the setting up in its place of a supreme economic council, modelled on that of Soviet Russia. That was 25 years ago, and the Minister may have learned much since then. While he may have changed his views there is not the slightest evidence that he has done so. </para>
                        <para>The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture interjects; he is the greatest Minister for Commerce and Agriculture that Victoria has ever produced! He is a gentleman who, having been defeated at every turn by the wheat-growers of Australia when trying to fasten upon them a stabilization scheme of his own concoction, and having been challenged in this House by members on this side, both as to the merits and the validity of the scheme, delved into the files which were left by myself and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page respectively, when we were Ministers for Commerce, and extracted an old plan which we placed before Cabinet in 1940. The Minister now claims that this is his new stabilization plan - the "Pollard wheat plan ". Every bit of that plan has been taken direct from the secret documents left on the files when we went out of office. All that the Minister did was to change the name, alter the price from the figure of, I think, 5s 2d. in 1940, to 6s. 3d. He then called it the great Australian wheat plan. I hand it to him with pleasure. If he had asked for it he could have had it. The fact that he claims credit for it does not matter, because the wheat-growers will recognize it as the old plan which was evolved by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page. It looked familiar to the Victorians, who thought that they had seen it around, but could not place it for a while. As soon as it was exposed to the full light of day I recognized it. </para>
                        <para>I am very glad that we have been able to help the Minister to do so much for the wheat industry. But what about doing something now for the dairying industry? We on this side of the committee could offer him a few suggestions. He may not be receptive, but nevertheless if he is in office long enough the dairying industry might easily be dealt with like the wheat industry. As the Minister considers everything for up to six or twelve months, exhausts all his own resources, and finally adopts somebody else's ideas, I shall suggest one or two courses that he could take. I am glad that the Minister is present in the chamber. The dairying industry is on the down-grade despite everything that the Prime Minister has said. If the Minister wants facts and figures I can supply them. I do not know whether he is a practical farmer, but if he has had any experience in farming, he should recognize that the quantity of butter and milk produced in Australia is governed, to a substantial degree, by the number of cows that are milked. The quality of the stock and type of feed are factors which affect production, but by and large the amount of production which we can expect is governed by the size of the herds. I shall quote figures published in the Commonwealth Statistician's quarterly statement, <inline font-style="italic">Summaryof Dairy Industry in Australia,</inline> for the year ended December, 1947, relating to the number of dairy cattle.In 1943 there were 5.000.000 dairy cattle in Australia. There was a decrease in 1944 to 4,900,000, while in 1945 the number fell still further to 4,800,000. In 1946 there was yet another fall to 4,600,000, while in 1947 the figure dropped to 4,590,000. Honorable members will see that since 1943 there has been a decrease of approximately 100,000 each year in the number of dairy cattle in Australia. </para>

One of the most serious aspects of that decrease is that the number of heifers under the age of one year, which are the potential dairy cows of the next year or so, fell last year by more than 60,000 to a total of approximately 864,000. </para>

                                <para>- I remind the Minister that this is not a laughing matter for the people of Great Britain are down to the minimum of butter requirements. They are receiving the smallest ration of butter in their history. and their only hope of increasing the quantity substantially rests in greater imports, not from the United States of America, Canada, Holland and Denmark, but from Australia and New Zealand. That this fact is recognized is borne out by the report of the recent decision to increase to approximately 2s. 7d. the price which the United Kingdom will pay to the Australian Government for our butter. As statements in the House of Commons and announcements by  the  British Ministry of Food indicate, the United Kingdom Government reached this decision in the hope and belief that the higher price will encourage Australian diary-farmers to step up production. That hope will be realized if the amount of the increase is paid to dairy farmers. Unfortunately, the Australian Government, which boasts of its decision to make a gift of £10,000,000 to the United Kingdom this year, and which is extracting an additional 5d. per lb. for butter from the British people, is withholding the increase from dairy farmers who are entitled to it, and has  announced that it will distribute the money four, five, six or seven years hence, mould the price of butter fall. That is why the people of Great Britain will receive very little additional butter. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture appointed a special committee to investigate the cost of production in the dairying industry. </para>

                                <para>- 'That is so. The members of the committee were most efficient and I offer no criticism of them. They all had experiece of the dairying industry, and were well qualified to make a report on the cost of production. Tie Minister did not accept their report. After they had recommended the payment of a certain price, he arbitrarily reduced the amount, and producers will receive approximately £4,500,000 per annum less than the figure which, the committee considered, represented a payable price. The price which the Minister decided to pay is barely sufficient to enable some dairy farmers to continue. Indeed, the majority of dairy-farmers in New South Wales and Queensland cannot hope to step up production. As the result of the Minister repudiating the report of the committee, Australian dairy-farmers and the people of the United Kingdom have been let down. I admit that the output of certain dairy products such as condensed milk, whole milk and processed milk has been increased, but dairy-farmers are receiving a return which will not enable them to incur the expenditure that is required to enable them to step up production. They need more money with which to buy fertilizers, improve their stock and subdivide their paddocks. According to the experts, those three factors are essential to increased production. But the pricewhich the Government is now paying is sufficient to enable only a very prudent dairy-farmer to buy the necessaries of life. </para>

They were obliged to sign the pledge. Their masters said that they had to do so. One of the objectives of the Labour party is the socialization of industry, production, distribution and exchange. </para>

                                <para>- Another objective of the Australian Labour party is the abolition of the Senate. Perhaps honorable members opposite can reconcile that with legislation recently introduced by the Government to increase the number of senators from 36 to 60. It was expedient for the Labour party to depart from its objective because it believed that by increasing the number of senators il would be able to retain control of the Senate for the next six years. The federal platform and objective of the Australian Labour party is something that is here to-day and gone to-morrow. The only steady light shining through it is the intention to socialize industry, production, distribution and exchange. Honorable members opposite never deviate from that principle. They are prepared to appeal to the Privy Council rather than to accept the decision of the High Court if they can thereby socialize the means of exchange. They will do anything to remain in office. As long as what is done is expedient, it does not matter to them whether or not it is in their platform. Moral values mean nothing to them. </para>

It was not announced in the Parliament at all. Another plank of the federal platform of the Australian Labour party is the nationalization of wireless transmission, including broadcasting. We can understand why frequency modulation has not got much of a chance in Australia.

The document sets out the Labour party's objectives and thereby reveals the inconsistencies of honorable members opposite. It shows that they are prepared to skip a principle here in order to gain an advantage there. It tells all those who are prepared to study it that the ultimate objective of the Australian Labour party is the conscription qf people under socialization as a pathway to communism. </para>

                            <para>.- lt is inevitable that any government which assumes office will be attacked b&gt; the Opposition. We are quite used to that. Nevertheless the people of Australia must be somewhat tired of the petty bickerings in this chamber which anbroadcast to the nation. Nothing seems to be worthy of attention to-day except the delinquencies of a small group of people in Australia. During the war there was a concerted effort to put the country on a satisfactory basis as far as war production was concerned. Is there to be no concerted effort with regard to peace production? Why is it considered necessary to have order and good government in time of war and apparently not considered necessary to have order and good government, or even respect for one another, in time of peace? I may nol be completely satisfied with everything in the budget that was presented by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> but I realize that Australia is in a more fortunate position at the present time that any other country in the world. This must be due either to good luck or to good management. If there had been glaring mismanagement, the country would nol be so comfortable or prosperous as it is. To be logical, therefore, one must give credit where credit is due and congratulate the Government upon those things that have been well done. In my opinion, those things are neither few nor negligible. Having done that, I feel myself free to offer suggestions and criticism. </para>

                        <para>I recently drew attention to the possible danger to some workers by the expiration of the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act on the 31st December of this year. We are now advised that Cabinet has decided to recommend that this legislation shall be extended for a further twelve months. I am aware that by raising the question before the act has expired it might have appeared to some honorable members that the outcry was rather like that which was raised by the White Queen, in the famous story of Alice, before she pricked her finger on the pin that held her shawl. It will be remembered that the White Queen said, " It is a poor sort of memory that onlyworks backwards". We know from experience that some workers have suffered because of the lack of definition of their positions as far as wages or salaries are  concerned. I think that it is necessary for the members of the Government to train their memories to work both backwards and forwards. Quite a number of pinpricks have been brought to my notice, but I do not intend to deal with them at his stage. </para>
                        <para>I propose now to refer to some of the. paragraphs in the Treasurer's  budgetspeech  dealing with social services. Before the Parliament assembled some newspapers stated on a number of occasions hat the means test was to be eased. I lad on several occasions previously asked for its abolition. The easing of the means test now proposed is, to my mind,  most  disappointing. It is claimed that -.he complete abolition of the means test  would  cost the Australian Government *n additional £54,000,000 annually. What of that? With the introduction of  almost  every progressive measure some »ne has claimed that the country would 1Ot be able to afford its application. Despite such claims the Australian people lave gained the maternity allowance,  child  endowment, widows' pensions and hospital and other benefits. Shall we say, it any stage, " This is where we must  draw  the line. We cannot make further progress ". The <inline font-style="italic">Coburg Citizen,</inline> which is an Australian Labour party  publication,  wrongly assumed that I had failed ;o ask in this House for the implementation of the Labour party's policy of abolition of the means test. That newspaper  drew  attention to the indignity of the  means  test, and went on to say - </para>

                        <para class="block">Tn reply to that article, I ask, where are those Labour representatives mentioned by the newspaper, who wish to eradicate this blot? It appears to me that, entirely alone, I conduct a campaign on this matter, despite this propaganda which is issued in my electorate by the Australian Labour party press which wishes to create feeling against me. It is claimed by many that age pensioners are living is almost luxurious circumstances. They may occupy their own homes and posses* property to a value of £750.. A husband and wife, who are age pensioners, receive £2 2s. a week each. They may also earn 30s. a week each and thus have between then an income of £7 4s. a week. Thai is described by some people as a luxury The newspapers, have made that point quite clear. It is conveniently forgotten that possibly 80 per cent, of the age pensioners are physically unable to earn any money and would not be able to find suitable employment. No one wants the old and infirm except to do the  unpleasant  and dirty work which other members of the community, avoid. There are not many age pensioners who have the comfort of their own homes. The position in Victoria is so bad that the  varioumunicipalities  have been asked by the State to supply facts and figures showing the requirements of homes and rooms and the age of individuals residing in  various  districts, so that steps can be taken to cater for them. The housing problem is worse to-day than it ever was, despite any statements to the contrary. We are told that in Victoria houses are being erected at the rate of 12,000 a year, tha' is only 1,000 a year behind the 1923 rate At the same time the marriages figure if some thousands ahead of that figure. 1 shall not go over that ground again as 7 have spoken of it before. </para>
                        <para>An increase of 5s. a week is to be mad» in the allowance paid to trainees  under  the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme. The increase is long overdue and is not yet sufficient. Among university students who come under this scheme are married men with families. A trainee with a wife and children has been receiving £5 10s. weekly, plus a small sum foi fares, which is by no means enough when one considers that because of the housing shortage many of them have to live fas from the city and pay increased fares. Such a trainee will now receive £5 15s. 8 week. Trainees at present receive an allowance with which to purchase book* and instruments. I wish to draw the attention of the Committee to the plight of medical students in particular. For the last three years of their medical course those students work in hospitals and ar*  required  to wear suitable clothing. They must wear white coats,, and require a  supply  of four or five, two or three of which would require laundering each week. At one hospital which students attend during the final years of their course, they must dress entirely in white. That means that out of their small income they must provide white duck trousers,  white  shoes, white socks and. white ties in addition to white coats. Added to the expense of providing these items of clothing is the cost of having them laundered.. All honorable members know how far  short  £5 15s. a week must be in the meeting of such costs. When I referred to this situation on a previous occasion the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline> suggested that those individuals were being treated very generously by the Government and should be grateful. I agree that there is a very striking difference between the manner in which ex-servicemen from the last war are being helped to-day compared with the scheme in operas &lt;ion after World War I. </para>

It' must be remembered that  ex-servicemen  are being trained because- thecountry requires their services in the various phases of industry. For that reason their training must be adequate and they should not be constantly reminded that gratitude is either necessary or expected. Although they may be grateful for the- training they receive, let us not claim that they are receiving a living allowance, during their years of training; which permits- either themselves or their families to live in security. The facts are that in most, cases wives of such trainees must engage in employment to augment the family income. To do so they must make whatever arrangements they can to have their children looked after.. I do not consider that a. satisfactory position. </para>

Nc longer is the wife of a British  subjecable  to claim the protection of British nationality which she is supposed te acquire on marriage. We have not the wisdom of the ancients in the matter omaking friends with those. whom we  have  conquered. The generals of  Alexander  and other famous leaders of past age* were not only expected to  fraternize  with conquered people but were also directed to encourage marriage with their conquered enemies, so that  ultimately  friendship would grow between victor and the vanquished. So completely have we abandoned Christian teaching that to-day we speak of om former enemies "polluting the country'and we refuse them permission to conn to our shores. A number of people ii.

If the- Australians do nol make clear to the Japanese the kind of work on which they are engaged, the Japanese children will not come neat them. If foreigners in Japan aTe known to be Australians or Americans the Japanese children are terrified of them. They are feared as soldiers and foreigners. The people of one country may develop hatreds which go just as deep at those of another. It is for the people' f the world to come together in an attempt to overcome these hatreds. Unless they are prepared to do so, there is  no  prospect of peace in the world. It is not for me to suggest here how such collaboration can be brought about ; but surely if it is seriously attempted it can be achieved. The common people all over the world  desire  peace. Both the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> and Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chambers)</inline> have spoken along the same lines. Their words were, I thought, at times, almost inspired, and we must all come around to this way of viewing the problem of world peace.

                        <para>Ex-servicemen as well as aged people have taken a very live interest in the subject of home construction. First priority  should  be accorded to all homeconstruction projects. I am unable to understand how the Government can reconcile its appeals to the people to work for peace with its decision to accord first priority for scarce building materials to the guided weapons range at Woomera. If the Government is sincere in asking the people to talk and work for. peace, it should take this elementary step to bring about the security of the people by providing them with much-needed homes. The Government must think in terms of housing for the people. Although migrants coming to Australia are supposed to have accommodation provided for them, we hear every day of migrants who, after having resided in the accommodation provided for them for two or three weeks, have been able to secure homes of their own. In some instances to which my attention has been drawn wealthy migrants from overseas have been in the market for homes a few days after their arrival in this country. I do not know what can be done to prevent that sort of thing from occurring. If the Government is aware that this is going on it should be able to take some action to protect our own people from the competition of migrants bringing money from overseas^ I shall reserve my further comments until the Estimates are under consideration. </para>

                            <para>.. - During the debate on the budget much comment has been made on the Government's defence proposals. Running through the minds of Government supporters there seems to be the thought that peace is the paramount  considera-#  tion. While we all desire peace, honorable members opposite appear to hold theextreme view, so popular before the outbreak of World War II., when the call was for " peace in our time ", that we should seek to preserve peace at any price. The Government might well heed thechange of attitude of the Government of the United Kingdom, which, after having considerably reduced the forces in the last few years, has decided to increase them and build up armaments, specifically aircraft and tanks. This Government makes great play of its defence expenditure. It intends to expend £250,000,000 in a five-year programme on defence, of which £75,000,000 will be expended on the Navy, £62,500,000 on the Army and £62,500,000 on the Air Force. We had a hint from the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> that the amount might be increased, but it has not been increased. It is an odious comparison to talk about the money expended on defence before the war and now, because, although Ave  are spending a lot of money on the armed services, we have little or nothing to show for it.

                            <para>Satisfactory progress has been made in the development of the Royal Australian Air Force on its approved post-war basis. All units have their full complements of aircraft and the Royal Australian Air Force will be developed and operated in 1 948-49 in accordance with the planned increase of that force. </para>

                        <para>I have endeavoured, from time to time, to obtain from the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> information as to the strength of our squadrons and the numbers of aircraft involved. My private information leads me to believe that the squadrons are not up to complement or anything like it. Reverting to the five year programme under which £75,000,000 is to be expended on the Navy, £62,500,000 on the Army and £62,500,000 on the Air Force, I most strongly believe that the greatest amount of money should be expended on the Air Force because air superiority is of fundamental importance to defence. That was clearly demonstrated in World War II. by the sinking of <inline font-style="italic">Prince of Wales</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Repulse</inline> by the Japanese because they bad air superiority at the time and because the vessels went into action without air cover. It was also revealed in the great change that took place in the Middle East when we gained air superiority and in the invasion of Europe, which could not have been accomplished without the overwhelming air superiority possessed by the Allies at that time. My specific reasons for saying that we need a larger air force than any other armed force are that we have a tremendous coastline, which necessitates a highly mobile force, and that we can only achieve quick concentration on a section of our coast by means of an air force. There seems to be some misconception that we shall have a breathing space in the event of another war. In World War I., we had a considerable breathing space and, in World War II., we had a breathing space of about eighteen months. But it required two years to get the Royal Australian Air Force under way. If we imagine we shall again have anything like that breathing space to develop our forces we are working on entirely false premises. When the Permanent Air Force, which the Government has set up, is at full strength, it will consist of 1,930 men. The Citizen Air Force will consist of 190 men. Those figures should be noted. Never was there so grossly inadequate a citizen air force than one consisting of only 190 men. Our air defence is split into two components, a home defence force and a task force. The home defence force will consist of 54 aircraft and 1,182 men. There will be four fighter squadrons of eight aircraft each, one bomber squadron of eight aircraft, one target-towing squadron of nine aircraft and one air-sea rescue squadron of six aircraft. The task force will consist of 90 aircraft and 2,061 men. There will be two fighter squadrons of sixteen aircraft each, three bomber squadrons of eight aircraft each, one technical  reconniassance  squadron of eight aircraft, two transport squadrons of eight aircraft each and one survey squadron of eight aircraft. </para>
                        <para class="block">The total strength will be 144 aircraft and 3,243 men. We are to have 439 reserve aircraft, about which I propose to say something later, and 69S training aircraft. What really mattersis our immediate defence in the even of aggression, and the total of available combat aircraft, that is those that can be used for directly repelling the enemy, will be only 86. The numbers could be increased to 111 if the air-sea rescue and reconnaissance squadrons were included. Using the usual 75 per cent, serviceability rate, which is  applied  in the Royal Air Force, I  point  out that this means that our from line strength would be S4 aircraft. That, to say the very least of it, is a pathetic state of affairs in this year of grace, 1948. What we could hope to achieve with 84 aircraft passes my comprehension. I propose to make some suggestions that I believe the Government might well accept. There is no wellthoughtout system of developing potential operational bases in north and northwest Australia and the northern islands. Those bases are vitally necessary for strategic purposes. The best way to meet attack is to get as near to it as possible. We have no well-thought-out plans for a highly mobile force capable of concentration at short notice. Another lack from the point of view of civil aviation as well as military aviation is an  efficient  radar system. We have for years, during the war particularly, lagged far behind the Royal Air Force in the development of radar. I recall vividly that when <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> returned from England during the war the only type of radar, and, in many instances wireless equipment in use in Australia was either obsolete or obsolescent in the Royal Air Force. Here is a task which if the Government had any real interest in defence it would tackle immediately and energetically. The greatest need in the event of war would be a reserve which could be called up and put into action quickly. I wish to quote from a statement given to me by the Minister for Air, which lays down the conditions of service for the Citizen Air Force Reserve. Here it is stated that ex-members of the Royal Australian Air Force will be invited to give an undertaking that, in an emergency, they will rejoin the service, and the statement continues, " There will be no training liability". That is most significant. I jay quite bluntly that it will be an utter waste of time to put men on the reserve if they are to be given no training. I am myself an ex-member of the Royal Australian Air Force, and I served in the last war. I have been out of the Air Force for three years, and I am so unfamiliar with modern equipment and development that if I were to rejoin I should be of no use whatever for a considerable time as a navigator or whathaveyou. Unless men are kept up to date by lectures and refresher courses, and given an opportunity to practise flying in aero clubs, it will be merely a waste of time and money to put them on the reserve. However, the most dangerous feature of the Government's policy is that no provision is made for the rapid expansion of the Air Force. We have an available front line token air force of 84 aircraft, with trained crews, but there will be no -efficient reserves upon which to draw. </para>
                        <para>There is much dissatisfaction in the Royal Australian Air Force because of the lack of opportunities for promotion, and many young men, who served in the Royal Australian Air Force in the last war, have since left the service for this reason. Nothing is more calculated to kill a man's ambition than lack of opportunity for promotion. At the present time, membership of the Royal Australian Air Force consists almost entirely of flight lieutenants, and there seems no prospect of their getting any further. That is one reason why the Royal Australian Air Force is not what it ought to be. Another cause for dissatisfaction is that so little flying is done. Some of my friends in the service have not flown for months.  According to official figures, the Royal Australian Air Force has 439 reserve aircraft and 698 training aircraft, but all of them are out of date. They are obsolete, and are, in actual fact, rotting, as can be seen by any one who visits the Royal Australian Air Force stations at Wagga and Laverton. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.] I</inline> quote  the following, from an article written by Air Chief Marshal <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Slessor, anr!

                            <para>Here, for instance, is  Bayerlein,  the com mander of the Panzer  Lehr  Division, describing his experiences on D day : " At two o'clock in the morning of  6th  June, I was alerted.

                        <para>Finally, I wish to state that, in my opinion, the Air Force is the only service arm capable of making any sort of reply to an atomic bomb- attack, whether the bombs, be delivered, by guided, rocketpropelled missiles,, or by ordinary aircraft.

                        <para>Recently; in1 the field of civil aviation^ there was a serious accident involving lossof life when the liner <inline font-style="italic">Lutana</inline> crashed. Once- again, I suggest that the Minister for Air might, consider- the- introduction of radar equipment as a: means of ensuring the safety of civil aircraft. The type [ recommend is that known under the code name of "Loran". I have- heard it. objected such a service would, cost a lot of money, and that it would be necessary to maintain a considerable staff to keep it in. operation for. 24 hours a day. I believe, however, that when, we begin counting' the cost in money as against the cost in lives it will be a bad lookout for civil aviation. It is very likely that, even, bad there been available a radar service of the " Gee " type, such an accident a3that which befell the <inline font-style="italic">Lutana,</inline> could not have occurred, because the pilot would at all times have known exactly where he was. At the present time, that is not always,  necessarily  so. I suggest that the cost: of installing radar- equipment might be borne equally by the Department of Civil Aviation and the Royal Australian. Air Force because- it would serve both civil and Royal Australian Air Force aircraft. This safety device is urgently needed. Civil aviation in Australia has a fine record,, and accidents, have- been, comparatively few, but whenever an opportunity arises to improve safety measures, we should take advantage of it. </para>

                                <para>4, 5 and 0. The amount of repairs and maintenance, work carried out for many year* to postal buildings- has been inadequate, and many departmental buildings are in urgent need of alteration. During the war works of this nature could not be carried on and since the war ended there have been serious shortages of labour and materials. In view of the difficulties being encountered, an approach has already been made to the Department of Works and Housing, which has shown the Post Office the utmost co-operation. An agreement has been reached whereby the Postal Department is authorized to carry out, without reference to the Department of Works and Housing, any work of a minor character costing up to £25. r.t has also been agreed that the resources of the Postal Department may be used to arrange, with the approval of an officer of the Department of Works and Housing in each individual ase, for the execution of urgent building works of a minor character estimated to cost between £25 and £300. The necessary arrangements are now being made by the Postal Department to implement this agreement,  which  will be reviewed by both departments  concerned  after a period of twelve months, with the object of smoothing out any dimculties brought to light by actual experience, f feci sure that, consistent with the demand  hi  the nation's building resources for other essential works, the procedure now agreed upon will enable Post Office maintenance jobs to he expedited. [ direct particular attention to the words "'utmost co-operation" in the latter portion of the Postmaster-General's reply. During the last few years, the Postmaster-General's Department has found that its efforts to provide necessary facilities in the country districts of Tasmania and generally throughout the other States have been seriously retarded by the Department of Works and Housing. Although the last-named department agreed to permit the Postmaster-General's Department to undertake minor works costing between £25 and £300, I have yet to learn of one instance where its approval has been given. A " rider " clause at the end of the Department of Works and Housing (Functions) Order, published in <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth</inline><inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> No. 149, dated the 2nd August, 1945, states that the permission should be given at the discretion of the Department of Works and Housing. Many small post offices throughout the country districts made requests two or three years ago for certain minor jobs to be done. The Postmaster-General's Department employs artisans who can carry out the works, but the Department of Works and Housing has evidently decided to make itself responsible for them. To late, it has not done the jobs. Its  attir11 de  hp.«  been greatly  prejudicial to Tas- mania. Unless those minor works are carried out within a specified number of years, no benefits will accrue to the State from the rehabilitation programme formulated by the Postmaster-General's Department. I hope that the Minister representing the Postmaster-General will inform his colleague of the position. The Postmaster-General should protect <inline font-style="italic">hisdepartment</inline> against this unnecessary hamstringing by the Department of Work, and Housing. </para>

                        <para>I am vitally interested in war pensions. Although the budget provides for an&gt; increase of 5s. a week, war pensions are completely out of balance with other pensions. In 1920, the invalid and old age pension was 27s. 6d. a week less than the maximum war pension. By 1942, the invalid and old-age pension was only 12s. 6d. a week less than the maximum, war pension. Since 1920, the invalid and old-age pension has been increased on eleven occasions, the total amount of theincrease being 22s. 6d., but, in the sameperiod, the war pension has been increased only once, ' and, on that occasion, the amount was 8s. a week. Whilst I do not in any way deprecate. the increase of theinvalid and old-age pension, I believe that scant a'ttention has been paid to war pensions. The proposed increase of 5s. a week is grossly inadequate. Some cognizance should be taken of the basis or* which the war pension is computed.  As  far as I can gather, there appears to be no real basis upon which it is calculated. The war pension should be based on the cost of living, the value of the £1, or the basic wage. No real attempt has been, made to increase war pensions commensurate with the increase of invalid and age pensions since 1920. One of my friends, who is a member of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial: League of Australia, remarked, " With all this talk of pensions for defeated politicians, it would be better to get the political bullet rather than the sniper's bullet.. which means that for the rest of your life you try to exist on the meagre war pension which is paid now ". </para>
                        <para>I shall devote much more time to the discussion of the Estimates than I have to the budget itself, and at appropriate times, I shall refer to a number of subjects. However, I strongly support the -amendment submitted by the Acting Leader of the Opposition. </para>

                            <para>.- I have no intention of attempting to dissect the budget so capably presented by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> or of engaging in a dissertation on the creation of new States, although I believe that they will inevitably be required. Nor do I propose to advocate constitutional reform, although I consider that the Constitution must be altered so as to give the Parliament of the Commonwealth complete authority in all matters. I shall not -engage in a dissertation on socialization, although the subject is so attractive that [ am greatly tempted to devote some time to it. However, I desire to address myself specifically to communism, which deserves special attention. The Australian Labour party is uncompromisingly opposed to communism, and has shown its opposition in a number of ways. Both the Federal and State branches of the Australian Labour party, which are the bodies that govern the organization, have also expressed their opposition to communism. Various speakers in this chamber, notably the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> and the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> have made attacks on communism, and I largely agree with their statements. The Labour party is composed principally of unionists. Unionists may or may not be Communists. I see no way, short of the exclusion of Communists from membership of trade unions, to ensure that unionists are not Communists. If unionists are not Communists, the reasons for the exclusion of Communists from membership of trade unions should be reasons stated by the Labour party. I lo not think that Communists should be allowed to exercise any influence over the Labour party. They do so at present. The Labour party must prove that it is not Communist. The Labour party must prove that unionists have no association with communism. That may mean that the Labour party will be split into at least two sections. That would be regrettable, but it may be unavoidable Communism is said to be irreligious. We are very proud of the fact that there is no religious test under the Constitution. Therefore, under the Constitution com munism, though in other respects undesirable, is not forbidden. Yet the Labour movement must rid itself of communism. It must actually prove that Communist? are not eligible for admission to the Labour party, even though in the opinion of the Labour party they are not eligible at present. </para>

                                <para>- I have a strong idea that Communists are not in the Labour party for the reason that they are not permitted to be in it. They are rightly excluded. They cannot be excluded for a reason which is incidental to communism, which is that Communist* are regarded as irreligious, not believing in Christianity. As there is no religious test under the Constitution, they should not be excluded on that ground. However, I think that they are rightly excluded from the Labour party on other grounds. I do not intend to say tha' members of the Australian Labour part: may not be socialists, because the honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) proved that the Labour part? has a socialist objective.

                            <para>. - I do not propose to attempt to  dissect  the budget. I shall merely refer to some of its salient features in an endeavour to illustrate how hypocritical and false it is. and how the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has attempted to mislead the people. Before I do so, I propose to relate to the committee two incidents that occurred in the City of Sydney, the largest city in Australia, last Saturday and Monday. On Saturday morning I endeavoured to buy a small celluloid medallion with the flag of my country on it, but 1 found it impossible to do so. Last Monday, again in Sydney, I attempted to buy the national flagof my country. I wanted only a small one, measuring approximately 6 inches by 6 inches, but [ did not succeed. I inquired in many shops there, including some of the largest multiple stores, but I could not buy a blue ensign, which is the national flag of Australia. I believe that the reason why it is impossible <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> buy our national flag is that there is no demand for it in Australia to-day. The Government has brought the people of Australia to such a sorry pass that they are rapidly losing their national spirit. I eventually bought this flag which I now hold in my hand. I propose to describe to the committee some of its features in case -honorable members, like the public of Australia, have largely forgotten what it looks like. In one corner it has the Union Jack, which is the flag of our Motherland. Beneath it, there is a seven-pointed star, representing the six States of the Commonwealth and the mandated territories. In another corner there is the Southern Cross - the great constellation of the southern hemisphere. The Government would have no difficulty in combating communism in Australia if it assured the people that that symbol, the Southern Cross, will not be removed and replaced by the great constellation of the northern hemisphere, the Great Bear. That is a constellation which some people are desirous to see shining, not only in the heavens, but also over the whole earth. The Prime Minister of Australia and his Government should assure the people of Australia that it does riot intend to permit the great Russian bear to put his dirty paws on this flag, or to remove from it the constellation of the Southern Cross and replace it with the constellation of the Great Bear. What the people of Australia want to know to-day is that they have a government which loves and stands by the flag of our nation. The Government has betrayed the flag. It should . give the assurance that the people seek and so restore their confidence that they really have an Australian Government and not a government prompted by communism, and largely subservient to the will of the Soviet. In the circumstances I have outlined I ask for leave to have a replica of the flag of my native country incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> There is no technical difficulty involved,and I consider that anybody who denies the right of the Australian people to see their national flag in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> brands himself as a sympathizer of the Communists. </para>

                        <para class="block">Let honorable members examine those two  statements.  In the first statement the Prime Minister says it is our duty to step up our exports, and in the second he says that we should send our goods to dollar markets, to win dollars, or to the sterling market to save sterling countries from having to buy goods which are produced  only  in the dollar area. In either case the effect is the same. I shall quote specific instances to illustrate that the Government, and particularly the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard),</inline> have betrayed the sentiments expressed in the budget speech by the Prime Minister by having refused to permit exports to go out of this country to win dollars or to assist starving people. [ particularly refer to an action which the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture took in October and November, 1947, with regard to the maize-growers of the New England Tableland. On the 14th November, 1947, in reply to a request from the Northern New South Wales Farmers Union, he sent a telegram, signed "R. T. Pollard", in which he stated that the Government was not prepared to issue an export licence for maize from the northern tableland, as there was an ample market available within Australia. He did not say that the price in Australia was about £14 a ton. Yet he and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bulcock,</inline> the Director-General of Agriculture, for Aus1tralia, and the former Minister for Agriculture of Queensland, had put their beads together and issued to the Queensland maize-growers export licences for 3,000 tons of maize when the export price for maize was about £33 a ton. The Minister, I repeat, refused to issue export licences to New South Wales maizegrowers. Those growers naturally protested and after further correspondence <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bulcock</inline> told the general  president  of the Farmers Union that he would recommend the issue of licences for the export of 1,000 tons this year. I understand that the quota allocated to the Tumut grower* could not be filled by them. </para>

The New England Tableland growers were prevented from sending their maize overseas. I saw at Guyra a telegram offering £2S a ton for maize f.o.b. ship Darling Harbour for export to Japan which would be paid for in irrevocable  credits in American dollars. This Government refused a licence for that maize to be exported to Japan. I might add that the Minister committed a breach of the Australian Constitution. He had simply acted in defiance of it. When the Farmers Union protested to me, ] wrote to it pointing out that the Minister had broken section 99 of the Constitution which states that the Commonwealth shall not by any law or regulation give preference to one State or any part thereof over any other State or any part thereof. I suggested to the union that it should take legal action, and I regret, that il was not wealthy enough to do so, or go to the Privy Council as this Government has done in another instance. I suggested also that it might consider issuing a writ of mandamus against the Minister and the Government to compel them to issue the export licences required. Another suggestion I made was that the union should sue the Commonwealth for damages on the grounds of breach of section 99 of the Constitution for having given preference to one State or part of a State and also sue the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bulcock</inline> personally. I regret that the union was unable to take such action, but I hope, if in the future I ever have an opportunity to catch the Minister committing so flagrant a breach of the Constitution as he did on that occasion, that I shall be able to take the necessary action to make him respect the rights of private ownership and property, and make him respect the Australian Constitution. </para>

To increase exports of primary products from this country it is necessary to import more and more tractors.

Do they not know thai farmers have to sow their crops at a particular time of year? Do they think that the farmers can sow crops every three months? It is terrible that bureaucrats and inefficient Ministers of the Government should be able to come to a decision to allot* tractors to he brought in only at three-monthly intervals. How can the Government justify such a decision which means, in effect, that tractors must be held in cold storage until next year, thu? denying to the people of Great Britain much-needed foodstuffs? What inefficiency and blundering this is on the part of this Government. On the 17th February, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPherson</inline> again wrote to the Controller-General of Customs and the Minister for Customs stating that his company had programmed, if required, an obsolute  minimum of 1,469 tractors for manufacture and export to Australia for the financial year 1948-49, of which slightly in excess of 44 per cent, were of the large cereal type.

During this period when tractors were prevented from coming to Australia, the Government provided 1,189,110 dollars to Metropolitan Cement Proprietary Limited for the importation of a second-hand cement plant from the United States of America. At that time, the company had no capital assets to pay for the plant, but the dollars were allocated to it. The company's managing director was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> S.

If the right honorable gentleman made these dollars available to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor,</inline> and has lied to the Parliament about the circumstances, he is not fit to hold office as Prime Minister. If he, in fact, knew <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor,</inline> and has lied in denying that he knew him, he is unfit to lead the Government. On the other hand, if the right honorable gentleman is so simple and innocent as to have agreed to provide approximately 1,200,000 dollars to a company, the name of the managing director of which he did not even know, he is not fit to be Prime Minister. In the late final extra edition of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun,</inline> of the 11th September. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor</inline> is reported to have said that ho had been associated with the foundation of several companies. I propose to give to honorable members some information about the type of companies with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor</inline> was associated and some about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor</inline> himself. 1 remind honorable, members that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor's</inline> application for an allocation of approximately 1,200,000 dollars, for the purpose of importing a second-hand cement-making plant, was sponsored by the Prime Minister at a time when the farmers of Australia were denied the requisite tractors to enable them to carry on. Many of the companies with which Taylor was associated failed, and only by the skin of his teeth has Taylor escaped gaol. My authority for that statement is the Attorney-General of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarence</inline> Martin. In 1931 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor</inline> was declared bankrupt.  His  assets at that time amounted to £340 and his liabilities were a little in excess of £6,000. In 1932, presumably while still a bankrupt, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor</inline> floated Metropolitan Products Limited ; but, notwithstanding the fact that the company must have collected certain funds from investors, it failed to function. In 1938, he floated Atlas Portland Cement (Australia) Limited. He was appointed managing director. Another of Taylor'., companies was Berrima Electric Power Company Limited, of which he was also appointed managing director on the nomination of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Markell,</inline> the proposition having been seconded by himself, because no other shareholders were present. Later, the company sued the new South Wales Government for compensa-tion for work which had actually been done by enemy prisoners of war at Berrima, and for certain work done at a coal mine which in fact had been carried out long before the company was formed. The directors were so terrified by the revelation of certain facts during the hearing of the case that on the second day of the hearing they agreed to accept a non-suit. During the hearing of the case, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shand,</inline> K.C., referred to the company as one being conducted with absolute fraud. Certain papers arising from the case were forwarded to the Attorney-General for action. This is the sort of company that was floated . and organized by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor.</inline> The Government has associated itself with criminals. It has placed in the highest positions in the land men like the forger, Garden, and <inline font-style="italic">his</inline> associate, the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward).</inline> In 1940, things being a little dull in the cement business, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>
                        <para class="block">Taylor floated a company described <inline font-style="italic">&amp;e</inline> Coal Oil and By-Products Limited; but. because the then Government, the FaddenMenzies Government, would not override the decision of the Advisory Committee on Capital Issues, the company was not given a permit to raise the requisite capital. Who was the champion who then took up the cause of Tayloin this chamber? It was none other than the former honorable member for Reid. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morgan,</inline> the importer of refugees, who were attracted by advertisements in the Austrian newspapers, and who charged them exorbitant fees for supposedly arranging for their entry into Australia.

While he was a member of the Parliament he talked about the activities of great monopolies, but he was prepared to sell his soul to the devil in an attempt to obtain approval for the raising of the necessary funds to enable his company to operate.

The Crown. Solicitor's report proceeded - with  a capital of £5.000 divided into 4,000 preference shares of £1 each, and 4.000 ordinary  shares  of 5s. each. The objects of the company were, among other things, to produce fuel, oil and other products from shale or coal. The directors of this company are Arnold Stanley Taylor, Cecil Oscar William Lyne, and Oswald Ford . . . The company set about forming groups of consumers, each member of a group signing a,n agreement with the company to subscribe to the- cost of erecting one retort, the liability of each subscriber being set. out in the schedule to the agreement. </para>
                        <para class="block">Consumers who were to buy the products of the company subscribed £1,250 for the building of a retort. It was intended that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor</inline> and his confreres would sell them the petrol obtained from it. Taylor apparently got very enthusiastic about this, and talked about the amounts that  would be required to build the retort. [ have in my possession a photostat copy of an original agreement made between Coal Oil and By-Products Limited, and one of the consumer groups, which shows that the. total subscriptions amounted to only £877 instead of £1,250. The document, which is signed by the unfortunate people who agreed to put up their money for this venture, was not even dated. The company omitted the formality of affixing its seal to the document in order to make it a binding agreement on both parties; but it did not omit to take money from those wretched people, lt failed to do what it set out to do. A report, was subsequently made to the Crown Solicitor pointing out that, although retorts were to be erected within a. period of six weeks, some of them had not been erected after the expiration of two years. While the  company: was fail- ing to carry out its undertakings', <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor;</inline> this protege of the Prime Minister, floated another company called Mudgee Shale Oil Proprietary Limited, in which he held a controlling interest, for the purpose of' undertaking exactly the same* work. Any. government which nef uses.- to. appoint a&gt; royal commission to inquire1, into this matter, is unworthy of holding, the King's commission and should resign. Another company floated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor</inline> was called Fly-off Oil Proprietary Limited, but apparently it flew straight away with all the subscribers' capital, for they, never saw their money again. Although the Crown Solicitor said that criminal proceedings could not be taken by the Crown against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor,</inline> that gentleman had a very narrow escape from joining his associate, Harold J. Price, the solicitor who is now gracing Long Bay gaol as the guest of  His  Majesty for having misappropriated an amount of £60,000 over a period, of years. This scoundrel Taylor is allowed by the Government to stay out of gaol, and. the company of which he was managing director was given 1,200,000 dollars to buy needless machinery for the manufacture. of cement, while the farmers of Australia are prevented from importing the tractors that would enable them to grow the food needed by the starving people overseas. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> T.

                        <para>I refer now to another example of the Governments hypocrisy. I asked the Treasurer, upon notice, how many licences had been issued since the 1st July last for the importation of bottlelabelling machinery. Will bottle-labelling machinery feed the people of Great Britain or produce anything in this country that will earn us dollars? Of course not! But friends of the Government, whom I may name later, wielded power and influence with it and members of the Government party, whom I may also name, and went to and obtained from the Minister for Trade and Customs the licences to operate after the 1st July for the importation of bottle-labelling machinery to the value of just under 60,000 dollars, the equivalent of about 30 tractors, which, in a normal year, would enable the production of 80,000 bags of wheat. However, the hungry, grasping, criminal element, which, from the beginning of time, has supported and been associated with the Labour party, including the forger, Garden, and the people concerned in the stench of the Keane trunk case and other scandals that have flashed like lightning on the Government's head, show us that the Government is entirely insincere and does not care a jot for the people of Great Britain or the farmers of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. They will not pull much weight in the direction that honorable members opposite desire. My idea of a satisfactory budget is that it should give evidence of honesty, equity and security. The Government believe? that all the people, regardless of their status, are entitled to adequate food, clothing and shelter. Honorable members opposite should debate the budget a? it should be debated, from that standpoint. Instead they are seizing every opportunity of belabouring communism. They are not doing the country much good by doing so. As communism has been debated so much, however, let me, before I .get on to my real task of debating the provisions of the budget, say that Communists and I are as far apart a? the poles. A Communist would get no support from me and I would not expect any from him. I appreciate that a Communist may have ideals thai he believes are good. That is a matter for his own conscience. But [ disagree with the methods of Communists and the way they endeavour to control the people's lives in the manner that they regard as the best for the people. I do not believe in force or domination. We must have a system of government that fits in with my remarks as to what a budget should be, and is honest, and that gives equity and security to the people. I deeply regret that honorable members opposite have said that we are friendly with the Communists. One honorable member stated that he would not say that we were " fellow travellers ", but that he would say we were sympathetic to Communists. If he were to attend meetings of the trades and labour councils in the States and hear those who favour communism condemn the Australian Labour party advocates, he would soon realize that there is no friendship between us and the Communists. Doubtless, some policies to which the Labour party endeavours to give effect accord with some policies of the Communists. In my parliamentary experience, I have become aware that administrations, Labour or Liberal, do many things that are in accord with the policies of their political opponents. I was amused when the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> read extracts from the platform of the Labour party. He brought no secrets to light. The platform has been well known by all interested people for many years. As one honorable gentleman said, Labour  members would not be here as representatives of and endorsed by the party unless they had fully subscribed to Labour policy. That is quite true, but it is nothing to attack us with. Honorable members opposite have talked bitterly about the socialization or nationalisation of industry. I know that many people do not like the nationalization of industry. But about two years ago, when I was a member of the Parliament of South Australia, the LiberalCountry party Government led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Playford,</inline> became, I think, the first government in Australia to nationalize the power and lighting services of a metropolitan area. Honorable members opposite say that nationalization or socialization is something that people should be afraid of and run away from-, but when their own colleagues in another legislative sphere nationalize a utility, they are silent. After  the years that I have spent m both the trade union section and political section of the Labour movement, I know what it stands for. More than that [ know more about the people and their standards than do many honorable members opposite. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> spoke about the standard of living of the workers and pro.duced figures which, he said, showed that, although a man, some years ago, could buy a suit of clothes with the pay for one week's work, he had to part with the pay for two weeks' work now to buy one. [f the honorable member had visited the homes of poor people as I did and had seen the conditions in which the people lived in 1939 and had recently revisited them, he would not have risen in this chamber and claimed that the standards of . the . workers to-day are far below what they were then. The Leader- of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> speaking about taxation, on the one hand, and wages, on the other, said, in effect, " You give a rise with one hand and take it away with the other". I do not know whether he was speaking about ordinary people, because the great burden of taxation beans heaviest on people at 'the bottom of the ladder, and not on those at the top. I agree that a man on £1,000 or £1,500 a year is substantially taxed. But I also contend that what he ha.left after paying his tax is what counts. I remember meeting a man in my electorate just after the last general election. He told me that he had been speaking to his bank manager, who had said to him, " You will be voting for the Liberal party candidate, I suppose ". He replied,. " No, I support the Labour party ". The bank manager said to him, " But your cheque for income tax this year was over £1,300. How can you support the Labour party when you pay over £1,300 in income tax ? " The man replied, " I am well aware of how much income tax I paid, but I am also aware of what I had left after the tax was paid. That is what determines my standard of living ". When honorable members opposite say that taxation has not been reduced sufficiently they must, surely, be thinking of the higher incomes. I agree with them that income tax rates rise somewhat too steeply, perhaps, from the exempt income to the middle income, but even in regard to the middle income ranges  it is what is left after the tax if paid that counts. I have been examining the tables prepared for the information of honorable members about income tax rates, and I believe that some of the figures might well be put on record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> so that the public may understand the real position. During the war, when taxation rate." were at their highest, a man with out dependants, who was receiving £250 a year, paid £36 14s. in income tax. Such a man now pays only £12 10s., a reduction of £24. A man with £300 a year, without dependants, paid £55 during the war, whereas he now pays only £18 15s. The man with £500 a year, without dependants, paid £136 in income tax during the war, but even then he had £364  left,  and that is 'what counts.  His  tax. has "been reduced from £136 to £53, a 'reduction of £83. We now come to the man on ^£5,000 -a year. During the war, he paid £3,530 in income'tax, whereas he now 'pays £2,405, -a reduction of £1,125. When the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(.Mr. -Fadden)</inline> said that the Government was collecting more revenue from income tax now than ever before, he did not state the position quite fairly. I am not saying that his figures were incorrect, because it is true that the total amount of income tax collected is greater than ever before. However, the individual is, in many instances, paying less than he did during the war, and even those who are actually paying more are doing so because they are receiving more. When the right honorable gentleman was discussing our exports of primary  products he said that, on the basis of pre-war values, such exports had increased, not by more than 100 per cent, as shown by statistics, but by only 44 per cent. However, when he discussed income tax collections, he did not apply the same rule. He did not take into account the fact that present returns from income taxation are conditioned .by the present-d'ay value of money. </para>

                        <para>I regard the man in receipt of £6 a week as a basic-wage worker. On an income of £300 a year, a man without dependants pays £18 15s. income tax, but the man with a wife to support pays only £7 16s. Moreover, it must be remembered that this payment of £7 16s. represents his social service contribution, and is not income tax in the ordinary sense of the word. Those who press for the abolition of the present system of uniform taxation would do well to remember this. Even if the system were abolished, existing social services would have to be continued. We should still have to pay age and invalid pensions, widows' pensions, and hospital benefits, all of which are financed out of social service contributions. Thus, if the system of dual income taxation were restored the man on £300 a year would have to make his social contribution to the Commonwealth Treasury, and pay something in State income tax as well. The man on £300 a year, who has a wife and one child to support, now pays only £1 11's income tax, and I cannot agree that the* constitutes an unduly heavy burden. It represents a social service contribution of only about '7d. a week. The man on £300 a year, with a wife and two chi1dren, makes no social service contribution at all, but his wife receives £26 a year child endowment for one of heT children. It is absurd, therefore, for honorable 'members opposite to talk of taxation pressing heavily upon basic wage earners, or to suggest that it i* depriving them of food, clothing and other necessaries. </para>
                        <para>During the war, a man receiving an income of £500 a year paid £80 16s income tax .if he had a wife and <inline font-style="italic">two</inline> children to support. He now pays £21 9s That is not a very large deduction from £500, seeing that his wife is entitled t© receive £26 a year child endowment as an offset against the payment of £21 9s. in tax. The tax payable by a man on £500 a year, who has a wife and two children, has been reduced by £59 7s., whereas the tax payable by a man receiving £5,000 a year has been reduced by £1,125. The Leader of the Australian Country part: advocates a flat rate reduction of income tax, claiming that rates should be 'reduced by 30 per cent., or some other fixed percentage. That is where We differ from him. Income tax reductions, in the case of the man on £500 a year, with two de pendants, total 28.5 per cent., hut the amount to only 10 per cent, in the case of the man on £5,000 a year. Honorable members opposite do not condemn 'the Government for having taken too  much  off the £500 a year man, but for not haying taken enough off the £5,000 a year man. Evidently, they still believe thai the function of government is to protect the economically successful members  of  the community, the persons who have done well for themselves. The honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blain)</inline> very seldom asks questions in this House about the poor man on the land. He wants to get at the " big man ", and I believe that he is right. Members of the Opposition generally show great concern for the " big man ", and their efforts are directed at ensuring that he shall not be heavily taxed. </para>
                        <para>Hie -wage-earner 'has already ^received  reasonable  consideration. .If .honorable members will refer 'to the 'tax schedules which were in force during the  last financial  year, they will find that a man with a wife and five children, in receipt of £8 15s. a week, did not pay any income cax or social services contribution. There are 'not many workers, even in the skilled trades, who receive more than £8 15s. a week, unless they work overtime and on Sundays. The wife of the employee to whom I have just referred received child endowment amounting to 30s. a week. How can we assist that class of wage earner? The remarks of the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> were calculated to make his audience believe that wage-earners in that category require consideration. That would .immediately occur to our minds when we heard the statement that workers could not afford to buy suits of clothes at the existing high prices. A man in receipt of £1,000 a year would not be so affected. En making these remarks, I do not desire honorable members to think that I believe that the present inflated prices of clothes are justified. The increases in recent months have been remarkable indeed. I mention this matter merely tor the purpose of showing that the remarks of the honorable member for Reid lid not apply to the average tradesman with a wife and several children, because he does not pay income tax or the social services contribution. </para>
                        <para>Honorable members opposite may claim that the working man is heavily penalized by indirect taxes, including sale tax. Generally speaking, the man who has figuratively to fight in order to support his family does not buy luxury articles which are subject to sales tax. Admittedly, he might purchase a special article upon which sales tax is payable, but such an occasion would be rare. The remarks of honorable members opposite about the necessity to reduce the burden of taxation obviously apply to persons in the higher income groups. When I visit factories, some of the employees say to me, "Why does not the Government reduce taxes ? " I ask them what wages they receive, and what families they have, and nine times out of ten I discover that they do not pay income tax or the social services ^contribution.  Their questions ito me are inspired by the constant agitation in the .newspapers in favour .of a reduction of taxes. As I have shown, the Government has already exempted many persons in the lower income groups from the obligation to pay direct taxes. I forecast that if workers with only one or two children do not continue to receive their present high wages, a government some time in the future will be compelled to  reimpose  taxes on some of the lower income .groups in order to maintain the buoyancy of Consolidated Revenue. Some honorable members opposite have referred scathingly to " attendance money " which is paid to waterside workers when they present themselves for employment, but are not engaged. I do not desire to deal with that subject, but I know that some people, while greatly concerned about the increase of social service payments, advocate the abolition of the means test. The honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mrs. Blackburn)</inline> stated earlier that she had been severely criticized because a newspaper had erroneously stated she had not declared herself in favour of such abolition. I make no secret of my attitude. I stand for the modification of the existing means test on property, but I do not advocate the complete abolition of the means test. A few days ago, a gentleman asked me, " When does the Government propose to abolish the means test? " I replied, " Do you want a pension before you retire from your employment ? " He said, " No, of course not". I informed him that the complete abolition of the means test would mean that, although he was continuing to earn his salary, his wife would be eligible for a pension of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 2s. fid. a week on attaining the age of 60. In my opinion, that system would not be justified, and I would not advocate it. The adoption of that proposal for the payment of pensions would not be warranted unless the recipients had, for years, made contributions computed on an actuarial basis. When people advocate the abolition of the means test, I sometimes get into hot water by disputing the soundness of their contentions. In my opinion, any pension payable by the Government should commence only when a person has retired from employment, or lias not sufficient means to provide him with the necessaries of life. Whether he is in that position can be determined only by some form of means test. </para>
                        <para>Whilst I wholeheartedly support the budget proposals, I had hoped that the Government would be a little more generous than it has in relaxing the means test. Honorable members opposite may be surprised that a supporter of the Government should express that view in this chamber, but I do so because I desire to make a few suggestions about the means test, which, I hope, the Treasurer will carefully consider. In the past, when people did not pay the social services contribution, I did not feel so concerned about the means test applicable to income from property as I do to-day. In my opinion, the means test on property should be made less irksome. At present, a man in receipt of an income of £3 a week is eligible for the full pension, provided he has no property other than the home in which he lives. During their working life, many people have endeavoured to save a few hundred pounds in order to ensure that they will have some comfort in their old age. A man and wife who have Savings Bank deposits or investments in bonds or in property amounting to £1,500 a year, are not eligible for the age pension. A house in which they have invested that sum may yield them a net rental return of only 30s. or £2 a week. I hope that before long the Government will make the property condition more liberal, Instead of the existing capital test, which provides that a person shall forgo from the pension £1 for every complete £10 over £100, the money should be regarded as income. A person who derives up to £3 a week from property should be placed in the same category as the man who has made contributions to an endowment fund to return him £3 a week at the age of &lt;!5 years. Provided such a man has no capital, he is eligible to receive the full pension. It is anomalous that a man who invests in property a <inline font-style="italic">sum</inline> to yield £3 a week is disqualified from receiving a pension. This position should be thoroughly investigated. My ideas on this matter are well known in official quarters, but I voice them again this afternoon because 1 realize the necessity to assist many people who have saved a comparatively small sum of money for a " rainy day ", and who are now being harshly penalized. The bud  get provides that the amount of property, apart from the pensioner's dwelling and other exempt property which he maj have without reduction of pension, shall be increased from £50 to £100, and the property limit above which no pension will be payable will be raised from £650 to £750. Thi3 position is causing grave concern to many people, some of whom have saved approximately £1,000, and invested the money in security loans. They are thereby disqualified from receiving an age pension. We should seriously consider relaxing the means test as it is at present applicable to such persons. I appreciate the action of the  Governmenin  increasing from £50 to £100 the permissible amount of property which th&lt;pensioner may have without reduction of pension. Not many years ago, the maxi mum amount which husband and wife were permitted was only £50. Under the budget proposals the maximum will become £200. Whilst I advocate this liberalization of the means test, I do not overlook the Treasurer's warning thai money must be provided to meet the additional cost. That money cannot be conjured out of the air, or created through  some  fancy method of finance like social credit. Any additional money which is paid to a person who needs it, and should nave it, can be obtained only by taking it from another person who is in a position to pay it. That is one of the reasons why I have dealt extensively with the incidence of income tax and social service contributions upon the individual and said that in my opinion the  important  factor was not the amount of ta&gt; that was paid but the amount that remained in the taxpayer's pocket after payment of the tax. It is the size of that amount which determines whether a taxpayer will be able to provide for the needs of his family. </para>
                        <para>I am aware that we must cut our suit according to the cloth, or in other words, make the best use of the dollars and other foreign currencies that are available to us. We must also, however consider our future industrial expansion. In the  past we were almost entirely a primary producing country, and dependent upon exports of primary products for our well-being. We must face up to the fact that at some time in the- future the European and other countries which were formerly exporters of primary products will again be competing with us in this field, and possibly in a more vigorous manner than before. If Australia is to continue to be a white man's country and our present prosperity is to be maintained, we must increase our population, and especially our industrial population, which is the largest internal consumer of our primary products. That brings me to the Government's immigration policy. Lastweekend I visited the displaced persons camp at Bathurst, in which the people who are commonly known as Baits are accommodated for a time so that they may acquire a working knowledge of the English language. I desired to see the type of persons who are coming to Australia from overseas and to form an opinion about whether they are likely to he assimilated into our community and become good Australians. If we wish to maintain the standard of living that we have enjoyed during the last few years, we must attract great numbers of migrants to Australia. If the prices of wheat, butter and other primary products fall to their pre-war levels we shall find it difficult to maintain our present prosperity and standard of living unless our own population is sufficiently large to consume much greater quantities of our primary products than at present. </para>
                        <para>I hope that this budget will be. accepted by honorable members as being honest and equitable and as one that is designed to achieve the. security of the Australian economy. I conclude by saying that it is important that the people should cultivate a spiritual outlook - and by that I do not refer to a religious revival. I am thinking of the manner in which every Australian should regard the other people in the community. Every citizen should consider the welfare of the man around the corner, whether he lives in a big or a small house. </para>

                            <para>.- Since the Parliament re-assembled two very important matters have been discussed. The first was the GovenorGeneral's Speech, which was in fact a speech prepared for  His Excellency  by his Ministers and read by him in the Senate chamber to members of the Parliament. That Speech was fully debated and was, I think, generally accepted as being very uninteresting and uninspiring. It was devoted mainly to eulogizing the efforts of the Government during the past year and it gave little inspiration to the people. We are now discussing the budget, which is designed to give effect to the policy of the Government as indicated in the Governor-General's Speech. The budget speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> closely follows the lines of <inline font-style="italic">his</inline> previous budget speeches. The right honorable gentleman is adept at making wise saws and uttering orthodox statements. I have little to complain of in the announcements that the Treasurer made in this and previous budget speeches. As a matter of fact, they might have been made by a member of the 'political party to which I belong. Honorable members on this side of the chamber take little exception to the principles that were enunciated by the right honorable gentleman. He expressed very sound views and clearly stated the financial and economic position of the country. It is when we come to consider the reasons that he gave for our present economic position that we have some cause for doubt or difference of opinion. The Treasurer endeavoured to convince the Australian public that the sound economic position that he outlined is due almost entirely to the policy that his Government has followed during the years it has held office. He substantially ignored factors over which the Government has no control. I admit that in his speech the right honorable gentleman gave a clear warning to the Australian people. He told them, in effect, that the solvency and the sound economic position of the country is largely, or almost entirely, bound up with ruling prices, and particularly those paid for our exports. He said that unless those prices continue at their present high level severe problems will confront the Government and the  people- of Australia. The Treasurer uttered' those words of warning,- but there is-no evidence in his speech or in the proposals that' he has- made to show that he has1 taken cognizance of his own warning. This is' the most inflationary budget ever tO'be: presented to the Parliament. If the right' honorable gentleman believes, as I think he does, that the present high prices for commodities are unlikely to continue, we; should have seen some evidence of an endeavour by the Government to reduce expenditure as an example to private citizens. It will be remembered that in the budget of. last year the Treasurer underestimated' by £60,000,000 the revenue that he expected to receive. I do not criticize the right honorable gentleman for that, because during that period even private individuals found great difficulty in estimating their income for the current year. I have no objection at' all to a treasurer being conservative in- his estimate of the revenue he expects to receive. Although the revenue collected was £60,000,000 in excess of the Treasurer's estimate, the surplus for the year <inline font-style="italic">waaf</inline> only £1,500,000. In addition to underestimating revenue, the right honorable  gentleman  underestimated expenditure; We are still in the midst of a period of high prices. In spite- of the warning to which I have' referred, the Treasurer in this budget' has estimated revenue at approximately £500,000,000 and expenditure at £509,000,000. If the right honorable gentleman really believes that a recession - he will not admit to a depression - is likely to occur; I suggest that the proper thing to do would be to find some way to reduce expenditure. I do not know whether the present estimate of revenue will prove to be an underestimate again, but" the probability is that it will be. I am satisfied that expenditure is also underestimated. It is interesting to note that the only reductions of expenditure that are proposed are, first, a reduction of £20,000,000 of the amount which is to be expended upon defence; and" secondly, £25,000,000 on subsidies. I beard the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> speaking very glibly on this- question of subsidies. He tried to justify  the audacious- announcement' by the Prime Minister during the last referendum campaign, when the right honorable gentleman threatened' the people of this country with the removal of subsidies unless they gave- full powers of price control to the Australian Government. Now for the honorable member for Fremantle to suggest thai there was no justification for subsidies at that time" is one of th* most ridiculous proposals ever made in this House. Honorable members- will recall the history of those subsidies. They will recall that during the two years of the Menzies regime immediately after the outbreak of the last- war, that Government' appointed a price-fixing commissioner for the purpose of holding down costs during the war period. Honorable members may also recall that during those two years' the action, taken by the Menzies. Government, and the resulting control exercised by the Prices" Commissioner, were so successful that increases in items involved in the " C" series index figures was under 10 per cent; On the advent of the Labour regime, prices began to rise rapidly, so that from an increase in the first two war years of under 10 per cent, they increased in twelve month.1' of Labour rule to very nearly the same percentage. In the first two years of the Labour regime the increase in prices was over 20 per cent. It was at that time, when the futility of the controls then exercised was evident, that' the Opposition suggested to the Government s policy of subsidizing, the goods listed in the " C " series index. That policy had been applied earlier, in the war by the British Government. It was not until the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> had returned from London, where he had represented this country on the War Cabinet of the British National Government, and had seen the success of the subsidy policy there, and advocated in this House the adoption of a similar plan here, thai the Curtin Government accepted subsidization as a policy. From then on. during the course of the war, costs were reasonably held down: I do not say that some rises did not occur, but they were very much slowed down by the' subsidization policy. It was expected that with the end of the war and with consumption, and purchasing' power reverting from war-time to civil levels the position would be eased and the subsidies would gradually be reduced. Honorable members will also recall that the Prime Minister early last year stated that as a matter of policy the Government was working gradually to reduce subsidies, and as they had reached too high a level during the war, the Government would gradually tail them off. The .Prime Minister in his budget speech last year estimated that an amount of £19,000,000 would be required for subsidies. Suddenly, out of the blue he announced to the country that the Government intended to intensify subsidization of commodities. Honorable members do not require to look very far to realize what had caused the Prime Minister to reverse his previous decision, [t was perfectly clear that the industrial policy of his Government has so reduced production in this country, or at least prevented it increasing, that buying pressure had so grown that prices were skyrocketing. Therefore, instead of the £19,000,000 estimated, the actual expenditure on subsidies was £35,000,000. In spite of that, prices were again increasing rapidly. At the end of the war price levels, based on the " C " index series, had increased approximately 25 per cent, above the 1939 level. They rose in 1946- 17 .to 27 per cent, and in 1947-48 to 35 per cent. In his budget speech last week the Prime Minister said that during the quarter which ended the 30th June, 1948, prices had increased by 40 per cent. That .increase occurred notwithstanding that an amount of £35,000,000 was being paid out by the Government in subsidies. In the face of that, the Prime Minister had the audacity to suggest .to the people of this country that unless they gave the Government permanent power to control prices, subsidies would be reduced. The comment made by the honorable member for Fremantle that the advocates of .a "No " vote at the referendum had suggested that Government control should be ended immediately and that 'subsidies should be cut off immediately, was completely untrue. I know, from the literature that was circulated during the referendum campaign, and from published advertisements .and broadcast an nouncements at that time, .that members of the .Opposition told the country that while they were opposed to the granting of permanent .powers the Government already, in an act of parliament, held such powers to -the end of the present year, and that the Opposition was willing to support a re-enactment of that act for twelve months and perhaps for two years. There was no suggestion by any member of the Opposition that those powers should immediately be transferred to the States. Put the Prime Minister and his Government were so peeved, so disappointed, and so annoyed at the decision of the people at the referendum that they decided, willy-nilly, to throw the controls over to the States and to discontinue subsidies. It will be interesting to the people of this country to see the results. This Government has deliberately thrown into the discard the very people it claims to represent. I refer to the wage earners on whose standard of living the " C " series index is based, the pensioners and retired persons on superannuation, who are affected much more by the Government's action than are earners of large salaries or property owners. The Government has thrown these people into an inflationary period in which prices will rise. Then, to cover himself up in the budget the Prime Minister suggests a paltry reduction of taxation of about £20,000,000 for this year, which, in the cases of these people, will mean a reduction of £2 to £5 a year in their tax, whereas increased prices following the Government's action may mean an extra expenditure of £20 or £30 a year for such people. </para>

                                <para>- Before the suspension of the sitting I had referred to the callous way in which the Government has discontinued subsidies formerly provided in order to keep down the cost of living, and I had stated that even when subsidies were paid, and the Government had complete control of prices, the cost of living had increased by from 25 to 40 per cent. .It is still rising, rapidly. The Government abandoned the subsidy system because it claims that control over prices has been taken away from it. All that .the people said at the referendum  was that they did not desire the Commonwealth to exercise permanent control over prices. The Government had statutory power until the end of December to continue its control over prices, and the Opposition had given an undertaking to support the continuance of the exercise of that power for some years to come. In order to counter the effects of this callous action the Government has made very slight tax reductions, but they will mean very little to the working man. The reduction of £1 or £2 in the tax paid by a worker will be swallowed up by increased prices within a month. The Government, in a fit of pique, has thrown its own supporters to the wolves. </para>

                                <para>- I agree with the honorable member. They will be thrown to the wolves at the next election. After that we shall have a Liberal government which will be more sympathetic. Another reduction made by the Government to counter increasing costs is in the provision for defence and allied services. Last year, notwithstanding that the Government did not complete its programme, it expended £65,0S1,236 on defence and allied services. This year it proposes to expend £50,462,000 for that purpose. A number of statements have been made by the. Prime Minister and other Ministers on the subject of the .Government's defence policy. We have been told that the five-year defence programme which the Government has mapped out was decided upon after consultation with Great Britain and other Empire countries. These statements, however, completely overlook the fact that whilst an amount of £250,000,000 may have been appropriate for defence on the scale of costs applicable in 1946, according to the Government's own figures it is totally inadequate at the present time. After all, Australia is only a very small part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and of the United Nations. During World War II. we were compelled to ask for aid from wherever it could be obtained. No doubt the Government is relying on similar ' aid being forthcoming should another world conflict occur. We have heard a good deal about the improbability of war. I should say that no man in this country has done more to influence Russian aggression than has the Prime Minister. </para>

                                <para>- It will be remembered that recently the Prime Minister said that the peoples of the world do not desire war. He also said, in relation to the dispute between the allied nations and Russia, which is now reaching an acute position, that the allied nations should resist Russian pressure right up to the point of war, but that we should not contemplate risking the holocaust that another world war would bring in its train. We have already had two world wars within a generation and J do not doubt that those wars occurred substantially because the aggressor nation did not realize that Great Britain and its allies would fight. The Kaiser was misinformed as to the attitude that Great Britain would take if his armies marched through Belgium. Hitler was misinformed by von Ribbentrop as to the attitude that Great Britain would take if he invaded Poland. Now the Russians are being told by the Prime Minister of a British dominion thai we should resist Russian pressure right up to the point of war.. What greater encouragement could Russia have thai a statement of that kind? In spite of the deteriorating  international  situation, and in spite of the fact that the United States of America and Great Britain and other countries are stepping up their defence plans, Australians are told that we have a five-year plan which will be put into operation irrespective of what may happen in the international sphere. Defence is being made a political shuttlecock by the Government. We all know that the peoples of the world do not want war. No one likes expenditure on war or on preparation for war; but the Government has a responsibility to the people of this country, and it must face up to that responsibility. Ministers of the Crown are the only people in Australia who know precisely the state of affairs that exists overseas. Yet in spite of the information they possess they merely stand pat and do nothing. Whenever the  subject  of communism is raised in this chamber, and it is pointed out that the </para>

                        <para class="block">Minister for Defence and other Ministers allow Communists to remain in key  posi-lions,  the Government docs nothing. Consider the utterances made by Communists recently in Brisbane. We all know what the Communists will do during the next war and we also know that there will be no war unless Russia is the aggressor. The Government, however, does nothing about them. We know that before Russia was attacked by Germany the Communists characterized the war as an imperialistic war, and they did everything they could to retard Australia's war effort. The Prime Minister said that should war occur these people will not be able to do anything because they will be put behind barbed wire. That is a very smug attitude. </para>

                                <para>- That is so. What the Prime Minister has refrained from telling the people is the manner in which our Communist enemies are impeding production in this country. It is all very well for the right honorable gentleman to say that he knows where the Communists are and what to do with them. Why does he not deal with them now, when Australia is in duty bound to make the utmost preparation for war? This Government is refusing to face up to its responsibilities to provide adequately for Australia's defence. </para>

                        <para>Honorable members opposite continually tell the people of this country of the wonderful policy of the Government, which is providing full employment for the people. Having regard to the general scarcity of commodities of all descriptions, and to the lag in maintenance and renovation works during the war years, what policy could have brought anything but full employment in Australia? The Prime Minister, however, has not told us what full employment means. I should like to quote the views on this subject of Professor Copland, who was economic adviser, not only to the Menzies Government, but also to the Curtin and Chifley Governments, and who was intimate!}' associated with our war effort. Professor Copland recently said - </para>

                            <para>The output of basic materials has increased very little since 1930, and is now much less than is required to maintain in full productive activity the numbers employed at present. It would be better to describe the present position as employment of large numbers at a level far below industrial capacity than as full employment. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">I entirely agree with those sentiments. It is futile for the Prime Minister to talk about the increase of the export of foodstuffs from Australia. The right honorable gentleman did not mention the fact that this country is probably doing less in relation to its capacity to help Great Britain and the allied countries than i3 any other country in the world which was not directly affected by the war. We know perfectly well that what Professor Copland has said in relation to basic materials is, unfortunately, only too true. The overall increase in production in this country has been extraordinarily small. The latest figures I have seen suggest that the overall increase in the volume of production in Australia since 1939 has been less than 10 per cent. In Canada, where there is not a socialist government, but one which is encouraging industry, enterprise and individual initiative, overall production has increased by approximately 60 per cent. The United States of America has increased its overall production by 50 per cent., and is now said to produce 50 per cent, of the manufactured goods placed on the markets .of the world. It is to the United States of America that Great Britain and the European countries are looking for succour. As an indication of how we lag behind, it is interesting to note that in 1939 black coal production in the United States of America amounted to 389,000,000 tons. In 1947 the overall production of coal was increased to 602,000,000. In Australia the comparable figures are 13,500,000 tons pre-war and 14,800,000 tons in 1947. The increased coal production in the United States of America is the kind of increase that might easily have been expected in this country, but instead we have had amendments of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the establishment of conciliation commissioners and boards galore and more and more strikes and less and less production. Until quite recently we had the Prime Minister peregrinating around </para>

                            <para>.- 1 take this opportunity of complimenting, the Government wholeheartedly on. the budget. We have heard, a. lot. of speeches about democracy,. The- subject, in my opinion, has- been talked to pieces-. But the- Government has- proved its- faith in democracy by bringing down ademocratic budget which provides the greatest good for the greatest number., The.Prime Minister and Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr., Chifley)</inline> has told us for years that he will reduce taxes as. the opportunity comes to do sohe has carried out that promise to the letter. The great majority of the people are 100 per cent better off than they were when Labour took office. Tax reductions are not quite so great as many people would have liked them to be, but it must be remembered that we are still coping with the aftermath of war. The results of the last two general elections show that the people realize that Labour has been their friend in peace and war. They were the judges and they gave most emphatic verdicts in favour of Labour as they will do so again when they have the opportunity. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline> dealt exten- sively with, the activities of his depart- ment and the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> made an excellent speech in explanation of the social services legislation provided for in the budget. I do not desire to traverse ground already covered and I do not propose to juggle figures. Some honor- able members opposite can do that easily enough, for it is their profession. I leave it to other people equally competent in that profession to judge what has been done. There is no need for hme to juggle figures to show that Australia is more prosperous to-day than it has been at any time in the last 25or 30 years, despite all the difficulties and problems caused by warand drought. The Labour Government- has overcome all' obstacles and given the great bulk of the people a  better standard of living,despite statements to the. contrary by Opposition members. I remember that notwithstandingthat in the dark days of the depression when the government had no aftermath of war or drought to contend with and Australia was a land of plenty, thousands of Australians went hungry and even starved. </para>

                        <para>Taxes have been more than halved since the war ended: That is a remarkable performance in thecircumstances. I am pleased to be associated with a Go-, vernment that hasmade such generous provision for the aged people, invalids mothers, widows, and children. I am, especially pleased that the Government has seen fit to increase the age pension. We all grow old no matter how much we may desire to stay young. The years pass very quickly. Since this. Government has been in power, the age pensioners have been treated very generously. In that respect, too, the. budget is a credit to the Prime Minister. Some members of the Opposition do not agree with a policy of full employment. I cannot understand their attitude. Full employment is most necessary. A man who loseshis job loses his income and the means of supporting himself and his family. During the depression, 33 per cent of the people in New South Wales were on the dole. The stores were chockablock with commodities, the silos full of wheat and the paddocks full of sheep and cattle, but in the midst of all that, plenty unemployment was rife in every city of the Commonwealth. The conditions then were a. standing disgrace to the legislature. Goods were plentiful' but money, was lacking. Now the people have prosperity and plenty of purchasing power. Any business man in any, small town in Australia will tell you that. he is being paid 20s. in the £1 and that practically no creditis asked for. Contrast that with the depression days when thousands committed suicide because of despair. It is amazing to hear people say that the Government has not done a good job. Supporters of a Government that could not conduct the country's affairs well enough to ensure work, food, clothing and shelter for the people it was supposed to represent ought not to have the audacity to criticize the full employment policy of this. Government and say that it does not mean prosperity. Nothing could be further from the truth. Ask any man the first thing he needs and he will say. " Employment ". The rank and file, who keep the wheels of industry turning are fully employed to-day. As the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> has said, 100,000 jobs are waiting to be filled. One may read in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> or any other leading newspaper any day of the week columns of advertisements of jobs waiting to be filled. The argument that the Government's tax policy has retarded production must be far from the truth. Otherwise why should so many firms be advertising for hands? The fact is that labour and materials are not available. </para>
                        <para>Some honorable members opposite have referred to the decline in our cattle and sheep population. It is true that there has been a decline, but that is because the country passed through three of the worst years of drought in Australia's history. One drought was the worst for all time. Sheep and cattle cannot be bred in 24 hours.It takes a long time to develop flocks and herds. In the drought, calves that could have increased the herds were killed. Moreover, 30,000,000 sheep died. During the war old stock was killed for food for our servicemen. That is why our numbers of cattle and sheep have dropped so steeply. Nature did not give us the opportunity of keeping them at the required level. The former Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> had a most unenviable job when he took over the department during one of the worst periods in our agricultural history. The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> had a great deal to say about the shortage of butter. I can understand the decline of production in the dairying industry. People left dairy farms as people left wheat farms because they could not make a " crust ". Now, however, the Government has granted dairymen a payable price for their commercial butter. The burnt child fears the fire and it was not to be unexpected that people would be chary of returning to dairying. Honorable members opposite have condemned the Government for its attitude towards men on the land, but I maintain that, in the whole history of Australia, there has never been a more countryminded government than the present Labour 'Government. When I first entered this Parliament, hardship and poverty were rampant in country districts, and many farmers were going bankrupt; but to-day, it is a pleasure to visit rural areas because the people are so prosperous. Everywhere I go, I hear the men on the land, no matter what their political sympathies, praising the Government's rural programme. The conn- try people admit that never before were they so well off. Who is responsible for this? The credit must go to the present Labour Government for introducing organized marketing, and guaranteeing prices for rural products. </para>
                        <para>The wheat industry has been a political football for a long time. Not long ago. there was a keen debate in this chamber on the international wheat agreement. The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> led the debate for the Opposition. He delivered a well-prepared speech - prepared, I think, by interests representing the wheat merchants - in the course of which he said that, if the wheat-growers were given the opportunity to exercise a vote on the subject, they would turn down the proposed wheat stabilization plan. Unfortunately, the international wheat agreement was not ratified by certain countries, and it has been abandoned although it would have provided an unequalled opportunity for stabilizing the wheat industry for the next five years. However, the Prime Minister called a conference of State representatives to institute a voluntary wheat pool to take the place of the proposed stabilization scheme, and the wheat-growers of the various States have been given the opportunity to vote on the proposal. In Victoria, the vote has already been taken and the growers have approved the proposal by a three-to-one majority. Obviously, the honorable member for Indi, in opposing the stabilization proposal, was not speaking for the growers of Victoria. In that State, 11,275 growers voted in favour of the proposal and only 3,490 against it. Opposition organizations are themselves divided on this issue. The Fanners and Settlers Association is not the mouthpiece of the wheat-growers, but the Wheat Growers Federation is, and it has advocated a " Yes " vote in New South Wales, in spite of the opposition of honorable members opposite, and of the executive of the Farmers and Settlers Association. I quote the following press report of proceedings at a recent meeting of the New South Wales branch of the Wheat Growers Federation: - " The degree of unanimity reached between representatives of the State and Federal Governments, and within the Australian Wheat </para>
                        <para>Growers' Federation, upon the Federal wheat proposals can surely permit of little opposition, especially from within the wheat industry," said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> H. Evans,  president  of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation to-day.  Organized wheat-growers have for many years supported such a plan in principle and during the last three years they have had the opportunity of concentrating on proposals on which can be built an effective stabilization scheme ", he said. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Evans</inline> said that Victorian growers had already decided by a three-to-one majority to support these principles. In Western Australia a special conference oi organizations whose representatives had previously opposed such a plan had now supported the acceptance of the Government's latest proposals . . . </para>
                        <para>A large and representative gathering of wheat-growers at Oaklands this week carried with one dissentient a resolution recommending a " Yes " vote at the coming ballot on the Federal wheat stabilization plan. Those present included two vice-presidents of the Farmers and Settlers (Messrs, R. A. O'Neill, of Berrigan, and J. M. Wilson, of Balldale), and district council members of the same body, as well as office-holders and prominent members of the Wheat Growers Union and Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Association. Most districts of Southern Riverina were represented, and there were some farmers from Victoria. </para>
                        <para class="block">Opposition parties when they were in power, had the opportunity over a period of many years to do something to help the wheat-growers, but they never offered more than 2s. lOd. a bushel for wheat at country sidings. The result of the poll of growers in Victoria has placed beyond doubt what the growers want. They are satisfied with the Government's proposal for a guaranteed export price for 100,000,000 bushels, and it is not often that we have more wheat to export than that. Under this scheme, which guarantees a payable price for the next five years, growers will be able to plan ahead. <inline font-style="italic">lt</inline> is necessary to plan at least twelve months ahead for the growing of wheat, because land must be fallowed, and other preparations made. I commend the Government and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> for bringing forward a plan which will give the growers security, and enable them to produce at a profit. I also commend the Government on its decision to continue to pay a subsidy on superphosphate. Probably 90 per cent, of Australia's agricultural land needs superphosphate, which is used in the growing of onions, potatoes, wheat and lucerene,  and for topdressing pastures. During the recent referendum campaign, the Government stated  that, if its proposals were rejected, the payment of subsidies would be discontinued, but it has wisely decided to continue the payment of the subsidies on superphosphate. I am pleased that it is intended to make payments direct to the growers instead of the manufacturers, as has been the case in the past. Under the old system, farmers had to wait a long time for their rebates from the manufacturers: </para>
                        <para>The Department of Commerce and Agriculture, the Australian "Wheat Board, and the New South Wales Railways Department, as well as the Minister for Agriculture in» New South Wales, have done a magnificent job in shifting last year's wheat crop from the interior of New South Wales to the coast, especially as the quantity to be removed amounted to almost two years' normal crops. More over, farmers had, for the most part, to use second-hand bags. The Government sent a representative to Calcutta in an endeavour to obtain more cornsacks, but he was unable to get all that were needed. Very little wheat will be left at country sidings when the new season begins, and that little will all be in bags. </para>
                        <para>The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)</inline> has said that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture should not have any say in the sale of wheat. Can we imagine any Government guaranteeing the price of wheat and not insisting upon having a say in the sale of it? If any honorable member opposite were to guarantee a businessman who required a loan of £10,000, he would insist on having a voice in the management or control of the security. </para>

                                <para>- The Government is in exactly the same position. Had it not guaranteed the producers a price for their wheat, the situation would be entirely different. Honorable members opposite want it both ways. They demand that the Government shall guarantee the farmers a payable price for their wheat, but they object to the Government having any voice in the disposal of the grain or in  the conduct df the industry. Their attitude is most unreasonable. The administration of the Government and the Australian Wheat Board has been most effective. We can easily criticize what another man does, but when we place ourselves in his position, we often view the matter in a different light. I make no apology for anything that the Government has done for the man on the lami, and I. compliment it for placing the primary industries on a sound footing. Prosperity is evident in all walks of life. Various Ministers have made a vigorous defence of the Government's actions. Any government is apt to make some mistakes, but the Chifley Government has shown foresight in everything and has done the greatest good for the greatest number of people. The administration of the Treasurer during the last eight years has greatly improved the conditions of all the people, whether they be workers, businessmen, primary producers., age and invalid pensioners or widows. The fact that every section of the community is enjoying prosperity unparalleled in our history is a great compliment to the Government whose wise legislation has made that prosperity possible. The Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chambers),</inline> who vigorously defended Australia's defence policy, counselled his critics to talk more about peace and less about war. The Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has done everything possible at 'the United Nations to avert another conflict. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> frequently criticizes the Minister for External Affairs. </para>

Preceding speakers have dealt with some of those problems, and I shall confine-my remarks to matters relating to the defence of this country, and the circumstances in which this defence becomes necessary. The .Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> reminded us that, although actual;hostilities in World War XT. ceased " two .years -ago. the peace which we have  dearly earned and 'richly  deserved still dudes us. While all men cry out for peace, they are feverishly re-arming, lt is a tragic commentary on the folly of mankind, but it is a definite factor that <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> cannot afford to ignore. The right honorable gentleman has expressed the opinion, which all honorable members mare, that Russia. although pressing on,  does  not want Avar, but is prepared to push its policy as far as it can go without war. In my opinion, that statement describes the situation very crisply.  Naturally,  we ask ourselves what is it that Russia can gain by war that it has  not  gained and is not gaining by the mere threat of war? Applying these great things to relevantly small ones, we see r.he position in the domestic sphere proceeding along the same lines. Men do not want to strike. Why should they ,trike when they can get all that they  want  by the mere threat to strike and by ignoring the law? The right honorable gentleman has told us that the western  democracies,  with whom we are associated, are confronted with a power which they are quite unable to repel. </para>

We naturally ask why  Russia  does not do that, and, in part, the answer is that, so far, the Russians are doing very well as they are. We watch closely die situation as it unfolds in Europe and elsewhere. We see the situation in Berlin deteriorating daily. As honorable members know, the Russians are occupying one sector of Berlin, and they have banged, bolted and barred the door in  order  to prohibit the western powers sending food, and the other necessaries of  life  to the Germans in the western sector of the capital. The Russians hope that, hy this means, they will force Germany to accept the Communist philosophy. The Russia ns are standing "pat" in Berlin. They have refused to budge. Every possible effort has been made to induce them to come to agree to a <inline font-style="italic">modus vivendi</inline> with the western powers, whose purpose is quite pacific and entirely in harmony with the spirit of the age, which  seeks  the settlement of international .dis putes by an appeal to reason, right and the rule of law. But the .Russians stand there, and no one can shift them.  Realizing  however, that their attitude exposes them to a certain amount of odium, the Russians have notified the world' that they are prepared to evacuate Korea. Now, that is entirely in keeping -with the  technique of the Soviet, which masks its unalterable pur pose - the domination of the world - with specious disguises. Russia affects to stand out as the champion of liberty and of the oppressed, offering its services to the down-trodden in every land - thrusting those services upon them when they are a little hesitant about accepting the offer. I am sure that honorable members, and the people of this country, realize the relative significance of Korea and Berlin. While standing " pat " in Berlin, from which they cannot be driven, the  Russians  offer to evacuate Korea, from which they can be driven quite easily, because forces of sufficient strength are at hand to expel them. Should Russia evacuate Korea, it would not make any material difference in world affairs, or affect its control of that area. For although, in body, the Russians would leave, in spirit they would remain, for they have, as is their practice, established powerful Communist cells which would carry on their work, and obey their slightest wish. That is the technique of Russia throughout the world. So although according to the right honorable gentleman and .as we know ourselves, Russia is -not anxious to provoke a war, the whole world is apprehensive of war. Steps are being taken in every country to prepare for it. The Australian Government, like other governments, has a defence policy. lt has allocated approximately £6,000,000 for use on the guided weapons range and general defence research. In this, Australia is following the example of other countries. Britain and America have expended huge sums of money on research for the most effective weapons  and to assure that their defences will be strong enough .to repel, oi to : smash by anticipating them, the bombs, rockets or other missies that may be launched against them by an -enemy. </para>
                        <para class="block">We may be sure that Russia is sleeplessly labouring to strengthen her offensive and defensive armaments. If  I  were asked what it is that prevents Russia from setting out on its conquest of the world and brushing aside all resistance in Europe, I should say it is the fact that America has the atomic bomb, and that Russia has not. The key to the# present world situation is to be found in those few pregnant words. America has the atomic bomb, and Russia has not. If Russia had it, believe me, it would use it. Whether that be so or not, we must perfect our own defences so that we may be enabled to give a good account of ourselves if we are attacked or take part in any conflict that may be let loose upon the world. The Government has already done something by allocating £6,000,000 for the purposes to which I have referred, but that is not enough. Wars are fought by men disciplined, regimented and trained in the use of the weapons of their time. The Government recognizes this, and has set about the task of raising our forces to the level which would afford us a reasonable prospect of giving a good account of ourselves, but so far its efforts have fallen far short of success. Recently I asked the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chambers)</inline> a series of questions regarding the number of recruits for the Citizen Military Forces and the Australian Regular Army, [n his reply, the Minister stated that 3,313 recruits enlisted in the Citizen Military Forces throughout Australia in July of this year and that in August the number fell to 2,S07, while the number of recruit* to the Regular Army, which in July of this year was 1,631, fell to 923 in the following month. The Minister further said that at the 8th September last the estimated strength of the Citizen Military Forces and the Regular Army was 8,697 and 10,712 respectively. Those figures, which are most disturbing in themselves, are made doubly so by the Government's very modest target strength of 50,000 for the Citizen Military Forces and the 19,000 for theRegular Army. Those figures compare still more unfavorably with the strength of the armed forces of Australia in the months immediately preceeding the out- break of the 1939-45 war. At that time the Government of which I was a member, being seriously alarmed at the prospect of war, appointed me to conduct a campaign to raise our Militia Forces,, which then stood at the paper strength of 20,000, to 75,000. In approximately two months the campaign raised S5,000 voluntarily enlisted men. I ask the committee to compare that with the 8,000 men in the Citizen Military Forces to-day. In November, 1939, after war had broken out in Spetember, the then Minister for Defence was asked what was the strength of the militia forces at the time. He said it was between 55,000 and 65,000, after making allowance for the men in the militia forces who had enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for active service abroad. Wha is the explanation of this? At the outbreak of the last war there were 85,000 men in the militia forces; now there only 8,000. Are we to assume that that is due to a deterioration of the character of the people of. this country? I cannot say. The facts are that the response to the appeal to the citizens of Australia to defend then liberties has been paltry and shabby. </para>
                        <para>That brings me to a point that I desire to emphasize. I have always believed in compulsory military training. ] believe that the rights and privileges of citizenship carry with them the obligation that every citizen should fit himself to defend those rights and privileges. In 1901, speaking on the Defence Bill that was then before the Parliament, I proposed that every adult male in Australia from the age of eighteen to the age of 60 should undergo a period of training. After setting out the scheme in detail, I said that what I meant by " training " was that a man should perfect himself in everything that went to make an efficient soldier of that day. Compulsory military training was subsequently adopted by the Labour party on my motion and became a plank of its platform. In 1914, war having been declared and an election having taken place, that plank was one of the most vital in the platform, and every member of the party was bound to support it. As a matter of fact, we were returned to wage the war to a victorious conclusion. creating all other things as subsidiary to that objective. As honorable members probably remember, in 1917 the conscription issue divided this country. Compulsory training as a plank of its platform was scrapped by the Labour party and conscription was denounced by it for 25 years afterwards. In 1940 the then Prime Minister pledged himself and his party to oppose conscription in every form, yet in 1941 he introduced legislation, which was passed by r.he Parliament, under which military and industrial conscription became the law of the land, and remained so until the war ended. Once again compulsory military training in Australia, which was vital to the Labour party for so many years, was thrown aside. Recruitment for the Citizen forces and the regular army depended on voluntary enlistments. A most expensive and extensive recruiting campaign has been conducted. Use has Seen made of the press and radio stations. The advertisements that appeared and which set forth the opportunities for young men in the forces left nothing to be desired, but there has been a beggarly response. It is said in a newspaper jailed the <inline font-style="italic">Express,</inline> about which I know very little, that the Minister for the Army expressed the opinion that he was convinced that voluntary recruiting would never succeed in obtaining the required number of recruits. The Minister will inform the committee whether or not he said that, but the results confirm the opinion that the Minister is alleged to have expressed. Voluntary recruiting both for the Regular Army and the Citizen Military Forces has failed dismally. I have always believed in compulsory military training. I have worked as consistently as any man could to build up the defences of this country. I say that now, when war is looming on the distant horizon, the defences of Australia have sunk to a level that almost moves us to tears. We are bereft of any semblance of an effective defence force. What are we doing about it? War has come almost within hailing distance of our shores. It is raging in Indonesia and Malaya. There are revolts in those countries against the established governments. In Malaya, a campaign of murder and rapine has been raging for months. Planters have been brutally butchered and administrators in mines and other businesses have been shot. When the planters made an appeal for arms, and some were shipped in the Port of Sydney, the Communist-dominated Waterside Workers Federation banned the vessels on which they had been shipped. When, at long last, incensed publicopinion compelled the Government to do something, it sent arms by air. But not one word of censure was uttered by the Prime Minister against those who had banned the despatch of the arms by sea. I have said, and it has been said many times by others that governments ought to govern. This Government does nol govern. Its foreign policy like itf domestic policy is shaped by the Communists. As honorable members know. Malaya and Indonesia are bastions of Australia. They are strategic posts from which an attack can be launched against this country. As long as they continue under the control of friendly, strong governments we are, at any rate to some degree, cushioned against any swift and fateful attack. But there is war in both Malaya and Indonesia. The Communist press would have us believe the Malayans are fighting for freedom and the right to govern themselves in their own way. That is  a  right which Australian people freely concede them. But we must make it perfectly clear, that whilst conceding them the freedom to govern themselves in their own way and to provide for their own security, we demand the same rights for Australians. We demand the right to govern ourselves in our own way and to take such steps as we may deem necessary to ensure our security. Malaya is a British possession and Australia is an integral part of the British Empire. We are here by the grace of God and the power which that Empire has exercised on our behalf. We have done something. on our part, to help the Empire. The other day a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burns</inline> in Queensland, when asked what would be his attitude in the event of war with Russia, said that the Communists would fight on the side of Russia. The secretary of the Australian Communist party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dixon,</inline> who had a night to think over </para>
                        <para class="block">
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burns's</inline>

                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burns's</inline>
                            view did not represent the con- sidered view of the Communist party, and that Communists would fight against any power which sought to. enslave the Australian people. Of course, as the Communists hold that the mission of Russia is not to enslave people but to liberate them, we may take it for granted that in any war those enemies within our gates would fight on the side of Russia. These traitors in our midst no longer skulk in the shadows or behind rocks, but are enthroned on the seats of the nighty. They rule with an iron hand the great industrial organizations of this country on which the production of." coal, steel, transport, and the ordered life of. the community lbsolutely depend.. The Labour party is at present taking steps to purge itself of Communists, but, it is quite powerless to do so because the Comnunists are in control of the industrial wing of the Labour movement, and that wing in its turn controls the political wing. I do not wish to labour this ques- tion further,but I say that if war comes so Australia, or threatens it, we must show by our actions- that we intend to lefend ourselves.. Such action on our part might well turn the aggressor away. But what is our position? Australia is amongst the most vulnerable of countries: It is a white island in a yellow sea. It has a vast extent of territory and 12,000 miles of coastline. It. has8,000 soldiers, or, counting the Regular. Army, 18,000 soldiers. If we were to station one man in every mile of our coastline, the total number of troops would not go round. What are we going to do? War threatens in Europe, and it is actually raging in Malaya and Indonesia. As I said in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, Australia has one enemy and one alone, and that enemy is communism. Russia is communist. The war in Malaya is inspired by, is financed by, and. is fanned by Russia. The same statement applies to the war in Indonesia, the war in Greece and the war in Palestine.

If there is to be war if this country, is to be attacked, let us at least take the precautions that prudence and common sense dictate, and rid ourselves of the traitors within our gates. Drive them out. Drive them under ground ? What can they do underground that they cannot do now? Nothing! They are everywhere, and on every hand. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> told this House about an individual employed in the Post Office who has a reputation as dark as the devils out of hell. There he is, working in the Post Office, marshalling the clans so that wher the day comes, or when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dixon</inline> says it has come, the telephone services will stop. Power lines will go out of action and the trams will stop. What a great day that will be! Sonow, while we yet have time and are masters in our own household, let us at least decide that we will not be stabbed in the back by the enemies within our own gates - those traitors who are plotting our downfall. Drive them out; underground or any where else. </para>

                        <para>I propose now. to address my remarks to some mathematical and financial aspects of the budget. The budget papers are, of course, presented for the purpose of revealing to the Parliament, and to the people, the intentions of the Government in its handling of the business affairs of the. nation, and, incidentally, of the financial affairs of private individuals. Upon a knowledgeable and close examination this budget quickly becomes revealed as a very extraordinary document.. It envisages an expenditure of more- than £500,000,000 and the collection, almost entirely by the means of, taxation, of an exactly identical amount., Upon perusing the items upon which expenditure if intended, one would be compelled to agree that most of them, at least taking them at their heading value, are inescapable </para>
                        <para class="block">Those- items' include- payments for- social services, payments to the States, expenditure to maintain our defence forces: and repatriation, responsibilities} and essential capital expenditure- for the development of Australia. A. study of the categories rf the items- of- expenditure proposed would indicate, that there is no scope for pruning,, but the total amount that the Government intends to collect is exactly the amount required to meet those items of expenditure. How did the Prime Minister and Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> and. his advisers arrive at the calculations which produced those figures of anticipated, returns from taxation ? Naturally, they could only have been arrived at by estimating the income expected by individuals and companies, by estimating the anticipated imports to this country and the consumption of goods subject to excise *nd other duties. The advisers of the Treasurer must have carefully calculated the anticipated expenditure, and said, " This- is what we expect to collect and this is how we propose to expend the- money ". The calculated income of. individuals- and: companies in this country is determined, by. the export' income of the nation more than: by any other single factor. So, we have a budget which, is constructed, around the anticipated income from. wool, selling, at. 40d., 50d., or 90d. per lb., and. from wheat, jelling at 12s., 18s. or 18s. 6d. a bushel.. Vs these figures are expressed in. terms of Australian, currency, it becomes obvious at: the slightest glance, that if the prices of wool, wheat, meat, fruit and sugar on the export markets fall sub.stantially the whole- structure of the budget will be immediately wrecked. Is- the Government absolutely sure- that we shall *jo through next year without experiencing a; fall in the prices of our export products?. If members of the Government are confident- of that they comprise the most optimistic group of people in the. world. If, however, they have some, doubts whether this great national income will be sustained at that level, then theTreasurer knows that his budget estimates may well not be realized. The Treasurer knows, perfectly well that this income,, which has its- genesis in our export sales and becomes taxable in hand after hand, is in currency which is.- depreciated  2.5'  per cent, below sterling Within the- last few weeks- our sister dominion, New Zealand, which, took concurrent and identical action with Australia in. depreciating its' currency, hat brought its currency to parity- with sterling. No one will doubt that if. during next, year, there is an appreciation of Australian currency and, to thai degree, a diminution in the figures of our national income, this budget will be completely wrecked. Taken at its face- valuethe budget is an utterly reckless document. It is reckless to propose items of expenditure each one of which is dependent upon the maintenance of our existing scale of export income. For my part <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> do not believe that the Treasurer has based his calculations upon that expectation. That brings me to the real nub of the. matter. If. the right honorable gentleman has not been so callously negligent as to prepare and present to this Parliament a budget which is utterly dependent on the maintenance of present export values,, upon, what then does he rely'* The whole history of the Chifley administration of the Treasury shows that the right honorable gentleman is relying on secret reserves, and that this budget- cannot be taken at its face value. The budge is. a faked document, as were- previous budgets presented, from, the same sourceThe Government's accounts are faked hee cause income- tax is- not. being- collected. I have been the recipient of copies of resolutions passed, at meetings- of various branches- of the Australian. Country party complaining that many members cannot get assessments of income tax, not for, last, year only, but for the previous three, years. Is the Chifley administration of the Treasury se inept, that the- Taxation Branch delays; the issue, of assessments for three or four years?. I do not believe that it is. It is a, part of the- policy of the Treasurer not to collect income tai because uncollected, tax represents one- of the- secret reserves upon, which, he relies to juggle his accounts: So, I do. not take this budget at its face value. It has been demonstrated year after year that the budgets presented by the Treasurer have not reflected the true accounting position. Just as the budgets have been faked in their preparation, so the treasury, boob have  been faked in their ultimate accounting. At the end of the financial year r.here is invariably brought into the Parliament some bill designed to " cook " the hooks. In 1947, on the eve of the close of the financial year, the Treasurer produced overnight a proposal to make a rift of £25,000,000 to the United Kingdom. On the same day as that proposal  was  announced the right honorable gentleman informed us that defence expenditure totalling £18,000,000, which the budget proposed should be met from loan, was to be met from revenue. In that way £43,000,000 was written out of the books almost overnight. If that had not been done, the financial figures for 1946-47 would have shown that the Treasurer had collected from the people almost £50,000,000 more than he needed to meet his commitments. That is the way in which the Treasurer has " cooked " the books.  His  action was like that of a storekeeper who " fixes " his books .by writing down the value of his stock or by failing to send out accounts. Last year exactly the same thing was done. During the closing period of the financial year a proposal was introduced to the Parliament for the provision of funds for supplementary estimates amounting to £30,000,000 when it was obviously physically impossible to expend the money. This was done solely for the purpose of writing £30,000,000 out of the books. According to the figures furnished by the Treasurer the Government closed the books at the end of the last financial year with a surplus of £1,400,000; but if that faking had not been perpetrated the accounts would have disclosed a surplus of approximately £32.000,000. Because this is a part of the planned technique of the Treasurer, I mistrust the whole of the figures contained in the voluminous document now before us. My mistrust of them is substantiated by the experiences of the past. I am not prepared to accept the right honorable gentleman's figures at their face value. What does £30,000,000 or £50,000,000 mean to him? He is so little concerned about millions of pounds that they just flutter around like nobody's business; but pounds do not flutter around the wage-earners of this country like nobody's business. The great thing that concerns the majority of the people at this time of the year is the income tax they will becalled upon to pay. Let us look at thefigures relating to income tax to ascertain, whether this document represents a truebill of the finances of the nation. Thanks to the Treasurer we have been provided with a document showing the amounts of income tax to be paid by -people on various scales of income during the present year, and in order thai honorable members shall not fail to realize the generosity of the right honorable gentleman, we have also been provided with tables showing the comparative tax levied last year and the highest tax imposed during the war years. A wage-earner with a wife and two children may now receive an income of £300 a year and pay no tax at all. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> wage-earner similarly circumstanced in receipt of an income of £350 a year will be called upon to pay in income tax only £3 15s. a year. That all sounds very good ; but these figures are deceptive. The family man is concerned not only with what he has to pay in income tax  but  also with what may be extracted by the Treasurer from his pay envelope. A close examination of the budget reveals that although there have been progressive reductions of income tax there has been a progressive increase in total income tax collection on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis. The <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> collections of direct taxation anticipated in this budget - and of course they will be greater than the estimate - will be approximately 25s. higher than the tax collected two years ago. So, even in respect of direct taxation there is not much consolation in this budget. Direct taxation, however, is the impost most apparent to the uninitiated. Like the conjurer who focuses our attention on the coloured ball in one hand while he secretly performs his manipulative work with the other hand, the Treasurer seeks to focus the attention of the people on income tax reductions, hoping that they will -not see how he is fleecing them by way of indirect taxes. That is the practice adopted by the Treasurer. An examination of the budget reveals that the estimated collections of indirect taxes, including customs and excise duties, primage and sales tax, amount to £19 12s. 8£d. for every man,  -woman and child in the whole of Australia. So the fellow on £6 a week who congratulates himself on having no income tax to pay is not expected to realize^ that he has to pay, according to these figures, £19 12s. 8$d. in indirect taxes. The pay-roll tax is a further form of indirect tax. It is nothing but an indirect tax. It is included in the calculations of every employer as a component of his total employment cost and is passed on to the total cost of his product or service. The pay-roll tax works out at an average of £2 6s. 2 1/2d. for every man, woman and child in the community. The two figures combined show that every person will be paying on an average £21 38s. lid. this year. But the person who buys clothing, furniture or other goods does not pay sales tax, excise duty or customs duty directly. They are incorporated in the cost of the goods that he buys. Those taxes are not merely incorporated in the cost of the goods. Sales tax, excise duty and customs duty become a component of the wholesale cost, and the retailer does not merely add his profit to the manufactured or production cost of the article he sells. He inevitably adds his profit write-up to the production cost plus the added tax costs, except when the Prices Commissioner has been able to prevent his doing so. And prices control has been given away prematurely by the Government. So the Parliament no longer has that control. The retailer adds his profit to the sales tax, customs duty, excise duty and pay-roll tax, and to the £21 18s. lid., which is the average <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> indirect tax levied in Australia under this budget, must be added the average retailer's write-up, which, I am told, is 33^ per cent. Therefore £7 6s. 4d. a head a year must be added, and, although the Government does not get that money, it is a burden placed on the consumer as a direct result of the Government's policy. That brings the total <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> liability under this budget on these calculations to £29 5s. 3d. a year. But the tax-gatherer has not finished with the consumer who, because he goes to the pictures, the football and, sometimes, the races, has to pay entertainment tax. Every man, woman and child is charged an average of 13 s. 4-Jd.  a  year in entertainments  tax.  That brings his total obligation te £29 18s. 7Jd. a year. Bur. the Government, of course, recognizes that we do not all travel as individuals. This community is made up of married people and families. The table issued by the Government shows what a married man with two children will be required to pay in direct income tax; but he will pay. when he buys furniture, blankets, food or whatever he buys, the total of £29 18s. 7£d. multiplied by the four members of his family, which means that, under this " generous " budget, that taxpayer, out of his £300 a year, will have to pay £119 14s. 5d. in indirect taxes. He will pay it painlessly because he will not know that he is paying it. That is not the end of it. </para>

                                <para>-  I am not trying to make out that it is new. But it is involved in the budget. It is of no use to try to delude the people into thinking because a document like this is pushed on to them that a man on £6 a week with two children will not pay any tax. I am removing the misleading intention of the document by pointing out the actual tax burden that he will have to bear. But that is not the end of it, either, because the Government imposed an extraordinarily high sales tax on building material for years, and that became a part of the capital cost of thousands upon thousands of homes in Australia. Many people on lower incomes are paying from 5s. to 10s. a week more rent than they should have to pay because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley's</inline> budgets have imposed sales tax of up to 25 per cent, upon building materials and, to that degree, added in perpetuity to the capital cost of homes. </para>

                                <para>- But substantially. Chat is not the point. If income tax is lowered, the people will derive immediate benefit, but once the cost of a home is loaded with sales tax one. can never escape it until one builds another home from materials free from sales tax. It is of no use to try to pull any one's leg  by  seeking to prove anything to the con-  ru ry. So it is clear that the budget, which is designed to be attractive to people on lower incomes is revealed upon close and knowledgeable examination to be imposing on people a burden practically as heavy as they have ever carried. The Government knows that we are in a phase in which it can be expected that prices -Will continue to rise for at least tome time. It relies in the circumstances on getting a substantial part of its revenue from goods that will carry a higher tax burden. If prices continue to increase, . men on wages will have to contemplate paying higher taxes for the remainder of the year. If there ever was a budget that showed fundamental disregard of the workers on low wages of this country, it is this budget. There is  no  explaining away or suppressing of these figures. </para>

                        <para>That is, of course, not the full attack that the budget makes upon people on lower incomes, because some subsidies are to be abolished. In his budget speech, the Treasurer produced figures showing that for the current year there is an anticipated reduction of tax collections of £20,000,000. But it is ako shown that the abolition of subsidies will save the Government £26,000,000. So the Treasurer <inline font-style="italic">has</inline> the effrontery to bring before the Parliament a budget on which he will show a profit of more than £6,000.000 in the abolition of subsidies notwithstanding .the reduction of taxes. The budget, in fact, is an attack upon the earners .of lower incomes in <inline font-style="italic">thin</inline> country. .The .subsidies were designed to keep. as low as possible the cost of living and the cost of consumer .goods. They were consumer subsidies, although in country areas it was pretended that they were producer subsidies. We all know that they were, in truth, consumer subsidies. If there is one thing that the Government .has claimed credit for, it is its anti-inflationary policy. It is entitled to a good deal of credit for that policy. But most of its anti-inflationary policy, which was based on the control of prices, was provided for in the <inline font-style="italic">War Book</inline> of 'the Lyons Government. The policy was put into effect by the Menzies Government and carried out in turn by the Curtin and Chifley Governments. That was the origin of prices control. So the Government has no right to claim credit for that major aspect of the .anti-inflationary policy. In due course it injected consumer subsidies into the system. The only justification for that procedure was to keep down the cost of living and the cost of production. </para>

                                <para>- No. I said that it was injected into the system. The Government claims credit for that and has said that it wanted to .go further and make the anti-inflationary policy a permanent feature of our life. So it produced the prices referendum. The only justification that could be claimed for authorizing the Australian Parliament permanently to control prices would be to give to the Parliament the power to control the cost of living and the cost of production. We on this side did not think that that was the real motive of the referendum. We said so. We were sure that the real motive was to further the ultimate socialist objectives of the Labour party. We said so. But if the genuine intention of the Government in endeavouring to keep the power over prices was to keep down the cost of living and the cost of production, why did <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> abolish  subsidies ? Nothing could be more  important  in the control of the cost of living than subsidies. It is of no use to say that the Government is powerless -.to continue subsidies, because= some of them are continued in the budget. The truth is; of course, that the unscrupulous methods of Government propaganda in the referendum led the Prime Minister to issue the threat to abolish subsidies. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, blackmail. He said, in effect, " If you do not vote for our referendum proposals you will lose the subsidies ". The result of the referendum is history. What the people did to the referendum proposals is nobody's business, and the Prime Minister was caught in the mesh of his own threatening words. As he could not allow himself to be made out to be an absolute liar, he had to provide in his budget for the abolition of subsidies. If it were constitutionally necessary to abolish subsidies, why were they not all abolished? The fact that some subsidies have been retained, proves that the Government was under no constitutional obligation to discontinue any of them. The increased cost of blankets, milk, &amp;c, will fall upon the workers as the direct result of a political threat issued by the Prime Minister: during the referendum campaign. When we add the burden of indirect taxation to the increased, burden which the workers will have to bear because of the withdrawal of subsidies, it becomes evident that this budget deals a heavier blow to the purchasing power of the workers than was dealt by any other budget since federation. I should like to hear some one try to prove a contrary contention. </para>

                        </continue><para>The Treasurer referred in his budget speech to the dollar shortage. Speaking on this subject six months ago, I said that, unless we were prepared to believe that the volume of our trade with dollar areas was to remain static, we should regard the present acute dollar shortage as merely a passing phase. If a man encounters a financial crisis in his- business affairs, he can, if his business is sound, overcome his difficulties by borrowing. Australia should meet the present dollar crisis in the same way. Instead of doing this, however, the Government is penalizing the community, depressing living standards, retarding production and restricting transport by its pig-headed refusal to accept, a dollar loan. It has even carried- its obstinacy to the- point of exercising' its. authority to prevent private persons and companies from bor' rowing in order to finance constructive enterprises. If, in return for  what  they gave away at international trad*conferences in Geneva and elsewhere. Australia's representatives did  not expecthat  we should ultimately be able to sell more in dollar areas, and be in a position to liquidate a dollar loan if one were raised, then Australia was, indeed, " sold down the river ". If, however, we shall be able, as the result of international trade agreements, to increase our trade with dollar areas, there can be no reason  why  we should not seek relief from the  present  emergency by raising a dollar loan. 1 voiced that opinion in this House  six  months ago; and I am still of the sam» opinion. I offered my suggestion as a layman, and I am gratified to observe that it has  been  taken up and supported by those who are better qualified technically than I am to express an opinion on the subject: </para></speech>

                            <para>. - Members of the Opposition have used strange and conflicting terms to describe the  presenbudget.  In my opinion, it is a sound budget - so sound, indeed, that members of the Opposition have become " rattled ". and have been unable to attack it effectively. The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> declared to-night thai it was a faked budget, and the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> described it as an ultra conservative document. On the other hand, the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McBride),</inline> who is managing director of Elder, Smith and Company Limited, one of the largest wool-broking firms in Australia, and, I believe, one of the best, said that this was very much thu kind of budget which his own party would have produced if it had been in power. As a matter of fact, I believe thai the Opposition's real objection to the budget is that it is too good. They have declared that it is an election budget I hope that it will be possible to bring down some more budgets of the same kind. Not only does it provide for substantial reductions of income tax to the most- deserving sections of the community. but it also provides increased social benefits for the poor and the sick. The Government has, in the words of the Scriptures, given " here a little, there a little ". When we recall the difficult times through which Australia has passed, when we observe the turmoil that exists in many countries, and when we see the poverty and insecurity with which other people have to contend, we should be thankful that the Commonwealth has had a Treasurer who, during and since the war, has been able to bring down a succession of budgets providing for the continued financial stability of the nation. In this budget, he has provided for present needs and for future contingencies.  He has put aside an amount of £23,400,000 with which to pay war gratuities which may fall due at a time when prices for wool, wheat and meat may be lower, and our overseas balances may be reduced. It would be very awkward for some future Treasurer, in such circumstances, to be called upon to find £70,000,000 for the payment of war gratuities. Very properly, the Treasurer, now that the national income is high and our finances are buoyant, has made provision to meet future obligations. He could have taken the easy political way. He could have framed a popular budget designed to catch votes at the next election, but, instead of doing that, he has provided for the future as well as for the present. That method of finance is completely sound, and is indicative of the whole financial policy which the Treasurer has followed since he took office. </para>

                                <para>- I shall explain the position. The Government announced that if the referendum were defeated, it would endeavour to continue the payment of subsidies on <inline font-style="italic">goods</inline> when it waiadministratively possible for it to do so. That promise has been honoured. For example, tea is imported in hulk consignments, and the cost of putting it intopackets is so small that the Government was able to say that it was administratively possible to continue the subsidy on that commodity. A similar position existed with butter. Because of the organization of the Commonwealth butter scheme and the co-operation of all butter factories, it has been administratively possible for the Government te continue the butter subsidy. The Government has also endeavoured to overcomethe difficulty of continuing the  paymenof  the subsidy on superphosphate. The ^system of paying the subsidy to various manufacturers, which operated in war time, will be discontinued,,, but in order to honour its promise to 'the best of its ability, the Government will pay the former subsidy direct to primary producers. For the reasons which I have given, I contend that the Government has honoured the promises which it made to the people during the referendum campaign. </para>

                        <para>I shall now examine the statement by cbe honorable member for Indi that Australia should borrow abroad in order to meet its dollar deficits. Australia was placed in a most difficult position during the financial and economic depression in the early 1930's because of its inability to meet interest payments on overseas debts. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang),</inline> who was Premier of New South Wales at that time, was dismissed from office because the State Government would not pay interest on its overseas commitments until the people enjoyed certain conditions. The obligation to meet interest . payments on overseas debts threw Australia into the depths of the economic depression. The honorable member for Indi  advocates a return to the policy of borrow, boom and burst. The Bruce-Page Government borrowed heavily from the financiers in  Threadneedle-street,  London, until <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer said that Australia's capacity to pay interest on oversea loans had been exhausted, and that British financiers were no longer prepared to make additional loans to this country. What happened then? The Bruce-Page Government proceeded to raise loans in New York at 5 per cent. When no more money was available at that rate, they mortgaged this country at 6 per cent, and finally at 7 per cent. </para>

                        <para>Hr. LEMMON.- The honorable member for Richmond, who is a primary producer, should know that the interest rate on promissory notes in respect of farm machinery used to be 16 per cent. The Mortgage Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank now provides financial accommodation for farmers at 4 per cent., whereas before World War II. they were obliged to pay 16 per cent. That reduction annoys honorable members opposite. Another fact, which they should not forget, is that when the worker paid interest at the rate of 7 per cent, on a housing loan, the basic wage was approximately £4 a week. Today, the price of houses has risen, but the interest rate on the loan is 4 per cent., or even in some instances 3§ per cent., whilst the basic wage has been increased by nearly 50 per cent. The average worker has a much better chance of becoming a home owner st the present time than he had before The last war, when some of the honorable members opposite occupied the treasury bench. </para>

Honorable members opposite endeavoured to show that during last year less meat was exported to the United Kingdom from Australia than in previous years. The only meat in respect of which they were prepared to quote figures was fresh meat. They completely ignored the great increases of exports of bacon, processed meats and tinned meats. Our exports of tinned meats amounted to  12,200,000  lb. in  1938-39,  and to 96,500,000 lb.in  1947-48.  In  1938-39  we reported  1,700,000  lb. of bacon and ham, and in  1947-48  we exported  5,500,000  lb. Honorable members opposite completely ignored those commodities and referred only to fresh meat. They gave no credit to the manufacturers who processed those quantities of meat and, in effect, saved them. Pro- cessed meat is usually second-class meat that is not suitable for freezing and export to the United Kingdom. Our manufacturers converted it into tinned meat and increased their exports to the people of the United Kingdom from  12,200,000  lb. to  96,500,000  lb. During the last twelve months there has, in fact, been a considerable increase of the amount of meat and dairy products exported to the United Kingdom. </para>
                        <para>This budget, which is a sound one, shows the foresight of the Prime Minister. [ hope that the right honorable gentleman will he able to introduce many more similar budgets, because he has shown that he is able to steer the ship of state away from both depression and serious inflation. </para>

The pre cedent was established in  1909,  when permission was given to insert tabulatec figures in a budget speech withoutreading them. On that occasion 'the permission was challenged, and a warning was voice that the practice could be abused. It was subsequently agreed that such permission could only be given by unanimous approval of the House, and that one dissentient could prevent it. The practice wasnever intended to apply to any matter that could not be read. The insertion of graphs and maps has been allowed on three occasions only, and refused several times. As late  as  March,  1946, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> declined to ask the permission of honorable  mem  bers to insert a map, the request to doso having been made by an honorable  mem  ber who was then addressing the House There is no precedent for the reproduction of a flag or a photograph of any kino jn the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> If that were allowed it would be contrary to all par liamentary practice and would be an abuse of the proper function of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> which is the recording of the speeches delivered in the Parliament. </para>

There is no control over the use of paperexcept for the production of daily, Sunday and weekly newspapers and no record is kept by the Department of Trade and Customs of publications not in the category of newspapers. There are five Communist newspapers at present being produced in Australia with an annual usage of under 200 tonsof paper. All of those are circulated within the Commonwealth and there would be noobstacle as far as controls in Australia are concerned to their being circulated outside Australia also The number of Communist publications printed outside Australia and circulated within the Commonwealth is not known. In this con nexion the Minister has advised that mam periodicals from non-sterling areas imported on individual subscriptions, and all publica tions from sterling areas, are exempt from import licensing, and in any case they are not examined by the Department of Trade and Customs to determine their political affiliations 2.

                        <para>Information on the cost of dollars, sterling and other currencies is not available  in  the form requested. However, production of petroleum products from Britain-controlled sources is not sufficient so meet sterling area consumption and the sterling area as a whole is a net importer of dollar petroleum products. For this reason all petroleum imports into Australia must be regarded as involving a dollar- commitment, irrespective of the source of supply. If Australia increases its purchases of sterling petroleum products the quantity available for purchase by other sterling area countries is correspondingly reduced and they necessarily have to obtain a greater proportion of their requirements from dollar sources. Be- causeof this position no attempt is made to divert Australian imports of petroleum products from dollar to sterling sources and, in practice, the proportions imported from the various sources of supply are governed largely by tanker availability and the shorthaul principle. The following table sets but the f.o.b. value in Australian currency of the petroleum products imported into Australia during 1947-48 from countries included in the various monetary areas. The table cannot, however, be taken as indicating the actual currencies in which payment was ultimately made: - </para>

                <para>Apart from the f.o.b. cost, substantial freight costs were also incurred and, because of the shortage of sterling tankers, a proportion of these freight charges had to be met in dollars. </para>
