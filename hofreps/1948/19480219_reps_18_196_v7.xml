                        <para>-Has the Prime Minister seen a report of the conviction in the Special Federal Court, Sydney,of a youth for a patrol coupon racket by means of which he obtained tickets for 50,000 gallons of petrol a month? Is he aware that a police witness said that the youth obtained the tickets merely by filling in a form and that he had not been asked to produceany certificate of registration of trucks or other motor vehicles? Will the Prime Minister state the reason for this apparent laxity on the part of official's in failing to demand proof of bona fides when issuing petrol coupons? What action is contemplated to ensure against a repetition of such illegal practices? </para>

                        <para>-I did see that a youth of nineteen was convicted of a charge relating to petrol tickets. I did not read all the details mentioned by the honorable member of how he acquired the tickets. I said in the last sessional period that we were not satisfied with the policing of the distribution of petrol tickets and that the system was being examined right through from the Note Issue Department of the Commonwealth Bank, which prints the tickets, through the distributing officers and then, to the oil companies, which collect the tickets from the petrol resellers. I believe that I also stated that I had asked the Auditor-General to have an examination made of the whole matter. All those things have been done. I do not know anything about this case, but I will obtain particulars for the honorable member. We are satisfied, however, that the checking of tickets from the Note Issue Department is complete. I understand that there was a question whether forged registration certificates were being tendered and whether there was a complete check of applications for petrol coupons. That aspect has been investigated. I will have a short report prepared for the honorable member.He may rest assured that nothing has been left undone that ought to be done. The services of the Commonwealth Investigation Service and the police departments in the States have been enlisted to ensurea tightening up of the policing of petrol rationing. </para>

                        <para>- Has the Minister for Repatriation seen a recent statement in a Brisbane newspaper that an exservicemansuffering from malaria was given a prescription for atebrin and quinine tab lets? He was surprised to learn that two chemists in the suburb in which he resided refused to make up the prescription because they would have to wait too long for payment from the Repatriation Department. To prevent a recurrence of refusals by chemists to make up prescriptions for ex-servicemen, will the Minister expedite payment to the chemists in order that patients suffering from malaria may have their prescriptions made up without delay? </para>

                        <para>- No complaintshave been made to me and I have not read in the press any reports relating to this matter. However, I shall obtain a report from Queensland on the subject of the alleged delay in the department making payments for prescriptions, and ascertain whether any delay is occurring. Obviously, when thousands of prescriptions are dispensed by chemists, it is difficult for the Repatriation Department to keep the position completely watertight regarding payments. I have not heardof any delays, and I do not think that any inordinate delays in making payments have occurred. However, I shall inquire into the matter, find inform the honorable member of the result. </para>

                        <para>- The rapid increase of rabbits and hares in Victoria has created a real menace to production. In the Wimmera electorate, one has only to trave by motor car at night to see hundreds of rabbits and scores of hares. The increase has no doubt been brought about by the shortage of wire netting, rabbit traps and fumigating material, and the inability of producers to obtain supplies of cartridges. Of course, the destruction of rabbits has not been assisted by the levy of1s. 6d. per lb. on skins. </para>

                            <para>- I have said that it is due to the inability of private enterprise to recruit sufficient labour for  the manufacture of wire netting and fencing wire that a desperate shortage of these materials does exist in Australia. If the honorable member suggests that the Australian Government should commence manufacturing wire netting and fencing wire and recruit the labour required for this purpose, I shall be prepared to consider his proposal. All honorable members realize that these materials are in short supply, but every possible action is being taken to overcome the scarcity. The honorable member will also be aware that my very active colleague, the Minister for Immigration, is working day and night in an endeavour to ensure that every available ship that we can obtain from the people who own them shall come to these shores laden with migrants who will be willing to engage in our heavy industries and produce our requirements. Further, I direct the attention of the honorable member to the fact that the problem of keeping down vermin in Victoria is the responsibility of the State Government, and the honorable gentleman should also make representations on the subject in that quarter. Ammunition, too, is scarce for the same reason that wire netting and fencing wire are scarce. Again, I admit, that the production' of this commodity is in the hands of a very efficient private enterprise in this country, but, until production difficulties can be overcome, with the assistance of the Minister for Immigration, the improvement will be rather slow.

                            <para>- I have sent circular letters to nearly every member of this Parliament on many occasions explaining that the levy on rabbit skins was imposed by the Menzies Government with the support of the Opposition of the day. So, if there is any blame attaching to this action, we are all blameworthy in some measure. The purpose of the levy was to ensure that the felt hats required by our military forces and by the civilian population would be available at a price in keeping with Australia's internal economy. The rabbit skin levy does not have any material effect on the activities of those who carry out rabbit destruction in this country because the high prices ruling overseas for rabbit skins provide ample incentive for this work. Last year, rabbit skins exported to the United States of America and other dollar areas realized 6,000,000 dollars. In fact, it is claimed that rabbit trapping is so remunerative that trappers will not destroy does found in the traps because they want to ensure an increase of the rabbit population so that their livelihood may continue. </para>

                    <para>- To ensure that growers of oats in Australia this season shall receive the full benefit, if they so desire, of the high prices ruling overseas, the Government has established a voluntary oat pool. Growers who deliver oats to the pool are guaranteed 3s. 6d. a bushel on trucks at railway sidings. That payment will be in the nature of a guaranteed price and a first advance. The Barley Board, which will receive the oats into the pool, will have the sole right to export the oats. In addition, it will be entitled to sell oats for consumption in this country. The operations of the pool will ensure an equalization of returns to growers who deliver to the pool. That is to say, if the Bailey Board receives 10,000,000 bushels of oats this season and exports 5,00.0,000 at 10s. a bushel and sells 5,000,000 in this country at 5s. a bushel, the equalized price to the oat-grower will be 7s, 6d. a bushel less the cost of administration, which is estimated at10d. a bushel. Those who do not deliver to the pool, of course, can sell their oats only within Australia. They will receive only the price paid to them initially by the purchasers. The pool will be effective in every State, including Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that it is not possible to announce a date for the assembling of the conference to drawup the Japanese peace treaty. A deadlock has been reached in regard to this matter. I believe that the Soviet Government takes the view that the treaty should be dealt with in the first place by the foreign ministers of the four major powers. Of course, that is not acceptable to Australia, and I believe that it is not acceptable to a number of other nations. It is generally considered that all those nations which participated in the war against Japan in the Pacific area should take part in the peace conference. Every endeavour has been made to overcome the present deadlock, but I cannot say whether the suggestions that have been made are acceptable or not. The answer to the honorable member is that the deadlock occurred because of a difference of opinion regarding the composition of the body to deal with the treaty. At present I can give no indication of the date when the treaty will he considered. </para>

It is true that there is a general shortage of steel throughout Australia, and that control over steel supplies is exercised by the Commonwealth As far as I am aware, each State is provided with an allocation and it is then the responsibility of each State government to distribute its quota amongst the different industries. Until such time as the production of steel increases considerably the shortage will continue. I shall make further inquiries, and if I obtain any additional information I shall convey it to the honorable member. </para>

                            <para>- I have not seen the latter statement attributed to Mr. Roach. However, a most reputable person did bring to my notice a statement made by Mr. Roach some time ago, in the course of which he was reported to have said that the ban on Dutch shipping, which had been imposed with the concurrence of federal unions within the Australian Council of Trades Unions, could not be lifted until the decision of that body had been reversed. The copy of the statement which Mr. Roach was said to have made did not contain any reference to the union with which Mr. Roach is connected. Endeavours have been made by the Government to have the ban on the transportation to the Netherlands East Indies of civilian goods, as opposed to arms, lifted., and it was hoped that the establishment of the Committee of Good Offices, whose members are now reporting to the Security Council, would result in the ban being lifted. The Government has never acquiesced in the imposition of a ban on the transportation of civilian goods to Java. </para>

                            <para>- I do all I can. For instance, when it was reported recently that a ban was to be placed on the resumption of shipping between Holland and Australia by a Dutch line, I made certain representations and issued a a public statement, as the result of which it was decided not to impose the threatened ban. The resumption of shipping between Holland and Australia is something which affects this country more than the carriage of goods to Indonesia. We all hope that a peaceful settlement of the dispute in the Netherlands East Indies will be reached, and that normal trade relations will be resumed between our two countries. </para>

                        <para>- Publication of reports of the proceedings at. the recent conference between the Minister for Commerce and. Agriculture, State Ministers of Agriculture and wheat-growers' organizations concerning the adoption of a stabilization scheme for wheat has led to agreat deal of criticism of the Government. Of course, the rumour that negotiations had broken down completely was denied by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in the House yesterday. Can the Minister now inform the House whether the " stumbling block " encountered in the negotiations was the matter of a guaranteed price, the home consumption price or the suggested extension of time of operation of the scheme to inelude the 1953 season's crop? Has any period been fixed for State Governments and wheat-growers' organizations to reconsider the matter before informing the Minister of their final decision? </para>

                        <para>- To furnish a complete answer to. the honorable member's question would necessitate my making a speech, which I do not propose to do. The discussions referred to by the honorable member took place at a special con ference held after the termination of the recent meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council, and was the outcome of a decision reached at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, held in August last. At the latter conference it was decided that Commonwealth and State Ministers should meet later in Canberra to explore the possibilities of evolving a satisfactory stabilization scheme, and it was also decided then that representatives of wheat-growers' organizations should be invited to hold a simultaneous meeting in Canberra, so that they could submit proposals in writing to the special conference of Ministers. The Wheat Growers Federation met simultaneously with the conference of Ministers and submitted its proposals, which were then considered. The conference then indicated its decision upon the proposals and, after considering them, the federation intimated whether it accepted or rejected them. </para>
                  
                    <para>After some discussion, I indicated the decisions of the Australian Government on most of the stabilization proposals, pointing out that there was no deviation from those announced when the increased price was published. I undertook to take to Cabinet a recommendation that the period of the plan should be extended by one year and a proposal that a responsible committee should be appointed to consider means of making payments to those who sold their properties before any stabilization plan was finally wound up, if one was inaugurated. </para>
                    <para>It was never envisaged that the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers would be able immediately to determine a mutually acceptable wheat stabilization plan. The State Ministers for Agriculture go back to their own cabinets, report what they are told by the Commonwealth Minister for Agriculture about how far the Federal Government is prepared to go, decide what further recommendations shall be made to the Australian Cabinet, and so on. Then the State Governments are in a position to inform the Australian Government whether they, in turn, are prepared to introduce the complementary legislation that is essential to the continuation of a stabilization scheme. </para>
                    <para>As to the time element, it has been conveyed clearly to the State Governments that if stabilization is to be accomplished, they must pass the necessary legislation in time for the plan to operate in respect of the new crop in November of this year. I am awaiting further information from them. </para>

                            <para>- That question requires a lengthy answer. As to the first part, in some cases, income tax does apply. Aborigines living under civilized conditions are ordinary citizens, and, therefore, the normal income tax laws apply to them. As to the second part of the question, in some cases social benefits are paid. I do not want to take up the time of the House now, and I shall arrange for a full reply to be given to the honorable member later.</para>

                        <para>- As I explained some months ago, considerably in excess of 400,000 persons are registered at Australia House to come to Australia, and 211,000 are included in applications filed in Australia House. About 90,000 have relatives and friends in Australia who are prepared to arrange accommodation for them in their own homes. The employment aspect does not present any difficulty, because this country is in the extraordinary position of having a depression in reverse. We have more ; jobs available to-day than we have people to fill them. Possibly, we could fill 200,000 jobs if we could only transport that number of additional people to these shores. The Lord Mayor of Melbourne has interested himself in a scheme to sponsor the migration of persons from Great Britain, who have neither friends nor relatives in this country, to give them accommodation here. The Legion of Exservice Men and Women in New South Wales has propounded a similar scheme. I shall approve any scheme which will help to bring people to Australia provided that accommodation here is ready for them, so that Australians, particularly Australian ex-servicemen, are not placed in further difficulty in obtaining housing accommodation for themselves and their families. With respect to suitability of accommodation, every effort is made to ensure that persons offering accommodation are genuinely offering suitable accommodation. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Minister for Civil Aviation whether it is a fact that Trans-Australia Airlines recently established a service from Townsville to Charters Towers, Julia Creek and Cloncurry, notwithstanding that a service on  the same route had already been established by ex-servicemen? If so, will the Minister inform the House of the justification for the establishment of this service, which will seriously hamper the rehabilitation of these ex-servicemen?

                            <para>- As from Monday last, Trans-Australia Airlines established a service from Townsville to Mount Isa. Previously, Townsville and Inland Services was operating on the same route, with aeroplanes which could land at places where Douglas machines could not land. The new service is intended to give a more frequent and better service, and it has been commenced with the consent and encouragement of the Queensland Government. The suggestion that some injustice is being done to ex-servicemen is. entirely without foundation. Eighty per cent. of the employees of Trans-Australia Airlines are ex-service personnel; and no other organization employs a higher percentage of ex-service personnel. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that recently the Minister for Transport assumed control of what is known as the New Vehicles Releases Committee. Can the Minister inform the House what will be the policy with respect to the release of new motor vehicles in future? Will priority be given to applications from persons who require vehicles for urgent business andindustrial reasons over applications from persons requiring motor vehicles solely for pleasure. I am informed that in some States vehicles are released to people to be used solely for pleasure. Yet, in New South Wales, many people engaged in the mining industry are unable to procure motor cars in which to carry on activities associated with that important industry. Will they be given priority over people in other States who require cars merely for pleasure purposes? Can the Minister arrange to transfer to New South Wales cars that are surplus in other States? </para>

                        <para>- It has never been the practice since the control was established to approve the release of cars for purely pleasure purposes. In New South Wales, the organization has been changed at the request of the State Government. The changes made by the Commonwealth are designed to prevent any of the abuses which, it is alleged, have occurred in the past. The same policy as previously is applied in the other States. The cars are released on the basis of the essentiality of the purposes in respect of which applications have been lodged. If the honorable member knows of any releases having been made for purely pleasure purposes and he furnishes details immediate investigations will be instituted. </para>

                            <para>- My attention has not been drawn to the statement, but I am sure that the honorable member will realize that Australia does not control shipping between Australia and Malaya. Control is entirely in the hands of the shipping companies. I am not always impressed by some of the statements that come from Malaya about Australian fruit. It seems that when there is a glutted market there the importers tend to blame the Australian exporters. Those circumstances have always to be taken into consideration in respect of complaints of that sort. I assure the honorable member that our officers who are in charge of the inspection of fruit for export, are most careful about the types, standards and packing of fruit consigned to Malaya. Sometimes trouble occurs in Malaya. Recently, there was trouble over a shipment of oranges. Waterside workers in Malaya were on strike and the oranges were not unloaded. There was sabotage on board after the ship reached port and the fruit was deliberately damaged. There were, of course, " kickbacks ". Some people in Malaya tend to blame the Australian exporters) merchants and growers, but I assure the. honorable member that our trade representatives in Malaya and Singapore, who keep in close touch with Australia are co-operating with us to keep our fruit trade with Malaya on a high plane and to preserve a high ethical standard between the Australian exporter and the Malayan importers. </para>

                            <para>- I will reply to the last part of the question first. It is easy to ascertain the ages of those who are unemployed, if there are any, and Where they are. The honorable member's question was whether there could be some discrimination in determining the right of eligibility for social service payments because of the age of-applicants. There is. no need for that, because the mere fact that they are. out of work and, having been submitted to the works test, cannot be given work, entitles them to unemployment relief. The first part of the question is the most difficult. Do I know of any cases of employers having refused to employ people over the age of 35? I have heard of such cases, and I have investigated them, but I have never been able to prove one, with this qualification : some large companies that employ men over the age of 70 are making some of their employees permanent but do not make permanent any one over the age of 40 or 45. When I ask them why they do that, in view of the state of the labour market, they say that it is not because they do not want to employ men over that age, or that such men are not so good as others, but because of the welfare schemes of superannuation and retiring allowances that they have put into operation at the request of the Australian Government. So, we have repercussions when we take steps to improve the lot of the masses. If the companies are to put their employees on a permanent basis and allow them to share in the benefit of retiring allowances, they cannot carry out those schemes if the employees begin at 40 or 50years of age. But I have no proof that an employer will not employ menor women because of age. I intend to follow this matter up because I have had cases reported to me that I have not been able to prove. I will follow it up and supply the honorable member with further information when I have it. </para>

                        <para>- A Sydney newspaper last night stated that a report on the redistribution of electorates made by Mr. Turner, the Chief Electoral Officer, was confidentially made available to members of the Labour, caucus for their use during the discussions on the proposals to increasethe size of the Parliament. I ask the Minister for the Interior whether such a report was distributed as stated? Has the report been made available to other members of the Parliament not belonging to the Labour party, and, if not; what is the reason for the secretiveness regarding this document? </para>

                            <para>- I shall answer the question. The only paper distributed to members of caucus was a report, with a number of statistics and schedules prepared by the Chief Electoral Officer. That document was forwarded to the Minister for the Interior in the first place, and I also received a copy. I then issued instructions for a copy to be sent to each honorable senator and member of the House of Representatives. No document other than that was made available to members of caucus. I think that the writer of the newspaper article probably thought that the  document had been dis- tributed only to members of caucus for their consideration,but I issued instruction that copies were to be roneoed and supplied to every memberof the Parlia- ment.I believe tha that has been done. That is the only document which has been issued.

                        <para>- An application was received from Mr. Sharkey - not Mr. Miles - for the issue of a. passport to enable him to go to India. The Government of India stipulates that before a visa can be issued to anybody to enter that country, the views of the Indian Government must be ascertained, and, its approval given.. The ordinary procedures were followed in the case of the application by Mr. Sharkey. A cablegram was  despatched to the Indian Government asking whether it  had  any objection to the issue . of a visa and whether it approved of Mr. Sharkey being permitted to enter India. The Government of India replied that it had no objection to Mr. Sharkey coming to that country. It didlay down a condition that he could remain in India for a certain period, which would enable him to attend a particular conference there, but that he must leave the day after the completion of the conference. When the Indian Government intimated that  it had noobjection to the issue of a visa, a passport was issued to Mr. Sharkey and  he proceeded abroad. In respect of the issue of passports, no discrimination is made betweenpersons of different political faiths, provided they are permitted to function legally. As the Communist pairtyhas the right to nominate persons tostand for Parliament and is in every way permitted to function legally, no discrimination is made against its members seeking to go abroad. </para>

                        <para>- I have read in the newspapers all sorts of reports - some of them sheer propaganda - about the Convair airliners which have been purchased and. I am not accepting them. So far as I know, a confidential report has not yet been supplied to the Department of Civil Aviation about these aircraft. If such a report has been made, it has not yet reached me, I should like to see it. The Convair airliners have been purchased to specifications which provide for the carriage of 40 passengers between Melbourne and Sydney, and similar distances between Australian cities, with ample fuel reserve to meet the requirements of the regulations of the Australian Department of Civil Aviation. The latest reports from the technical representative of the TransAustralia Airlines at the Consolidated Vultee factory at San Diego in the United States of America confirm that these  requirements will be satisfactorily met. The Convair airliner has been granted an approved type certificate by the United States civil aviation authorities, but final tests on pressurization and de-icing equipment are not yet completed. Speed and performance figures for these aircraft during the United States civil aviation authority's tests have been satisfactory. Three Convair-airliners have been delivered to airlines in the United States, and a further 173 are on order by American and overseas airlines. Delivery in America of the five aircraft for Trans- Australia Airlines is. expected as follows : One in April, one in May, one in June and the remaining two in July. Final acceptance by Trans-Australia Airlines is conditional upon the aircraft having a full certificate of airworthiness for scheduled airline operations. I hope that this information which I have given to the House, will help to kill the inspired propaganda that has been disseminated from time to time against these fine aircraft. </para>

Doubtless the right honorable gentleman had in mind the Taxation Board of Review, which hears appeals against assessments, but often when I use the word " appeal ", I refer to applications for deferment of the payment of tax, or applications for permission to pay by instalments. This applies not only to companies but also to individuals. Every effort is being made to collect the arrears. I am not able to inform the right honorable gentleman as to the amount of arrears at the 31st December last, but I shall obtain the figure for him. </para>

                    <para>. - I should not have risen had it not been for certain statements made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> last night. The honorable gentleman should cast his mind back to 1930 when certain duties were levied on imported tobacco. The Minister virtually expressed himself as a dyedinthewool protectionist and ventured the suggestion that the only hope for the tobacco industry in Australia was a reversion to some form of punitive tariff taxation on imported tobacco. I say to the Minister and to the Government that under the. conditions that prevail in Australia to-day the customs duties required for this purpose must necessarily be much higher than they were in 1930-31. I remind the House that quite recently the Government - perhaps quite willingly - permitted this country to. be handed over to a 40-hour week system. In my opinion that is one of the wickedest things that have ever been done to Australian 'industry. It stands to reason that the cost of production of goods manufactured in this country must rise considerably as the result of the shorter working week and the Government, if it thinks at all on these matters, .must recognize that the tariff wall that will be required, to protect Australian industries functioning on a 40- hour week from outside competition of the kind referred to by the Vice-President of the Executive Council last night, will necessarily be much higher than it was in 1930-31. I recall to the honorable gentleman's mind something that he has probably forgotten, namely, the effect of the 1930 tariff on the sheepskin industry. We do not want to revert to administration of that kind. The first essential is to grow tobacco on the right country ; the second is to . grow tobacco of the right variety; and the third is to grow it in the right way. My experience as a Minister for Commerce in this country on two occasions, i,s that if the quality is in the tobacco, there will never be any doubt about selling it at the right price. There is a far too great tendency in the Australian tobacco industry to assume that anything that is grown and called tobacco will find a local market at a price satisfactory to the grower. In relation to production, I raise the important consideration of the 40-hour week because, recently, a prominent gentleman associated with the Labour party said in Adelaide that shortly the dairy industry would have to be converted to a 40-hour week. When that happens, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> will find it necessary to turn his mind to the price of milk, butter and cheese. When tobacco plants are first put out, they must be watered about five times a day or even more if the weather is hot. Then, when the tobacco is being cured, it has to be watched night and day. With a 40-hour week in operation, it stands to reason that the troubles of the tobacco industry will only be starting when the proposal to which the committee is now being asked to agree is given effect. Probably when the membership of this Parliament is increased as it may be before the next elections, we shall find that the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> has sponsored a few immigrant members so- that there will be a proper infusion of overseas, interests into the new House. </para>

                    (Darling Downs Leader of the Austr:;liu;i Country party) |"3.33"|.  -  This debate affords me an opportunity to make a. few observations regarding the potentialities of the tobacco industry in Australia. The advantages to be gained are twofold. First, we' would be establishing a very important industry on a sound basis, and, secondly, the production of tobacco in this country would ease our dollar difficulties considerably. Sixteen years ago, in March, 1932, 1 personally carried out considerable research into tobacco-growing in Australia and had prepared and printed a. review of the investigations. I was particularly interested in the tobacco industry at that time because of the acute economic conditions then' existing in this country. It will be recalled that during the depression there was considerable unemployment throughout Australia, particularly in Queensland, and I considered that the establishment of the tobacco-growing industry in that State would do much to alleviate the economic strain. The statistics that I gathered in the course of my inquiry, are, of  course.  out of date tq-day, and the conclusions may not have application to existing circumstances. However; I ascertained that only 2 or 3 per cent, of the trade of the largest tobacco companies operating in Australia was in Australian tobacco, and that only between 2 and 3 per cent, of Australian smokers would smoke composite tobacco. Growers then were producing only enough bright leaf to enable the manufacturers to include about
                    <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline>
                    per cent, of Australian   tobacco  in every pound produced.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline>
                    P. Darnell-Smith, a Doctor of Science and Director of the ' Sydney Botanic Gardens, said in 1932 that Australians were growing tobacco in districts not suited to the production of the type of leaf demanded by Australian manufacturers and consequently by. Australian smokers. Giving evidence before a select committee which had been appointed to investigate the tobacco industry by a government composed of the parties now in Opposition,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Darnell-Smith</inline>
                    stated that, in the. Mareeba district in northern Queensland, there were large areas of land which appeared to be ideaL for the production of tobacco suited to. Australian requirements.  His  evidence also indicated that the future of  the  tobacco industry  for  the production of light leaf and cigarette tobacco lay north of Bowden, about 2.0 degrees south latitude. An official survey, including examination of the results of test plots, conclusively proved that Queensland was pre-eminently suited to the production of bright leaf tobacco of superior texture, colour and aroma, a type for which there- would be. fully a 90 per  cent,  demand in Australia and in other English-speaking- countries.
                </para>
                <para>Small quantities of tobacco have been grown in Queensland almost since it was established as  a  colony. In 1894, over 1,000,000 lb. of cured leaf was produced in Queensland from 900 acres of land.  However,  after 1896 the industry slowly declined in Queensland and production contracted to an area of less than 100 acres in 1925. After 193Q there was an expansion of cultivation in all States. Production was so increased in Queensland that, in 1944-45, that State produced about 50 per  cent,  of the entire Australian crop. The remainder was grown in Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. "Of the 1,300,000 lb. of dried leaf produced in that year off 1,800 acres, 60 per cent, came from the Mareeba district of  the  Atherton Tablelands. Most of the remainder was grown in the Townsville, Mackay, Bowen and Gladstone districts. </para>
                <para>As long ago as 1932, I declared that Australia could produce all .the bright leaf tobacco required for home consumption and that, in addition, production could be stepped up so that millions of pounds  of  this readily marketable type of  tobacco  would be available for export. Expert tests have proved that light Australian tobacco produced in northern Queensland districts is comparable with the best light Virginian leaf. Had this industry been fostered  in  northern Queensland, Australia  would  have been able to save millions of dollars pf expenditure on imported tobacco. We could have built up a splendid Australian industry and also we should have had the chance to establish export markets both in Great </para>
                <para class="block">Britain and in other English-speaking countries. A thorough investigation of the needs of the industry and proper encouragement of growers even at this stage can be Of great value to the nation. </para>
                <para>The increase of production which did occur after 1933 was due largely to the encouragement given to the industry by the government of the day. That government decided to pay £20,000 annually to assist the States to continue economic and scientific research in the industry. This was of great assistance to the industry. A further grant of £62,500, increased later by £11,250, was allotted by the Commonwealth Government for periodic distribution, . commencing with the year 1939. Then, of course, the intervention of war interrupted the plan which had been operating since 1931. This "plan did much to develop disease-resisting -varieties of tobacco. It improved the smoking qualities of Australian leaf and enabled the growers to deal with diseases such as blue mould. However, much still remains to be done. </para>
                <para>The Australian tobacco-growing industry has never received the encouragement which it has deserved and which it is -entitled to receive in the interests of Australia generally. A superficial survey of the industry indicates its potential value. "The dollar .situation to-day is most acute.  And it  will continue to be so even if the position is not aggravated. Consequently, -we should do everything possible to entourage production . of our own requirements within Australia. That is our -responsibility as Australians. I emphasize that Australia can produce sufficient -tobacco to meet the needs of Australian smokers in terms of both quantity and  quality. There has been &amp; great deal of prejudice against Australian leaf and in many instances that prejudice has been -ill founded. </para>
                <para>The researches of the Council-for Scientific and Industrial Research and the  evidence submitted at tariff inquiries and to a Royal Commission which sat in 1929 provide adequate proof of my statements should proof be required. I hope that this Government will authorize a survey of the industry with a view to its future development. "We have plenty of idle land that -can be adapted .to tobacco production be cause, paradoxically, expert opinion is that poor land is most suited to the successful growing of good tobacco. Allthe facilities are at hand for the development of the industry, and present economic conditions, particularly in the- light of the dollar situation, demand that we should do everything possible to expand Australian industries ' and make ourselves independent of imports. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research should be instructed to carry out a survey of the industry, and to resume the work which it was carrying out until 1932. The industry can be of great value to Australia. It requires a great deal of husbanding and all of the scientific 'assistance that can be given to it. Tobacco growing has been described more than once as scientific gardening. It is hard work; the crops have to  be watered continuously and given constant attention, and expert advice and guidance is required not only during the growing period but also during the treatment and curing of the leaf. I trust that the Government will continue the operation .of the scheme decided upon by the Lyons Government, and will make available annual grants for the establishment of experimental stations and other scientific facilities, because the industry is destined to be of great .importance to Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- When I spoke on this matter yesterday, I emphasized the importance of the tobacco industry to Australia, and referred particularly to the possibilities of increasing production. , I explained that the production of local tobacco leaf would ease the dollar situation, not only for Australia, but also for the United Kingdom. Whilst I do not regard tobacco as a completely avoidable import, the fact remains that every pound of tobacco which we import diminishes the' pool of dollars available for the purchase of unavoidable imports from, dollar areas.' Furthermore, it draws upon the dollars available in Great Britain, and this is important because now, as always, we rely upon the United Kingdom to make good our dollar deficit.  Conversely, every pound of local tobacco leaf which we export to the United Kingdom represents a savings, in dollars to that  country. Those are obvious facts, and, to me, it seems incumbent upon the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> to make a statement of the Government's policy in regard to the encouragement of Australian tobacco production. The schedule now before us Ls more than a mere revenue-producing or protective one. Indeed, it is of a most unusual nature, in that it proposes to confer upon the Minister for Trade and Customs discretionary power to prescribe the proportions of Australian leaf which may be mixed with imported leaf, thereby absolving imported leaf from payment of a high rate of duty. Notwithstanding this, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has listened to this protracted debate without attempting to make any statement of policy, and I protest against the attitude he is adopting. I believe that it is his duty to state clearly the policy which the Government intends to follow - if it has any policy - in regard to the stimulation of tobacco production in this country. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Lyons Government, which I supported before I became a member of it, took what I believe to be the most constructive step yet taken in Australia to foster the development of the Australian tobacco industry. The tariff schedule which it devised was no mere, unscientific protective tariff, but was one carefully designed to enlist the active support of manufacturers and importers to stimulate the production of Australian leaf. Indeed, that was the first time in the history of this country that importers of 'a particular commodity were deliberately encouraged to stimulate local production of that commodity. That result was achieved by the' imposition of a variable duty. The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White),</inline> who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, was responsible for the introduction of the legislation, and I pay tribute to him for it. That legislation provided that if cigarettes blended from imported and local tobacco contained 2-J per cent, of the latter, the duty payable on the remaining <inline font-style="italic">97i</inline> per cent, of imported leaf was to be subject to a substantial " drawback ". Similarly, if pipe tobacco blended of imported and Australian, leaf contained 13 pei- cent, of the latter there was to be a considerable rebate in the duty on the imported leaf. This policy not only overcame the difficulty of smokers having to choose between tobacco mixtures containing only imported tobacco and other mixtures containing only Australian leaf, but it was also designed to cultivate a taste for Australian tobacco amongst smokers in this country. That intention was quite a proper one. If one were to go to Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Rhodesia, or any other country which grows tobacco in any quantity, one would find that the people of that country appreciate and demand the peculiar flavour of the local product. Therefore, it is only proper that the Australian Government should seek to cultivate a taste for Australian tobacco and its distinctive aroma. The percentages of local leaf permitted to be blended with imported leaf were later increased from 2-J per cent, lo 3 per cent., and from 13 per cent, to 15 per cent., in the case of cigarettes and pipe tobacco respectively. At the time it was announced that as sufficient quantities of Australian leaf became available the statutory minimum percentage of local tobacco would be raised, and no one has ever criticized that policy. The tariff schedule now before the committee does not propose to abandon that policy, but it does propose to alter considerably the application of that policy. Although the Minister has not yet spoken, the proposed tariff schedule contains, in itself, an admission that sufficient Australian leaf to meet the statutory minimum percentage is no longer available. Sufficient Australian leaf is not being produced to provide an admixture of 3 per cent., in the case of cigarettes, or 15 per cent.,, in the case of pipe tobacco. Adoption of the proposal before us would authorize the Minister for Trade and Customs to prescribe from time to time the proportion of Australian leaf to be blended with imported leaf. The fact that it is necessary to make such a provision is in itself a serious reflection on some one. The honorable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Conelan)</inline> pointed his finger at the farmers, and obviously either the farmers or the Government are responsible for the present decline of production. I shall discuss this aspect of the matter presently, but at the </para>

                    <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff Bill</inline>
                    1948. 87 moment I point out that it is a very serious thing for the committee to authorize any Minister to say to importers and manufacturers : " In my judgment you are entitled to be absolved from the obligation to pay vast sums of money in duty ". And it must be realized that the amounts involved will be very large. I have extracted figures showing that in the year 1945-46, in the course of the operation of the law, duty concessions on cigarettes totalled £592.000. The concessions were made because the manufacturers used 3 per cent, of local leaf. In the same year, duty concessions to manufacturers using the statutory minimum admixture of 15 per cent, of Australian leaf in pipe tobacco amounted to £845,000. In that year, in respect of cigarette and pipe tobacco, manufacturers were granted a concession of £1,437,000. The figures for 1940-47 are, for cigarette tobacco. £81 0,000, and for pipe tobacco, £1.138,000. The total concession to manufacturers in that year was £1,953,000. In those two years duty concessions were approximately £3,500,000, but those concessions are now to be given on the personal decision of the Minister for Trade and Customs and not in accordance with the specific operation of a statute. We have allowed ourselves to drift into a position in which we are required to repose in a Minister the power to grant a rebate of £3,500,000 in two years. I have no doubt, that that fits in with the policy of the Labour party, which seeks to avoid the specific application of statutes and to centralize authority in officials and in particular Ministers. I protest against the drift that has resulted in this most obnoxious result.

                        <para>- These concessions are to be granted by the Minister principally to one company. It has been pointed out from all sides of the House in debates on tobacco that the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited produces 90 per cent. of the tobacco manufactured in this country. I do not know whether that figure is correct, but there is no doubt that it produces the great majority. This is the company upon which a former Minister for Commerce and Agriculture made a violent attack last night. It is not a satisfactory state of affairs when a member of the Cabinet makes such an attack in the course of a debate upon legislation designed to repose in a Minister personally the right to grant or withhold these vast concessions. </para>

                <para>The root of the trouble is to be found in the serious decline in the production of tobacco in this country in recent years. It is a crop that is bound to fluctuate from year to year. Production, however, has not only fluctuated but has gone down on a continuous and unarrested slide. In 1941 tobacco production was rather more than 5,000,000 lb.; in 1942 it was almost 7,000,000 lb.; in 1943 it was 4,000,000 lb. ; in 1944 it was 3,800,000 lb ; in 1945 it was 2,500,000 lb. ; and in 1946 it was 2,400,000 lb. I do not know what the figure will be for this year, but I have no reason to believe it will improve. </para>
                <para>The explanation of this decrease in production is to be found not in seasonal conditions but in policy. Since 1941 the tobacco-growing industry has been virtually under absolute government control, with the prices to the growers determined positively by the Government. There is not the slightest doubt that a man's decision to accept a certain job or to grow a particular crop is largely determined by his estimate of the return he will get. From his meagre knowledge of the industry, the honorable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Conelan),</inline> speaking as a supporter of the Government, said last night that the explanation for the decrease was that the farmers 88 <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff Bill</inline> 1948.[REPRESEN'TATlVES.] <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff Bill</inline> 1948. turned from the production of tobacco to the raising of other crops. I disagreed with most of what he said, but on that point he was right. In the exercise of their discretion, the farmers turned to the production of other crops. By its illjudged policy of maintaining too low a price for tobacco, the Government is discouraging the production of this crop. It is one that we need more than tomatoes, maize, beans, peas and the other alternative crops that the farmers grow. It would have saved us dollars; if production had risen instead of falling, a tremendous contribution would have been made to the easing of the acuteness of our present dollar position. </para>
                <para>I propose to quote figures showing how the Government handled the price factor. A system of appraisal of tobacco leaf was introduced. It was somewhat similar to the system for the appraisal of wool. That was a good decision, and one that I have advocated for years. But the whole success of the appraisal system in respect of its impact upon the volume of production lies in the price level of the table of limits. The Government took 1939 as the base year; and for the first year to which appraisals were applied, namely, 1941, the table of limits was worked out on the basis of a 25 per cent. increase of the 1939 price. In 1942 there was a further 10 per cent, increase upon the previous year's table of limits, which was the base year plus 25 per cent. In 1943 there was an additional 10 per cent. on the base year; and in 1944 there was the same figure as in 1943 plus a 10 per cent. subsidy. In 1946 there was the same figure as in 1943, again plus a 10 per cent. subsidy; and in 1946 10 per cent. was added to the total of the previous year's actual table of limits. For 1947 there was a 13 per cent. increase on the figure for the previous year. In view of those figures, honorable members and listeners may be inclined to ask what one is moaning about, because those figures seem to present a continuous upward curve in the price which ought to provide an adequate incentive to production. This magnificent and continuing increase of price will be more readily understood when I quote from the corresponding table of indices. Taking 1939 as the base year with a base index figure of 100, we find that the fixed price on the table of limits in respect of subsequent years expressed in terms of index figures was as follows: 1941, 125; 1942, 137.5; 1943, 150; 1944, 150; 1945, 150; 1946, 165; 1947, 187.5. Those figures sound all right but let us see how they actually worked out in money to the farmer. In 1941, the first year of appraisal, the average return to the farmer was 29.06d. per lb. In the next year, after receiving a 10 per cent. increase, the farmer received 29.94d. per lb. The next year, when he was receiving another 10 per cent. increase, his return was 30.86d. per lb.; and the next year, when he was still receiving an increase of 10 per cent., and when the index figure was 150, his return was 28.87d. per lb. In theory, he was receiving 50 per cent.. more for his tobacco; but, in fact, his return was a half-penny per lb. less than he received in 1941. In 1945, when the index figure was still 150, or anincrease of 50 per cent, on the base year, his return was 27.07d. per lb. or 2d. per lb. less than he received in 1941. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and that wouldl return him another 2¾d. per lb. In 1946, when no subsidy was paid, and when the index figure had risen to 165, he received, despite the increase of 65 per cent. in the index figure, only 3d. per lb. more than he received in 1941. Having regard to the increase of the index figure by 65 percent. on an original price of 29d. per lb., an increase of 65 per cent. on the base year index, at a quick glance, would represent an increase of 20d. per lb., but, in fact, the farmers received only 3d. per lb. more. </para>

Departmental officers informed me that their latest estimate was that there would be 30 tons of tobacco at Myrtleford, but two weeks ago 3 inches of rain fell in that district, and consequently, if I know anything about the industry at all,I know that there will be no crop at all in that area. That fact emphasizes the precariousness of the industry and should make the Government realize that it must not shave the return to the grower to the last penny. Periodically, growers- experience adverse weather conditions or the depredation of pests and diseases such as blue mould. In respect of the last year,, 1947, when there was another increase of 13 per cent., bringing the index figure to 187.5, I am informd that the anticipated overall return to the grower will only be between 35d. and36d per lb. </para>

                <para>I say to the committee and to the country, here is anactual example of the operation of price control applied to an. industry and. having the effect of destroying it. Price control has damned this industry. Curing the last seven years, the Government has exercised all the powers with respect to the tobacco industry that it now seeks to apply to every industry in this country if the prices referendum be carried. In. respect of the tobacco industry, it has exercised uninhibited powers and it has destroyed the industry, and has thus helped, to put this country "in the cart " with respect to our, dollar problem; but not satisfied with its ineptitude in applying price control to one industry, it now seeks to apply price control to all industries.  An  examination of the control exercised by this Government over the tobacco industry reveals a sorry state of affairs. I challenge honorable members to mention any other industry that has thus been brought to its knees during the term of office of this Government when it has been armed with every control and authority it could imaginably possess. It. is the duty of the Minister to stand up and tell the committee what is the policy of the Government with respect to stimulating the production of tobacco in Australia. In a country which has not yet been completely socialized, no government will ever attaint satisfactory production in any industry unless it givesa sufficient incentive. to producers by recognizing the profit motive. I believe that the experience of the tobacco industry ought to be a guide to the people of this country when they are asked to place every other industry completely within the clutches of this Government. </para>

                    <para>. -The problem of tobacco production in Australia should be approached in a non-party impartial spirit. The honorable member for Indi (Mr: McEwen), of course, is incapable of approaching any subject in that spirit. After all, I do not suppose there is any form of agricultural production in Australia which presents to. the producer a. more complex set of problems than. does tobacco production. My mind goes back nearly twenty years to the problems of tobacco production in Victoria, when, in the Ovens Valley, in the very electorate that the honorable member for Indi. now represents, a vast expansion of tobacco production was taking place. That expansion occurred largely as the direct outcome of the incentive given to the industry by the Scullin Labour Government. It is true - and I want to be perfectly fair - that that incentivewas so great that it stimulated the formation of bogus companies, or, to say the least, companies with little substance and little knowledge of the propositions that they wereembarking upon. It encouraged in the industry people with neither the production nor the technical knowledge required in such a difficult industry; but, at least, it did bring forward vastly increased production both there and in other parts of Australia. It is true that for a period in thethirties there was again some degree of expansion of production. But always, in certain circumstances, this industry has taken, from time to time, a serious backward step. It is useless any one in the Parliament or anywhere else trying to tell me that thatcan be attributed to the Government.. The fact is that here is a combination of factors, not the least of which is  90 <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff Bill</inline> 1948. [REPRESENTATIVES.] <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff Bill</inline> 1948. that the highly specialized nature of the industry requires, in its very essence, that people who engage in tobacco production must be qualified for that type of work. Lots of people engage in tasks for which they are not qualified. One could illustrate that point by the example of the honorable member for Indi who has entered a particular occupation, to wit, membership of this Parliament. He is not really qualified for the job, but, at least, he does some sort of job. But if a person goes into tobacco production without that great gift of being qualified for it, there is no hope for him. Great problems confront the industry - problems of soil character, water application, insect infestation, and the fact that there is practically only one buyer, one great company. No Australian government has, as far as I know, the power to force that company to buy at a specific figure. In addition to those problems, there is the prejudice of the Australian smoker against Australian tobacco. I believe that the prejudice is rapidly disappearing and that, in due course, when production increases, the Australian smoker will smoke Australian tobacco as avidly as he smokes the imported to-day. Let us be fair. We know that in 1929, 1930 or thereabouts the evidence given before a commission into the tobacco industry by a man in a high technical position in Australia - and the evidence is on record - was that tobacco grown in Australia in proximity to eucalypt plantations or eucalypts growing naturally would be tainted with the eucalyptus. He was not an employee of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited or any other tobacco interest, and, in all probability, he really believed that his statement was factual. But every one knows that the statement was absurd. It has been mentioned during the debate in this chamber. It would be as stupid to say that cabbages grown near eucalypts would be tainted. The fact is that in Australia the tobacco-grower has one purchaser, and whatever the Government does, short of compelling that purchaser to buy at a specific price, the growers remain in a difficult position. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In addition, the marketing situation is precarious. During the war, as the honorable member for Indi has said, the Government established a Tobacco Marketing Board under National Security Regulations. On that board were representatives of the tobacco-growers themselves and representatives of the other interests concerned. Tables of limits were set up. Appraisal authorities were established and with the appraisal authorities always went a representative of the tobacco growers and two observers. It has been well said - and there is a considerable amount of truth in it - that, notwithstanding that the Government from time to time, for the period of the operation of that board, increased tobacco prices by about 50 per cent., the increase to the grower was not very great. The fact remains that the observers representing the Tobacco Growers Association, so far as I know, have not lodged one protest or suggested the appraiser did not appraise the tobacco correctly. One would naturally expect protests to be lodged with the Government by the growers' representative or the observers if the appraisers nefariously did not grade and appraise leaf as it should have been. Owing to a combination of circumstances, the quality of the leaf did not keep pace with the increased prices set down in the table of limits. They included the entry of inexperienced people into the industries, climatic conditions, insect infestation, shortage of materials and shortage of insecticides. I cannot be dogmatic, but I can say that the fact that, as far as I know, no protest was ever made, indicates that that is the unfortunate position to-day. In my room I have samples of Australian tobacco leaf taken from the stocks held in one of the tobacco appraisal centres recently. Honorable members are welcome to inspect them. Among them is tobacco leaf that realizes 3s. 6d. per lb. It is beautiful, lemoncoloured leaf. </para>

                    <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff Bill</inline>
                    1948. 91 at 6d. per lb., one would say that at one stage it must have shown promise of maturing as a beautiful lemoncoloured leaf. To me, it looks as though it was picked immature or placed in an inefficient drying kiln. Anyway, it did not result as a high-class leaf. Also amongst the samples are samples of leaf for which no price was offered because of its inferior quality owing to poor kiln-drying, picking or some other cause. Those are problems that cannot be overcome solely by the price factor. The people in the industry must know how to engage in it. Science must be applied to it. Shortages of material and labour for irrigation, which is required particularly in Queensland, must be overcome. It is said by investigators that irrigation is essential in Queensland. In addition, further research work is essential by the State authorities and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. That work is going on all the time. The problem finally in regard to prices is one that cannot be overcome, despite what the honorable member for Indi says, unless he is prepared to accept the responsibility of saying to the people who are almost the sole purchasing authority, " You have to take this leaf into your factory and pay so much per lb. for it ". Of course, the honorable memberwould describe that as an illustration of bureaucratic control and interference with the liberty of the subject, and another example of the activities of a socialist government in this country. I ask the honorable member to state whether he is prepared to supporta proposal to force the company to pay a certain price for the leaf, whether it considers the leaf is worth that amount or not, and to compel the company to take into the factory for manufacture into cigarette or pipe tobacco a type of leaf which it considers does not measure up to its requirements.

                <para>I now desire to speak briefly on another aspect. During World War II., the Government established the Tobacco Marketing Board on which various interests concerned in the industry were represented. The Government considered that if we are to ensure to the tobacco growers in Australia at least some competition and some rights under an appraisal scheme, it is -essential to continue in the post-war period some form of co-ordinated  Commonwealth-State  marketing control. With that .object in view, the Commonwealth representatives at the meetings of the Australian Agricultural Council in July, 1947, submitted to the State Ministers for Agriculture the proposition that the States should cooperate in such a plan. They expressed their concurrence with the proposal, and the Australian Government thereupon decided that, the States having indicated their willingness to co-operate in such a plan to continue appraisal and Commonwealth marketing, it would introduce the necessary legislation, provided the State Governments brought down similar legislation. At a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council last week, the Victorian Minister for Agriculture indicated that his State was not interested. In those circumstances, Commonwealth marketing cannot be continued. The result will be that tobacco-growers in Victoria will market their leaf as a separate entity, and tobacco-growers in Queensland will market their leaf as. a separate entity. There will also be a division of appraisal authorities. Indeed, the Commonwealth appraisal authority will cease to exist. </para>

That situation may lead to a differentiation in price systems in the' two States, with substantial ultimate disadvantages to the tobacco growers of Australia. Any hope that one might have of dealing with any sinister practices,, as they have been termed, can be realized only through a co-ordinated all-powerful marketing authority, having the blessing and .legislative assistance of the respective State parliaments. Unfortunately, that will not be possible. I can only hope and pray that matters will turn out all right, but I have grave fears indeed about the ultimate result. </para>

                <para>Reference has been made to sinister influences in the industry. I believe that we should say .less about sinister influences, and get down' to facts. After all, sinister influences do not count very much if one produces a first-class leaf. Where a first-class product is available, the protection afforded by the tariff should, in itself, result in the purchasing authority at least endeavouring to " play the game ", I know that, in the past, it has not been in the interests of buying companies toencourage Australian production, but I am' extremely doubtful if to-day they are deliberately standing in the way of increased tobacco production in Australia. If the Australian tobacco-grower, aided by scientific research and adequate marketing facilities, produces a quality leaf, the buying authority can be brought to a sense of realism, and will face up to its responsibility, provided always that some body is vested with a residual power to deal with it, should it not face up to its responsibility. &gt; </para>

                        <para>- I have just pointed out that the Commonwealth tobacco marketing authority, because of the objections of Victoria, is virtually dead. If we are to have several States marketing tobacco and only, one buying authority, they all might be put out of the industry, but I do not believe that will happen. In my opinion, we must concentrate on helping the tobacco-grower, particularly with scientific advice, and ensure that, wherever possible, suitable persons engage in tobacco culture. At present, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics section of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture has under consideration proposals for tobacco-growing in Northern Queensland. I consider that there is scope in the tobacco industry for the right class of ex-serviceman, contiguous to people who have a lifetime of experience of the industry. Making allowances for all the war-time disabilities, the Government has always demonstrated its earnest desire to assist this industry. We shall continue to do so, and anything within reason that we can do to increase !he production and quality of tobacco in Australia, we shall certainly do.

If the basic value of the leaf is from 18d. to 26d. per lb., a premium of 6d. per lb. will be paid. If the basic value of the leaf is from 15d. to I7d. per lb., a premium of 3d. per lb. will be paid. If the basic value of the leaf isless than 15d. per lb., no premium will be paid. It  is useless to  pay a premium ontobacco leaf which does not measure upto the required standards of quality, and encourageadditional  production  of that type of leaf.

                    <para>.The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> has given to honorable members  an  illuminating account  of  the tobacco industry, and its trials and tribulations. As one who had some experience  of  the industry  in  the early years  of  World War II., I sympathisewith his administrative difficulties. Hehas con fessed that in spite of everything that the Government has attempted, and the urgent need for the production of tobacco in this country to conserve dollars, tobacco-growing has declined rapidly. According to figures given by the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> seven years ago, in 1941-42, approximately 2,000,000 lb. of tobaccowas produced ; to-dayproduction is a mere trickle. That is conclusive proof, if proof be required, of a regrettable failure somewhere, and if the Minister does not know where the failure has occurred or what can be done to prevent its recurrence, the industry faces complete extinction. As the honorable -member for Indi has pointed out, in- centive is an important factor. It is important in every trade and occupation. As one who has had some experience of groving various primary products, I appreciate that unless there is incentive - an -expectancy not merelyof a marginal profit but of a handsome profit -growers will not continue their activities. I say that there must be ahandsome profitbe- causesuch a profit isrequired, in some years at least, to offset losses in adverse seasons. All primary producers are faced with the possibility of extremely low incomesor evenlosses in some seasons and they depend upon their "bumper" cropsto carry them overthose periods. Whenan organization such as the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited endeavours to reduce prices to what it considers will provide a reasonable profit margin in the year of production only, it is  contributing to the ultimate extinction of the industry, because growers will have no reserves to tide them over less prosperous years. Profit should be averaged over a number of years. </para>

                <para>In my electorate in the northern part of New South Wales tobacco-growing has practically ceased although a considerable volume was produced in years gone by. In the Tenterfield district, and along the Queensland border, can be seen disused tobacco kilns by the score. Former tobacco-growersare no longer interested in the industry and have turned to some other form of primary production. They were beaten not only by unremunerative returns for their leaf, but also by disease,  insect pests, and adverse seasonal conditions. I have no doubt, however, that with the incentive of profitable prices, there would be a drift back from other industries - perhaps less important industries - to tobacco-growing. As the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has said, tobacco production i3 a highly-skilled and specialized industry. It is also a tedious industry and few Australians have had the patience to stick to it. In areas adjacent to my own district the industry is almost entirely in the hands of Italians. I do not intend to disparage these people in any way, but  they  are the only ones who are prepared to spend many hours, day and night, planting out the roots, watering, spraying to prevent diseases and to combat insect pests and attending the drying kilns. Australians .certainly will not tackle this industry to-day whim they can find much more remunerative occupations elsewhere. Another thing that is stifling tobacco-growing, and the Minister has rightly put his finger on this point, is the scarcity of labour. In every country district of Australia to-day . it is almost  imposible  to find farm employees. The problem is not always the wages that are offered. Men just will not go into the country districts. They compare country working conditions With those in more lucrative industries in the cities. They realize that by remaining in the metropolitan areas they can enjoy a 40- hour week, receive higher wages, and have more opportunities for sport and recreation, so why should they go into the bush? The drift from rural areas to the cities is unchecked. Recently I visited many parts of the Commonwealth and everywhere the farmers told me the same story. At Mildura, in' the electorate of the' honorable member for Wimmera. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull),</inline> fruit-growers said that they' did not know how they were going to harvest their crops. In the past, they had been getting all kinds of. casual employees but this source of labour was drying up. Many casual fruit-pickers had come to the conclusion that the little extra they received after paying taxes was not worth the effort, and they were no longer 'interested in temporary jobs. Similar conditions exist in the sugar in- dustry,  as honorable members representing cane-growing districts will testify. </para>

                        <para>- I am showing that what is happening in the tobacco industry to-day is characteristic of the conditions obtaining in other primary industries. The point I am making is that unless the Government takes steps to ensure that primary producers shall receive adequate returns for their labour, there will be a continued drift to other avenues of employment. It is all very well to say that tobacco-growers should offer higher wages to attract labour; but how cun they pay higher wages unless their returns are sufficient to enable them to do so? Wages depend entirely upon the price that can be realized for the tobacco leaf. I agree with the Minister that a premium .should be paid for first-grade leaf. It is no use this country growing tcn times .the quantity of tobacco that we are now producing if it is to be of a quality not acceptable to Australian smokers. When all is said and done, the man who smokes the- tobacco is the arbiter. He determines whether he will smoke Australian leaf or whether he will pay a fancy price for imported tobacco, as he is doing to-day in the main. Therefore, I welcome the encouragement that has been' given to growers by providing for a premium price for superior leaf. In fact, I suggest that consideration be given to' increasing the margin payable for better grade tobacco, because the production of such leaf is considerably more difficult and more expensive than the production of lower grades. More art and more careful attention in the drying and other processes are required to produce high quality leaf, and the product is certainly worth much more than poor leaf. </para>

We have learned in this country that too many safeguards cannot be imposed upon the authority of Ministers to. exercise patronage through their departments. I hope that this provision which I have mentioned will be abolished. It was introduced into the legislation about the end of 1946, and I do not know to what extent the power has been exercised up to date. It would be interesting to have a statement from the Minister on that subject. While the Minister has power to distribute bonuses, or whatever one might like to call them, amounting to millions of pounds, there is a possibility of things happening of which we have seen and heard more than enough in the last few weeks. I hope that the Minister will be more successful in stimulating tobacco production in Australia in future than he has been in the past, because unless something is done soon we shall not have much Australian tobacco to worry about at all.

                <para>However, the Minister for Trade and Customs is given a certain over-riding power with regard to the use of available Australian tobacco leaf. We on this side of the chamber are concerned with making available the maximum quantity of good quality Australian leaf. All that the Minister for Trade and Customs seems to be concerned about is a gradual reduction of the percentage of Australian leaf used in manufactured tobacco under the power granted to him. We want a clear statement of government policy. When the Opposition parties were in the happy position now occupied by the Government, we had a policy for the expansion of the tobacco industry. That policy resulted in widespread development of the industry within Australia. I well remember that, when the Lyons Government was in power, the production of tobacco leaf in Australia amounted to 12,000,000 lb. annually. To-day, the output is approximately 2,800,000 lb. annually. Something has happened to bring that about. </para>

That arrangement was made at a time when there was a flush period of tobacco production in this country. I wonder what will be the ultimate result if we continue to develop trade agreements of this nature to the detriment of our own  tobacco-growers.  Although I was the Minister who negotiated that trade agreement with Rhodesia, I say that we should examine the agreement again in the light of the present situation of the Australian tobacco industry, which seems to be fading out of existence. It seems to me to be "going down the wind " because of the failure of the Government to encourage an industry which should mean so much to Australia at this time of dollar restrictions. </para>

                        <para>- But it was pretty flush in production at that time. The encouragement given to  manufacturers and importers to utilize increasing, quantities of Australian leaf by means of the "drawback" provision in the duty payable on imported leaf which had been blended with a sufficient percentage of local leaf, did increase the production of Australian leaf.' The industry has had . its ups. and downs, and the application of an artificial stimulus to Australian production did result in Australian tobacco gaining a bad name because vast quantities of inferior leaf were foisted upon the Australian -smoking public. I realize also that large sums of money were spent to establish the industry in this country, and ihat the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research made energetic and protracted efforts to combat the various diseases and pests which beset Australian tobacco crops, and I appreciate the splendid job done by that body. The fact remains, however, that tobacco growing is an industry of fluctuating fortunes. If things had gone light with the industry it.might. at this time of acute shortage of dollars, have been of untold value to our national economy. Nevertheless, one cannot overlook the fact that because of the short-sightedness of the Government, and of the Minister .for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> in particular, the industry has received no assistance, and that is largely responsible for its present condition. The treatment  meted out to the tobacco industry by the Government is in line with its attitude towards many rural industries. </para>

                    <para>.- The further contribution which I desire to make to the debate is to bring to the attention of the committee a telegram which I have received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shorten, president</inline> cf the Southern Queensland Tobacco Growers Association, who telegraphed me after he had listened to a broadcast of the debate last night. He states that the first mOve which the Government should make is to "improve marketing so as to assure growers' full commercial value for leaf produced ". 1 was most interested to hear the speech of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard),</inline> and I appreciate the problems and difficulties confronting the Government in regard to this industry. However, the Minister says we have no right to use' the term " sinister ". as applied to- purchases. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shorten</inline> does not employ that term, and I hesitate to use it. However, I am satisfied that growers have good reason to be dissatisfied with the methods' of marketing which have obtained in', the industry. The first sales of tobacco crops' in any season, invariably realize the best prices. It is said that the major- company buying for  all. manufacturers pays the better price, until the demands of the smaller manufacturers are met, when the prices have fallen. That happens year, after year, and although growers have in many years held back samples of the first part of their crop sold for purposes of comparison with the latter part, the large companies invariably allege, that the tobacco, which they purchase is of inferior quality to that sold earlier, arguing that, in consequence, they are entitled to purchase it at a lower price. When things like that happen year after, year they cannot be due to mere coincidence, and this is an injustice suffered by groovers to which I have drawn attention many times previously. Before any other action is taken to improve the lot of tobacco growers that is something which should be remedied. </para>

                    then urges the payment of "government assistance to solve production problems ". I do not know exactly what he had in mind, but from the latter part of his telegram I assume he means the payment of financial assistance for the purpose of combating disease and pests. Like manyothers,I believed that mould, the principal disease to which tobacco crops grown in this country are susceptible, could be overcome by spraying with benzol, but evidently that is not so. The exceptionally wet season which has prevailed in all parts of Australia has evidently had a detrimental . effect on the Queensland tobacco crop.

                <para>The nextstep which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shorten</inline> . urges should betaken is . the provisionof additional water supplies for irrigation ". An adequate supply of water for irrigation purposesis particularly essential in the district where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shorten</inline> . operates. Supplies of water for irrigation have been promised bysuccessive Stategovernments for many years,but nothing has been done toimplement those promises. However, the present . Government in Queensland hasundertaken to provide water for that purpose,and Itrustthat its promisewill provean exceptionto the rule. </para>

                    then mentionsthematter of" premium payments ". Atpresent they are madeonthe following basis, namely: Leafwhichsells at27d. perlb. ormore, 9d. perlb.leafwhich sells at 18d. to 26d.  per  lb., 6d.  per  lb.; leaf which sells at 15d. to17d.  perlb.,  3d.  per  lb. However,  the  Minister, in the course, of his speech, omitted to state  that  those premiums  are  paid by  the  tobacco manufacturers, and  not  by  the  Government. Honorable members will realize, therefore,that the Government is  not  giving  any  financial assistance to this industry, which  has  always  been  " on the bread-line". In this  respect,  tobacco falls into  the  same categoryas cotton.  Previous  governments have failed to  provide  a sufficient return to  the  growers of cotton  and tobacco  to encourage  production  in sufficient quantities. Had they  done  so,  the  country would undoubtedly have  been  saved much of  the  embarrassment caused by the present shortage of dollars.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shorten</inline>
                    states,  that  growers  are  of  the  unanimous opinion  that  premium payments should be made by  the Government, and not  by manufacturers. The aadoption of that proposal would , of course, involve the Government  jn the  payment of a subsidy,  and  growers askforpaymentof a subsidyof9d. per lb. for all grades  of  tobacco leaf. Whilst I agree  thatpayment of  a subsidy is necessary,I disagree with  the  proposal that a uniform rate should be paid for  all  production, irrespective of its quality.Myexperienceof industry is opposed to  the  adoption of  any  such prpposal. Growers argue that payment  of the  subsidy by  the  Government, instead ofbythe manufacturers, would result in fairer treatment  for them.  They advocate  that  if they  are paidonthe  basisof a " table of limits ", plus , a subsidy which theycontendtheyare entitledto receive, it would provide a greater incentiveto them to produce more tobacco.
                </para>
                <para>The price paidto growers  of  tobacco leaf inthiscountry  has  never  been  satisfactory,and Irepeatthestatement I made yesterday,thatanincreaseof tariff duty on  imported  leafwill  not  encourage  growerstoimprove thequality of  their product.However, ifthey know that they will receive asatisfactory price I believe that they willcooperatewiththeGovernment  and  restore  the  industry, which  has almostgone out  ofexistence, to a nationalasset. </para>
                <para>Labour isanotherproblemwhich confrontstobbacco-growers.TheMinis- ter suggested that the industry might, with  advantage, be mechanized. I disagree with that contention, because if it is capable of being mechanized at all, it could be mechanized only to a limited degree. I cannot imagine how a machine could be utilized to pick grubs off tobacco plants every morning, or to gather leaves as they mature. An entire tobacco crop is not harvested at one time, the operation is progressive. Difficulties. would present themselves to the use of machinery in several cultural operations. If this, industry is to succeed we must be prepared to supply labour. I rose to put before the committee the point of view of the growers, who say unanimously that their proposals provide the solution of the main difficulties. Unless a price is given that will encourage growers to produce - not a borderline price - we shall never get the production that is needed. </para>

                    <para>. - I spoke last night upon this important industry as it affects Australia. J was surprised to hear the Minister make the best speech for the monopolist that I have ever heard from, a member of a so-called democratic Government. He probably spoke as he did because of his ignorance of the real position, but nevertheless his speech was merely a defence of the monopolist. He concluded his wandering remarks by saying, in effect, that if the quality is good the price will be right. That means the price paid by the manufacturers, but I do not trust them any more than anyone else does on this side of the committee. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Government is throwing this industry into the hands of a foreign element. Only certain types of persons will be able to make a success of tobacco-growing in Australia and they are the people accustomed to a lower standard of living than Australians, such as Yugoslavs and others from south-eastern Europe. Some fifteen years ago the Canadians fought to save their agricultural industry and to prevent their standard of living being lowered by reason of an influx of immigrants accustomed to a lower standard than 'themselves. The same position is now arising in Australia. Honorable members on this side of the chamber want a prosperous yeomanry and not the indigent peasantry that this Government is sponsoring by its actions. It is probable that the Minister made his defence of the monopolist, as it was in effect, because he had not taken the trouble to ascertain the technique of tobacco-growing. Other honorable members have referred to it and to the patience that is required, but only in passing. I have grown tobacco from a seed bed. We used to cut whole stalks down, put two across a pole and carry them into a tobacco -shed. That was the procedure 30 years ago, but the technique now requires the use of kilns. To meet the present requirements of the cigarette market, the tobacco leaf has to be stripped periodically, in other words, it is necessary to adopt the technique of the Hollanders in countries like Sumatra. Honorable members opposite would be enlightened if they visited that country and talked to the people who are making a success of tobacco-growing there. I do not wonder that the Hollanders are fighting the barbarians for their rights and for the return of their plantations. </para>
                <para>When tobacco-growing land there has bean used for five years, it is spelled and not used again for ten years. The private companies of the Hollanders , have research organizations continuously at work, hut in Australia the policy is haphazard and go-as-you-please, despite the fact that we have established the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I do not know of one government experimental farm that is assisting the growers here in the same way as the private research organizations in Sumatra and Malaya are helping growers there. The tobacco leaf grown in eastern Sumatra is produced essentially for cigar coverings and is so assiduously culled that much of it is destroyed. I was reliably informed by a Hollander that there are about 30 different classifications of leaf. There are some for length, some for colour and others for flavour width and so on. </para>
                <para>If we are to put the industry on a proper basis in Australia and to have a prosperous yeomanry rather than an indigent peasantry, the price of tobacco leaf to the grower must be guaranteed by the Government. It is useless for the Minister to. run away from the problem- and to say that if the colour or the quality is right the price will be right. He criticized the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> for using theword " sinister ". I say there is a sinister synchronizationof circumstances in this matter. Surely that is so if the tobacco companies are to dictate the price and appoint their own appraisers. In this situation, the Minister should not take objection to the word, bad as it is, and loath as I am to use it. The Commonwealth Government must give premiums or prizes for the superior quality tobacco so that the super-grower may be rewarded. Despite the difficult technique of tobacco-growing,there are still many Australians who are highly qualified for the task. The second-class lands in the far north, despised by many people, will come into their own as suitable areas for the growing of cotton and tobacco if the grower is guaranteed a fair price for his product. I ask the Government to see to it that 3s. 6d. per lb. will not be regarded as the highest price for first-class leaf. At 5s. per lb., the good class leaf will be produced. </para>

                    <para>.- Prior to the suspension of the sitting, the committee was discussing the question of reverting to the pre-war duty upon tobacco. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard),</inline> when replying to the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> exhibited considerable pique,  a  fact I was sorry to note because he was not a member of the Parliament when this industry was established. Consequently, I am afraid that he based his remarks upon wrong assumptions. I am afraid that his predecessor in office, the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully),</inline> who has spoken in this debate as though he had a monopoly of. knowledge of the industry, has misled him. The Minister should appreciate the fact that several honorable members on this side of the chamber have actually grown tobacco, whilst others have discharged responsibilities of administration in respect of the industry. I am sure that, as an enthusiastic Minister, he is avid for the latest ideas concerning the industry, because tobacco culture offers a means to this country of earning dollars. Faced, as we are at present, with a dollar strin gency, that aspect should considerably agitate the Minister's mind. However, as I have said, the Minister exhibited considerable pique when replying to the honorable member for Indi, whereas he would have acted with more wisdom had he thanked the honorable member for his very thoughtful speech. Obviously, the honorable member for Indi is an authority on the industry.  His  electorate includes the Ovens Valley, which is the biggest tobacco-growing district in Victoria. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Minister would be well-advised to study the facts of the case. He admitted that a previous Labour administration made a blunder when, during the depression, it placed a crude and fantastic duty upon tobacco, with the result that speculators found it easy to "palm off" land upon which they pursuaded settlers to grow tobacco. Those persons found that they could not make tobacco growing pay. As the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blain)</inline> emphasized, quality is most important. If tobacco leaf of the proper grade is grown it can be sold, but it is impossible to dispose of cabbage-leaf varieties. Only suitable land should be used for the production of tobacco leaf. Coarse and dark varieties cannot be forced upon consumers. Honorable members opposite have thrown many stones at the BritishAustralasian Tobacco Company. It is true that that company does the bulk of the business in the handling of tobacco in this country. However, it is equallytrue that thecompany operates with the highest efficiency. The Government in which I was Minister for Trade and Customs provided for the blending of an increasing percentage of Australian leaf in local manufacture. During my term as Minister, I dealt with the very complaint voiced by the Vice-President of the Executive Council when he complained that tobacco grown to-day in the Tarnworth district could not be sold. I had that complaint investigated, not by representatives of any company, but by departmental officers, who reported that growers in that district were attempting to produce tobacco leaf on soil which was utterly unsuitable. However, since those: days the general quality of Australianproduced leaf has improved. This has beenduelargely toresearchencouraged by pastgovernments in the interests of the industry. Those governments realized that given adequate guidance, tobacco growerscando aswell asgrowers of wheat and wool.As the result of thatpolicy, we find to-day that tobacco and cotton, both of which are dollar earners,can beprofitably produced inthiscountry and can helpnot only AustraliabutalsoGreatBritainin meeting the dollarproblem. Thisisanimportant consideration at a time when we read that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),theMinisterfor</inline> Commerce and Agriculture(Mr. Pollard) and a host of officials are exploring tariff schedules with theobject offindingoutwhatproductswe canexportto the United States of America in order to ease the dollar shortage. They will search for a long time before they find what else we can sell to the United States of America. Tobacco and cotton head the list of productsof which we can buy less from that country. </para>
                <para>I  do not put theseviews to theGovernmentinany partisan spirit.  I  advance them in the sincere desire that the Government will investigate them.  I  also point outthat the Government in which  Iwas  Minister for Trade and Customs allocated the sum of £40,000 annually for research work in the interests of thetobaccogrowing industry. Under that scheme inspectors went outamong the farmersgiving them the full benefitof their advice, and, at the same time, the greatest  degree  of experimentation was carried on.Thatworkproved to bemost successful.  I  recall that a cure was discovered for downy mildew and, other diseases which haddecimated tobacco crops inQueensland.Thatpolicy was infinitely better than merely imposing a duty on tobacco,and had itbeen continued Australian growerswould  be producing  considerablymoretobacco leaf thantheyareabletoproduce to-day.If honorable members opposite approach thisproblemfrom a national point of view they willagain implement that policy. If the Ministerfor Commerce andAgriculture tookthe trouble to study what was done by previousgovernments in theinterests of the industry he, also, would support it. The expenditure of £40,000 annually on research effecteda considerableimprovement in thequality of Australian leafandstepped up the productionofmahoganyand lemon colour leaf which isreadily saleable.Butthis vote is not provided for in this Government'sestimates. That provision was madeata time when the Australian Government'srevenue was comparatively small. This Government talks in terms of tens of millions ofpounds. TheAustralian people have never been more heavily taxed than they are at present. Revenueis flowinginto the Government's coffers in such a way that Ministerslike the MinisterforAir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)do not</inline> know what to do with all the money. The Minister for Air cannot think where to put another un- payable Government airline. Ministers are faced with an embarrassment of riches. At the same time, ministers and members are able to takejauntsall round the world. The Australian people are now the most heavily taxed people of the world. Yet, whilst the Government still extorts more taxes, it cannot spare a miserable£40,000a year in order to help the tobacco growers of the Commonwealth to develop their industryand thus earnmore dollars for this country. Whereare the plannerswho have been tellingushow theworldshould be run, and who have been signing agreements at Geneva and, of all places, Havana, where they should have learned something about tobacco, yet at a time like this they cannot realize the importance of the tobacco industry?I believe that when the Minister forCom- m erce andAgriculture thinks the matter over he will go" hot foot " to Cabinet andsay, " We were made to look silly in this debate.You mustallocate £40,000 to helpthis industry. JackDedmanhas just come back from Havana,and he should have learned something.Let him bring down a recommendationthat some allocation be made for research in the interests of the tobacco industry". Inthe lastEstimates a considerable sum wasappopriated forplant culture, but noneof it is being expended on tobacco I should be glad to be corrected on that point if I am wrong. At any rate, the Government is not expending anything like £40,000 ayear in this sphere. However, in view of its record revenues, it  could easily afford to double that appropriation. I again urge the Minister to study the suggestions made in this debate. I hope that be will nol continue to be so impetuous, but, on the contrary, will realize that such suggestions are worth studying just as he has found it worth while to study rabbit skins and other matters with such enthusiasm that his replies to questions on such subjects never take more than a quarter of an hour. </para>

                    <para>.- This is a comprehensive item covering naphtha, benzine, benzoline, gasoline, pentane, petrol and any other petroleum or shale spirit. I believe that the reduction of duty is not sufficient to encourage the project of the National Oil Proprietary Limited at Glen Davis. I have had considerable experience of that project, not only in my present position as a liaison between the mining unions and the Government but also as chairman of the Public Works Committee when it inquired into the project from 1943 to 1945, and even farther back than that, in connexion with the American commission's proposal for a hew plant to extract  old  from shale known as the Renco or  Jackmani  retort. The Public Works Committee included representatives of all the political parties then, represented in the Parliament. After exhaustive inquiries, the committee submitted to the Parliament certain recommendations, including one that while the committee agreed that the  Pumpherston  retorts should be improved, it considered that a pilot plant should be erected to try out the American idea in order to ascertain whether we could recover from 120 to 140 gallons from a ton of shale, which, it was claimed, Lad been shown to be possible by laboratory tests. We found that the retorts had been set up in various places. The Americans claimed that the retort " delivered the goods ", but we were not quite satisfied for we wished to see it operate on what may be  termed  run-of-the-mine shale instead of selected shale without the dirt that would go through with run-of-the-mine shale. That recommendation was carried out in part, but, on my recent visit to Glen Davis, I found that the plant has never been completed, let alone tested. That indicates to me that we waste money in setting up parliamentary committees whose recommendations are not carried out. The committee of which I was chairman was of the opinion that, the system should be given a fair trial, but the excuse now offered is that not sufficient shale is being mined to supply the present plant, despite the fact, that it was put to me, as a miner, that if we could induce the miners at Glen- Davis to agree to a system of extraction of pillars by machinery, sufficient shale would be mined to supply not only the existing plant but also the new Renco or  Jackamani  retort. There must be some reason for the failure. I make it quite clear that miners fear extraction of pillars by machinery. They believe that it endangers their lives. But many of the miners have invested their life savings in. homes at Glen Davis. They do not want the project to close down as a losing proposition, as it has been for a period of years under the control of the National Oil Proprietary Limited. The project has been able to carry on only because the Labour Government has carried the losses. I was at Glen Davis only a fortnight ago and I spoke not only to the miners but also to a. public meeting in an attempt to keep production at as high a level as possible. They have agreed to do so. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> as a member of the Public Works Committee when I was  chairman,  will agree that Glen Davis is completely isolated. It has no amenities, no bathing facilities, no hospital and no hall for pictures, bar a bug and flea-ridden bag place. The people there are living in isolation trying in a period of national emergency to get shale for the nation. </para>

                    <para>. - I have permitted a number of items to pass without asking the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture(Mr. Pollard) for an explanation of the variations of the rates of duty, but I now consider that the time has arrived when he should give to the Committee some information about these matters, because they are of general importance to the Australian industries affected by the duties. At this point, the Minister should explain the various alterations which have been made in the duties applicable to benzol and naphtha. In 1933-39, the British preferential tariff was 6d. a gallon, the intermediate tariff 9d. and the general tariff 9d. On the 2nd May, 1940, the duties were increased to 9d.,1s. and1s. a gallon respectively. In 1946 the British preferential tariff was reduced from 9d. to8d. a gallon, the intermediate tariff from1s. to11d. and the general tariff from1s. to11d. However, those reductions do not restore the pre-war rates. These duties, we know, are imposed for revenue producing purposes,, although they also afford some degree of protection to our local industries. The Minister should also explain to the committee the reasons for these variations. These duties have been validated over a number of years, and honorable members will be interested to know exactly why the duties have fluctuated as they have done. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>A similar explanation is due to the committee in respect of item 277, carbonic acid gas. In . 1933-39, the British preferential tariff was 2d. per lb. and the intermediate and general tariffs were 3d. per lb. In 1940 the rates were increased to1s. 2d.,1s. 3d. and1s. 3d. per lb. respectively. In 1946 the British preferential tariff was reduced to 2d. per lb. and the intermediate tariff and general tariff to 3d. per lb. The reason for that reduction is easily understood, but we have not been informed why the duties applicable to benzol and naphtha have not been restored to the pre-war rates. </para>

                    <para>. - The proposed duties represent an increase of 2d. a gallon on the rates in operation under the customs tariff of 1933-39. In May, 1940, the Menzies Government increased the rates in force in 1939 by 3d. a. gallon. The present Government reduced therate by1d. a gallon in November, 1946. These amendments are consequential upon the alterations of the duty on petrol. Benzol and naphtha may be used as substitutes for petrol, and in order to safeguard revenue it is necessary that the duties on such products be at the same level as those applying to petrol. The item is unimportant as a revenue producer, because importations are relatively small. In 1938-39, immediately before the outbreak of World War II.. the revenue collected was £956 : in 1939 it was £1,275, in 1945-46, £7; and in 1946-47, £4. Therefore, the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> will see that the subject-matter of the item is not of vast importance as a revenue producer or as an imposition on the consumers of this product. </para>

                        <para>.- The Customs Tariff (Southern Rhodesian Preference) Act 1941 provides for a concessional rate of duty on tobacco leaf when imported from Southern Rhodesia. The description of the goods follows the wording of item 19 appearing in the Customs Tariff. As the result of the alteration of the wording of tariff item 19 proposed by the Customs Tariff resolution of the 14th November, 1946, it is necessary to make a consequential alteration to the schedule of the Customs Tariff (Southern Rhodesian Preference) Act. </para>

                    <para>The alteration to which I have referred, was the provision that the minimum quantity of Australian tobacco leaf which could be blended with' imported leaf in order to qualify the latter for concessional rates of duty, was to be varied in accordance with the size of the Australian tobacco crop. Previously, provision was made that a fixed percentage of Australian leaf was required to be blended with the imported leaf. Honorable members will see that the proposal is on all fours with the proposal in relation to tobacco imported from sources other than Southern Rhodesia. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendments now proposed to the Excise Tariff are associated with 'Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1, of the 14th November, 1946, and are designed to implement reductions of duty as part of the Government's  1946  budget .programme. The reduction of Id. a gallon, in the rates of duty specified in item 11 of this resolution is complementary to the reduction of Id. a gallon in customs duties on petrol and allied petroleum products provided for in Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 of the 14th November, 1946. Honorable members will note from the memorandum of alterations that a number of changes in item 11 have occurred since it was enacted in 1939. First, the rates were increased by 3d. a gallon from the 3rd May, 1940, as a revenue measure. On the 21st August, 1940, the item was amended to cover coal tar and coke area distillates other than benzol, and the rates on liquid fuel produced from both indigenous shale and coal were reduced to encourage and speed up production of fuel in Australia. At the time the Menzies Government gave an assurance to producers that, provided they were in production by the 2.1st August, 1942, they would be given protection against imported petrol for a period of fifteen years. The item was worded accordingly. . War-time circumstances prevented some producers from commencing production by the date stipulated and the item was subsequently amended to remove this condition. The amendment of the 5th March, 1942, was effected to make the item more comprehensive. The definition of " beer " is also being amended for administrative purposes. </para>

                    <para>. - I am rather interested in what the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> has said. I realize that certain administrative changes are provided for in the proposals that the committee, is considering, but so far We have not. heard very much about them. I invite the Minister to tell the committee just what is intended, and how the changes are likely to affect tariff and excise duties generally. I take it that we are now dealing comprehensively with the entire schedule. That means that we have an opportunity to discuss, for instance, an amendment to the definition of beer. We are also able to discuss excise duties imposed upon " Petroleum or Shale Products, viz. : Petrol, Benzine, Benzoline, Gasoline, Naphtha, Pentane." and so on. This, of course, opens up the entire field of petrol rationing and the production of oil from shale - the matter with which the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jamas)</inline> was dealing so ably a few minutes ago. We are also at liberty to discuss, I take it, " Coal Tar and Coke Oven Distillates " &amp;c, mentioned in item  13  (c) and "Petroleum and Shale Distillates " &amp;c, mentioned in item  11  (b). First, I should like to know the reason for the addition of the definition of beer. This, of course, is a suitable subject for discussion on a hot evening in. Canberra, and, although, I am not one who is addicted to this beverage, I am so interested that T should like to know the meaning of the words - </para>

                <para class="block">That all sounds very nice. Am I to assume that we now have better methods of brewing? No doubt the Minister, with his vast knowledge and great experience, will be able to tell me what- is meant by *hat definition. </para>
                <para>I come now to certain remarks made earlier in the debate by the honorable member for Hunter. It is' true that' I was a member of the Public Works Committee when, in the early days of World War II., it investigated the production of oil from shale at Glen Davis and Baerami. I was vastly interested in the possibilities of these fields, and of others including Latrobe, which we all believed, gave great hopes of the production in this country of necessary wartime fuels. In the course of our investigations we came across a retort known as the Renco retort which, it was claimed, gave a yield that was staggering compared with that of other retorts. The company interested in the Glen Davis deposits took over this retort with the idea of using it as a pilot plant, and, in the event of satisfactory operation, installing others throughout the works. It was taken up to Glen Davis. The committee saw the plant in its dismantled state where the foundations had been set for its erection. We were then told that it would be erected within a period of ten months. The honorable member for Hunter greatly interested himself in this matter on behalf of  his  electorate and because of the great knowledge which he has of the subject. As chairman of the Public Works Committee, he received assurances that the Glen Davis management proposed to go ahead with the erection of the retort. The committee was informed in evidence that great losses had been sustained in the Glen Davis field. We knew that private enterprise was waiting to develop the Baerami field and was awaiting a report as to the suitability or otherwise of the Renco retort before setting up retorts at Baerami. However, the management at Glen Davis, for its own reasons, did not go ahead with the erection of that retort. I am not sure, but I believe that it has not yet been installed. Its vast possibilities have never been explored. </para>
                <para>The losses sustained by the present method of retorting might well be reduced considerably if the Renco retort were installed and put into operation. Early reports as to its efficiency should be tested. At, the time the Public Works Committee visited Glen Davis, it was said that the company operating at Baerami had every intention of installing Renco retorts in that field ifthe installation at Glen Davis proved to be successful. It was claimed that the more efficient results obtainable from the Renco retort would have paid handsomely in the early days of retorting, even at the higher excise duty applied by this Government. However, the retort is still lying idle at Glen Davis. I do not know whether it has rusted away completely, but at any rate its possibilities have not been exploited. I suggest to the Minister that action should be taken to bring that retort up to date. The results obtained from it might justify the installation of a battery of similar retorts. I shall not discuss the subject further because I know that the honorable member for Hunter wants to deal with it. Because of his earlier difficulties in attempting to discuss this subject on another item, I have endeavoured to give him an indication that he can discuss it now. </para>

                </continue><para>I have visited Glen Davis, as the honorable member for Wentworth knows, on three occasions. I have learned that the retort mentioned by the honorable gentleman has not yet been installed although the Public Works Committee recommended to the Government that it should be erected and tested. It has been only partially erected. When my remarks were ruled out of order earlier this evening, I was endeavouring to point out that sufficient shale could not be produced to supply the Pumpherston retorts, which arenow in use. I went to Glen Davis at the request of the miners federation, to ask the men to extract pillars by machine, which is a very dangerous process. They agreed to do so in order to try and save the homes which they had established there. </para><para>Other governments as well as the present Government have been interested in the extraction of oil from shale under the management of National Oil Proprietary Limited. The project has been a losing one, but we want to try to make it profitable in order that the employees who have gone to Glen Davis to live will have at least some security. These men have put all of their assets into that place, and they want the project to become an economic success. I have never known men and' women more willing to make their town a congenial place. The men are working hard in an endeavour to keep up the output of shale. Many factors contribute to the fact that the maximum possible production is not being maintained at Glen Davis. One of these is the lack of a satisfactory housing scheme. Homes are not provided for married workers. A man does not like to maintain two homes, one for himself at Glen Davis and another for his wife at Lithgow or elsewhere. </para><para>The State Government has been asked to build homes in that locality in order that the population may be increased and the output of shale maintained. However, the Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGirr,</inline> has " passed the buck " to the Australian Government and has said that the matter is one for National Oil Proprietary Limited, which is dependent on this Government. That is what has been reported to me. I do not say that it is correct, but it calls for an answer by some responsible person. Furthermore, the State Government will not consider erecting a hospital or even a child welfare clinic. These things affect the success of the Glen Davis project. The building of houses and a hospital would contribute towards saving the money that has been sunk, or at any rate invested, in the Glen Davis proposition by this Government, and by previous governments. We want to make the project a profitable one. If my ideas, which are the ideas submitted to me by the people who live at Glen Davis, are carried out, I sincerely believe that the project can be made to succeed and the homes of the people saved. </para><para>The Joint <inline font-style="italic">_ Goal</inline> Board would not interest itself in providing houses and amenities for the workers at Glen Davis. <inline font-style="italic">lt</inline> asserted that it had no right to do so, because the word " coal " is not mentioned in relation to the process. The Joint Coal Board, therefore, washed its hands of the matter, stating that it could, not provide the same amenities for shale workers as for coal-miners. In my opinion, it would be an easy matter for the Government to bring the employees of National Oil Proprietary Limited within the ambit of the Joint Coal Board so that they may share in the improved, amenities which are to be provided for coal-miners in the near future. Why should the sick child of a miner employed at Glen Davis have  to  be transported 50 miles to Lithgow hospital? It is ridiculous that people employed at Glen Davis should be denied ordinary hospital facilities. No provision whatever is made for maternity cases, and the result is that expectant mothers often give birth to babies while pt&gt;, <inline font-style="italic">route</inline> to the maternity hospital at Lithgow. It is tragic to think that people who are engaged in &lt;i vital national enterprise should be treated in such h fashion. A great dp.al will have to bp done to provide reasonable amenities. The schedule under discussion specifically mentions "beverages", which, of course, includes beer. It is the right of a working man at Glen Davis to enjoy a drink of beer at the end of his day's work, just <inline font-style="italic">w</inline> black-coated workers do in metropolitan areas. But for three days in every week no beer is available to him. What is the result? Pedlars of "plonk" visit the valley and. sell it to the miners. Those who consume this cheap wine and have a drink of water the following morning find themselves " on the booze " again. </para><continue>

Yet those miners are supposed to work contentedly . and to maintain an output sufficient to  meet the nation's ' requirements.

                </quote><para>Honorable members who have been members of Parliament for any. length of time recognize that I have always been interested in the coal industry, and in the extraction of oil from shale and coal. In my opinion there is ample scope for both industries, and in any case, there is more' coal in this country than oil shale. Tests of Maitland coal have proved that it contains from 12 to 15 per cent, of oil, a higher percentage than is found in coal won in any other part of .the world. As the result of my recent journey through Germany I made certain recommendations to the Government. In the preparation of my report and recommendations 1 was greatly assisted by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beazley</inline> of Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd., an expert whom I met in Munster, whose services had been loaned to the Allied coal control authorities in north Germany. This gentleman advised me that the Australian Government would be well advised not to accept one or two Fischer-Tropsch retorts, hut to seek the service's of German experts to visit Australia and erect retorts for the extraction of oil from coal. I felt that that would be the better course to take. These men, who were forced to work for the Nazis, were quite prepared to give us the benefit of their experience of the plants they had operated in Ger: many and to assist in installing new plant here. To transport plant covering 5 to 10 acres of ground would require two vessels of the size of <inline font-style="italic">Queen Mary.</inline> I supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beazley's</inline> recommendation and strongly urged the Government to accept it. </para><para>The criticism can be offered that there is not at present sufficient coal to satisfy the needs of industry, but I do not believe that situation to be permanent. The attempts of the miners' federation to impose discipline in the coal-fields will, I am sure, result eventually in an adequate supply of coal becoming available for normal industrial use, as well as for the conduct of experiments designed to alleviate the present shortage of flow oil by extracting oil from solids such as shale and coal. There are greater quantities of coal available than of shale, and it is cheaper to mine coal than shale. We are importing almost all of our oil fuel. To employ our people at extracting oil from solids, even though, the resultant product may cost more than imported oil, will be far better than to do what was done during the years from 1930, almost up to the outbreak of the last war, when we paid out " doles " to the extent of £15,000,000 a year. In such circumstances Australia would not be dependent upon other countries for oil supplies if another war occurs. I trust it will not, but if we make no attempt to safeguard ourselves in this way. we may be deprived entirely of oil supplies. Although there is a shortage of coal, I believe it is time that we began these experiments. We should bring these Germans here so that they may give us the benefit of the knowledge they have gained by operating plants economically with coal of inferior quality. </para></speech>

                <para>I agree that it is necessary for the Government to secure, if possible, a reduction in the quantity of petrol used in this country. Australia imports approximately 33,000,000 gallons per month, and a few million gallons are obtained by way of extraction from shale. It should be possible to reduce consumption by 10 per cent. Two cuts have already been made, one of 10 per cent. in October last, and another of 10 per cent. in November last. An investigation of the figures might be expected to reveal a substantial reduction in the quantity of oil sold by the oil companies. I have not yet been able to obtain the complete figures, but those I have show that there has been practically no reduction in petrol consumption in Australia, despite the two cuts to which I. have referred. </para>

                <para>An enormous sum of public money has been squandered by the Government on the so-called extraction of oil from shale at Glen Davis. Figures issued by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> show that since its establishment National Oil Proprietary Limited, has been advanced £3,091,000 of public money. Including interest of £287,000, a total expenditure of £3,378,000 of Commonwealth funds has been involved at Glen Davis. As the honorable member for Hunter has pointed out, there is practically nothing to show for it. </para>
                <para>I have not available at the moment exact figuresof production at Glen Davis, but I believe that the total production would represent no more than a bagatelle so far as Australia's requirements are concerned. The cost of producing petrol at Glen Davis is out of all proportion to the economics of the project. It is proposed to impose an excise duty of 3d. a gallon upon production up to 10,000,000 gallons - I do not believe that anything approaching 10,000,000 gallons a year has yet been reached at Glen Davis - and, thereafter, duty at the rate of 8½d. a gallon is to be applied. In any case, what is the sense of these duties when all of the money involved is government money?

Therefore, we cannot mei-elynbrush-asideuthe. matter by pointing . to . the unnlcasant features to which I have . referred. . The Latrobe  shale . 'oil deposits , . have never . been  prope.rly:exploited. I have discussed the history of the field with,ma.ny. local people who -have, . resided.- in j that area for many  years. . A, German . engineer installed! the  old . plant ,  at. iLatrobe. .  It.* is . still there,  being, a. reminder of., an, honest attempt to produce, petrol .  f.rom . shale. -Ehe',.ipoint I' emphasize is. that- within : 'fehe ..lasti.i'30 years no- really 'effective attempt . -has i been -.made- toiexplore the  possibilities of&lt; the- '-shale  oil deposits ;jt Latrobe.' I am aware' of the argument that the deposits are not large enough, to make their exploitation economical and that the cost of production would be very high. Surely our need to produce petrol in this country to-day should stimulate the Government, if not individual companies, to explore the possibilities of those deposits. Recently, I heard rumours that the land bearing the deposits at Latrobe had been leased to an oil company for a period of 50 years. I am wondering, whether, as has often happened in respect of other promising oil-bearing deposits, an attempt is being made to discourage the development of the Latrobe deposits. To-day, for the first time in . our history, and for the reasons I have mentioned, a sincere attempt is being made to produce petrol in Australia. All shale deposits, wherever  they exist throughout the Commonwealth, including the Latrobe deposits should now be genuinely tested and such efforts should not be abandoned until every possible test has been made. I repeat that no such attention has yet been given to the deposits at Latrobe. Even if the field could be operated for Tasmania only, it would be of tremendous assistance, as all our petrol is imported from the mainland, and that, of course, at times causes us great concern as well as higher costs. So I put these facts to the committee in order to keep the matter before us so that the possibilities of Latrobe shall not be regarded as hopeless. Our Government ' should be inspired to every effort, oven though there may be losses in the initial stages, to get the desperately needed petrol from our own shale deposits. </para>

                    <para>. --I was a member of the Public "Works Committee that was authorized during the war to inquire into our shale deposits. We inquired into shale deposits throughout Australia. "We- did not consider there was any possibility of the successful use of the Latrobe deposits. There had been at some long distant date an attempt to produce motor spirit from that shale. The deposit is slight. There are  agreat many disabilities in its use. There is a hard pebble through a great section of it. Our opinion was that it was quite impossible to produce shale oil at a figure that would encourage any go vernment, even in a time of war, to use it. We decided that there was a possibility of success at Glen Davis. We believed that with the use of Renco retorts there was a chance that we might be able to . produce motor spirit there at a cost that, in war-time conditions, would justify the Government in spending money on it. I do not believe that intime of peace any government is justified in spending a considerable sum of money on any of the shale deposits. I believe that there is a possibility that we should be justified in considering the production of oil from coal. . We have wonderful coal deposits in New South Wales, but, unfortunately, our experience has-been for the last four or five years that we cannot produce sufficient coal from the New South Wales fields to carry on essential industries - gas works, steel works and railways. I believe that in Victoria possibly the best opportunity of producing spirit from coal is provided by the vast brown coal deposits of Gippsland, about which the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> can speak authoritatively. When one considers that there we have deposits running a distance of 100 miles' and varying from 100 to 150 feet in depth one can imagine that with the adoption of the proper method, of hydrogenation, the, method used in Germany, there is a possibility of producing motor spirit at a cost that would justify the Government in spending money on it. I do not believe that the Government would be justified in spending money on experiments in the production of oil from the coal in New South Wales - the deposits there are too valuable from other points of view - but the second-grade coal of Gippsland provides justification for the Government to bring the best experts available to Australia from Germany where, owing to absence of natural oil, they were forced to produce oil from coal. The Government would, be justified in spending a large sum of money in developing the Gippsland coal deposits for the production of oil, but, as the results of the investigations of the Public Works Committee, . I do not believe that the shale oil deposits are worth developing in any circumstances, other than to meet the exigencies of war. </para>

The Bronter retort was in operation and quite a lot of fuel was produced.I used some of it on occasions. I can verify the honorable member's remarks about the vapours that resulted from its use.  I  was running a ten-year-old Hudson and getting about  10  miles a gallon. With a certain amount of commercial petrol in my petrol tank, mixed with the local product, I went from Latrobe to Wynyard, a distance of  40  miles, on just over a gallon.

                        <para>- There was no one behind me for many miles. I was not happy about the smell, myself. But the power was there, without doubt. It was an enormously powerful spirit. The one difficulty, of course, was the lack of refining, and the odor was terrific. Of course, some damage would be done to the car engine if one ran too long on the spirit. The real trouble was the sulphur content, which, at that time, could not be eliminated. It so happens that about eighteen months ago I met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Bronter, who was then operating the retort. It was his father, an American, who designed it. He has now severed all connexion with that kind of work, certainly with the Latrobe field. But he assures me that, as the result of knowledge gained from recent experiments, it would now be commercially possible to undertake the refining of the output from Latrobe. He says that, in his opinion, because of limitations of which the committee has been informed, petrol produced from Latrobe shale would never be able to compete even with petrol produced from other Australian . shales. It cannot be produced economically enough to make it worth exporting from Tasmania. He spent two or three years on a complete survey of the field, and he assures me that it is capable of producing sufficient petrol to meet all Tasmania's needs. </para>

                <para>The honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin)</inline> said that, in his opinion, as a member of the committee that investigated the Australian shale deposits, it would not be feasible to produce petrol from Australian shale, except under conditions of war. Quite obviously, you cannot begin to produce from shale under conditions of war. The foundations must be laid before the emergency arises. So. I suggest that now is the time to begin the experiments. The general situation in regard to petrol and, I say with great reluctance, the general situation with regard to war, are such that it would be wise to make whatever provision for the production of petrol within Australia we possibly can. So, I commend to the Government that it proceed with the use of the Renco retort, which has proved to be so very much more capable of results than any other retorts hitherto used in Australia. I particularly ask that in the event of any such work being carried out, the Latrobe field be examined most carefully, having regard to the fact that, as far as I am aware, at any rate, it is the only petrol-bearing mineral in Tasmania. </para>

                    <para>.- Another subject apropos this is : what is to be the fate of the power alcohol distilleries that were erected during the war to produce motor spirit from wheat? In an answer to a question asked by me, I ascertained that about  £2,000,000  was expended on these distilleries and that about a dozen pints of spirit was produced. They did not function, for what reason I do not know. In any event, wheat is too valuable to be used in the production of spirit. Has the Government disposed of those distilleries? One of them was placed most strategically in the electorate of Wimmera which was then represented by one no 'longer with  "UB,  who rs the . admanaswator 'of Noxfo'l'k Island "now. </para>

                <para class="block">The Auditor-General'sreport on National Oil Prroprietary Limited's workings at GlenDavis isoneof the most disturbing documentsthathonorable members  have  seen for a long time. Year byyear, the expenditure of the Commonwealthin this undertaking has beenincreasing. Advancesmadeby the Commonwealth during the twelve months endedthe 31st December, 1946, amounted to£385,918, bringing the total Commonwealthloans at that date to £3,291,735. Only the original advance of£334,000 has been covered by a deed of covenant  and  charge. When this undertaking first began to operate, Australia was engaged in World War II., and it was considered that the physicalmeans of conveying petrol to this  country  might be completely cut off by enemy action. Thatdanger does not exist to-day, and the question which honorable members should now ask themselves is whether it is worthwhile that the Australian public, whoaresorely harassed by taxes,should be burdened with thisgreat incubus of the Glen Davis project under NationalOil Proprietary Limited. Financially, the Australian Government, and the Government of New South Wales, are heavily involved. </para>
                <para>Whenwe examine the AuiditorGeneral's report relating to production, we find that none of the estimates of production, either at thebeginning or during the period of the existence of this undertaking, has been realized. In particular, I direct attention to replies which the Minister for SupplyandShipping (Senator Ashley) gave to questions asked by ex-Senator Brand about this matter.On one occasion in 1945, ex-Senator Brand asked when it was considered that National Oil Proprietary Limited's undertaking would reach the target figure of 10,000,000 gallons per annum. In a most optimistic spirit, the Minister said that it was expected that the undertaking would reach the production of 10,000,000 gallons in March, 1946. From an examination of the Auditor-General's report,I find that the company produced 1,303,000 gallons in 1944, 2,224,000 gallons in 1945 and 4,079,000 gallons in 1946. I shall be interested to hear the Ministerfor Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> inform the committee what was the production by the undertaking in 1947, because NationalOilProprietary Limitedisnot meetingthe estimates of production that were madein respect of the Glen Davis project. According to the Auditor-General's report, theselling price of petrol, after excluding excise, was 1s. 3.42d.a gallonin1946,1s. 5d. a gallon in1945, and1s. 7¼d. in1944, and sales of petrol realized £199,720 in 1946, £127,623 in 1945 and , £80,854 in 1944: The losses on operations in those years were £301,000, £342,000 and £303,000 respectively.Itseems to be extraordinarily bad business that in the production and sale of £199,000 worth of a product,  a  loss of £401,000 should be incurred. Isitany  wonder  that the people of this countryare unable to obtain anyrelief from high taxes? Is it right that this great undertaking should be permitted to continue to lose approximately £500,000 a year ? Provision has beenmade in theEstimates for the current financial yearfor assistance to the Glen Davisprojectamounting to £239,000. That figure seems very low indeed when one considers that the loss on the undertaking has grown steadily from£263,000 in1942, to £401,000 in 1946. I should be interested to hear from the Minister whatloss has been incurred in the current financial year. Inreply to a question earlier to-day, the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)was</inline> informed that it was not possible to manufacture largerquantities of wire netting, steel fencing posts, and other articles urgently required by the man. on the land if he is to produce the commodities that are necessary to alleviate the food shortage in Great Britain. The reason given by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture for the inability to increase production of these requirements was the shortage of manpower; yet the Government is prepared to continue to foster a project which  has  proved wasteful, not only of man-power, but also of revenue contributed by Australian taxpayers. A loss of approximately £500,000 a year is not insignificant. One can only assume that with losses increasing not in arithmetical progression, but in a manner reminiscent of steep taxation curves, this little bouncing baby will probably be losing £750,000 or more a year in the not distant future, because, as the infant's age increases, it becomes more and more voracious in its demand upon the taxpayers of this country. Therefore, the Government might well consider whether the continuance of the Glen Davis project is justified, or whether it should be scrapped entirely,particularly in view of its inability to produce even half the estimated quantities of petrol. The continued losses are adding enormously to the capital indebtedness of the undertaking, and the Government cannot hope to recover its investment. Abandonment of the project would release man-power for the production of essential requirements such as steel for housing. The undertaking was established purely for war purposes. It was a safeguard against the risk of Australia being cut off from its overseas oil supplies; but apparently once this socialist Government, which believes that no socialist administration ever makes mistakes in planning, starts the flywheel going, it cannot be stopped. It continues at increasing speed, year after year, creating so many vested interests in Government departments that opposition to it is swept aside. . At Glen Davis to-day, petrol is being produced at enormous cost and can only be sold for much less than its real value. Again I say that the project should be. thoroughly investigated with a view to diverting the man-power now engaged in it to more essential occupations than the production of minute quantities of petrol. Labour is required urgently for the production  of  commodities, export of which will assist materially the dollar battle that is now taking place, and of food for the people of Great Britain. In addition there is a shortage of certain commodities such as textiles in this country. Throughout the Commonwealth hundreds of homes await roofs and fittings, while Australian citizens are denied their rightful inheritance. </para>

                        <para>. -This tariff proposal implemented the Government's decision to reduce the rate of excise duty on spirit used in the fortification of wine consequent upon the cessation of payment of wine export bounty. Under the provisions of the Wine Export Bounty Act 1939-1944, an amount of 2s. 6d. a gallon from the excise duty imposed on spirit for the fortification of wine had been transferred to a trust account from which bounty had been paid. With the cessation of the payment of bounty by the expiration of the Wine Export Bounty Act 1939-1944 it was unnecessary to transfer this amount from excise collections and it was therefore decided to reduce the rate of duty on fortifying spirit by 2s. 6d. a gallon. A further amendment to the item was the elimination of the provision for special rates of duty on spirit used in fortifying grape must prior to the 13th March, 1930. The quantity of such spirit yet to be cleared from bond is negligible and the continuance of special provision was not considered necessary. The simplification of the item results in a flat rate of 4s. a gallon being applied to spirit for the fortification of wine. </para>

                            <para>.- This proposal is the first of a group of four tariff proposals which were tabled in Parliament on the 14th November, 1947, viz. :  - Customs Tariff Amendment No. 2, Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Amendment No. 1, Customs Tariff (Canadian Preference) Amendment No. 1, and Customs Tariff (Exchange Adjustment) Amendment No. 1. The Government made certain decisions in respect of the basis of value for duty of imported goods which were jointly implemented by the four tariff proposals tabled on the 14th November, 1947, and I propose now to refer in detail to these decisions and allow it to serve mainly as an explanation of the associated tariff proposals, which will be dealt with later by the committee. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>Towards the end of last year, Parliament approved of a bill to amend the Customs Act to provide for the calculation of value for duty of imported goods in Australian currency and to abolish the addition of the statutory 10 per cent. to the f.o.b. value of imported goods. Prior to this amendment, the Customs Act provided that all duties should be paid in British currency and that the value of goods shown on. invoices should be converted to British currency. While Australian currency was on par with that of the United Kingdom the position was satisfactory, but when Australian currency was depreciated in 1930 the paradoxical procedure arose of calculating the value for duty of goods in United Kingdom currency, applying a rate of duty of, say, 10 per cent., and accepting the resultant figures as duty in Australian currency. </para>
                        <para>A further practice which was in opera tion was the loading of the f.o.b. price of imported goods with a statutory charge of 10 per cent. before arriving at the value for duty.Theprovisionappeared in the original Customs Actof 1901, but lost its significance in later years. <inline font-style="italic">The</inline> ii...-. of the amendment to the Customs Act whichwas passed the endof last year was to inincreasethefigure atwhich thevalue <inline font-style="italic">for</inline> duty wasexpressed. For example,a previous value for duty of £110sterlingisnewexpressedas£125 Australian.Thiswouldhaveresultedin increased duties being ; collected if the tariffhad valorem rates had remained unchanged. As the amendment to the Customs Act was purely for administrative purposes, it wasnecessary to reduce ad valorem ratesby 12 per- cent,to ensure that approximately the same amount of duty would.be collectedas previously.If the exact 12 per cent, reduction had been  appliedin all instances, however, many fractional rates would have resulted and it wasdecided to eliminate theseby adjusting all reduced rates to the nearest 21/2per cent. The maximum variation from the formulais11/4per cent, increase ordecrease,and in most cases it is considerably smaller. </para>
                        <para class="block">It wasalso decided, consequent upon the expression of value for ,  duty in Australian currency, that it would be preferable to eliminate the provision for exchange adjustment and show in" the tariff theactualrateswhichareoperating under existing exchangeconditions.For example, a British preferential tariffrate which appeared in the tariffat35 , per cent., but which was subject to exchange adjustmentof25 per cent. - one quarter -resulted inanetrate of '26 per cent, beingpaid.Applyingthefurther12 per cent. reductionas previously described, theratenow appears as221/2 percent. Allrates of duty which werepreviously subjecttoexchange adjustmenthavebeen shown inthese proposalsattheirnet level,and in consequence it wasnecessary tointroduceproposalsto eliminate the provisions for exchangeadjustment. Thiswas effected byCustomsTariff (Exchange Adjustment) ProposalsNo. 1, whichwillbebefore the committeeof shortly.Exchangecorrectives wherever theyappeared inthetariffhave also been removed. </para>
                        <para>In the case ofexchangecorrectives however, no change of theratesof duty, other thanthe 12per centalteration for value for duty, purposes,.- has* been necessary as the net 'operativ&amp;'rarte is shown in the tariff. </para>
                        <para>Exchange correctiveswere basedon pre-war conditions and in the event of a change, in the exchange positionofAustralia or other  countriesappropriate actioncanbe taken in the light ofcurrent conditions. </para>
                        <para class="block">With regard to CustomsTariff ProposalsNo.2 it will be noted that it includes two schedules. 'The reason for this is that the amount of printing had to be reduced. In the majority of cases, only the rates ofduty were required to be altered" in accordancewith the formula, andthefirst schedule merely specified theitemnumber and the new ratesof duty. In thecircumstancesitwas not considered necessary inthememorandum ofalterations to-setout every item in the firstschedulewith the proposedand previous rates ofduty. There are a few exceptions to thegeneralprinciplewhich thereductions havefollowedand these are shownwiththereasons thereforin the memorandum of alterations. </para>

Thatmaybe all right, but it would be muchmorehelpful to the committee if we knewtowhat item a number related.I have donenothingto impede the Minister in regard to the items mentioned in the schedules because, as I have already pointed out, a lot of them arepurely revenue-producing and protective items which have already been validated and in respect of which no representations have been made by any industry. Therefore, many of them can be regarded as purely machinery provisions. Nevertheless, if the Minister when he referred to item 122 (a), for example, had indicated the nature of that item it would have facilitated the committee's discussion. I should havepreferred thatall the items includedinthis schedule be setout in detail, but I realize the printing difficulties involved. Had the itemsbeen set out indetailhonor able members who were interested in particular items could have spoken in the committee if they had desired to doso,but wedo not know to whatgoodsthe different numbers relate. At the moment I shouldlike the Minister to state exactly what item 122 (a) refers to. </para>

Details of the items covered in the schedule could not be given because of the great amount of printed matter that would have been required. Items 122 (a) and (b) deal with textiles, including materials cut into shape therefor, and felt articles, including materials cut into shape therefor. The explanation of the amendment is that under the 1933-39 tariff any article in which textiles or felt was used in any degree whatever was liable to duty. The amendment will remove this anomaly, and only articles where the chief component is felt will bedutiable. The reduction of duties is in. conformity with the general principle of adjustment following thechange in the basis of assessing value for duty. </para>

                            <para>It is a fact that ships spend very considerableperiods in port. There is no necessity for the Government to commence an immediate investigation into all shipping facilities in Australian ports since the Government has had this matter under close investigation for some years and is still actively inquiring into it and taking such action as is within its power to improve conditions. The powers of the Commonwealth Government, however, have not. speaking generally, been such as enable it to deal, apart from war-time emergencies, with harbour equipment and installations, with the routing or programming of ships, nor with the transport of cargoes to and from wharfs. Nevertheless, the Government has interested itself in such matters and in respect to the port of Sydney, for example, in collaboration with State authorities, has initiated action within the last few days toexpedite clearance of cargoes from wharfs andwharf sheds where congestion has had a marked effect in delaying ships. Similar conditions exist at other main ports in the Commonwealth and it is the function of State authorities to deal with harbours and railways serving harbours, and of private enterprise to arrange transport for clearing cargoes from port installations and to arrange programmes for ships (except ships belonging to the Commonwealth Line). The Stevedoring Industry Commission, on which both shipping employers and waterside workers are represented, is in almost constant session regarding the manning of the ports with waterside labour and the industrial conditions of waterside labourers. Within the last three weeks, arrangements have been made for 750 additional waterside workers to the previously existing labour level at that port, and the position in respect to labour at all ports is under continuous and close review. From the refe rences made above to other factors which affect the total position in relation to turn-round of ships, it will be recognized by the honorable member that the difficulties he alludes to cannot be solved by merely adding to the labour strength at ports. </para>
