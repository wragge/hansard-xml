                    <para>- I do not know of any measure that had greater consideration by the Government than was given to the International Trade Organization Bill. It was the subject, of discussion at dozens of Cabinet meetings. I respect the views of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures on this subject, but I have not the slightest intention of withdrawing the bill. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave-</inline> Certain of my remarks in this ' House having been misreported I desire to make a personal explanation. I refer to a report in this morning's press in which it is alleged that, in a speech in this House on Japanese trade, I made a derogatory reference to General MacArthur's head-quarters: The Australian Associated Press-Reuter message reads as follows : - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>A spokesman for- General MacArthur to-day criticised the behaviour of members of the Australian; Parliamentary delegation to Japan after their return to Australia. </para>
                    <para>The spokesman said : " We thought, when the delegation was here, they would have behaved decently when they returned to Australia? How wrong we were ". </para>
                    <para>The spokesman was commenting, after General MacArthur had received press clippings of a statement made by Mr. L.C. Haylen (Lab., N.S.W.) in . the House of Representatives on November 12. </para>
                    <para>In his statement, Mr. Haylen alleged that " international harpies  " were " hanging around " General MacArthur's headquarters waiting to get into Japanese trade. </para>
                    <para>Mr. Haylen was leader of the seven.man Parliamentary delegation which visited Japan this year.
                    </para>
                    <para>The last paragraph of the message mentions the names; of the other members- of the delegation. The- simple fact is that no attack was made on General MacArthur and his staff. My reference to traders hanging around General MacArthur's headquarters, was reported by the- <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> the only newspaper to report the matter, as " traitors ". This gave a shockingly inaccurate twist to the story.  StrenghtenEng  the error, a subheading to the story also contained the word. " traitors " instead of " traders ". It waa an obvious error. </para>

                            <para>- I rise to order. The House has already heard a personal explanation from the honorable member with regard to the publication of the word "traitor" instead of "trader". The report in which he now claims to have been misrepresented, that which he has just read, contains no reference to that misreport. I submit, therefore, that the honorable member should confine his personal explanation to that statement. </para>

It would appear that the report to which he has referred purports to be a report of statements that he made in this House. The honorable member is in order in correcting any inaccuracies in that report. </para>

                            <para>- I have purposely made this explanation in defence of the members of the parliamentary delegation and myself as concise as possible. I am sure that there was nothing more than a pardonable error in transmission, and not an error in actual reporting. The word " trader " was recorded in the shorthand notes of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> reporter and later was mutilated in transmission and was published as " traitor ". This error caused me grave concern because it completely, although I believe innocently, misrepresented my attitude to General MacArthur and his head-quarters in Japan. Since I have never criticized General MacArthur and have nothing but the liveliest and warmest appreciation of his hospitality to the parliamentary delegation which visited Japan and of the great, inspired work that he is doing in- that country, I hastened to make a personal explanation in the House. </para>

                    <para>That brief, but, I hoped, adequate statement appeared in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> A correction along the lines of my statement in the House appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and I believed the incident to have been closed with dignity and without rancour. However, the original garbled message got to Japan and was presented to General MacArthur for comment. The spokesman's reply is as I have  just  read it to the House from the Australian Associated Press-Reuters cablegram. I should like to inform the House that I saw the original cable message last night by courtesy of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> before it had appeared in any newspaper. I immediately prepared a statement setting out the facts as I am now giving them to the House. I saw the reportersof both the Sydney morning newspapers and told them of my statement being available in the press gallery. Neither the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> nor the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> used a word of it. In fact, the cablegram from Japan was entirely rewritten ia order to emphasize the point that there had been an attack on General MacArthur whereas there was in the offices of the newspapers concerned substantial evidence to the contrary. Since the garbled message has caused distress to me and to the members of the delegation I trust that this correction will be given as much publicity in ' Japan <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> was given to the original inaccurate statement. However, as I am not naive enough to believe that any cooperation in this matter will be given to me by the press I have arranged with Radio Australia . and the Australian Forces newspaper <inline font-style="italic">BOON</inline> to publish the facts in Japan. Because of the great public which these two Australian news mediums have in Japan, I am satisfied that the Supreme Commander and his staff will eventually know the truth. </para>

                        <para>- There is no truth in that statement. Army nursing sisters are still engaged on duty in hospitals with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan and in training depots in Australia and they will be retained. However, some army nursing sisters who were sufficiently patriotic to agree to remain in the service of the Repatriation Commission until it could replace them with civilian nursing sisters, are anxious to be discharged, and that has probably given rise to the rumour mentioned. They will be discharged at their own request when they can be replaced. </para>

                        <para>- In view o°f the important statement of government policy on Palestine recently made by Mr. Hood, a departmental officer, can the Prime Minister say whether the Government intends to make similar important announcements on foreign policy in future at the United Nations or in the Australian Parliament? Before this important statement, which conflicted with British policy in regard to Palestine, was made by Mr. Hood, did any preliminary discussion take place with the United Kingdom Government? If not, will the Government ensure that in future the Government of the United Kingdom, will be consulted before statements are made on such important matters? If some of the present grave international issues led to war, we should undoubtedly fight shoulder to shoulder with Great Britain. Will the Prime Minister consider making a full report to the Parliament of important statements on foreign policy that are made at. the United Nations so that the Parliament and the people of Australia may know exactly what are the commitments of Australian policy instead of having to depend on condensed newspaper reports? </para>

The situation in Palestine and the future of that country have been the subject of a constant exchange of views between the Governments of the United Kingdom and Australia.

Many considerations affected our decision, but I do not think it would be wise at this stage to enter into such a lengthy detailed explanation as would be required to acquaint the House with them. The latest information I have received indicates that there is a very good possibility of a solution of the problem being devised. Considerable difficulty has been presented by the. disposition of the Negev area, which has been the subject of particular dispute between the Arabs and the Jews, but negotiations are proceeding which I hope will lead to a solution of even this difficult problem. I trust also that the differences in Greece will be settled amicably. I assure the right honorable gentleman that there has been a constant exchange of views between the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and myself concerning the Palestine situation. When I was abroad some months ago I took the opportunity to <inline font-style="italic">discuss the matter</inline> with the British Foreign Secretary. Mr. Bevin, and other Ministers. The adoption of the suggestion of the right honorable gentleman that statements should be made in the Parliament on all issues as they arise, would result in almost the entire time of the Parliament being thus occupied. It might even cause confusion and prove a hindrance to international discussions. [ have been asked to prepare a statement dealing with a number of international developments. I am examining that request, and hope to make a brief statement to the House before the forthcoming recess. </para>

                        <para>- The  Government  does not need to subscribe to the recommendation of the United Nations SubCommission on Freedom of Information and of the Press or of any other body in order that Australians may be assured of those rights, because the Australian Labour party has always advocated and supported liberty of the subject and the principle of freedom to disseminate accurate information te- the people. At the same time, the Labour party has opposed licence, and the abuse of that right including the supply of misinformation to the public by persons who are expected to protect the liberty of the subject and freedom of expression. There has been no departure from that policy. If there isone principle more than any other that this party has stood for down the year.= and other people have tried to- suppress, it is that of complete freedom to express the truth, particularly when such expressions are backed by sincerity. I assure  the  honorable member for Reid that the Australian Government is entirely in accord with the recommendation of the SubCommission on Freedom of Information and of the Press, and agrees with the action of its delegation to the United Nations Commission on Human Rightin affirming the right' of freedom of expression by every medium. But it doe? not stand for licence to supply to the public misinformation, of which the* country has had an undue quantity. </para>

<para>I direct a question to the Minister for Air, in consequence of complaints that I have received from some of my constituents who live in the vicinity of the aerodrome at Schofields, which allege that aeroplane practices are being carried cut over a residential area and that aeroplanes are constantly "stunting". Residents in the area ask that the Minister will take steps to ensure that aircraft exercises will be carried out over another adjacent area where there are thousands of acres on which there is neither property nor human life to be endangered. Will the Minister take steps to have this nuisance abated, and ascertain what can be done to ensure the safety of the people who live near the aerodrome?

                    <para>- I have not heard previously of any complaint regarding " stunting " or low flying in the Schofields area. Men are constantly in training at the Royal Australian Air Force station at Richmond. During their training they naturally have to do all sorts of manoeuvres which people who live in the area probably regard as " stunting ". The general rule is that trainees must keep aircraft beyond a specified minimum height and distance from built-up areas near their training field, and it is the duty of the commanding officer of the station to enforce observance of that rule. In view of the honorable members' remarks I shall have inquiries made with a view to ensuring that air force orders shall be stricly enforced so that the people in the district will have no cause to complain of any nuisance. </para>

I have received some information regarding the matter from the Australian High Commissioner in London and I am studying it at the moment to see whether something can be done along similar lines in Australia. The problem here is the difficulty of obtaining motor cars that would be suitable for such a purpose. </para>

Will the Prime Minister give what information he can on the subject?

                        <para>- The ordinances of the Territory of Papua have been the subject of discussion between the Minister for External Territories, the Administrator of the Territory of Papua-New Guinea, Colonel Murray, and myself, on a number of occasions. I think it is true that some of the ordinances are out of date or require modifying in order to make them suitable for modern conditions. There has been delay because the bill dealing with the administration of the Territory of Papua-New Guinea, which we had hoped to put through the Parliament this session, has been held up because of certain matters which arose at the last meeting of the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations, and  were  later referred to the United Nations General Assembly. Last week, I examined the objections that had been raised, and the legislation, with perhaps some slight alteration, will be introduced either before the end of this sessional period or at the beginning of the next. However, if it is introduced during this sessional period it will not be carried past the second-reading stage. After the legislation has been passed, it is hoped that the ordinances will be remodelled where necessary. </para>

                        <para>- Will the Prime Minister inform the House why it is that when a permanent officer of the Commonwealth Public Service is obliged to take furlough at short notice, there should elapse a period of six weeks before leave pay is approved, and a period of ten weeks before leave pay is paid? Is it not realized that such lengthy delays may cause anxiety or embarrassment to such officers, in the event of domestic emergency or illness? Would it not be possible to improve the manner of handling such approvals and payments, in order to obviate the long waiting periods? </para>

                        <para>- The general provisions relating to furlough, leave and associated matters are administered by the Public Service Board, having regard to the standards and conditions that have been laid down from time to time. It is desirable, of course, that both an officer's department and the Public Service Board shall receive timely notice when an officer desires leave of absence for a lengthy period. In some instances, of course, special concessions are granted. I have not heard of any complaints having been made in this connexion. Doubtless the matter has now been raised in consequence of representations having been made to the honorable member. I shall be speaking to the  chairman  of the Public Service Board later this morning, and shall then ask him to look into the- matter generally and to let me have a report. When that report comes to hand I shall pass the information on to the honorable member. </para>

If Australian experts have not yet been  sent  abroad, when is it anticipated that the Commonwealth will take positive action in that regard in view of the urgent need for dealing with soil erosion on a national basis? </para>

                        <para>- As far as I am aware, no Australian experts have yet been, sent abroad foi- the purpose of studying soil conservation exclusively. However, the Government? of at least two of the States have recognized their responsibilities in this matter, and have appointed soil conservation boards. An obligation rests on the States to send their experts overseas to study methods for combating soil erosion, which is morta State than a Commonwealth function. The State Governments are in close contact with the immediate problem. The function of the Commonwealth is that of co-ordination and of assisting the States, all of which desire to retain their functions and oppose the intrusion of any Commonwealth authority, particularly in connexion with agriculture. The Commonwealth respects that point of view. </para>

                        <para>- Before I address a question to the Prime Minister, I desire to give particulars of a case that I have had to deal with in my electorate. A man, after many year in the carrying business, decided to go on a farm. He approached a trading bank and was told that it could not finance him in the purchase of a farm because he possessed two houses, the combined value of which was about £2,000. He was informed that he would have to sell his houses before he could approach the bank, because of the restrictions imposed upon the bank by Commonwealth policy. I now ask the Prime Minister: Is it Commonwealth, policy to prevent people of small means, such as the man I have mentioned, from acquiring farms? Is it the policy of the Commonwealth Bank, through the Government, or of the Government through the Commonwealth Bank, to compel people to dispose of a couple of small houses and such like in order to become eligible to obtain a mortgage from an ordinary trading bank? If that is Commonwealth policy, will the Prime Minister have it reviewed in order to ensure that these inequities shall not be allowed to persist ? The property owner to whom I have referred was compelled to sell his houses at a price much below their real market value at the time. </para>

                        <para>-The Commonwealth Bank, as the central bank controlling the over-all issue of credit, consulted the private banks and finally laid down a standard policy to be followed by them in the making of advances. That, so far as I know, does not relate to small advances such as that referred to by the honorable gentleman, but was intended to arrest the wide expansion of credit that was occurring and was having a strong inflationary effect. I do not think there is any disputation between the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks, or any of those qualified to express an opinion, about the desirability of some limitation being imposed on the expansion of credit. The statement of the policy sent by the Commonwealth Bank to the private banks has been in their hands for a considerable time. As far as I know, there has been no complaint about that policy. The policy has, indeed, been defended by some of the people who are associated with the private banks. The honorable member has referred to a man who is not financially sound enough to purchase a farm without financial assistance. I cannot imagine  that what the honorable gentleman has' said represents the facts of the case. </para>

At paragraph 57, after discussing certain characteristics of the radio range equipment, the court concludes that there is no justification in saying more in relation to this than that there is a strong possibility that the radio range at Kempsey was temporarily sending out an " on-course " signal which led the captain of the <inline font-style="italic">Lutana</inline> to follow the track he did. It goes on, at paragraph 58, to say that "even if it were found as a fact that the radio range at Kempsey was transmitting a false signal that in itself would not be a sufficient explanation of the accident ". </para>

                    <para>The reasons given for the belief that the radio range at Kempsey was wrongly broadcasting an " on-course " signal arises from an experience when such did happen on the 15th September, thirteen days after the accident. This particular circumstance resulted, it was found, from the failure of a broken spring operating a plunger contact. The radio range equipment throughout the Commonwealth has been in operation for over nine years and in the whole of that time this particular fault has not previously developed and neither its effect on the resulting signal emitted from the transmitter nor on the control meter was known. However, it was observed and reported by a pilot when it occurred on the15th September, and the troublewas soon found. The suggestion by the court that this particular fault developed on the night of the 2nd September can only be logically accepted - </para>

                            <para>if, thirdly - and this is of prime importance - in spite of the foregoing evidence we also accept the suggestion that a broken spring, of which there was no previous experience in nine years of the operation of radio ranges, failed on that night and upset the operation of the range. This spring was first discovered as broken on the  15th September, thirteen days after the accident, and if the court's belief is correct we must agree that it failed on the night of the 2nd September for a short period while the <inline font-style="italic">Lutana</inline> was in ^contact with the Kempsey range but that it then, without any human aid, re-established itself and functioned correctly again until the 15th September. </para>

                    </list>
                    <para>I find it very difficult to believe that captains of aircraft who relied on the radio range for their passage in bad weather conditions that evening and reached their destinations without incident could all have failed to notice, had Kempsey been broadcasting a signal which the court suggests might have contributed to putting another pilot on a' wrong course. It is to be noted that the court states that it is not justified in saying more than that this was a strong possibility, and in these circumstances I feel that the findings of the court in this respect must be said to be inconclusive. For these reasons, and because the court made certain recommendations in other matters which came to its notice during the inquiry, I directed that its report should be carefully examined. </para>
                    <para>As to the accident itself, I am now advised by the Director-General of Civil Aviation that, with the further evidence now available to him as the result of the court's inquiry, he can only find one set of conditions which would logically account for the course taken by the <inline font-style="italic">Lutana</inline> and the action and reports of its captain on the night of the 2nd September. That set of conditions is that not only was the magnetic compass in the aircraft out of adjustment but that the radio range receiver was also out of action, and that the captain of the aircraft was without its aid throughout the flight. The court, at paragraph 25, -states that the principal navigation aid available to a captain of an aircraft is " of course the radio range ". The radio range receiver is fitted in the aircraft and it is not possible to say from the parts recovered whether it was working. The court at paragraph 35 concludes that the radio range receiver was working correctly - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Because if it were not working, Captain Drummond would <inline font-style="italic">have,</inline> I think, reported that he was not receiving the radio range transmission and would have asked if the transmitter was out of order. He sent no such message. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Yet on the course which the court finds the <inline font-style="italic">Lutana</inline> followed, there was a period of some 36 minutes during which the aircraft was flying between Kingston and Bundella and when the captain of the <inline font-style="italic">Lutana</inline> was in an area where neither Kempsey nor Mascot radio range transmissions could possibly have reached him ; but he made no report of the fact that he was not receiving radio range signals. No other condition than that the radio range receiver in the aircraft was not functioning can explain the fact that having proceeded for a distance of 170 miles from Kyogle, which should have placed him in the vicinity of Kempsey, and therefore receiving signals of maximum strength, the pilot was in fact at Kingston some 110 miles further west where he was outside the "broadcast range of* Kempsey and could not have been receiving signals therefrom. Further, after reporting his position as at Williamtown, obtaining permission from Flight Control at Mascot to descend from 6,000 to 4,000 feet, and being instructed to do so " on the range " he made no reference to not receiving radio range signals, although we now know that he was at that time some 135 miles west of the track and could not receive radio range signals, and he did descend whilst flying in a direction almost at right angles to that of the range. Further, whilst following that course, Control at Mascot inquired from him whether he was endeavouring to contact them, and he replied that he was not. At this time he could not have been receiving the range signals but made no comment on it to Control at Mascot. </para>
                    <para>The court suggests, at paragraph 63, that for the period when the <inline font-style="italic">Lutana</inline> should have been south of Kempsey, and was not receiving radio range signals, the pilot probably believed himself to be in the gap between the southern leg of the Kempsey range and the northern leg of the Mascot range. This is not understandable for the reason that at a height of 6,000 feet, at which he was flying, there is no gap between these two radio ranges. A further suggestion that the radio range receiver on the aircraft may have been out of action is found from the fact that when the <inline font-style="italic">Lutana</inline> landed at Brisbane on its flight from northern Queensland, the captain reported that the radio range receiver was not working properly. The instrument then fitted was removed and another substituted. That which was removed was subsequently found on test to have no fault. The new one installed in the <inline font-style="italic">Lutana</inline> for its flight to Sydney was tested on the ground and found to be working correctly. In other words, both receivers, when tested on the ground, functioned correctly, but the first, when in the air, failed to do so. The failure of a receiver of this kind is not necessarily limited to the receiving set, and there is a strong suggestion in this case that as the receiver itself revealed no fault, its failure to receive signals on the journey to Brisbane was to be found in the wiring and other fixtures fitted permanently into the aircraft, which, of course, would not be removed when the receiver was replaced, and the captain of the aircraft would not be aware of such a fault until he was in the air. </para>
                    <para>It is interesting to observe from the transcript of evidence that counsel assisting the court, in his final address, referred to the defects of the Kempsey range as being merely a remote possibility, and counsel for Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited thought that little reliance could be placed on the theory that the radio range was not functioning on the night of the accident. In view of all these facts, I find it difficult to believe that the Kempsey range failed to function normally on the night of the 2nd September, and believe that there is evidence to support the strongest possibility that the second navigational aid which had failed was the radio range receiver in the aircraft. </para>
                    <para>At paragraph 120 the court makes certain recommendations on matters arising out of the hearing of the court in the present case. As to these, dealing with the provision and operation of navigational aids from the ground, in relation to the monitoring of the radio ranges, at paragraphs 51 and 53 the court refers to the steps taken by the radio operators to ensure that the radio ranges continue to function correctly and recommends that a monitoring system be immediately installed which gives a positive alarm when any fault occurs, particularly when such faults cause the range to bend or circumscribe the station. At present, radio operators are required to check their equipment every 30 minutes and to make an entry in their log that this has been done, and indicate the results. The court suggests that it would be possible for the equipment to go out of action immediately following a check and, without being noticed by the operator, to return to normal functioning prior to the next half-hourly check. </para>
                    <para>A reference is made at paragraph 49 to the means for making this check and to the use of lights for that purpose. The lights referred to were fitted in the design of the original equipment for purposes to which it is not applied in Australia and were never intended to indicate the correct operation of the apparatus under the conditions dealt with in this report. These lights are not in a circuit which would give such indication, and in fact it would be possible for the lights to indicate that the equipment was functioning in a normal condition whereas the equipment could be broadcasting the " on-course " signal to all points of the compass. The only means of noting correct operation is by observation of the  milliamp  meter built into that portion of the set designed for the special purpose of monitoring. As already stated, this equipment has been in use for over nine years and nothing has occurred previously which would indicate the necessity for more frequent monitoring; but in view of the court's recommendation, steps have been taken, in consultation with Amalgamated "Wireless (Australasia) Limited, to produce an alarm which will indicate malfunctioning immediately. In the meantime, a quarter-hour monitoring has been instituted. The new equipment now being installed throughout the Commonwealth contains an automatic monitoring device. </para>
                    <para>In respect of the use of modern radar aids in lieu of relying on pilot's reports and consideration of what navigational aids should be substituted for the present radio ranges, at paragraph 88 the court levels a criticism at the department for - </para>

                        <para>Not using the modern scientific aids which were discovered and used during the war, that they are requiring information from the pilot which should be known to them or which could be obtained by them accurately and instantaneously from the ground without choking the communications channels. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The aids referred to are the radar and other applications of the cathode ray tube. As is well known these aids were developed during the war to meet the needs of war and without regard to cost of production or operation and irrespective of the manpower demand involved. These considerations, however, cannot be similarly ignored in peace. To install these aids to cover the extensive airways network in Australia would involve expenditure and man-power of such a magnitude as to make it impossible for any nation of 7,500,000 people to consider. </para>
                    <para>Australia, favoured as it is with good flying weather, would hardly find justification to be the first to install aids such as are referred to. No other nation has yet attempted to do so. In any case it is very doubtful, and by no means accepted by aeronautical authorities, whether it is wise that the responsibility for the navigation of an aircraft from one point to another shall be transferred from the captain of that aircraft to a ground control. Such a process is entirely opposed to all experience. </para>
                    <para>At paragraphs 103-105 the court makes reference to the radio aids and recommends that before any further installations are made by the department, a committee of experts from both within and without the department be appointed to advise it. The court is here referring to the approval already given by Cabinet and work now under way to replace the present 33 megacycle radio ranges with radio ranges operating on 112  magacycles. </para>
                    <para>There is some suggestion by the court, and this was given considerable press publicity at the time of the hearing of the court, that the new equipment now being installed is already out of date, and it is suggested by the court at paragraph 104 that it is- </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>It is obvious that the matter of radio facilities must be considered on an international basis, for it would not be in the interests of air transport as a whole nor of the local aeronautical authority if one system of radio communication or navigation were established and maintained for domestic services whilst another was provided for international operation. The matter has, therefore, been the subject of considerable discussion and examination in the International Civil Aviation Organization, which has given thought to not only what may be desirable but also what is already in existence and practical. It is realized by the aeronautical authorities of the world that an equipment of this sort manufactured to-day to a specification which has been the subject of trial and experiment may be termed obsolete tomorrow by reason of the results of continued experiments that, have taken place in the laboratory during the time of manufacture of the equipment now in existence. For these reasons, the International Civil Aviation Organization has decided that a particular equipment, once' adopted for general international use, shall be retained for ,i stated period before replacement. The International Civil Aviation Organization has recommended the 112 megacycle equipment to be standard for international purposes until 1955. The equipment which is now in Australia's possession and being installed to replace the 33 megacycle ranges is the 112 megacycle radio range. </para>
                    <para>The court in its report refers to (a) the 112 megacycle four course range: (&amp;) the American omni-directional range; and (c) the Australian  multiple  track range. As to the latter, this was set up by representatives of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Canada last year, when the International Civil Aviation Organization was conducting trials in order to come to a decision as to the type of equipment it should recommend. As a result of those trials, the 112 megacycle ranges were recommended. This leaves the court's reference to the 112 megacycle fourcourse range and the American omnidirectional range giving the impression that the latter is of a frequency different from that of the former. This is not correct, for both of these equipments are of 112 megacycle frequency and the character of their signal is the same, the only difference being in the method of direction of the broadcast. The first transmits a signal or track in four directions, the latter in a number of directions according to desire. </para>
                    <para>This question of the number of tracks along which a signal for the purpose of guiding aircraft is transmitted is obviously related to the nature of the traffic to be handled. </para>
                    <para>It must be borne in mind that the omni-directional range involves the addition to the present four-course range of certain components and alterations to the aerial which would result in a more complicated mechanism, and obviously there would be no call to install such equipment at places such as those on the route between Adelaide and Darwin or between Adelaide and Kalgoorlie and many other places where the needs of the traffic are fully met by the simpler four-course transmitter. On the other hand, the omni-directional broadcast is the one agreed upon for international use and as far back as February, 1947, the Commonwealth agreed with the International Civil Aviation  Organziation  to provide this system of broadcast at the agreed international airports and alternates. This agreement covers most of Australia's points of dense traffic, but in any case the 'four-course range can be modified to omni-directional at little cost whenever or wherever traffic so demands. </para>
                    <para>It is quite wrong to suggest that the equipment now being installed is either obsolete or is being so installed merely because it is already in the possession of the Commonwealth. It is the type of equipment which has been recommended as standard for international purposes until 1955. </para>
                    <para>Dealing with minimizing the records that should be kept by radio operators the court makes reference to the amount of work involved in the recording cf messages received over the radio system. In so far as these are concerned with air traffic control they will be almost eliminated on the institution of the new system, and whilst such messages must berecorded by radio operators there is noneed for their duplication in the signal log. It would appear that instructions already existing are not being observed at Mascot, and steps have been taken toeliminate such duplication. </para>
                    <para>Regarding the installation of mort radio beacons, the court considers thateach reporting point should be one at which the pilot is able to fix his position by radio and recommends that radio beacons should be installed for such purpose (paragraph 89). This matter is being examined in conjunction with the recommendation of the court that the number of position reporting: points should be reduced (paragraph S9 (b) (&amp;).) </para>
                    <para>With reference to air traffic control, after discussing certain details of the operation of the air traffic control system now in operation at Mascot, the court recommends at paragraph 80 that a new and better system be installed immediately. Reference is made to the use of" blackboards, report forms, &amp;c. The problem of air traffic control has existed for many years, but it was not until the conclusion of hostilities that it was possible for the Department to build upanything more than a very bare nucleus of staff to deal with it. Consequently, the principal work' in this connexion has been accomplished during the last twoyears as personnel with the requisite experience became available from the fighting services. This development has had to take place during a time when there was a tremendous growth in civil air transport services, and the court draws attention to this fact at paragraph 100. </para>
                    <para>The problem of providing for thesafety of the increasing air traffic operated with fast modern aircraft is one that has faced most nations of the world and none has yet devised a scheme which can be said to be thoroughly satisfactory toitself or to anyone else. The most extensive experience has been obtained in the United States cf America where airtransport services have been widely developed. Realizing that the system in use, although meeting the needs of Australia, to the extent indicated by the- freedom from accidents over the past several years, was becoming inadequate to meet the ever-increasing traffic, the department took steps some six months ago to replace the present system with a more efficient one. In August cf this year, officers of the department were sent to examine the system in operation in the United States, and the civil aeronautics administration there sent an officer to Australia to assist in its development here. A staff has been employed on the details of this system which must necessarily include instructions for everyone employed in it, so that an immediate and efficient change-over from the present to the new can take place. Because of the decision to introduce a new system of control all available personnel have been applied to it and it is hoped to replace the present system completely within the next six to nine months. Consequently, although certain statements by the court as to the usefulness or necessity, for their purpose, cf particular parts of the present equipment cannot be agreed with, it is recognized that the system, as a whole, must be improved to handle increasing traffic and steps are in hand towards that end. </para>
                    <para class="block">At paragraph 96 the court states - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It would appear that the department is more concerned with the separation of traffic in the air with the view to preventing collision than with the safety of individual aircraft - and at paragraph 84: - </para>

                    <para class="block">The <inline font-style="italic">Kyeema</inline> inquiry dealt with conditions existing ten years ago, when there were no navigational aids and the court at that time endeavoured to indicate a plan under which pilots in the air could get assistance from the ground. Since then, captains of aircraft have been given the means, first, to maintain their track by use of the radio range and, secondly, to check their position by means of the radio compass and by V.H.F. marker beacons. The conditions which were considered at the time of the <inline font-style="italic">Kyeema</inline> inquiry therefore no longer exist. </para>
                    <para>The statement that the department has lost sight of safety in its attention to avoiding collision is difficult to understand. The air traffic control organization established by the department has one aim only - that is, the safety of aircraft. This control system is based on a general division of responsibilities into two parts - (a) that which handles the traffic departing from and arriving at terminals, that is, that in the vicinity of airports; <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> that which deals with traffic <inline font-style="italic">en route,</inline> that is, that which has left the vicinity of airports. </para>
                    <para>The duties of the staff referred to at (a) are carried out by means of verbal contact with individual aircraft until they have left the vicinity of the airport or have landed at it. As to those at (6), having installed radio ranges, it is obvious that traffic making use of them must follow a similar track and consequently the predominant problem then is avoidance of collision. If the radio range is used by aircraft on the principal air routes, they must of necessity be proceeding in a space control by the width of the beam, and so long as there is no failure of equipment the only problem confronting the control of staff is that of collision. This staff does, in addition, redirect traffic to alternate aerodromes when necessary, but whilst the duty of avoiding collision is ever present, the second duty develops only under conditions of bad weather. </para>
                    <para>The whole idea of air traffic control i3 safety and nothing else. There are nine flight information centres in the air traffic control system covering the Commonwealth, and the work of that staff is devoted entirely to safety as distinct from traffic separation and avoidance of collision. The general problem of air traffic control is not so simple as may be inferred from paragraphs 94 and 95 of the court's report. It is not the department's responsibility to control the detailed schedules of every operator which must be considered by operators with regard to traffic offering, the convenience of the travelling public as to times of departures and arrivals as well as the comfort of passengers. The suggestion that captains of aircraft may, under suitable weather conditions, be permitted to leave the radio range could only be applied if good weather could be guaranteed throughout the whole route; and it also suggests discarding what the court has already referred to as the principal navigational aid. However, the daily traffic of operating companies must be handled on those occasions when consideration could not possibly be given to allowing captains of aircraft to leave the radio range course. The suggestion is not one which, in my opinion, having regard to public safety, could he generally accepted. </para>
                    <para>With respect to the reconsideration of reporting stations, the court at paragraph 89 of its report suggests that the number of points at which pilots are required to report should be reduced to a minimum consistent with safety. The number of such reporting points on any particular route must necessarily be decided after having regard to the density of traffic and the nature and performance of the aircraft on that route; that is, the introduction of the Convair, with a much higher speed than other aircraft previously in use, demands a reconsideration of the numbers and places of necessary reporting stations. However, the principle is sound and one which will certainly be followed by the department. The suggestion by the court that broadcasting stations might be used in lieu of transmitters installed especially for air traffic purposes seems to introduce grave possibilities of misdirection, especially when programmes are relayed from other stations, but this matter, as well as that dealing with the question of additional beacons, is being examined. </para>
                    <para>The closest approach to a system which, in effect, is a three-dimensional display of aircraft as suggested by the court at paragraph 92 was that developed in the United Kingdom for the air defence of Great Britain. This is a system designed for bringing our own aircraft into a position to attack hostile aircraft. It involves a most elaborate system of radar stations with communications therefrom to a central point and the employment of large numbers of people. It has been tried in London, since the cessation of hostilities, in handling civil air transport traffic there; but our latest information is that it is being abandoned. It is difficult to understand why the court says that - </para>

                    <para>Dealing with the necessity for a flight checking officer with new duties, the court at paragraph 96 suggests that the present organization might be improved, if there were an official at the major aerodromes whose duty was to watch the flow of traffic as known from the ground thus separating that duty from that of collision prevention. Proposals for such an appointment were discussed with representatives of the Public Service Board in March last, the plan being to establish the post as from the 1st January, 1949. Steps will be taken, in accordance with the recommendation of the court, to do so earlier. </para>
                    <para>At paragraph 116 of its report the court recommends that the present practice under which reference is made to the operating company before an aircraft, operated by it is considered lost and a search and rescue procedure instituted, be eliminated. The original idea of this provision was to ensure that the department and the operating company cooperated in the search but there is no objection to its being eliminated insofar as domestic services are concerned. In passing, I should explain that as far as international services are concerned it is essential to provide air search and rescue under the provisions of the International Convention on Air Navigation. At paragraph 90 the court recommends that the <inline font-style="italic">Manual of Awr Traffic Control</inline> be amended to provide that action be taken to obtain position reports from aircraft " as soon as possible and in any case, within (some determined period) " in place of "within a reasonable length of time ". The department concurs in that recommendation and action in this direction has now been taken. Efforts are continuously being made to improve the accommodation of staffs which have been built up since the war and for whom adequate accommodation is not already available. </para>
                    <para>At paragraph 107 the court comments on the height marking on the present aeronautical maps issued in Australia. The general nature of maps for aeronautical  purposes  was decided after discussion by the International Convention on Air Navigation in 1919, and it was decided that the method of showing heights should be by layer tinting. Insofar as Australia is concerned these maps had necessarily to be prepared from surveys carried out for other purposes, and the information contained on them has been derived from various sources. On to these maps were superimposed layer tinting and information regarding radio aids and landing grounds and, in addition, heights were inserted where they were known. No authority claims that all, or even the highest peak in the district, are so marked. The court recommends that the highest peak in the vicinity should be marked and this is considered thoroughly sound and every endeavour will be made to adopt this principle. However, the question arises as to whether or not any heights should be shown when there is any doubt as to its being the highest. This matter is being further investigated. It may be of interest to note here that, recognizing that the information on the present maps is incomplete, the department some time ago took steps to prepare what are known as terrain clearance charts for each of the approved air routes, and for similar reasons it is a practice to approve flight under instrument flight rules at not less than 1,000 feet above the highest ground within 25 miles on either side of the route. 1't is also of interest to note that on the particular route which covers the area under consideration by the court, that is, that from Sydney to Tamworth, operation is approved only on visual flight rules. </para>
                    <para>At paragraph 112 the court refers to the withholding of certain evidence from the court, by a witness, on the instruction of a senior officer. The court subsequently agrees that this advice did not emanate from any desire to mislead the court but was given in the belief that the evidence concerned was irrelevant and I mention this reference only because a great deal of publicity was given to the matter during the hearing of the case. </para>
                    <para>At paragraph 114 the court recommends that provision be made for an air accidents investigation committee to be presided over by an officer of another department, and suggests that this might be an officer of the Attorney-General's Department. It is stated that this recommendation is in no sense intended to be a criticism of the Air Accidents Committee, which investigated the <inline font-style="italic">Lutana</inline> accident most thoroughly, most promptly and in the fullest detail. The present organization provides within the Department of Civil Aviation certain accident investigation officers who must necessarily be officers of wide flying experience. In addition, there is provision for the setting up of an Air Court of Inquiry such as the present one in cases where the reports of those accident inspectors do not adequately cover the investigation of an accident, and when it is considered that some useful purpose might be served by a further inquiry by a court. </para>
                    <para>It is obvious that to carry his responsibilities, one of which is to endeavour to ascertain the reasons for any aircraft accident, the Director-General of Civil Aviation must have available to him officers with the necessary experience and with the knowledge of the department as well as of the whole field of civil aviation within Australia. The recommendation is made on the grounds that the inspectors of accidents may be influenced by senior officers within the department to whom they are responsible. The fact is however, that those officers are responsible to no officer in the Department of Civil Aviation, except the Director-General himself, to whom they report direct. The causes of the majority of accidents are comparatively clear to experienced airmen, and in such cases' there is no need to set up an investigating committee. The present organization in Australia is similar to that established in the United Kingdom, and it has been proved satisfactory over a. period of many years. It would be quite unwieldy and unnecessary to have (&lt;z) inspectors within the department, <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> an air accidents investigation committee and (c) an air court of inquiry. </para>
                    <para>At paragraph 117 the court recommends that consideration be given as to whether an airline aircraft should carry two magnetic compasses. This matter. will be pursued having regard to all the facts which led to the recommendation. </para>
                    <para>At paragraph 119 the court recommends that the facts reported in Incident Reports should be compared with the logs of transmitting stations, &amp;c, when appropriate, and that the submission of these reports be strictly policed. This matter is now being pursued, and for that purpose an Assistant Superintendent of Air Accident Studies has been appointed. The explanation given and information furnished in the statement I have made does not purport to embrace every detail but does cover, I think, the main features of a very lengthy report. </para>

                    <para>Brief Review of Australia's manufacturing economy in the post-war period. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The review has been prepared by the Division of Industrial Development of my department. It gives details of the actual development which has occurred in each of the important classes of Australian industry since the end of the war. It shows that plans for new capital investment in manufacturing between September, 1945, and June, 1948, involved expenditure which totalled approximately £144,000,000. Among the overseas companies which became associated with new or expanding enterprises in Australia during the period were 129 from the United Kingdom, 87 from the United States of America, five from Canada and two from Sweden. New manufacturing projects announced between September, 1945, and June, 1948, totalled 1,672. By far the greatest expansion occurred in heavy industry, in which class <inline font-style="italic">522</inline> new projects were announced. </para>
                <para>The development of Australia's manufacturing strength is shown by an increase of 29 per cent, of the number of factories in this country between 1938-39 and 1946-47. During the same period the number of persons employed increased by 42 per cent. The value of factory production in 1946-47, which amounted to £412,945,000, was an all time record, and doubled the value of factory production in 1938-39. </para>
                <para>The review gives a great deal of valuable information regarding the decentralization of industry, economic trends in manufacturing, technical and financial assistance to industry, research and overseas markets. I, therefore, warmly commend this document to honorable members on both sides of the House. It gives a picture of remarkable expansion, and shows that manufacturers, both here and abroad, have every confidence in the stability of this country and in its future as a progressive industrial nation. Whilst most of the expansion has come from within Australia, the number of overseas companies which have become associated with new ventures here is highly significant, particularly as some of them are among the most important manufacturers in their class of industry in the world and are makers of products of wide reputation.

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to continue in operation the existing National Security (War Damage to Property) Regulations, which are at present in force by virtue of the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act 1946-1947. Further legislative authority is necessary to cover  the period during which the War Damage Scheme is to be wound up, and as some outstanding matters may not be brought to finality for some considerable time, it is thought that substantive legislation is preferable to a further extension of the regulations under the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act. Until the end of September last, the scheme was administered by the War Damage Commission, which was established shortly after the regulations were promulgated early in 1942. As, by September, the volume of outstanding claims did not warrant a continuance of the commission, it was disbanded, and its powers and functions were transferred to the Treasurer. The claims on which action is incomplete will be finalized by a war damage section within the Treasury. The final report of the commission will be tabled in the House as soon as possible. I commend the bill to honorable members for favorable consideration. </para>

                        should make a statement to the House about the proposed course of business during the next week or fortnight. Yesterday, he submitted a motion for the suspension of the 11 o'clock rule, and the implication of that action is that honorable members will be asked to sit late at night and possibly all night before the recess. As is well known, debates during an all-night sitting lose a great deal of their point and interest. It is legislation by exhaustion. I realize that the Government has the problem of disposing of its business in a certain time, but the Opposition is entitled to an opportunity to discuss controversial matters of public importance. The Opposition expresses the views of a large section of the community, and, therefore, should be given an adequate opportunity to express . itsopinions on controversial measures, such as the redistribution proposals, at a time when the people are able to listen to the broadcasts of proceedings.

                            <para>- I am prepared to try to make Christmas a movable feast, if necessary. A number of bills have yet to be received from the Senate, but I consider that only four or five bills on the notice-paper will be the subject of great interest or lengthy debate. It  was  hoped at one time that the House would rise by the 3rd December, but that does notseem possible at the moment. I am not anxious to encourage all-night sittings. The parliamentary staffs, particularly the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff and the Government Printer, have had a long and strenuous session. Somebody told me that this session has been in progress for about three months, but the fact that we have been meeting on four days a week, and Wednesday is a long day, makes the period seem much longer than. that. A heavy strain has been imposed on the parliamentary staffs, and I am not anxious to burden them further with all-night sittings, if they can be avoided. Of course, there is no reason why we should not have a supper at midnight occasionally, and continue the sitting for several hours. At the moment, it does not seem possible to dispose of the business on the notice paper before the 10th December. I am quite willing to consult with the Acting Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party about the advisability of dealing with hills of considerable public importance during the day or in the evening rather than in the small hours of the morning. Some bills, such as the War Damage to Property Bill, are merely machinery measures, and should not require discussion. I am in favour of any consultations which will expedite the business of the House. </para>

A similar provision is already incorporated in the act in relation to employees of the Australian Egg Board, and, in fact, of all statutory boards and commissions. It has been found desirable, in a number of instances, to permit a departmental officer, who, in his official capacity, has been closely associated with the development and formation of an industry organization, to continue with that organization in an executive capacity. The officer so concerned with the Australian Egg Board has been acting as the  chairman,  and, therefore, it is desired to make provision for his continuing in such  a  capacity without prejudicing his rights as  a  permanent officer of the Public Service. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to amend section 38 of the War Service Homes Act 1918-1947 in order to provide, should the ex-serviceman or his widow so desire, for the continuance of the insurance of a dwelling house effected in pursuance of the act after the liability of the purchaser or borrower has been repaid. It will also permit the reinsurance of a dwelling-house in respect of which the liability has been repaid and the insurance terminated in consequence, provided the ex-serviceman or his widow remains the owner and desires again to insure the home under the war service homes insurance scheme. Provision is also made for the personal representative of a deceased ex-serviceman or of his widow to continue the insurance until such time as the property is disposed of in accordance with the laws of administration or probate. In proposing the extension of the provisions of the act in the manner which I have mentioned, the Government has taken into consideration requests made by individual ex-servicemen, and ex-servicemen's associations for the continuance of the insurance, or the reinsurance of their homes under the act, which affords a satisfactory comprehensive cover against damage or loss. The bill will add a further benefit to ex-servicemen and their widows, and I feel sure that it will meet with the unqualified approval of all honorable members. </para>
                    <para>This bill will enable ex-servicemen or their widows who have built homes under the War  Service Homes Act, and have discharged their liability, to effect a financial saving. At present, the act provides that such persons must discontinue insuring their homes under the war service homes insurance plan. The insurance rates under the act are approximately 50 per cent, of those charged by the tariff companies for a comprehensive cover. It is greatly to be regretted that when I endeavoured to move the second reading of the bill after I had introduced it yesterday, the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> who always claims that he desires to assist ex-servicemen, used the forms of the House to prevent me from proceeding. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the bill and shall make some observations on it, -but before dealing with it I desire to make a few remarks concerning some of the statements made last night by honorable members opposite. Honorable members heard the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> refer to " nationalization ", " socialization ", and " dramatization " in a most dramatic and Shakespearean fashion. The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> commenced his speech by making what I regard as an unparliamentary expression. All I have to say at the moment regarding that is that I suggest that he should have an X-ray of himself. The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> was the only one of the three Opposition speakers whom I mentioned who confined his remarks to the bill. The other two honorable gentlemen made only passing reference to it. I support the bill because I am conscious of the fact that we in this country are on the eve of great developments in radio broadcasting. Honorable members know full well that no consideration has been given to any change in the control of broadcasting in this country since its inception about 25 years ago and as we are on the eve of great developments, it is essential for the Government to review the whole subject of broadcasting control. Is it to that end that the present measure has been introduced. It will amend the Australian Broadcasting Act 1942-46, and will have as its purposes, first, the creation of an Australian Broadcasting Control Board; secondly, the improvement and strengthening of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and, thirdly, the financing of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in the future, having regard to the work that that body will be expected to perform. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>By establishing the Australian Broadcasting Control Board the legislation will set up machinery to provide for the efficient, co-ordinated control of broadcasting in Australia. The board will assume some of the functions that have been and are still exercised by the Postmaster-General. The board, which will comprise three members, will co-ordinate broadcasting in Australia and place it on a proper footing. It will also deal with the installation and operation of the technical equipment of all stations, both national and commercial. Its purpose will he to see that the interests of the listeners are protected. That is indeed the primary purpose for which the board is to be created. It will ensure that the listening public shall receive the service from radio to which it is entitled. The hoard will also supervise programmes. The protection of the interests of listeners will be the major function of the board, to which exception has been taken by honorable members opposite. Before I conclude my speech, I propose to deal with developments in broadcasting in other parts of the world. The board, while performing its function of supervising all broadcasting in Australia, will be available for consultation by both the national and commercial stations. If the board, for instance, considers that certain improvements in broadcasting are necessary and what it proposes to take action which will effect the national and commercial stations, those interested can come forward and make suggestions to the board, and the whole matter can be ironed out there and then and dealt with expeditiously. The board will .take action to ensure that programmes shall be reasonable both as to duration and to variety and above all to ensure that adequate provision shall be made for the broadcasting of divine worship. Honorable members know that at times a number of stations broadcast the same event. As I have said, the listening public is entitled to the best service that can be provided by broadcasting, and it may be necessary for the board to consider whether or not a certain number of stations should broadcast the same event. The board may decide that the broadcasting of that event shall be confined to one or two stations, while the other stations provide an alternative programme for listeners. In brief, the purposes of the bill are: (1) to see that the interests of the listeners are protected by ensuring the provision of programmes that are varied and of adequate duration ; </para>

                        <item label="(2)">
                            <para>to provide alternative programmes so that not too great a number of stations will be broadcasting the same event; and </para>

                        <item label="(3)">
                            <para>to see that technical equipment in the various stations is up to standard. In addition, the board is to be given very wide powers to control broadcasting generally. But the power to rescind, renew, grant or suspend a radio station licence shall still remain with the Minister responsible. In the United States of America the Federal Communications Commission controls broadcasting. That body occupies a similar position to that to be occupied by the proposed Australian board. The Federal Communications Commission which has the power to suspend and revoke licences, was constituted because of the chaotic conditions into which broadcasting in the United States had slipped. The Federal Communications Commission was given all the powers necessary to clear up the mess. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para>In the early stages of its career, it suspended hundreds of licences. It has controlled broadcasting in the United States with an iron fist, to the great benefit of the American listening public. It is not correct to say that because under the present measure, the power to cancel or suspend a radio station's licence is to remain with the Minister, the democratic control of broadcasting in this country will he interfered with. The power to say whether or not some particular body shall take part in this public utility will remain with the Minister who is responsible to the Parliament. The Minister will be responsible to the Parliament if he should suspend or cancel the licence of a commercial station. </para>
                    <para>Another advantage of the new arrangement will be that the board may make national programmes available to commercial stations. That is similar to the Canadian system under which the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation may exchange programmes with B class stations. It is also provided in the bill that the Treasurer may, on the recommendation of the Minister in charge of broadcasting, grant financial assistance to commercial stations that are financially embarrassed. Commercial radio stations situated in the cities have no financial worries, because they are able to get plenty of advertising, but in the outback areas, such as some in the electorate which I represent, radio stations find it extremely difficult to carry on because of the small amount of advertising available. </para>
                    <para>The purpose of the bill is to co-ordinate the control of national and commercial broadcasting, and to improve programmes. We are on the eve of great developments in radio, including frequency modulation, television, and facsimile broadcasting. Honorable members opposite have complained that the commercial stations are not to be allowed to use frequency modulation. The establishment of frequency modulation broadcasting stations in the capital cities and other large centres will make it possible to transfer some amplitude modulation stations to country districts, thus improving the service available to the public. I know of one commercial station in Queensland that has been financially embarrassed for some time because the revenue obtained from local advertising is inadequate. Offers to buy the station have been made, but only on condition that it may be transferred to a large provincial town within 40 miles of the capital. Whilst the transfer of the station to that town would give its residents a better service, the people in the outback district, where the station is now situated, would be deprived altogether of a commercial service.' Financial assistance to enable that station to continue to serve those outback people may be justified. Frequency modulation broadcasting has only a limited range, and will be controlled by the national authority, so that the establishment of frequency modulation stations will not reduce the number of licences available for amplitude modulation stations. </para>
                    <para>Television and facsimile broadcasting like frequency modulation, are, past the experimental stage. Of the present commercial broadcasting stations, newspaper proprietors control, or are interested in, 62 per cent. They realize that facsimile broadcasting offers an alternative method of distributing news to the public, and if the stations which make facsimile broadcasts have independent news gathering services, the listener will be able to select the news he wants. He will not have to accept what is supplied to him by the newspapers. </para>
                    <para>The bill provides for the strengthening of the Australian Broadcasting Commission by the addition of two new members an official of the Postmaster-General's Department possessed of technical knowledge, and a Treasury official, whose duty it will be to watch the financial side of the commission's operation?. The commission now operates 32 stations, but the number will soon be increased. The Government, in the interests of listeners, has decided to finance the commission out of Consolidated Revenue, which make's it desirable to appoint a Treasury official to ensure that the money shall be wisely expended. </para>
                    <para>The commission has been successful in giving the public balanced programmes. The Acting Leader of the Opposition said last night that only jo per cent, of the public listened to the national broadcasts. I do not know whether the investigators who chose the figure of 15 per cent, were any more reliable than those who conducted the public opinion polls in the United States of America on the recent presidential election, but I am convinced that their estimate of 15 per cent, is just so much " hooey ". There rests on the Australian Broadcasting Commission, under its constitution, an obligation to present balanced programmes, having regard to the tastes of all sections of the community, and to assist in the development of culture and education. I know that in the outback schools in my electorate, the educational talks received on the school radio sets have been of considerable interest to the children, whilst the booklets on education issued by the Australian Broadcasting Commission have provided valuable reading matter for teachers and children alike. But, above all, entertainment must be provided in the broadcast programmes. I venture to say that the standard of entertainment that is being provided by the national broadcasting stations is far superior to that of the commercial stations, although it must be agreed that the commercial stations supply programmes in keeping with the tastes of some sections of the community. Personally, I regard the national programmes as being more in keeping with current trends than, generally speaking, are the programmes of the commercial stations. </para>
                    <para>The most important of the activities of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is the provision of a news service which, unlike that provided by the newspapers in this country, contains almost straight news, uncoloured and unbiased. It is possible for such a service to be provided by the Australian Broadcasting Commission only because it has neither to pander to vested interests, nor to accept the dictates of advertisers. The news service provided by the Australian Broadcasting Commission is the best in Australia. </para>
                    <para>It is true that the commercial stations have played an important part in the development of broadcasting services in this country. In the early days of broadcasting there was little demand for licences to broadcast. When, subsequently, the profit-making possibilities of broadcasting were realized, many hundreds of applications for such licences were received. I contend that the B class stations were established primarily for the purpose of making profits; the provision of a service to the public was only a secondary consideration. Logically that must be so, because the proprietors of the B class stations are business men, not public benefactors. The organizations of commercial stations favour this bill, and, in fact, have been working towards the introduction of such a measure for a long time. They have already indicated that, with some amendment, the bill will meet their wishes. As a result of this legislation the control of commercial stations will be vested in the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. </para>
                    <para>It is interesting to recall the action that was taken by the Government of the United States of America to overcome the chaotic condition that developed in the broadcasting industry in that country. A Federal Communications Commission was established to inquire into all aspects of the matter. The commission found that in many instances commercial stations would broadcast four or five " puffs ", or announcements, then play a musical record, and then make further announcements. The commission insisted that those stations should provide sustained programmes of entertainment, without interruption, and that, for at least part of their broadcasting time, the stations should be required to present unsponsored entertainment items. Honorable members are well aware of the ruthless manner in which the commission slashed existing licences in the United States of America, and of the very strong control which to-day is maintained over broadcasting in that country. As a result of the exercise of control by that allpowerful commission, the broadcasting services in the United States of America have been vastly improved. It was recognized by the commission that the grant of licences to operate on the freedom of the air, as the matter has been described by honorable members opposite, whilst conferring certain rights on the licensees, also imposes certain obligations on them to provide programmes for the entertainment of the public. It is but right that such obligations should be borne by public utilities. </para>
                    <para>In his speech on this measure last night, the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> made an impassioned plea on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">"Mr. John</inline> Henry Austral ". </para>

On the eve of the general election in 1943, during the period of the war, listeners to the programmes of some of the commercial stations were surprised to hear the announcer, in a simulated German voice, say, " If the Labour party is elected, ve vill help Germany to vin the var ". That was followed by filthy propaganda. It was subsequently learned that that propaganda was so bad that, when some of the commercial stations heard the recordings, they refused to broadcast them. <inline font-style="italic">From</inline> that genesis we come to the era of " John Henry Austral ". He is in business to make money and is employed to do a certain job. But filthy as the broadcasts of 1943 were, his are filthier, and it is encumbent upon any government, regardless of its political colour to protect the interests of those in the community who may listen to the broadcasts. I use the phrase "may listen to", because the broadcasts are so nauseating that the average fair-minded person- </para>

The Labour party objects to the " John Henry Austral " broadcasts, but the bill has not been brought down, as has been suggested, primarily to suppress them. The Government, however, has the responsibility to empower the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to protect the people against being offended by matter put over the ether. I agree with the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burke)</inline> that the " John Henry Austral " broadcasts are so nauseating and degrading that they may have the ulterior motive of destroying the parliamentary institution. In the depression years, certain interests which we regard as " rightist " endeavoured to destroy the parliamentary institution. It is our duty to ensure that such people shall not be allowed to pursue their evil course of destroying the democracy that we all love and for which many Australian soldiers gave their lives not very long ago. It has been suggested by honorable gentlemen opposite that this bill is designed to interfere with individual freedom. Nothing of the kind! It proposes to prohibit the dramatization of certain incidents within a certain period. It is nonsense to claim that power could be taken to prohibit the broadcasting of plays by Bernard Shaw. </para>

He claimed that Australia had a totalitarian government that proposed to regiment political thought and condition the minds of millions of people. I made a note of what he said because his statements were utterly ludicrous. Either the honorable gentleman does not know what has happened abroad or he was endeavouring to mislead the people. The Government proposes to continue the dual system of radio entertainment through national and commercial broadcasting stations. We have the constitutional power to nationalize broadcasting should we desire to do so. The best illustration of our ability to do that was supplied by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> who, as Postmaster-General, closed down station 2KY. If the Postmaster-General has the power to close down one station, he has the power to close down the lot. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with the suggestions that the Government proposes to regiment political thinking. The Acting Leader of the Opposition forgets that Great Britain has a national broadcasting service supplied by the British Broadcasting Corporation as the only authority allowed to broadcast in that country. The British Broadcasting Corporation was established by the Conservative party when it was in office in Great Britain. The supposed Liberal party of Australia is ultra-conservative and it probably objects to the British system. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Acting Leader of the Opposition also complained about the political tie-up of stations. My answer to him on that point is that 62 per cent, of the commercial stations are linked in some way with the newspapers. The honorable gentleman also made much of the fact that the bill does not stipulate the Minister who shall administer this legislation. Broadcasting is making such rapid strides that we do not know when it will be necessary to take its control from the Postmaster-General and place it in the hands of a " Minister for Broadcasting". If we stipulated in the bill that the Minister in charge of it should be the Postmaster-General, we should have to come back to the Parliament and effect a purely machinery amendment of the act, should we ever decide to transfer the control to a " Minister for Broadcasting ". The Acts Interpretation Act covers the situation if we leave the ministerial control unspecified. The honorable member for Indi started his speech with an unparliamentary expression about a Government member's speech. He spent nine minutes of his time in talking about " the Minister " as provided in the act.  His  whole speech showed that he knew nothing about the subject. My advice for what it is worth, is that henceforth he confine his speeches to such subjects as wheat-growing, about which I give him credit for knowing something. Most of the honorable member's remarks dealt with the alleged desire to suppress the " J ohn Henry Austral " broadcasts because they were getting under the skin of the Labour paTty. My point in reply to that criticism is that so offensive to the ears of listeners are the broadcasts that they are doing a mighty fine job for the Labour party. We do not object to " John Henry Austral " from the party political point of view, but we do object to him because the matter he broadcasts is offensive to a large section of the listening public and, more important, because it may have an ulterior motive. The honorable member for Parramatta, who is striving to throw me off my path with interjections, showed distress at the treatment to be meted out to " John Henry Austral" and made an impassioned plea about the freedom of the air. People who enjoy freedom have obligations as well as rights. Some people abuse their rights and forget their obligations. The honorable member said that the Government proposed to take away the right of any one to criticize it. The right to criticize the Government will still exist, but the criticism must be expressed in decent language and within reasonablebounds. I am happy to give the bill my blessing. </para>

                        <para>. - Three features of the speech made by the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> particularly interested me. The first washis statement to the effect that there would be no diminution of commercial broadcasting under the terms of this bill. The second was his declaration that the Government would provide financial assistance for country 'broadcasting stations which could not afford to operate unaided. The third was his expression of concern on behalf of the Labour party about the advertisements that are broadcast by the Liberal party. The first statement was at least an admission which no Government  speaker  had previously made in this debate. However, it only goes half way towards meeting the wishes of the country. We certainly do not want any diminution of commercial broadcasting. On the contrary, we want an increase of it. We consider that the commercial stations should have the same right to use frequency modulation and other mediums of broadcasting as the government controlled national stations will have. I shall discuss the proposed financial aid for country stations later in my speech. At the moment I direct attention to the Minister's references to the"John Henry Austral" series of advertisements. The serious concern of the Labour party at those broadcasts was made evident beyond doubt by themanner in which the Minister took up thecudgels on behalf of the Government. My own view is that, if I were sponsoring aseries of advertisements, I should select some other form than that of dramatization. However, the Government's decision to suppress such broadcasts shows that it is badly worried by " John Henry Austral ". </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Broadcasting has developed within our lifetime from a novelty to a necessity. Science has made it essential, in every sense of the word, to the nation. Because of, that, I admit that there is a need to maintain a check on the activities of what I shall describe as the broadcasting industry. A review of the Australian Broadcasting Act 1942-1946, which this bill will amend, indicates how well the industry has been legislated for in the past. It has been allowed freedom of activity and freedom of speech. Both the national stations and the commercial stations have been adequately catered for. Now the Government proposes to change the system, and it has declared its intentions in this measure. In effect, its declarations read well. Nevertheless, it remains to he seen whether they disclose the true purpose of the Government or are merely a form of propaganda designed to condition the minds of the people and camouflage the Government's intentions. The measure appears on the surface to be reasonable, but its effects may be very far-reaching. </para>
                    <para>The Australian Broadcasting Act embodies a policy which provides for the control of national stations by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which draws its finance from listeners' licence fees. The commission is responsible for the management of national stations and for the quality of the programmes which they provide for the public. The act also provides for the existence of commercial, stations, which are dependent for their revenue upon income from advertising. That system has proved its worth and it will be continued, under this bill, at least in relation to finance. The Australian Broadcasting Commission is required to manage the national broadcasting system efficiently and to provide programmes capable of meeting the competition of the well-managed commercial stations. Efficient management is essential because the commission must budget within the limits of its income from listeners' licence-fees. It is not able to draw upon unlimited financial resources and therefore has no chance to waste its funds. The programmes which it organizes also must he acceptable to the public if the national stations are to survive in the face of competition from commercial stations. The bill proposes to retain the Broadcasting: Committee, representative of all parties in this Parliament, which has occasionally tripped around the country. The committee has taken evidence in relation tobroadcasting from various sections of the community in the course of inquiries instituted by the Postmaster-General. Itsreports and recommendations have been regularly tabled in this Parliament, but just as regularly, the Government hasignored them. In spite of that, the committee is to remain in existence, although its duties will be confined in future toreporting upon such matters as may bereferred to it by the Postmaster-General.. The Minister will no longer be required torefer matters to the committee upon therequest of the Australian Broadcasting Commission or the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations.. The views of the commission and thefederation will be no concern of the Government. Government policy will be carried out by the proposed broadcasting control board, which will be subservient to the Government. Apparently, that is all that matters in the mind of the Government. </para>
                    <para>There will be broadcasting committees in all States, but they will be only advisory in character. The membership of the Australian Broadcasting Commission will be increased by the. addition of two public servants, one representing the Treasury and the other representing the Postal Department. When the Minister for the Navy said that the Treasury representative would watch finance, the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> asked the pertinent question whether that officer would be appointed merely for the sake of economy. In other words, will he be there to prevent expenditure that would give an efficient service to the public? This vital alteration of the method of financing the commission, under which, m effect, it will be another government department which will be called upon to submit its budget to the Treasury for approval, will detract from rather than contribute to its financial responsibility. Instead of the commission being financially self-supporting - reference is mad* to that matter in the hill - it will become more dependent upon the Treasury. One speculates upon the meaning of the term " financially self-supporting " when one realizes that, in fact, the commission may draw upon the Treasury, <inline font-style="italic">ad lib,</inline> so long as it has the approval of the government of the day. This bill makes the Australian Broadcasting Commission subservient to whatever government may be in office. The existence of the Australian Broadcasting Commission will depend upon finance from the political throne. Only to the degree to which the commission carries out the policy of the Government, will it be provided with finance. [ contend that an independent commission would serve the community to much greater advantage ; but with the inclusion on the commission of government nominees who will be able continually to dictate government policy, even the commission's present independence will be lost. </para>
                    <para>When this measure becomes law, broadcasting, both national and commercial, will operate only on government sufferance. Not only will the Australian Broadcasting Commission be dependent upon the Government for finance, but also the commercial stations will be on the sufferance of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. Over and above the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Government is to constitute a board of three members whose terms of office will be up to seven years. These will be full time jobs - in other words, political plums. The  chairman  will be the equivalent of a departmental head. What are to be the functions of this board ? First, the board will be called upon - </para>
                    <list type="loweralpha">
                        <item label="(a)">
                            <para>to ensure the provision of services by broadcasting stations, television stations, and facsimile stations, and services of a like kind, in accordance with plans from time to time prepared by the board and approved by the Minister; </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para class="block">I imagine that the last phrase " approved by the Minister " is considered 'by the Government to be vital. The second function of the board will be - (ft) to ensure that the technical equipment and operation of such stations are in accordance with such standards and practices as the Board considers to be appropriate; and </para>
                    <para class="block">The third function will be - </para>

                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para class="block">Those involved provisions may mean anything or nothing at all. One of my maiD objections to this bill is that the powers of the board are so wide and varied. They are also so obscure that the government of the day will be able to do exactly as it pleases. As previous Opposition speakers have pointed out in this debate, the board will have over-riding powers. It may be able to ensure better broadcasting services, but, on the other hand, it may mean a dictatorship in accordance with government policy. In future, the expert opinion of the Australian Broadcasting Commission will be subservient to the opinion of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, which may be composed of experienced men, public servants - I do not use the words in a derogatory sense - or political friends. The Australian Broadcasting Commission will be subservient to the board except in regard to the provisions of section 89 of the act, which provides that the commission may determine to what extent and in what manner political speeches, or any matter relating to a political or controversial subject may be broadcast through the national broadcasting stations. I am glad that the commission is to retain that authority. </para>
                    <para>The Australian Broadcasting Control Board will be able to dictate the policy of the commercial stations on programmes, technical equipment and advertising. Not only will it be able to determine how the commercial programmes shall be constituted, but also it will be able to place a limit on advertising and so cripple the finances of the commercial stations which, I remind the House, do not receive any part of the listener's licence-fee, that they will not be able to carry on. </para>
                    <para class="block"> The Minister for the Navy referred to the subsidizing of country stations. According to this bill, the board will have power to subsidize selected commercial stations - for the purpose of ensuring that programmes of adequate extent, standard and variety are provided in the areas served by those stations. </para>
                    <para class="block">If the Minister's views are to be the guide, well and good, but that power could be abused. The Government could, for instance, at the expense of the taxpayers, subsidize a station or a group of stations to the detriment of others which might be driven off the air. Such powers are open to the gravest political abuse. </para>
                    <para>Broadcasting has made wonderful strides, and it can be said with every justification that sponsors of commercial radio stations can claim some credit for that. I do not suggest for a moment that some credit is not due also to the national stations. However, in claiming justification for the continuance and expansion of commercial radio stations, I refer honorable members to the history and performance of those stations. Truly they merit the confidence that the public lias placed in them. Yet in spite of that expansion, and the confidence of the public, no one will suggest that the present system is perfect. As one who has had some experience of commercial stations, I admit that advertising should be limited to a proper proportion of the programme time. The improvement of broadcasting has been continuous, and will remain so. The guarantee of that lies in the dependence of commercial radio stations on public approval of their programmes. It is competition between commercial radio stations - and I suppose to some degree with the national stations - that keeps the standard high. Commercial radio is exceedingly competitive, and stations are  forced  to strive constantly for betterment. All these steps that are being taken to improve programmes and to bring about greater efficiency and up-to-dateness do not cost the listening public one additional penny. If this bill be passed, however, programme-making will no longer be in the hands of the commercial stations. The board will have power to ensure " reasonable variety " and its orders will have the force of law. If its orders or instructions are confined to the betterment of programmes and of their presentation, well and good. It may be found, however, that because the commercial stations are providing better services than are the national stations in any field, the commercial stations may be hampered by the board in such a way as virtually to confer monopoly on the national stations. The Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> referred to the results of a Gallup poll which had been taken to ascertain the percentage of the listening public interested in the programmes of the national stations. In spite of his ridicule of the Gallup poll as the means of ascertaining public opinion on any matter it is undeniably true that the number of people who tune in to the national stations is not nearly so great as that of those who listen to commercial stations. That is accounted for by the much greater variety of programmes made available by such stations. If the board so desires it will be able to force the commercial stations to broadcast programmes arranged, not by experts in this field of entertainment, but by government appointees or civil servants who may have no knowledge or experience of radio work. In that way the audiences of the commercial stations could be very considerably reduced. The worst feature of this bill is that it prevents commercial stations from adopting new technical devices without the approval of the board. If there are marked improvements in broadcasting technique the Government could force the commercial stations to remain in a state of obsolescence. My principal objection to this bill is that it enables the Government to exercise a monopolistic control over all improvements in the field of facsimile broadcasting, frequency modulation and television. Provision has also been made to regulate the networks of the commercial stations. I believe that the existing protection in the principal act should be sufficient to guard against the wrongful use of the network system. Whilst it is not suggested that nation-wide hook-ups are not to be permitted, any interference with existing arrangements for extensive hook-ups of commercial stations must result in great hardship. Suitably controlled networks enable the commercial stations to provide their listeners with high-class programmes which it would be too costly for individual stations to finance. Under the system of extensive or nation-wide hook-ups, programmes broadcast in one State may be heard in all States. But for this system country broadcasting stations would be severely penalized. Too much frustration and interference, and too great a limitation of the rights of the commercial stations could place them in a disadvantageous position and even force them out of business. To the degree that officiousness is withheld, and the powers of the board are used in the interests of the public, this bill is welcomed by me. If it results in the elimination of the many objectionable broadcasts from race-courses, such as we hear almost every Saturday afternoon throughout the year, I shall welcome it. Listening to these broadcasts one would think that all the announcers employed on them had been trained by an expert in nasal twang. If this bill results in the improvement of their speech a service will be rendered to the community. Experience of this Government, however, leads me to the belief that Ave cannot always take the statements of Government spokesmen at their face value. Our greatest heritage is our freedom. We boast of our democracy, our right freely to express our opinion and our right to exercise the franchise. One of the statements made by the Minister for the Navy which rather intrigued me was his reference to the " John Henry Austral" broadcasts and his suggestion that the Liberal party were taking away our democracy. The socialist Government of this country is the only force which threatens to take away our freedom. This Government has given us much cause to fear that our freedoms will he filched from us. In attempting to nationalize the financial system - and finance is the key to al] material controls- </para>

                            <para>- If, in addition to controlling the financial system, the Government also succeeds in robbing the people of their inalienable right of freedom of speech, we shall become slaves to a system in every way equivalent to the Russian or nazi socialistic systems. If freedom of speech or expression he controlled by the Government, freedom will no longer be ours. The people of Australia do not want to conform to a pattern shaped by the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> nor to be made to accept government decisions with docility. The honorable gentleman suggested that, for all he knew, the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> might be " John Henry Austral ". I should prefer to listen to the honorable member for Parramatta broadcasting over the air than to have the Minister trying to force Australians to conform to a pattern fashioned by the Government in its attempt to take away our freedom. We do not want nazi-socialism to be practised here. What is required is good, clean, healthy and bright entertainment, and a watchful eye should be kept upon the broadcasting industry to ensure that such entertainment is provided. Basically, the livelihood of the many employees who are engaged in the broadcasting industry and in the manufacture of transmitters, receivers and the like, depends upon the matter that is broadcast being acceptable to the public. Judging by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, a company in which the Australian Government has a predominating interest, and by other manufacturing companies, and also by some of the commercial stations, the industry has been successful. Financially, they have not done too badly. The greatest charge for which the broadcasting stations have to provide is obsolescence, for the public demands uptodateness. If the Government prevents the commercial stations from taking advantage of the latest advances in radio technique, it will force them into the background and they will become secondary stations. I charge the Government with intending to grant to the national stations a monopoly of all that tends to the advancement of this industry. Many national stations have had their power increased to 10,000 watts, yet the highest power that is allowed to commercial stations is 2,000 watts. At least some commercial stations cater for country interests only, and they need' increased power. Obviously reception is better when higher power is available within the radius of service of a station. National stations have priority of power. They also have priority of wavelengths or frequency.  It must be conceded that the higher the wave, the more effective is the propagation of the programme. All the best wavelengths are allotted to national stations; with the exception of the Labour party station in Brisbane. National stations also have priority of channels. They have cleared channels within which to operate, but many of the commercial stations, with powers ranging from 200 to 500 watts, have to share channels. </para>

                    </continue><para>My first objection to the bill is that  by  preventing the commercial stations from making use of the latest tech.nical developments it will allow the Government to place such stations in such a condition of obsolescence and outofdateness that they will not be acceptable to the listening public to the same degree as government-controlled stations. The commercial stations will be slowly strangled and forced into a secondary position. I do not know whether the Government is seeking to exercise this monopolistic power because it is disappointed that the national stations have not hitherto been as acceptable to the public as the commercial stations. My second objection to the bill is that it will give vague and wide powers to the board. My third objection to it is that public servants will serve on the commission. My fourth objection is that the commission will be financially dependent upon the Treasurer. To the degree that (he bill seeks to better the industry, I support it, but I feel that, in regard to the objections that I have raised, the Government is not honest in its intentions. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - For months past, Opposition speakers have been demanding the refusal of the right of free speech to sections of opinion in this country to which they object. The chief spokesman of the Opposition parties in demanding a ban on the expression of opinion by other sections of the Australian community has been " John Henry Austral ". To-day, when it is proposed to place some restriction upon his activities, which are most deceptive, honorable members opposite rise and, in the name of the principle of free speech, insist that he should be allowed to continue to voice his demand that his opponents should be suppressed and prevented from expressing their opinions. There is no doubt that the broadcast matter written by " John Henry Austral " and delivered by another paid spokesman have been, if not designed to deceive the Australian people, at least calculated to deceive them by the simulation of voices of men who are at present engaged in public affairs in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- They have been calculated to lead those who listen to them to think that they were listening to the actual voices of persons taking part in public affairs in the Commonwealth to-day. That is obviously wrong, and should not be permitted by any broadcasting system. It may be that the clause of the bill which relates to this matter can be described as a steam-hammer being used to crack a nut. It may be that political dramatization of that crooked kind could be dealt with without taking such wide powers, but that is a matter of which the Government and its draftsmen must be the judges. It is ludicrous for the Opposition to contend that by means of this bill broadcasting will be made entirely subservient to the government of the day. It was an anti-Labour government and not the present Administration which set up the national broadcasting system in 1932, and which established complete political control of broadcasting. The Australian Broadcasting Commission Act 1932 was introduced by the Lyons Government. Section 20 of the act empowered the Postmaster-General to order the broadcasting by every station of any matter whatever which he directed as being in the public interest. There was no right of appeal from such an order, and no limitation of any kind was im-r posed on the programme control that the Postmaster-General could exercise. To make the broadcasting service entirely subservient to the government of the day, section 51 of the act empowered the Minister, without any qualification, to prohibit the broadcasting of any matter of any class or character whatever. There was again no right of appeal from his order. Without having to give any reason, the Minister could peremptorily 3top any broadcast, and order any other broadcast to be made. He could censor the national stations, and refuse them the right even to state that they had been censored. When the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> was Postmaster-General, and did not like the programmes of certain commercial broadcasting stations, he shut them down completely at a moment's notice. </para>

                            <para>- It could be argued that broadcasting should not be subservient to the government of the day. It could be argued with equal force that broadcasting should not be subservient to any private financial interests in this country, but should operate freely and independently without fear, and subject only to specific and clearly stated laws. It is quite impossible for members of the Opposition to maintain that position, because the Opposition, when it constituted the government, was the father of the legislative measure which imposed complete political control of broadcasting in this country. The statement of the father of the bill, the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron),</inline> is explicit. He said - </para>

                        <para>The allegation that this measure is a piece of socialization is entirely without foundation. The Government does not propose to nationalize radio. It proposes merely to license commercial broadcasting stations on conditions similar to those which obtain at present. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">That statement may be a complete answer to the charges which the Opposition has advanced in that respect, but those words will have no inspiring ring in the ears of tens of thousands of supporters of the Labour party. It is a ground for valid criticism of this bill that it perpetuates, not establishes, the objection able features of subservience to the government of the day, and the exploitation of B class wavelengths for private profit, which were established by antiLabour governments in the past. But it is hopeless for the Opposition to pretend that the bill takes a further step in political control of the air. The Opposition, when it constituted the government, took that step. It not only took the power hut it also used it brazenly. In the words of the honorable member for Barker, anti-Labour governments used every one of their powers of political suppression. As evidence by officials of the Australian Broadcasting Commission has since confirmed, they used their powers to the extent of putting Labour broadcasting stations off the air. Indeed, it can be said in favour of the bill that it represents an improvement in the sense that it replaces, at some points, direct ministerial control, by control by a body possessing a large degree of independence. The valid ground for disappointment with this bill, which will be felt by tens of thousands of supporters of the present Government as well as by many other Australians who are interested in the working of democracy, is that the Government is permitting the continuance of bad procedures and has not embraced the opportunity to establish genuine freedom of the air. I refer to freedom both from domination by the government of the day and domination from powerful financial interests. </para><para>The Opposition is also on poor ground when it objects to the control of broadcasting being vested in a board which includes some government officials. No Labour government has ever created so many boards as the Liberal-Australian Country party administrations did when they were in office. They were so bankrupt of political thought that their answer to every problem was to hand it over to a board. They created the power to control the national broadcasting service. They appointed so many boards of every variety that they named the authority to control national broadcasting a commission - the Australian Broadcasting Commission - and subject to the domination of the Minister, they made that body .the all-powerful arbiter of what the listener should get in return </para><para class="block">Cor the payment of his licence-fee. They made sure that the listener had no rights whatever. He had to pay the piper, but he would not be allowed to call the tune. The tune would be called by the expert commission which knew so much better than the listener what he wanted to hear and what was good for him to hear. That commission has operated the national broadcasting system ever since. The result is that, to-day, most listeners get nothing at all in return for their licence-fees. They pay the licence-fee because they have to, but they do not listen to the stations of the Australian Broadcasting Commission because they do not have to, and because they are sufficiently misguided still to have minds and wills of their own and are not yet ready to accept what officials say is best for them. Equally the Government has overwhelming facts to refute the charge that, in this bill, the Labour party is actually practising socialization. The Government may be flattered by the soft impeachment, but honesty requires a denial. There is no socialization in this measure. I have already quoted the statement by the father of the bill, the Postmaster-General, to that effect, and the Government is prepared to cite and does, in fact, cite additional evidence that its proposals are comparable with the British Broadcasting Corporation system established in the United Kingdom by an ultraconservative government, with the Federal Communications Commission established in the United States of America by a "big business" government, and with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, also a product in that country of an entirely anti-Labour government. Those are the models on which the Government has relied for its new legislation. In such circumstances, would any honorable member opposite expect socialization? The answer to that question is the same as the celebrated reply which was given by the young lady in <inline font-style="italic">Pygmalion,</inline> by Bernard Shaw, a topical political dramatist whose new works we shall hear over our radio after a decent interval of five years has remove their topicality. </para><para>Yet another charge which the Opposition has levelled against the Government can be strongly defended. I refer to  the  charge that there is a sinister intention in framing this bill, and that the measure conceals, under references to co-ordination and variety of programmes, a deliberate purpose to muzzle the Australian people. I believe that that charge is utterly false. I am certain that there is no such sinister intent or deliberate purpose on the part of the framers of the bill. Of course, I have to take that on faith. I was not present when the bill was framed. It was not framed in the room of the Parliamentary Labour party. That is no secret. It was officially announced to the press by Cabinet before it was submitted to the Labour party. At that time, Cabinet added that it intended later to seek the party's approval of the measure. However, I have complete faith in the good intentions of t§e Ministers and officials who framed the bill. I believe that they had enough good intentions to pave many miles. They believe in free speech, and are champions of democracy. They set out with no other objects in view than those which the bill professes, which were to overcome weakness in the broadcasting structure and to co-ordinate and improve programmes. That the way may be left open for suppression, muzzling and gagging by another government in the future would not occur to them. How lovely to be able to share their starry-eyed trustfulness! However, this world is harsh and real. I am sure that as long as the present Ministers remain in the Government, no machinery will be used for suppression, and all honest means of free expression will be respected. The history of the Government during the seven years in which it has held office is the best guarantee of that. It inherited from its predecessors, complete powers of radio suppression which they had shown how to use. In the words of the honorable member for Barker, they had used every one of those powers. This Government inherited those powers; yet, during the last seven or eight years, it has left them unused, while commercial stations, broadcasting sponsored programmes, have gotten away with political murder against the Government. "Was there ever such an example of tolerance? I think it was Hastings who said, "I am amazed at my own moderation". In the Senate, recently, the Postmaster-General said, " I am amazed at my own leniency ", and so he should he. However, I cannot share the sublime optimism of Ministers that they are destined to be political everlasting daisies, nor do I share their belief that their successors will not abuse the great powers exercisable under the act since 1932, and perpetuated in the present bill. If there is a fault in this legislation it is not in the intention and the purpose, which are good, but in the fact that it will provide opportunities for Ministers and officials to become, not the servants of listeners, as the Government intends, but their masters. The real responsibility taken by the Government to those who support it is that it may be sharpening a weapon for use by some future fascist-minded government. Australia to-day suffers from press misrepresentation, but there exists a powerful counter in the independent news service operated by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. That service was established, let it he remembered, by the present Government, in the face of bitter opposition from honorable members opposite, from newspapers and even from inside the Australian Broadcasting Commission itself. We know that there are those who to-day want nothing better than to smash the independent news service of  the Australian Broadcasting Commission. We heard the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> say last night that the money expended on the news service was wasted, and that exactly the same results could be obtained if the commission once more obtained its news from the newspapers. This legislation will leave it open to a future government to co-ordinate the national news service with radio news programmes supplied by existing newspaper services. If that situation should arise, the public, once again, would not he able to rely upon the news it heard. That is clearly the objective of the honorable member for Indi. That is what he would do if he had the opportunity. The honorable member for Barker has surely studied -this bill very closely. He must lick his lips at the opportunities which have been preserved to him to indulge his urge once more to ban and suppress all opposition. As Postmaster-General, he banned station 2KY Sydney by arbitrary order. </para><interjection>

Having given his decision, he retired to Kangaroo Island, swelled by a sense of his own power, and it was very difficult to get in touch with him. He had to be spoken to humbly, and he did not relent, nor allow the station to resume broadcasting, until he was satisfied that the Labour movement had been sufficiently  humbled  that it had been taught its place, and would not do the same thing again. </para>

                    </continue><para>A typical example of the way in which these powers are regarded by the Opposition was provided by itsspokesman in the Senate when the bill was under consideration in that chamber. She insisted that the Board's powers should be used to stop all racing broadcasts. She declared that the legislation would serve a good purpose- if it rid the air of racing broadcasts. One- does not have to enjoy racing broadcasts in order to recognize the menace in such an intolerant statement. It springs from an attitude of mental superiority, from an itch to run other people's lives and from a disrespect for other people's right as human beings to do that of which one disapproves. Yet the honorable .senator who opened the debate for the Opposition demanded that the powers provided in the bill should be used in that way, and left no doubt that that was how they would be used if she could have her way. </para><para>One of the most ridiculous arguments used against the bill is that everything in the broadcasting world is all right, and that no attempt should be made to dictate the programmes of commercial stations. As though they were not already dictated by the advertisers! Listeners who pay approximately £1,000,000 a year for the provision of national programmes, which most of them do not choose to hear, will not agree that everything is right as it is. The very fact that commercial stations, which receive no licence fees, exist, and are highly prosperous, shows that the national stations do not meet the public need. Payment of a licence-fee is compulsory, but listening is voluntary, and there is still freedom of dialling. Most listeners regularly tune out the national stations. There may be argument about the exact proportion of listeners who listen to the national prolamines, but there can be no denial of the fact that the commercial stations have a majority of listeners, despite the disadvantages of irritating and boring advertisements from which the national programmes are mercifully free. The failure of the Australian Broadcasting Commission itself illustrates the failure of the board system, which is due partly to the policy of divorcing the control of broadcasting from direct contact with listeners and partly to the grafting of a group of high-minded, amiable and cultured amateurs on to the top of an entertainment organization, and giving them power to control it. Finally, the failure of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is only what one might expect when the high-minded and cultured group has a guaranteed revenue, and never has to come down to earth to worry about results. I know that some Australian Broadcasting Commission officials are dismayed because their highly intellectual programmes are heard by so few and are missed by so many who would benefit so greatly by them. They are annoyed that commercial stations, broadcasting rubbish with no moral uplift, are attracting listeners from the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Some of these paternal officials think that it would be for the common good if the commercial stations were prevented from broadcasting such deleterious rubbish, so that listeners would turn their dials back to the Australian Broadcasting Commission programmes. The philosophy of those who adopt this attitude is that there rests upon them the serious duty of ensuring that this great gift of science to mankind is utilized in such a manner as to advance the common good. That sounds splendid, and no doubt there is a good deal in it. Basically, however, there is no justification for an assumption by one adult human being of a right to decide what his fellow adult human being ought to hear, and shall bear. While we accept the right to impose education and instruction on children, it would be an intolerable usurping of right to apply the principle to adults. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Yet, intolerable or not, it is the growing habit of mind of benevolent planners and of well-meaning officials. Boards given such powers as this one is to have would certainly feel that they must use them to uplift their fellow men by giving the public what was good for it, rather than what it wanted. While the Australian Broadcasting Commission's stations and the commercial stations were under separate direction, there were obvious limits to that tendency. With all broadcasting under the final control of one superior board, however, those limits will disappear. I accept the assurance of the Government that the board will not use its powers in <inline font-style="italic">-his</inline> way, but we are legislating now. not only to give power to this excellent Government, but also to any government of the future. If you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> are a lover of the music of Bach and Beethoven, as I believe you are, you may deplore the delirious joy that your neighbour derives from the crooning of Crosby or Sinatra. If your neighbour will permit you to do so, you may go into his house and seek to educate him to the enjoyment of better music. But without his permission, neither you nor any board has any right, except impertinence, to impose your standards on him. T believe that that view is so old-fashioned to-day as to be laughed at by some officials with a missionary zeal to condition the people to their standards. But it is a view which needs vigorous reasserting, with a vigorous kick to emphasize it if necessary. A lover of the great classics of English literature may deplore the foolish happiness that his neighbour gets from listening to the " Crossroads of Life ", a serial of eternal love. "With his permission, you may take a volume of Shakespeare across to his house, and attempt to open his eyes to the superior enjoyment that he may find in the works of the immortal bard. Without his permission, neither you nor any board has any right, except impertinence, to endeavour to impose your standards upon him. </para>

                            <para>- It must be remembered that, primarily, broadcasting is t.o-day the most important means of entertainment for the great mass of the people. Whilst it is valuable as an educator and as a means of spreading information, it is, above all, a mean9 of entertainment. It is the only form of entertainment that many poor, lonely and sick people, and people living in the outback areas, possess. They have a right to the kind of entertainment over the air that they like best. They should not be restricted to the kind that a board thinks is best for them. If the singing that they like best is Frank Sinatra's, if the orchestra that they like best is Spike Jones's, and if the drama they like best is " Crossroads of Life ", they are entitled to their share of that kind of entertainment. The Australian Broadcasting Commission has never met the popular taste in Australia. It may be said that it is entitled to give people the opportunity of discovering that they can enjoy something better. That is right. It should be able to say to the people, " Try this, you may like it better ". Of what use is it for the Australian Broadcasting Commission to put over programmes which may encourage people to listen to something better, if it has already driven them away from its programmes? Its first task is to get those listeners back. The fatal mistake of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is that it has failed to hold the mass of listeners. </para>

                            <para>- I should not think so. Although I do not have much opportunity of listening to that serial. I do not suggest for a moment that all the programmes of the Australian Broadcasting Commission are dull. Some of them are splendid entertainment, yet I I have heard many dull programmes broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and many which are completely over the heads of the ordinary listeners. I have heard musical programmes broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission at great cost, which could be appreciated only by expert musicians? </para>

                            <para>- If listeners regarded the Australian Broadcasting Commission as representing nationalized broadcasting, the majority of listeners would not have nationalized broadcasting because they will not have the Australian Broadcasting Commission. A most urgent task, therefore, is to re-organize the national broadcasting service, to cut out the deadwood, and to replace cultural highbrows dwelling in ivory castles by men experienced in the fields of entertainment and with an appreciation of public taste. Direct representatives of listeners and of members of the commission's staff who have actual experience in the entertainment field should be given a share in the day-to-day control and management of the national broadcasting service. If that service gave listeners better and more enjoyable programmes than the commercial stations give them the commercial stations would cease to exist. Nationalized broadcasting could be achieved by that means alone. The national broadcasting service has tremendous advantages over the service of the commercial stations in that there is available to it higher power, better wave-lengths, best technical facilities, and a huge guaranteed revenue. It does not need to broadcast advertisements. Those who run it should be told that they are expected to provide programmes which at least half of the licence-holders will wish to hear. If they cannot do that, they should make way for others who can do it. This bill proposes to strengthen the Australian Broadcasting Commission by appointing to the commission direct representatives of both the Treasury and the Postmaster-General's Department. It will be very interesting to see how this experiment works out. If those representatives infuse into the commission a spirit of bold adventurousness, and the ability to produce brilliant entertainment, the result will be as pleasing as it will be astonishing. So much for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </para>

                    </continue><para>The service of the commercial broadcasting stations is also unsatisfactory in many respects. Honorable members opposite appear to be satisfied with it; and, at least, they do not think any alteration should be made in the control of commercial broadcasting. Certainly the service is satisfactory as a dividend producer for private profit-takers, which is the angle from which the Opposition judges these things. There are many abuses in the field of commercial broadcasting that need remedying; and this bill is justified in that it seeks to apply such remedies. Honorable gentleman opposite talk about the dictation of commercial programmes as something to be avoided, but those programmes are dictated by advertisers, who compel the stations to broadcast their ideas of what the public wants. As a rule, such advertisers have no interest in broadcasting other than as a means of selling their products and making profits. Whether public taste is debased or insulted is entirely a secondary consideration. The control of commercial stations is entirely unsatisfactory in that respect. It is particularly unsatisfactory in the way in which brutal and wicked patent medicine advertisements are blazoned through the air by loud voices, which hammer in the ears of sick people that they should go out and spend a few shillings on this nostrum or that patent medicine. Worse than that is the fact that people who are ill cannot listen to commercial broadcasting stations without being constantly reminded of their illness. They are urged to put their hands in their pockets and bring out the money to buy a bottle of this or that patent medicine that will give them relief. The procedure is callous and brutal. It is entirely wrong that advertisers should be able to choke the air with  programmes from various stations appealing to only one type of listener, while all other listeners are shut out. There is an obvious need for co-ordination of programmes to prevent the occurrence of that kind of thing. It is also entirely wrong that the power of money should be the power to decide how much political information and propaganda is to be mixed into the entertainment programmes of the commercial stations. I believe that broadcasts of political ininformation and propaganda should be allowed without charge and that equal time should be allotted to all the major and recognized parliamentary parties in Australia. It is a reproach to the commercial stations that though thousands of Australian musicians are seeking opportunities to broadcast, they do not employ one. The  only Australian musicians broadcasting are dependent on contracts with advertising sponsors. It is a disgrace that while hundreds of Australian writers are seeking a creative outlet many commercial stations prefer to draw largely on the cheap syndicated writings available on discs from overseas. It is a damning fact that if the provision of radio programmes were left entirely to private enterprise, listeners in the outback would hear none at all, listeners in remote country towns would hear few, and the " Voice of Australia " would never he heard overseas. All those unprofitable services have to be provided by the national service. </para><para>The bill may certainly he justified as a temporary measure to co-ordinate programmes and to end serious abuses, but, in considering this matter, the Government also needs to take a long-range view. Fundamentally, the legislative change needed is to place the control of broadcasting not in fewer and fewer hands but in more and more hands. Under the existing act, one man, the Postmaster-General, has been able to say what his 7,000,000 fellow Australians should hear and should not hear. No matter how wise the Minister is, that is a tyrant's power. The power was created not by this Government but by the Lyons Government in 1932. The present Minister may not use that power as a tyrant, but it is the power first sought and exercised by every tyrant, lt is a power that Ave should be most careful in entrusting to the hands of any man. Broadcasting is already the most important means of entertainment and expression in this country. With the coming of television and facsimile, its power and importance will grow greatly. The bill is an improvement in that instead of the power being exercised completely by one Minister, it is to he exercised by the Minister in conjunction with a board, which will have independent powers and be subject to some control by the Parliament. The Government would perform an outstanding service to a healthy democracy if it legislated to ensure that no Minister, or official or any private financial interest should have the power to shackle public expression or to dictate to the population what it should hear and what it should not hear. That object will not be achieved by transferring the control of national stations from the Australian Broadcasting Commission to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board or by transferring the control of the programmes of commercial stations from the vendors of medicine to a handful of officials. Frequency modulation will provide hundreds of additional channels and with the provision of new channels every community could be given the control of its own broadcasting station. I trust that the Government will bring down a bill that will ensure that broadcasting shall be divorced from direct governmental control. The Government may not be able to claim for that bill the support of all the commercial stations in Australia, as it can for this bill, which must be disturbing to the Opposition although that claim cannot be welcomed with great enthusiasm by the people outside, when they know that 62 per cent, of the commercial stations are directly associated with the leading newspapers of this country. Neither may it be able to claim for that bill as it can for this one that it is based on the legislation of anti-Labour parties in Great Britain, Canada and the United States of America. But such a' bill will be welcomed by all the Australian people. </para></speech>

                            <para>- I thought thefearless honorable member for Eden Monaro, who has denounced the political implications of the bill, and also denounced planners and those who would' foist one mind on the people of Australia in the person of the Minister or someother authority might back up his words- with deeds. I see that I was mistaken. Doubtless, he will tell his radio public on Sunday night that what he has said' represents his  views.  Yet, when offered the chance, he flatly refuses to support any amendment that would give effect to the principles that he claims are held by him. Despite the fact that the honorable member will talk in oneway and vote in another, what he hassaid is right to the point. Right through; his speech, there flowed one train of thought to which he came back time and time again. It was that to give one person authority to impose his views on the whole community was too great a power to be entrusted to any Minister. The honorable member said that although he had some confidence in the Minister who is to exercise such a power in relation to broadcasting while the present Government remains in office, there was a danger in vesting in one person such wide authority. The honorable member placed his finger squarely on the danger. We do not yet know which Minister will control this legislation because by this bill reference to the Postmaster-General, who has been in charge of broadcasting, has been expressly deleted from the principal act. For all we know, broadcasting may be controlled by any Minister. It is accepted,- of course, that it will be controlled by the Minister for Information, who is in charge of the bill in this House. For the sake of the community and in the interests of freedom of expression, I hope that it will be controlled by a gentleman, who is more tolerant of the opinion of other people than is that honorable gentleman. By all the odds that we can calculate politically, however, it would seem that he will be chosen to mould the thinking of the listeners of Australia. </para>

At that time, the then Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay,.</inline> had brought down a bill to amend theAustralian Broadcasting Act, which contained certain provisions enabling political control to be exercised over broadcasting. As honorable members will recall,, the war was then in progress and, in thenational interest, certain controls were necessary to guard against the dissemination of undesirable propaganda over theair.

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman may well ask, " Which Minister ? " I shall allow him to nominate the Minister of his choice. A great deal has been said by honorable members opposite, notably by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, and the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen),</inline> about the justification for banning their political opponents from the air because they dramatize their political propaganda. Honorable members opposite attempt to justify suppression of speech of that kind, notwithstanding that listeners to the sessions which they criticize have merely to flick a knob on their wireless sets in order to switch to another programme if they object to the matter to which they are listening. Honorable members opposite seek to justify censorship of this description, yet they have been most vociferous in this House in proclaiming that obscene plays such as <inline font-style="italic">Rusty Bugles</inline> and books such as <inline font-style="italic">Love Me Sailor</inline> should be allowed to go into every home in Australia and to fall into the hands of the young and the old in every part of Australia. They have been the champions of that kind of freedom, yet, by a remarkable somersault, they now say that the " J ohn Henry Austral " broadcasts are so misleading, damaging and wrongful that the people must be protected against them, even though they are not forced to listen to them. I do not think that honorable members opposite have ever been more hypocritical or inconsistent than they have been in this connexion. I believe that there is justification for a bill relating to broadcasting and for some greater control than that which is being exercised at the moment over . the proportions of programmes which should be devoted to advertising matter and to entertainment. We know that practically the whole of the broadcasting time of commercial stations is bought by manufacturers of soap, patent medicines and so on. They have to some degree obtained a monopoly of radio, which is one of the greatest instrumentalities for the dissemination of entertainment and information, but this bill is not designed to correct that situation. In my view, its main purpose, although I do not say that it is its only purpose, is to give effect to the provision in it which states that neither the commission nor the licensee of a commercial broadcasting station shall broadcast any dramatization of any political matter which is then current or which was current during the preceding five years. It is obvious that the Labour party feels that the manner of presentation of the " John Henry Austral " broadcasts, which does not make them tiresome to listen to and which is different from the presentation of the Prime Minister's Sunday evening dissertations </para>

                            <para>- I am unable to trace the way in which the funds that go overseas are disbursed, but in 1939 T secured, as a result of a question directed to the Postmaster-General of the day, a statement from the association showing how it disbursed its revenue in Australia. The statement is to be found on page 1.569 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 8th and 9th June, L939. At that time, the Australasian Performing Eight Association was receiving approximately £44,000 a year from the Australian Broadcasting Commission. After certain deductions were made, £19,496 was available for distribution. It was supposed to go to Australian authors and composers and to authors and composers overseas. Of the £19,496, £10,149 was remitted to the Performing Eight Society Limited, London. There was approximately £9,000 available for distribution in  Aus  tralia, and I shall indicate the trifling amounts that went to hard-working Australian authors and composers. Chappell and Company Limited, the music publishers, received £2,658. The company filed a statement showing how that sum was distributed. It reads as follows: - </para>

There are powerful influences at work which seem to be able to prevent any action from being taken by this or other governments in this connexion.

                    <para class="block">The action that the commission requested was that the Australasian Performing Right Association should be placed on the same footing as the Canadian Performing Right Association, that a general assessment of fees should be made and that there should be an averaging of those fees as between the national stations and the commercial stations. The Australian Broadcasting Commission said that, despite repeated representations, nothing had been done and that it had perforce to continue to pay to the association an annual tribute which, according to the evidence in its possession, was at least double the sum that could be justified, which meant that the excess payment was at least £17,000 a year. That statement is contained in the twelfth annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </para>

                        <para>I desire to inform the honorable member that before any action can be taken in this matter, it is necessary for certain legislation to be passed by Parliament. The drafting of the necessary bill would entail considerable work, and pressure of more urgent and important matters, particularly those relating to the war, has prevented the task from being undertaken. A suitable bill will, however, be drafted as soon as practicable. </para>

                    <para class="block">That answer was given three and a half years ago. The Australian Broadcasting Commission contends that it pays annually to the Australasian Performing Right Association £17,000 in excess of a fair and equitable sum, but not a finger has been lifted to remedy the position. The Minister for Information, when he was  chairman  of the Broadcasting Committee, agreed to a recommendation that action should be taken to give effect to the Gibson Committee's recommendation on this matter, which was that there should be one Australian fee payable by the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations, to he shared in a proportion to be determined. The fee was to be fixed by agreement between the parties. If the parties were unable to agree on the amount, the matter was to be referred to &gt;an arbitrator acceptable to them. If they were unable to agree upon an arbitrator, he was to be appointed by the Governor-General. The arbitrator's terms of reference were that he should fix a fee that was fair and equitable, and determine the proportions to be paid by the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the commercial stations. The Minister for Information and the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan)</inline> endorsed those recommendations </para>

                            <para>- I congratulate the Minister for the Navy on having written them, but I cannot congratulate the Government on having acted on them. I have revealed the small amount which Australian authors ,and composers receive from the huge sum of money which the Australasian Performing Right Association collects from the Australian Broadcasting Commission. According to the latest report of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, it pays to the Australasian Performing Right Association nearly 4 per cent, of its revenue. Each year the Australian Broadcasting Commission pays between £40,000 and £50,000, not for the benefit of Australian authors and composers, as far as I am aware, but for the benefit of those who have been able to obtain possession of the rights. The Jack  Lumsdaines  and Alfred Hills, who, as the authors and composers, are really entitled to the money, are not receiving it. </para>

                    <para>There has been a good deal of fencing in connexion with this matter, and it appears that some one is exerting powerful influence to prevent the situation "from being remedied. I am not suggesting any wrong-doing on the part of the Government. The situation has existed for a long time. However, the matter came to a head when this Parliament ratified the Statute of Westminster. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> who gave evidence before the Broadcasting Com- mittee  when the Minister for Information was the  chairman  of it, stated, <inline font-style="italic">inter aiia -</inline></para>

                        <para>In Canada, there is compulsory fixation of such fees. It may well be held that in Australia such a system of compulsory fixation, by compulsory arbitration or otherwise, would not be a mere modification or dealing merely with procedure and remedies. If section 2 of the Statute of Westminster were in force here, no difficulty on this score could possibly arise, and I have so advised the Broadcasting Committee. No such difficulty . exists iri Canada, because the Statute of Westminster was applied there in 1931. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Statute of Westminster was not in force when the Attorney-General gave that evidence. Evasive answers  were  given to questions on this subject prior to the ratification of the Statute of Westminster, but they will no longer be accepted in the face of the Attorney-General's advice on the matter. The Australian Broadcasting Commission complains that finance is one of its principal difficulties, and that it has to come to the Government cap in hand at the end of each financial year for a subvention. Therefore, I was most interested in its claim that it paid £17,000 a year some years ago - the amount is probably more to-day - in excess of a just and equitable fee to the Australasian Performing Right Association. As I have pointed out, a meagre percentage of the amount which the Australasian Performing Right Association collects from the Australian Broadcasting Commission is paid to Australian authors and composers. The situation should be remedied. Of £19,000 which was disbursed through the Australasian Performing Right Association in a particular year only £163 was paid to Australian authors and composers. The Government should act on that information. </para>

It has asked the Government to <inline font-style="italic">tai'</inline> action because it claims that it is powerless in the matter. The Australasian Performing Right Association will not agree to an arbitrator. In such circumstances, the Government should introduce legislation to compel the Australasian Performing Right Association to agree to the appointment of an arbitrator. The Australian Broadcasting Commission has been asking for such legislation for a long time. I could quote a good deal more evidence in support of my submissions, but I shall he satisfied with reminding the Prime Minister of the promise which he gave to me in May, 1945, that legislation would be drafted as soon as practicable to deal with the matter. The time has arrived when the Government should have a " look-see " in order to ascertain the reason for the delay. </para>

The original objection was that copyright complications prevented action, and subsequently, it was that the Statute of "Westminster was the obstacle. .1 am certain that if the Prime Minister faces this problem with the same degree of determination that he devotes to other problems, he will soon be able to solve the difficulty.

                        <para>. - This bill will make great changes in the system of broadcasting in Australia. Its provisions are based largely on the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> was  chairman  in the period 1940-42. One of the principal changes which the bill proposes is to increase greatly the powers of the Minister. An Australian Broadcasting Control Board will be established to take over and coordinate various functions which, up to date, have been exercised by the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Postmaster-General's  Department. In this bill, as in many other bills which this socialist Government has introduced, there has been erected a facade which ostensibly places control in the hands of a board that is supposed to safeguard the interests of the public, yet that board is to be always subject to the direction of the Minister. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board will be subject to the direction of the Minister. Some members of the, Opposition, who have spoken on this bill, have stated that the Minister who will administer the proposed act is not specified, and that the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> will have the responsibility of implementing its provisions. However, 1 have studied the definitions in the principal act, and as the definition of Minister has not been changed I presume that the Minister contemplated in the bill is the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> ; but no doubt, later, the administration of the act will be taken out of his hands and placed in the hands of the Minister for Information. Therefore, we must examine the bill most carefully. Subsection 4 of proposed new section 6k states - (4.) The Board shall have power, subject to any directions of the Minister - (n.) to determine the situation and operating .power of any broadcasting station, television station oi facsimile station; </para>

                    <para class="block">I believe, would be a very dangerous provision. It represents an attempt to deny a right that has 'been fought for in Great Britain over the centuries. Now, in the twentieth century, we have a government which proposes to abrogate it. If a law of this kind had been in force when Dean Swift wrote <inline font-style="italic">Gulliver's Travels,</inline> it could have been invoked to prevent the radio broadcasting or televising of dramatizations based upon that story, had such facilities existed at the time. In the same way, <inline font-style="italic">Dravier's</inline><inline font-style="italic">Letters,</inline> which were written in the reign of George I., and published in the Irish press, could have been banned. Those letters drew attention to the great scandal associated with the issue of copper coinage in Ireland by a person named Wood. The coinage yielded a profit of 40 per cent., which was divided between Wood and the Duchess of Kendall, who was the favorite of the reigning monarch, George I. The Government is seeking to reintroduce the state of affairs which existed when Laud was one of the functionaries behind the Star Chamber in the reign of James I., and afterwards in the reign of Charles I. That was the tribunal which condemned William  Prynne  to have his ears cut off.  Prynne  was writing a book against play acting. He had a licence to do so, but before he finished the work, the Queen and the ladies of the court gave a performance of Walter Montagu's <inline font-style="italic">Shepherd's Paradise.</inline> Later, a passage in  Prynne's  book was construed as an aspersion on the Queen. Certain other passages referred to tyrants and to Nero, and they were taken as an attack on the King. Totalitarian governments, drunk with power, never hesitate to read into writings or dramatizations of political events meanings which were probably never intended. After  Prynne  had been already imprisoned in the Tower of London for a year, he was sentenced to imprisonment for life, was fined £5,000, expelled from Lincoln's Inn. and had his ears cut off. He was also branded on the cheek with the letters " S.L. ", standing for the words " seditious libel ". Under  such  legislation as this, the cartoons of  Gilray,  which powerfully attacked the administration under the later Georges, would  have been, forbidden. I maintain that the broadcasting of dramatizations of political events and of other matter should be permitted so long as they are not obscene or blasphemous, and do not advocate the overthrow of the government of the day by revolution or force of arms. It might be necessary to adopt some other safeguards also, but the widest possible freedom should be permitted. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eraser)</inline> alleged that certain writings by " John Henry Austral ", which were dramatized over the air, were responsible for moving the Government to forbid presentations of the kind. No such provision was considered to be necessary in earlier legislation, and Ministers have gone back to the days of the Star Chamber for a precedent to .justify it in preventing the publication of matter criticizing the government of the day. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro pointed out several times that this legislation will be available for use, not by this Government only, but also by those that succeed it. A subsequent government could use the powers in this legislation to prevent freedom of expression over the air by the Labour party. The present Government has been so long in office, and is so drunk with power, that it proposes to insert in legislation a provision which cuts right across the ancient rights for which Englishmen have fought. On that ground alone, this must be regarded as a had bill. </para>
                    <para>The bill also empowers the Minister to tell the board what kind of programmes commercial stations may broadcast. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro is a frequent radio broadcaster, and is, apparently, a keen  student  of broadcasting. He told us that the Australian Broadcasting Commission's programmes were very bad, and that the programmes of commercial stations were not much better. There are some persons, and probably the honorable member for Eden-Monaro is one of them, who would not permit the people to choose the programmes they want. Such persons must always be educating the people, and giving them what they, the planners, think is good for them. That sort of thing is being done in Russia to- day, just as it was done in Germany under the nazis. The people are not to be given what they want, but only what somebody thinks is good for them. The test of the matter is that a majority of the publiclistens to the commercial programme. Most of the authorities on broadcasting admit that the commercial stations, which have to depend for their existence on revenue from advertising, are able to attract a majority of the listeners. This has been established by such tests as the making of numerous telephone calls tofind out how many persons have been listening to a particular programme." The commercial stations give the publicwhat it wants. The Government is attempting to crib, cabin and confinepublic expression, and "to give the people only those radio programmes which the Government wants them to hear. That tendency should be resisted. </para>

                        <para>.- The Government says that it needs another board to control broadcasting. Boardsappear to possess a strange fascination for this Government. Apparently, it .believes that the existing machinery for the control of broadcasting has failed. I should like to know whether it believes that the Minister in charge of broadcasting has failed to do his job, and whether the Postmaster-General's Department has failed. Does the Government admitthat the Broadcasting Committee is a wash-out? If so, it can probably justify the appointment of another board. When this Government finds that a job is too big for its own Ministers, it invariably sets up a board to do the work, and I suppose we must be prepared to accept the bill on that understanding. The Government wants to set up a board, and the Government will be responsible foreverything that the board does. I, for one, am not prepared to relieve it of any of its responsibility. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>There may be justification for the appointment of another board if it satisfies certain conditions. A board should be independent, it should be free from political interference, and it should replacethe system of multiple controls at present hampering the broadcasting industry. Properly administered, such a board could, help broadcasting. Badly administered,.  it would retard and hamstring broadcasting. I agree absolutely that broadcasting should be conducted in the public interest. It should give the people the kind of service that they want and not a service foisted on to them by a dictator of broadcasting or a group of dictators who seek to satisfy their own whims and their own prejudices. The safety valve of broadcasting is the retention of vigorous competition and the rigid suppression of monopolistic interests. The more competition there' is the better will be the service. It is much better to have a hundred people planning competitive programmes than to have &gt;one man, or even three men as members of the board, centralizing all programmes under the one control. That would be regimentation of the air. There can be two kinds of monopolies. One would be a government monopoly, similar to the British Broadcasting Corporation. That would be bad, because it would give the Australian people the monotonous kind of programme for which the British Broadcasting Corporation has become so notorious. The other, equally vicious, would be a monopoly established through the network system such as operates in the United States of America to-day. That kind of monopoly means that all of the stations that are members of the network are more or less controlled by the big monopolistic network. That type, also, is bad, because the network can squeeze out the independent stations. It means that they can extort monopolistic conditions in return for their programmes, and that they can exact a toll on station revenues through discounts and selling commissions. Australian broadcasting has been able, so far, to keep comparatively, free of both of those undesirable influences. Only one attempt is being made to operate a network in Australia on the American system. That is with the Macquarie network, over which the Prime Minister speaks every Sunday evening. The board proposed under the bill should see to it that broadcasting does not fall into the hands of monopolies. It should see that the requirements of the Australian Broadcasting Act governing licences are honoured in the spirit as well as in the letter, and it should remove broadcasting from political interference. </para>
                    <para class="block">It should see that the system does not pander to sectional interests. All these conditions call for high qualifications on the part of .the members of the proposed board. If it can fulfil the obligations the board will be good for broadcasting. If it falls below the requirements of its responsibilities, the board will be a disastrous experiment. This proposal appears to have started out as a bid by the Minister for Information to grab dictatorial power over all broadcasting. If he succeeds, we shall have a regimentation of the air similar to that operating in dictator countries throughout the world. But since the bill was first proposed, other members of the caucus appear to have had something to say. I am waiting to see whether the views of the rank and file members have had any weight at all with the Government. Certain assurances were given to caucus that the Government's motives were to be helpful to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and to the commercial stations. Members were told that political hacks and " Yes " men would not be appointed to the board. Up to now the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> has been in charge of broadcasting. He is a member of the Australian Labour party whom I have always regarded as possessing a fair understanding of Labour principles. He has stood up for those principles on many occasions. Any man who holds principles above expediency is a man who should be given a chance to prove himself. If the Postmaster-General is to be responsible for the appointments to this board, and if he does not allow himself to be dominated by the Minister for Information, the members will be appointed to the board on their capacity as administrators and their judicial outlook. They would have a fair chance of being reasonable and proper administrators. But if this is to be another board consisting of political hatchet-men, out to do a job for the Government on a party basis, broadcasting in the future will be infinitely worse than it is at present. If this bill is to establish another instrumentality like Trans- Australia Airlines, the board jobs will be plums for other camp followers like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> C. Taylor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> W. Coles, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> Wilson. </para>
                    <para class="block">That would make broadcasting the plaything of party politics and board membership might become a game of the " ins and- outs ". That is an aspect of which all parties must be careful. I point out that the Government has far more to lose by such a game than has the Opposition. The Australian Labour party controls a number of large broadcasting stations, most of which earn big profits. Whilst these Labour-controlled stations remain independent, Labour cannot be blanketed off the air, irrespective of whether it he in office or in opposition. That is in accordance with the spirit of democratic government. The real danger of this bill is that it might not he a Don Cameron bill ; it may eventually turn out to be a Calwell bill. The Minister for Information appears to have been obsessed with the method of the totalitarian propagandists. It is for the Government and its supporters to see that he does not realize his objective. If he does, the only ones to suffer will be members of the present Government. If the board ever comes under the thumb of the present Minister for Information, neither the Australian Broadcasting Commission nor the commercial stations will be safe. There will only be Calwell stations, dedicated to the greater glorification of Arthur A. Calwell. That state of affairs' would be as dangerous to members of the present Government as to any 'one else. There should be no illusions about the conditions. In considering the bill on its merits we must assume that the Government will resist the demand to hand over these powers to party hacks or " Yes " men of the Minister for Information. The board is to be under the Minister. To-day that means <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron;</inline> to-morrow, it may mean the Minister for Information; next year, it may mean the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron).</inline> I have an idea that the honorable member for Barker would enjoy to the full exercising the powers contained in the measure now being debated. Too often has a Labour government passed an act that has been against the Labour movement when its administration has fallen into the hands of anti-Labour governments. That has happened before and it could happen again. One Cameron might be bringing in this bill for another Cameron to use. </para>

                    <para>Up  till now the technical control of broadcasting has been in the hands of the Postmaster-General's Department. Despite suggestions to the contrary by members of the Government, that administration has done a .very good job. The present dual system of broadcasting is the result of the foresight of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Brown. He was a man of vision and an impartial administrator. The more he saw of overseas broadcasting, the more he was satisfied with the system he had created for Australia. He was followed by men like McVey, Panning, Malone and Martin. All have been conscientious administrators, with a proper regard for the traditions of the Public Service of this country. The Government, in introducing this bill, was remiss in its failure to pay full regard to the achievement* of those men. Most of the mistakes thar have been made, can be traced to political interference. In that regard this Government has been no different from any other government. It has played politics in broadcasting. This bill retains political control through the Minister. That is essential under our system of responsible government. It is the right principle. If the Government abuses its powers, then it must be held responsible for such abuses by the people. If we are to believe the arguments put forward by the Government, the only reason for the bill, is that broadcasting and its future have become so important that they call for. more than part-time administration. When we look at some of the other departments,, and then consider the ramifications of the Postmaster-General's  Department, I am inclined to agree. But. if that is to be the approach, the real difficulty will he to get the right men to do the job. It will he hard enough to find one man with the necessary qualifications. It will be a really major problem to find three men with the necessary objective and judicial temperaments, without any preconceptions about broadcasting policy and without an axe to grind. Still, the Government has taken on the job. It is prepared to dump its present radio administrators in the Postmaster-General's Department. If it makes n. mistake on this, then it will certainly be answerable to the electors. If the board starts interfering with favourite broadcasting programmes, the members on the Government benches who sponsored this proposal will have to answer for it. I am quite prepared to allow them to accept that responsibility. For example, we are told that there is too much sport on Saturday afternoons. "What are the facts? There are more listeners on  raceafternoons, either on Saturdays or weekdays, than on any other afternoons. The number of people listening must be some indication of what the public needs. In Sydney there are eight broadcasting stations, two national and six commercial. Of these, on Saturday afternoons, five broadcast sport, and three others have general entertainment. One commercial station, 2SM, has an afternoon's programme provided by live artist talent, encouraging young Australians. Obviously, listeners have ample alternative programmes available to them. I should be surprised to hear that the Government has received any substantial protests regarding too much sport. Suppose the new board decides that there are too many stations broadcasting sport. Even if it is only one station too many, what will happen? Granted that the national station is allowed to continue, which of the commercials will be called upon to give up its racing description? "Will it be 2GB, key station of the Macquarie network, over which the Prime Minister loves to speak, or will it be 2KY, owned and controlled by the Labour Council? What will happen if the board decides that 2GB or 2UE have to abandon their racing descriptions? There are many thousands of listeners who have decided preferences. Many want to hear Cyril Angles. Others want to hear Ken </para>
                    <para class="block">Howard. Which group will be asked to forfeit its preferences? Whether it be Cyril Angles, or Ken Howard, the people affected will not blame the new board. They will blame the Government for interfering with their freedom to listen to the commentator they prefer. Then there is the other sticky problem of religious broadcasts on Sundays. The Broadcasting Committee had the idea that every station should have a religious programme at the same time on Sunday mornings. But if the spirit of this bill is carried out, the board may decide that there are already too many religious programmes on the air on Sundays. I think we are entitled to some explanation of the meaning of the clause in the bill dealing with religious broadcasts. That provision could be very dangerous, especially if read in conjunction with the following subclause regarding broadcasts of controversial matters. If the new board takes evidence, or conducts a survey, it may find that 50 per cent, of the listeners want sermons, and 50 per cent, want music. Which stations will be asked to alter their programmes? That could be a very serious matter and place a heavy responsibility on the Government. One Sydney station, 2CH, on Sundays has no commercial advertising. It is conducted on that day by the Council of Churches. When the board starts out to correlate programmes, it may decide that 2CH should be no different from any other station, and that it should cater for the needs not of one section but of all listeners. If it had a temperance talk, would it have to give equal facilities to the liquor trade? If it did, the Government members would then be certain to hear from the Council of Churches. Then there is 2SM, broadcasting on behalf of the Catholic Church on Sundays. What would be the Government's view if the board interfered with the rights of that station ? On the other hand 2KY broadcasts a popular non-religious programme. On Sundays it earns its biggest revenue of the week and has the largest audience of any Sydney station during the daytime. If the board interferes with its broadcasts, 2KY will lose a great deal of its profits. The New South Wales Trades and Labour Council will not welcome that kind of interference. </para>
                    <para>We are told that the board will reduce the volume of advertising matter. That will hurt most stations like 2KY and small country stations, which depend largely on what are called "scattered announcements ". The network stations have more sponsored programmes. Big advertisers running programmes such as the " Amateur Hour " can buy time by the hour, and in that hour use no more than three or four minutes of advertising. The stations depending on small advertisers have to use more advertising in order to obtain anything like the same amount of revenue. Will the board penalize stations like 2KY and the smaller advertisers in favour of the larger stations and larger advertisers? The bill contains a proviso requiring broadcasting stations to supply facilities on' an equitable basis for political broadcasts. With one exception - 2KY Sydney - commercial stations make time available equally to all political parties. Station 2KY broadcasts only Labour propaganda. If this bill be passed, will 2KY have to take Liberal party and Australian Country party propaganda? At present no amount of money can buy time on station 2KY. Is this really a bill to deal with 2KY and the other Labour stations? The honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fraser)</inline> pointed out that that should be given very careful consideration. Wo government goes on forever, but the power conferred by an act of Parliament continues. I have looked carefully at this bill. I am not surprised that the commercial stations support it. Indeed, I am not surprised that honorable members opposite support it- </para>

                    <para>Instead of generalized statements, I should like to hear how the Government proposes to tackle these practical problems. </para>
                    <para class="block">Is it intended to pass the responsibility over to the board? These problems are not easy of solution. If the board is to operate successfully, I am at a loss to understand how it will co-ordinate all the many other authorities that have a finger in broadcasting. What possible justification is there for the continuation of the life of the Parliamentary Broadcasting Committee ? If . the committee is* to remain, whose recommendations will the Minister accept? Will he accept the advice of the board on a particular problem, or will he discard the' board's advice and accept the advice of the Broadcasting Committee? If both the board and the committee are to continue, he will find himself in an impossible position. On the one hand, he will have his board of experts, and on the other he will have a committee representative of both Houses of Parliament. Whichever is rejected will be offended. If both always agree, .then one represents a damnable waste of public money and time. Or is the Postmaster-General to he placed in the position of Solomon? Will he accept the board's advice on the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the committee's advice on the commercial stations ? If the board is expected to look after such problems as broadcasting ethics and good taste, what will happen to the State advisory committees which were established under the 1942 act? At present the members of those committees serve in an honorary capacity, and act in the nature of censorship boards, investigating any complaints on behalf of the Minister and making recommendations to him. Under this new system, will they continue to do all that work, only to have their advice dropped into the wastepaper basket when the board sends along its recommendation? Consider the position of the Director-General of Health, who has the final say on all broadcasts on health topics. What will happen if the board wants to broadcast a play on tuberculosis and the Director-General of Health bans it? Then there is the rather strange position of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Its members are not full-time employees. They were appointed by the Government, because they were regarded as the outstanding men and women of the community, who were beat fitted to run a national broadcasting system. The commission has had in its membership some very distinguished citizens who have devoted a great deal of time to the study of broadcasting. On the present commission are members appointed by the Labour Government, including the <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Mr. Boyer,</inline> and the  deputy chairman.  The general manager of the commission is at present expected to take his orders from the commission. What will be the position in the future? Will the board override the commission? The commission may decide that it wants to stage a play every Sunday evening at 8 o'clock, and the board may say that, as there are already two plays on the air on Sunday at that time, the commission should broadcast a church service. At present the commission is supposed to be an independent body. How independent will it be after this bill becomes law? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boyer</inline> will probably tell <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moses</inline> that he has to do one thing, and the  chairman  of the board may tell <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moses</inline> that he has to do something altogether different. What, then, will be the position? The greater the interest the board takes in the work of actually controlling broadcasting the more it must come into conflict with the commission, unless that body is altogether supine. If the commission is doing its job, then it is certain to have different ideas on many subjects from those of the board. These are the kind of problems I should like to see the Government clarify. </para>
                    <para>Then there is the rather thorny problem of dramatized political broadcasts, about which other honorable members have spoken. The Labour party was the first to use political dramas in an election campaign. We used them in New South Wales during the 1932 election campaign. We did not win, but they caused a lot of controversy. The United Australia party at the time was very hostile to their use and wanted them banned. </para>

                        <para>.- This bill proposes to alter the whole basis of the control of broadcasting in Australia. It contains many dangerous provisions. As the result of great improvements' in the technique of broadcasting, particularly in the field of facsimile broadcasting, frequency modulation and television, it seems likely that broadcasting will become a most potent agent for the dissemination of propaganda. Broadcasting will, no doubt, in many respects take the place of the newspapers as a medium of informing the public mind. Many of the provisions of this bill which are so dangerous may at some not distant date have a boomerang effect against the Government. Provision is made in the bill for the establishment of a board to control broadcasting in Australia. Although we do not yet know who are to be appointed to the board, we know from past experience that, as in the case of many other boards appointed by this Government, the majority of them will be people whose political philosophy coincides with that of the Government. The Government may try to save its face by appointing one or two people to the board who are apparently neutral, but the great majority of the members will be its own supporters. When the men of the Australian Imperial Force were in the field, the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> spent £70,000 on what he called post-war education. That education consisted of the most blatant misrepresentation of the political situation in Australia that has ever been made by any political party in this country. </para>

                    <para>The broadcasting stations have a fair amount of liberty now. I am satisfied that the great majority of the people of Australia do not listen to the programmes of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which is, to a certain degree, run by the Government but they do listen to amateur hours and many other programmes which are broadcast by the commercial stations. The people are entitled to the kind of entertainment that they appreciate most, and I do not agree that the Government is entitled to appoint a board to dictate the form of radio entertainment to which they should listen. The Government has no right to appoint people to disseminate political propaganda of. the kind in which the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fraser)</inline> indulges on Sunday nights. I should not be surprised to find that many people in Eden-Monaro are so disgusted with the honorable gentleman's broadcasts that they would commit suicide rather than listen to them again. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know how that figure is assessed. If I were in Eden-Monaro, or anywhere else in Australia for that matter, and could not turn off my radio set when the honorable gentleman was speaking, I should smash it. The bill provides that one of the members of the Australian Broadcasting Commission shall be an officer of the Department of the Treasury, and that another shall be an officer of the Postmaster-General's Department, and that neither of those commissioners shall be the.  chairman  or vice-chairman of the commission. Those two officers will be able to exercise a great influence upon radio programmes, especially as the expenses of broadcasting will not be paid from listeners' licence-fees but from an appropriation by. the Treasurer. I daresay that a fee will still be demanded from listeners, and I have no doubt that the Government will use broadcasting as a means of taxation. It will possibly increase the listener's licence-fee to £5 5s., and give some of the proceeds to the loafers around the wharfs. These commissioners will be able to exercise a great influence on the policy of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, first, because the Treasury will supply the funds and, secondly, because broadcasting will come within the jurisdiction of the Postmaster-General's Department. At the present time, the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> is, in my opinion, doing quite a good job. He is using some of the tremendous income of the Post Office to provide some services for the Australian people, although he is, unfortunately, spending too large a proportion of it in the big cities. Although the Postmaster-General is doing a good job, he does not impress me as being fitted to decide the kind of programmes that the people of Australia want, and I do not consider that he should be able to exert any influence on the board. </para>

                            <para>- If there must be a board, there are thousands of people in Australia who, provided they have complete independence, are qualified culturally to suggest programmes that would be in the best interests of the people and fair and just to all political parties and all sections of the community. I do not believe that a man who has been associated throughout his adult life with one political party, and who has been a rabid member of that party, should have any voice in deciding the programmes to which the Australian people will be forced to listen and which will have an effect upon them, whether it be a good or bad one. I am strongly opposed to this bill, although I believe that there is room for some changes. The Government should deal, for instance, with the gang of parasites which is demanding a proportion of the proceeds of every little show that is run for charitable purposes. Although the Australasian Performing Right Association is supposed to act in the interests of copyright-holders, it is demanding payment for the reproduction of music and plays which .were written centuries ago by people who have no descendants. Its actions constitute one of the worst instances of commercial robbery that has ever been tolerated in any country. I do not say that the Opposition is without blame in this matter. The present Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham, and Viscount Bruce of Melbourne were, in their time, responsible for allowing this cancer to grow on the body politic of Australia, and for permitting this parasite to suck the blood of the people of this country. The Australasian Performing Bight Association should be compelled to act in the interests of the authors and musicians who can still derive some benefits from their works, and, in my opinion, any government which permits it to continue as at present is not worthy of the name of government. </para>

I believe that it is acting wrongly in attempting to give the party that is in power a deciding voice in what radio programmes shall be presented to the Australian people. If the members of that party are unscrupulous enough, and human nature is fairly unscrupulous, they will be enabled to put forward their point of view, and to ignore that of any other section of the community. I oppose the bill in its present form. </para>

Television, frequency modulation and facsimile broadcasting are coming into general use. The opinion of all the experts is that the development of television will be very rapid. It is developing rapidly in the United States of America now, and will doubtless do so in all other countries. It is evident that the appropriate section of the Postmaster- </para>

                    <para>General's Department, although it may have been adequate in the past to conduct the oversight of broadcasting, is not now adequate for the purpose. Some other organization or body must be established, and I suggest that one of the kind that is referred to in the bill is best suited to meet the needs of the situation. </para>
                    <para>I agree that the members of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board must be of a high standard of personal integrity, and ability, because people without ability could not do the work that the members of the board will be called upon to do. The honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin)</inline> said that the members of the board might be unscrupulous. Some funny things were done in regard to broadcasting in days gone by. It  amuses me to hear honorable members opposite referring to this bill as a step towards nationalization. As a matter of fact, it has nothing at all to do with nationalization. It proposes to set up a body to control and have the oversight of the broadcasting systems of Australia. Such a body would, perhaps, not have been so necessary a few years ago as it is now, but modern technical developments makie it essential that there should be established some authoritative body that can exercise oversight of broadcasting. The first act of naturalization of broadcasting in this country was that of the Bruce-Page Government, which nationalized the A class stations. Those who have any knowledge of this subject will recall that the people who went to a great deal of trouble to acquire shares in various broadcasting stations in Australia and formed the Dominion Broadcasting Company squealed for years about the unfair treatment to which they were subjected by the Bruce-Page Government. The company claimed substantial compensation from the Commonwealth. It complained that it had been misled by the Bruce-Page Government into agreeing to a unified system of A class stations. After that Government had paid an excessive price for the shares, particularly for shares in Tasmanian A class stations, it nationalized them. The Dominion Broadcasting Company claimed substantial compensation, and the then Attorney-General, who is now <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline></para>
                    <para class="block">Latham, resisted the claim most strongly. The claim was submitted to various committees of inquiry, and many lawyers were engaged in the negotiations. Finally, the Lyons Government rejected the claim. </para>
                    <para>The Dominion Broadcasting Company also complained that it had reason to believe that it would be given the right to supply the programmes, and that the Government had hopelessly misled it, because that right was granted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stuart</inline> Doyle. Until the day of his death, I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Best, who represented the claimant, was the strongest denouncer of the Bruce-Pago Government, because, in his opinion, it had robbed the company. As I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee at the time, I have some knowledge of the subject. I still believe that the Bruce-Page Government acted properly in nationalizing the A class stations. I said frankly, many years ago, that I did not consider that the control of broadcasting should have been allowed to get out of the hands of the Government. However, all that water has now run under the bridge. </para>
                    <para>The British Broadcasting Corporation, to which the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> has referred, is a government-owned institution, and no other broadcasting company is allowed to compete with it. The British Broadcasting Corporation is financed entirely from consolidated revenue and not from listeners' licence-fees. Neither a Conservative government nor a Labour government would consider altering the present system of the control of broadcasting in the United Kingdom. As a government instrumentality, it has the same kind of independence as the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Commissioner of Railways have, but, finally, it is responsible to the government of the day. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Brown, who was Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, recommended to the Bruce Page Government that it should establish a C class broadcasting system which would, be owned by the government and provide sponsored programmes.. However, the government of the day did not adopt that proposal. Probably it had enough troubles on its hands at the time with some of its friends as the result of nationalizing the A class stations, and did not desire to add to its difficulties. Nobody would accuse <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Brown of being a radical socialist. He has been a magnificent public servant, and nobody has a higher respect for him than I have, but I should be greatly surprised if his political views during the years have coincided with those of the Labour party. Yet he recommended to the Bruce-Page Government that it should establish C class broadcasting stations as I have indicated. Many people object to some of the broadcasts from commercial stations. I do not propose to refer to the entertainment value of some of their programmes, but I consider that some of their advertisements leave much to be desired. How frequently do we hear that a citizen of " Yarrabunda  ", a hypothetical place, had suffered from pains in the back for many years, but had obtained immediate relief after taking the nostrum that the broadcasting station was advertising. I do not believe that such advertisements are satisfactory, or in the best interests of the public. It is true that the commercial broadcasting stations depend for their existence on the revenue that they receive from advertisers, but I do not think that the public should be forced to listen to many of the advertisements. A few days ago, I spoke to the general manager of a commercial broadcasting station about an advertisement for some pills. Apparently they were an elixir of life,, because, according to the claim, they would cure every ailment. I have never been impressed by some of the programmes of the commercial stations, but I recognize that they derive their revenue from advertisements. Broadcasting in Australia would have benefited had the Bruce-Page Government adopted the recommendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Brown, because the kind of programmes to which I have been referring would not then have been inflicted upon the long-suffering Australian public. In my opinion, advertising matter of that kind could well be omitted from newspapers and from broadcasting sessions. Many of the patent medicines which are advertised are complete frauds. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Bendigo has claimed that the public should be given the kind of entertainment that it wants. If the honorable member's idea were adopted, listeners in country towns, when switching on their radios on a Sunday afternoon, would probably hear a description of a football match in Melbourne or a cricket match in Sydney. Under present conditions, some one in authority decides that such -broadcasts shall not be made on a Sunday. People are not allowed to have all the time -exactly the sort of entertainment that they want. The Chief Secretary of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baddeley,</inline> banned a play, <inline font-style="italic">Busty Bugles,</inline> although I suppose "that some people desired to see it. The people do not always get the kind of programmes that they want. Conservative governments have been in office in Victoria for many years, with a short break when a Labour government was in office, but the form of entertainment which the public of Melbourne are said to desire on Sundays has been denied to them for decades. The honorable member for Bendigo has adopted a ridiculous attitude. Melbourne has not a Sunday newspaper, yet reading the Sunday newspaper is a form of entertainment. Sydney has three Sunday newspapers, and I do not suppose that the people in that city are less moral than are the people of Melbourne; The statement that all the people should have what they want all the time is utter nonsense. If an entertainer at the Tivoli Theatre cracks a joke which is too " blue ", an inspector of police intervenes and forbids a repetition of it. </para>

                    <para>For reasons of administration, some authority must be established to deal with the phenomenal development of broadcasting. Progress in radio will also be rapid in future. Some honorable members opposite have asked why the Australian Broadcasting Commission or the Government should have a monopoly of frequency modulation and television. My reply to them is also a question. Why should not the Government have the monopoly? Frequency modulation and television belong to the people, whom the Government represents. I recognize that honorable members may have different views on this matter, but if the Government considers that great developments in broadcasting, such as television and frequency modulation, should be reserved for a governmental instrumentality, why should not the people have what really belongs to them? Television will probably progress more rapidly than frequency modulation in the next few years, and the financially weaker commercial stations may be crushed out of existence by the powerful monopolies. The Acting Leader of the Opposition has said that the commercial stations have not been game to protest against the bill. I remind the honorable gentleman that in 1937 the commercial stations asked the Government to appoint a board to control broadcasting. I know that they do not agree with all the provisions in this bill, but they have expressed themselves in favour of the appointment of a board such as the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The commercial stations do not fear this bill. The financially weaker ones realize that they will be mopped up or driven out of existence by the powerful monopolies, should the commercial stations be given the right to use television and frequency modulation. The introduction of television and frequency modulation will cost many millions of pounds, and the less wealthy commercial stations will not be able to afford the expense of converting from amplitude modulation to frequency modulation. Without the safeguards provided in the bill, the smaller commercial stations would be mopped up by the bigger organizations which would eventually secure a complete monopoly. I believe that if a monopoly is to be established., the people as a whole, who own the rights, and not commercial interests who desire to exploit the people, should have control. The bill has nothing to do with the nationalization of broadcasting. It deals with the control of broadcasting. </para>
                    <para>Reference has been made to the dramatization of political events. I have not listened to any of those broadcasts, but  disinterested persons, who are not supporters of the Labour party, have informed me that they are disgusted with some of the material. A few days ago, I had a conversation with a clergyman who had listened to a political drama. Apparently, words were put into the months of the players who were supposed to represent members of Parliament or Ministers which those individuals had never uttered. Should the broadcasting system be used in an attempt to deceive the people into believing that a Minister uttered certain words? I am informed that even the presiding officer of the House has not been immune. Such tactics have disgusted people who are not interested in politics. The banning of political dramas is not new. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackenzie</inline> King, who led Conservative governments in Canada for more than twenty years, approved of the ban on ali dramatizations of political events. This bill will impose a ban on dramatizations of political events which have occurred in the last five years. The honorable member for Bendigo has referred to the appointment of a representative of the Treasury and a representative of the Postmaster-General's Department to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. "We hope to provide for the Australian Broadcasting Commission a long-range programme similar to that which the Government has endeavoured to provide for all departments, including the Department of Defence. Hitherto, a wrangle has occurred every twelve months about the developmental programmes for certain departments for the following financial year, and no department had a long-range programme. To-day, the Postmaster-General's Department has a long-range programme. </para>

                            <para>- The contract has been let to a private contractor, and if the bouses fail to materialize, it will be a reflection upon private enterprise. The Government does not wish the Australian Broadcasting Commission to be coming to the Government every three months to ask for more money. When this bill is passed, there will be drawn up for the Australian Broadcasting Commission a programme extending over a number of years, so that it will know precisely what it can do. That is one of the reasons why it is proposed to place a representative of the Treasury on the. commission. During the seven years that I have been Treasurer, I have found that most Ministers realize the value of having a first-class Treasury official in their confidence. Even some of the semi-private organizations upon which there are Treasury representatives appreciate the value of such representation. A man is a fool who thinks that, because he knows something about politics, he is qualified to deal with statistics and accounts. The function of the Treasury official on the Australian Broadcasting Commission will be to deal with such matters, just as the function of the official of the Postmaster-General's Department will be to give advice on technical matters. Those officials will not be called upon to advise the commission on programmes, or to say whether " Billy Blue " or somebody else should be on the air. It is not intended to take away from the commission the right to decide who shall be given free political broadcasts. No government has ever had trouble with the commission on that matter. The present Government kas never tried to get more time for free political broadcasting than is given to Opposition parties. As a matter of fact, the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> once got a double dose of time because somebody cut the line he was using during the first five minutes of his broadcast. Therefore, the commission, being completely fair, gave him his time over again. The Government was not concerned in the decision. </para>

                    <para>The purpose of the bill is not nationalization of broadcasting, but the setting up of an authority to control broadcasting effectively, including the utilization of available channels. I do not make any bones about saying that; I think that some supervision of programmes is desirable, but by that I do not mean arbitrary control. The  chairman  of the board will consult with the managements of commercial broadcasting stations, and come to an arrangement with them about programmes. I know that it is impossible to satisfy everybody when arranging programmes. I am told that the Leader of the Australian Country party sometimes gets a line more over the air than t do, but I do not complain. Probably be deserves it. I believe that, on one occasion, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> was given five minutes over the air, while the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> who followed him, was given only one minute. There were a lot of complaints about that, but I do not 'become excited over such matters. The Government is concerned about creating an organization which will control the great developments taking place in broadcasting, and which will give the best possible service to the public. It must be remembered that the commercial broadcasting stations have no rights. They have been granted licences for a limited period. They are using something that belongs to the people, and the people have the right to ensure that the assets which they own shall be used to the best advantage. As for the kind of entertainment offered, we know that a concerto in E minor may be followed by some of the most modern dance music, which many people do not like. Our purpose is to ensure that, at any time of the day, a listener shall be able to get what he wants from some station.  1  make no reflection on the officials of the Postmaster-General's Department when  1  say that, in view of the impending developments in broadcasting, control can no longer be left in the hands of that department. Having regard to the prospective introduction of frequency modulation, and to the many new channels which the introduction of that system will make available, we believe that it is necessary to establish a first-class organization to control broadcasting. </para>

                        <para>.- It will not take me long to say what  1  have to say about this bill. When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> rose to speak, he probably conveyed the impression to any one just entering the House that he intended to explain the bill thoroughly, and clarify the whole position. However, he did nothing of the kind. As usual, he discussed many trivial matters, and attempted to distract the attention of hi.= hearers from the real substance of the bill. In this he succeeded to some extent. He spoke of pills and .backache cures, of trunk telephone lines and monopolies. If he really meant what he said about monopolies, he would have dealt long ago with a monopoly of taxation that is crushing many ex-servicemen who own small businesses. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister spoke of trunk telephone lines, and claimed that the Government was extending them into outback areas. For a long time, I have been asking for certain telephone facilities in my electorate, but without success. This bill proposes to set up a board to control broadcasting, and the Government, through the Minister chosen for- the purpose, will control the board. The policy of the Government is socialization, and there is not the slightest doubt that that policy will be applied, through the Minister, and through the board, to broadcasting. This bill is followed on the notice-paper by two others, one dealing with nationality and citizenship, and* the other dealing with an international trade agreement. All these bills have a common aim. Other speakers in this debate have pointed out how broadcast matter can be phrased so as to convey certain meanings. Let me refer to a broadcast made by the Prime Minister last Sunday week over a station which he frequently uses. It is not only " John Henry Austral " who can dramatize political issues. The Prime Minister said that he was tired of listening to Opposition members disparaging the Public Service. Everybody knows that the Opposition has never at any time in this House found fault with public servants. What they have condemned is the action of the Government in appointing so many public servants in order to carry out its socialist programme. The Prime Minister suggested that the Opposition was finding fault with public servants. </para>

I am usually to be found on one side or the other of it, and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> cannot keep me on the rail on this subject or any other. My objection to the bill is that it gives the Government complete control over an important advertising medium. We do not know yet who will be appointed to the board. I am sure that the people do not approve of the proposed alterations in the method of controlling Australia's broadcasting services, but the Government, having the numbers, will do what it likes. Not until the next general election will the* people have an opportunity to express their opinion. </para>

                        <para>. -  I do wish to speak. I thank the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> for the consideration extended to me, following a.n oversight on my part regarding the call. I appreciate that consideration very much. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> in his speech made what, to my mind, were two significant remarks. One was evidently intended to assure the Opposition and the country that there was no nationalization in this measure. The right honorable gentleman stated that this was a simple bill in conformity with the long-range planning of the Labour Government. In the latter respect I thoroughly agree with his remarks, but to endeavour to assure the Opposition that there is no nationalization in this simplelooking measure is asking us to accept too much, in view of past experiences. I remind honorable members that similar remarks were made by Government members repeatedly when the now famous banking acts were before this House. In the light of after events, I think that the Opposition can be excused for any suspicion that it might have in regard to  this measure, particularly when we consider and analyse it, having regard to the fundamental principles of the policy of the Australian Labour party, which are the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. The Government claims that this bill is intended to effect the more efficient and coordinated control of broadcasting in Australia, to strengthen the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and to introduce a different system of financing the national broadcasting service. However, I regard this measure as one of the most subtle and dangerous pieces of legislation that has been introduced into this Parliament in recent years. Under the guise of being an apparently harmless and innocuous administrative measure, the bill is, in fact, the latest and most dangerous step towards the regimentation of Australian thought and action that has yet been attempted. It is in keeping with the decision of the recent triennial conference of the Australian Labour party to retain the objective of the socialization of industry, distribution and exchange. It will be recalled that that conference, which was held as recently as last September, reaffirmed planks in that party's platform, calling for nationalization of banking, credits, and insurance, monopolies, shipping, public health, radio services, and sugar refining. The Prime Minister told the conference that in effecting nationalization the Government had been making a selection of really essential activities and services. Obviously, broadcasting is in the forefront of these essential things, because no one recognizes more than does the Prime Minister and the Minister for Information the tremendous value of radio as a vehicle for government propaganda. This legislation evidences, if evidence were required, the Government's determination to introduce the Goebbels technique into the Australian way of life. It wants to give the Australian people a taste of the undemocratic propaganda methods which have been the outstanding characteristics of totalitarianism. While it should be recognized that government control of broadcasting has, for a great many years, been one of the planks of the Australian Labour party, it must be recognized that in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin's</inline> policy speech in 1928* he promised nationalization of broadcasting. In 1937 the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Curtin declared that broadcasting must be essentially and exclusively a publicly controlledutility. The decision to embody that matter in this bill must be obvious toevery one. Therefore, I agree with the Prime Minister when he stated that thismeasure is consistent with the longrangeplanning of the Australian Labour party. </para>
                    <para>As honorable members are aware, the Prime Minister has made no secret of the fact that he is smarting under criticism that has been meted out by thepress and otherwise to his Administration. It is not surprising, therefore, that, realizing that there will be a general election next year, he wants to gain complete control of this very important vehicle of news and propaganda. Notwithstanding frequent denials, a section* of the Cabinet has repeatedly indicated its support for the nationalization of broadcasting. For instance, the Minister in charge of this bill, who has been in the forefront of the campaign to gain control of commercial stations, has stated publicly that he looked forward to the day when B class stations would be nationalized. It now seems that, by the introduction and the certain passage of this measure, his dream will come true. </para>
                    <para>This bill places in the hands of a board which, both honorable members and the public should bear in mind, will be subject always to the control of the Minister, the power to regiment one of the newest and one of the most successful media for influencing public opinion. It is yet another of the Australian Labour party's onslaughts upon the democratic institutions that we have cherished up to the present. Once this bill becomes law, freedom of the air will he gone. Programme policy will be under the control of the Minister, and, on the admission of the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron),</inline> "Programmes " includes " News ". From now on, news services, both national and commercial, and programme plans, will be subject to the board's approval. The board is empowered to direct broadcasting employees, without being obliged to notify the managements of its orders. Could there be a more shocking assault on the citadel of liberty? </para>
                    <para>This legislation marks the passing of the grand old ideal of freedom. In future listeners will hear only those things that come within the limits of the Minister's programme policy. More than a century ago, Thomas Jefferson said - </para>

                    <para class="block">Since then radio has become an important vehicle for the dissemination of news and it has helped to preserve the principles of our democracy. However, in future it is to be strait-jacketed, so that this newest and most powerful organ will be subject to ministerial direction through a board legally subject to the Minister's policy. Obviously, commercial stations are to be compelled to conform to the Government's pattern. This board will lay down plans which, in effect, will include the development of a programme policy. It is utterly foreign to the Australian way of life, and to our citizens generally, that the people should be made to conform to any pattern, yet the bill provides that the board shall ensure that adequate and comprehensive programmes are provided for within the definition of the Minister's ruling. Freedom of speech was never intended to be freedom to talk, one with another, with hushed voices. It included freedom fearlessly to express one's views to the largest possible audience. The radio method obviously provides that audience. We have enjoyed also freedom of choice in listening, but now the Government intends to deny us that freedom, and to limit the listening within the dimensions of its own policy. </para>
                    <para>There can be little disagreement with the necessity for the control of broadcasting to be vested in a board. In fact, several months ago, I favoured the setting up of a board, and I know that the radio stations have themselves asked for this before. In asking for a board, it was not contemplated that that body would perform functions other than those which would be largely advisory in character. One idea was that the board should be similar to the Tariff Board, that it would openly deal with applications for licences, hear evidence for and against, analyse such evidence, and make recommendations to the Minister. But what will this proposed broadcasting board be? It will be nothing but a star chamber committee. Under the bill it has no power to hear applications for licences. The Minister has carefully retained that power. It will not matter that there is no broadcasting service at Southport, Innisfail, and scores of other places. None of these communities that are starved for broadcasting services can make application to the board. Applicants for new licences receive the stock reply that there are no wave length, available. Apparently all our wave lengths are utilized in providing for 134 stations. The United States of America on the other hand, has 1,700 stations on the same wave-band. Yet the Minister retains power to issue or refuse licences. He is doing so to ensure that independent broadcasting does not grow to a point where he cannot bend it to his will. Underlying this seemingly innocuous bill is a grim determination to prevent any further growth of independence in the broadcasting field. Though it lacks power to issue licences, this board has authority to control wave lengths, technical equipment, operating power, and programmes. In other words, it has power over the usage of the licences, once they are granted, including those of national and commercial stations. It is a case of a committee working behind closed doors and making decisions within the ambit of the Minister's policy. I shall cite a case in point. There is a radio station at Gympie, Queensland, licensed with a power of 200 watts. It shares its wave length with a station at Geelong, but the Geelong station has a power of 500 watts. Naturally, the Geelong station compresses the area over which the Gympie station can give service, which is particularly difficult at any time because of the mineralized nature of the country around Gympie. Despite repeated applications, the Gympie station cannot secure from the authorities parity with Geelong. In what way would this board deal with such a station? If an application came from Gympie, would the board hear evidence openly from the Gympie people ? Would it grant to Geelong residents the opportunity of being heard? It would not. If I read this bill correctly, the Gympie application would be discussed behind closed doors, and it is open to doubt whether Geelong would know anything about it. Such matters should not be dealt with behind closed doors. There are now at least 900 applications for commercial licences, many from capable and reputable organizations which would be able to give good service to listeners, but none would secure a hearing from the board. </para>
                    <para>Then there is the question of frequency modulation. Opinion is divided about it. Many people contend that, if existing stations were given increased power and the frequencies were better arranged, listeners would get reproduction equal to that of frequency modulation. This would also cheapen receivers, and bring them more easily within the worker's reach. One Australian manufacturer has just produced an electric receiver to sell at about £.11 lis., but, unfortunately, it is mainly for use close to high-powered stations. If increased power were granted to existing stations, more receivers of this type would be made. It is doubtful if frequency modulation will be within the average worker's purchasing power for some time. One manufacturer has produced a frequency modulation converter to be fitted to an existing receiver at a cost of £30, and it could not be attached to the normal mantel type receiver, even at that price. An ordinary frequency modulation receiver would cost about £50, if any were available, according to evidence given to the Broadcasting Committee by the experts of the Postmaster-General's Department. Will the average citizen receive benefit if some of the money lie pays in taxation is devoted to the provision of a frequency modulation service which he cannot use because of the high cost of receivers? Is it fair <inline font-style="italic">i.o</inline> use taxes to provide a service that only the comparatively well-off can afford? The Postmaster-General recently stated that there were over 150 applications for frequency modulation licences. Frequency modulation must come to Australia, even if only because of its comparative freedom from static and man-made interference. But, why not let it come in the natural way. through the commercial stations? </para>
                    <para class="block">The commercial stations should be helped to that end to the greatest possible degree. If commercial stations are prepared to spend some of their profits in establishing this new service, it will be available to listeners who are sufficiently interested to pay £50 for a receiver, without cost to the taxpayer. The idea of confining the service to the national stations is entirely wrong. The introduction of frequency modulation should not be financed with taxpayers' money, especially while taxes are maintained at the present unreasonably high level. There is no common sense behind the proposal, which is a sinister and ill-conceived idea of controlling radio, and, through radio, of controlling the people. Frequency modulation should be developed on the basis of free, independent, competitive enterprise. </para>
                    <para>Then there is the question of who will administer the act. The schedule on the last page says, somewhat coyly, " omit definition of the Minister ". The original act and this amending bill contain repeated references to " the Minister ". The identity of the Minister has not been disclosed. If the Government has nothing to conceal, it would say quite openly that " the Minister " means the Minister for Information but, apparently, it is unwilling to state this publicly. Perhaps the Government has some other intention, but it does seem, from my reading of this bill, that the new board will control all broadcasting stations. . These obviously include Radio Australia, the Government short-wave station, which at present operates under the control of the Minister for Information. That station will, therefore, have to present to the listening world both sides of every controversial subject and of every political question, adequate divine services, and so on. I feel confident that the present Minister for Information will willingly place that station at the disposal of the Opposition leader, and, perhaps, myself, to enable us to state our views on the various subjects we deem controversial, including, particularly, foreign affairs. Also, if this anonymous Minister is to he the Minister for Information, he will presumably be able to allot to Liberal and Australian Country party members, without charge, the same time on the Labour party stations as. is given by them to the Labour speakers. The original act provides for limitation of ownership of broadcasting stations. The amendment proposed now reads : " A person shall not own ",. &amp;c., and it goes on, as in the original act, to limit ownership and so control four capital city stations and four States. That provision needs careful watching, and it should be clarified. It seems to make the whole clause ridiculous. What will1 happen if the licenceholder is a political party and an incorporated association which does not come within the legal definition of " person"? In any event, will the Labour party disclose its broadcasting position? It apparently owns 2KY Sydney, 3KZ Melbourne, 4KQ Brisbane, 6KY Perth, and has interests in 5KA Adelaide, 2HD Newcastle, and other stations. Just how close does this come to the original act? Does the alteration conceal an intention to secure more Labour broadcasting interests? Apart altogether from this point, the Labour party stations under this bill will be compelled to apportion their time so as to present both sides of any political question fairly. I ask the Minister if, following the passage of the bill, he will ensure an equitable allocation of time to both sides in every controversy. Incidentally, that would undoubtedly mean that time would be used by the Communists to present their side of each controversy over the Labour party stations. </para>
                    <para>The legislation has been drafted with the sole object of enabling the Government to place its power-greedy hands upon the whole broadcasting industry in an effort to spread its propaganda over the whole community. It is yet another attempt to dragoon a free people into the acceptance of a socialist government's control of all they are and have. This impudent invasion of yet another sphere of private enterprise should awaken even the most lethargic Australian to the menace of a continuance of Labour-socialist rule. The silence of the , commercial radio stations in the face of this serious attack upon their liberty will doubtless be advanced by the Government as justification of its action. To this, I retort that it is very evident that those interests have been  intimi-  dated. They realize that the ruthlessness of the. Government is such that organized opposition to the legislation would mean drastic retaliatory action by the Government in one form or another.. I conclude by issuing a warning. I do not for one moment pretend to be able to- foretell the future,, but, considering the Government's present frame of mind and many of its recent actions,. I believe that, within the next twelves months, Australian newspapers will find themselves also controlled by a board similar to. this one. What is more, it, too, will be a board subject to. ministerial direction. The Government will then be in a position to compel both radio and press, to function as media for its party and socialistic propaganda. </para>

                    <para class="block">That shows that the Postmaster-General in Great Britain is responsible for the control of the affairs of the British Broadcasting Corporation. The honorable member sought to make a comparison between the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He said, in effect, " Here is the British Broadcasting Corporation; it is an ideal organization, and a much more democratically controlled body than the Australian Broadcasting Commission ". Let me inform the honorable member that on the 29th November, 1946, an agreement was made between the Postmaster-General of Great Britain and the British Broadcasting Corporation, which was established by an act of the British Parliament, and as has been remarked by other honorable mem/hers, it was. sponsored, not by a Labour government, but by a Conservative government. That agreement contained the following provision: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The Postmaster-General may, from time to time, by notice in writing to the Corporation, require the Corporation to refrain from sending any broadcast matter, either particular or general, specified in such notice. . . . Any such notice may specify whether or not theCorporation may, at its discretion, announce that the notice has : been given. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The Postmaster-General could, at any  time,  instruct the corporation what "it was to broadcast and what it was not to broadcast. Such a power does not exist in the Australian legislation. In 1941, an attempt was made to insert such a provision in the Australian Broadcasting Act by the Menzies Government. Honorable members will recall the words I quoted from the agreement between the British Broadcasting Corporation and the British Postmaster-General. In 1941, the then Postmaster-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay,</inline> introduced an amending bill into the Senate. Clause 17 of that bill contained the following provision: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para> The Governor-General may, if he is satisfied that it is necessary in the .public interest so to do, by notice in writing, direct the Commission to refrain from taking any action in the exercise of any of its powers conferred by this Act. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That provision is merely a paraphrase of the provision in the British legislation. The Menzies Government tried to defeat the intention of the Australian Broadcasting Act at that time by weakening it in that way. When the bill was presented to this House members of the Australian Labour party opposed it vigorously and as a result the Gibson. Committee was established. The Gibson Committee reported that that provision was wrong in principle. The committee'sreport was signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson,</inline> as <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Sir Charles</inline> Marr, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Grenfell</inline> Price, the present Minister for the Navy- <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan), Senator Amour</inline> and myself. If any group of persons rescued broadcasting from the efforts of the Menzies Government to destroy the power of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, it was the members of the Gibson Committee. Those members of the Eighteenth Parliament who in 1941 set out to destroy the power of the commission were the right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McBride),</inline> the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> and the right honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> who in concluding his speech a few minutes ago said that once this bill becomes law freedom of the air will be gone. The Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> was also a Minister in 1941 who sought to destroy the power of the commission. May I say parenthetically that at a certain time in the pre-World War II. history of this country when the Acting Leader of the Opposition was a Minister, he telephoned the  chairman  of the. Australian Broadcasting Commission and informed him that the government of the day objected to the criticism of " the Watchman ", whose real name was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> A. Mann, a former honorable member for Perth. The honorable gentleman told the  chairman  that the Government wished the commission to stop " the Watchman " criticizing the anti-Labour government of the day.  That telephone message is now history. The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> was another member of the Menzies Government who wanted to commit the dastardly act of crippling the commission. Last on the list is the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony),</inline> who skated so nicely over thin ice when he talked about the McLeay bill. The honorable gentleman said that something had happened, but that the Gibson Committee had set everything right. He even wanted to take credit for what the Gibson Committee did, but it is well known that the Gibson Committee recommended to this Parliament a course of action which would prevent the doing of a wrong such as had been attempted by a government of which the honorable gentleman was himself a member. The Gibson Committee's report was presented to the Parliament in the days of the Curtin Government, because, fortunately for Australia and for posterity, the non-Labour government of the period was relegated to obscurity and the Curtin Government was given the task of implementing the Gibson Committee's recommendations. The recommendations of the committee were implemented in their entirety. A bill founded on the committee's report was subsequently unanimously accepted by the Parliament. Every clause of that measure was passed by the committee of the House without alteration. All the nonsense that has been voiced, all the stupidities that have been uttered in recent days about the dreadful things that this bill will do, will not convince anybody. I am satisfied that every honorable member opposite who has so far participated in this debate has spoken with his tongue in his cheek. This Government proposes to rationalize and not to nationalize broadcasting. That rationalization process should have been commenced in 1932 when the right honorable member for Cowper first .drew attention to the need for improving the control of broadcasting. Because past governments neglected their work in this field, as they neglected it in so many others, a long time has elapsed before we have had an opportunity to do the very things that, not only some lion or able members opposite said needed doing, but also that the commercial broadcasting stations said in 1937 they wanted done. In 1937 the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations wrote to the then Prime Minister, stating that at a convention which had just concluded at Southport in Queensland, the federation had resolved that it desired some authority to be established " to regulate all commercial broadcasting in Australia". The federation suggested that a board consisting of three members should be appointed for that purpose. Provision for such a .board is made in this bill. The federation further suggested that the members of the board bc appointed for a definite period and that the board should not report to the Postmaster-General. The federation, however, recognized that some court of appeal should be established and accordingly it suggested that a select committee of the Parliament be established to deal with all matters about which some difference of opinion existed between the federation and the board. The government of the day, which was the Lyons Government, did not establish such a board. In his policy speech delivered at Deloraine, in Tasmania, on the 28th September, 1937, the then Leader of the United Australia party, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> A.

Ministerial control is absolutely essential. In 1937 the members of the present Liberal party were definitely committed to the establishment of a board, with the emphasis that the Board should be under the control of the Postmaster-General. The Acting Leader of the Opposition said that this board will have to comply with government policy- </para>

                    <para>The honorable gentleman's statement that the board will have to comply with government policy was only partly true. The functions of the board are clearly set out in the bill, from which it will be seen that the board will beauthorized to exercise many wide powers without reference to the Minister at all. We are taking away some of the powerswhich the Minister has at present and giving them to the board to exercise without any reference to him. The board will be required to ensure that adequate and comprehensive programmes are provided by national and commercial stations toserve the best interests of the public,, and that the technical equipment andoperation of such stations are in accordance with modern engineering practice. It will also be required to prepare comprehensive plans for the provision of broadcasting stations, television stations and facsimile stations, and to see that plans approved by the Government are implemented. The board will have tocomply with government policy in regard to the provision of those services, but that is different from saying that the Minister himself will make a decision in regard to all of those matters. TheMinister will have an obligation placed upon him to see that the board does its duty to the public in the directions that I have mentioned. That is in accord' with the attitude of successive governments since the inception of broadcasting:  in this country. The hoard will, however, be subject to the control of Parliament because, under proposed new section  6l (3),  it will be required to lay any orders that it makes on the table in both Houses of the Parliament. </para>
                    <para>In one of his more rational moments, the honorable gentleman said that the powers of the board will enable the Government to bring censorship into every home. The powers of the board in respect of censorship of programmes will be the same as that which was. conferred upon the Minister by legislation enacted, in the first instance, by governments which were supported by honorable gentlemen opposite. There is, however, this difference. The Minister previously had absolute powers in this regard, but now any orders of the board will have to be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament. Whatever the Minister did in the past need never have come to the notice of the Parliament, but anything that is done in the future will be made the subject of orders. Honorable members will have a greater control of broadcasting through this legislation than they had previously. </para>

                        the present time both sides have an untrammelled right to present their views over the commercial radio. That may be right in theory, but in practice many stations have not made appropriate arrangements to ensure equitable facilities for the presentation of different points of view. The bill imposes an obligation on the board to ensure that facilities are provided on an equitable basis for the broadcasting of political or controversial matter. That does not mean that a commercial station will be forced to give so much time to the Labour party and so much to the Liberal party and the Australian Country party. It means that if it has time to sell for political broadcasting it is bound to make equitable arrangements for the use of that time by those who want to buy it. If some people cannot buy it, or do not want to do so, it will "be free to do what it desires with it. All that we are providing for is an equitable basis for the broadcasting of political or controversial matter. Is there anything wrong with that? Will any honorable member opposite say that that is an unfair provision?

If commerical broadcasting and the smaller stations are strangled, it will he because of the operation of large vested interests. In theory, a commercial station licence is owned by the person to whom it is issued, but, in practice, the licence is the property of the biggest advertisers. They select the station on which they want to advertise, and, unless the owner of the station is prepared to sell blocks of time and to agree to the conditions imposed by people who have thousands of pounds to spend annually on broadcasting, he gets no opportunity to sell his time, and the offer goes somewhere else. The result is that, over the years, some stations have grown into bigger and bigger organizations, while other stations are struggling for an existence. </para>

                            <para>- I have not the slightest doubt of that. Just as advertisers can boycott newspapers that they do not like, so they can boycott radio stations that displease' them. We are going to break that stranglehold, hut it will not be broken in the way that the honorable gentleman suggests, that is, by a plan of nationalization. Briefly stated, our desire is to create order out of chaos and to see that these channels, which are the people's property, are utilized in a way that suits the public interest. Honorable members opposite seem to think that the possession of a commercial station licence gives the owner of that licence almost  a  freehold title to some property, but neither the holder of the licence, nor anybody else, were ever granted a commercial licence of more than twelve months tenure. The licences are all renewable annually. Every government has followed that practice, because it is recognized that events are moving rapidly in regard to audio-broadcasting, television and all the other new inventions that are coming on the market. One would imagine, from the speeches of honorable gentlemen opposite, that if a man owns a commercial radio station licence entitling him to broadcast on the medium wave band by the amplitudinal modulation system, he has some kind of prescriptive right to a frequency modulation licence or some prior claim to the issue of a licence to telecast, as the Americans say. No man or company owning a commercial broadcasting licence to-day has any better claim to a licence for facsimile broadcasting, television or frequency modulation broadcasting than any of the unsatisfied applicants for commercial station licences. Approximately 1,000 people who want these licences have filed applications for them over the years with the Postmaster-General's Department, but they cannot get them. The Postmaster-General has already received 150 applications for frequency modulation licences. "When television comes to this country, as it will in a very short space of time, there will be many applications for the right to televise into the homes of the Australian people. In America at present 40 television stations are in operation, 500,000 licences have been issued and 35,000 people are employed in television activities. In the course of some light reading over the week-end I scanned the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Harper's Magazine</inline> of September last. ' In an article dealing with the future of television some rather extraordinary statements are made. The writer of the article is Bernard B.

Moreover, newspapers and magazines will find advertisers decreasing their space commitments, or in some cases deserting these media altogether in favor of. the new and more effective advertising medium that television can offer them. Even a few book publishers are beginning to express very definite fears for the future, as yesterdaysbook purchasers spend their evenings with eyesglued to the television screen instead of to the pages of the latest novel. . . . </para>

                    <para class="block">That is less than £1,500 Australian. If that is the prospect in regard to television in America, a similar prospect will open up in this country a year or two later. All the radio sets of to-day will probably be scrapped by that time and will be put into the garage or the storeroom. Very few people will listen when they can watch a screen in their own homes and get the picture aswell as the story. It may be that when that time arrives this bill will be found to be quite out of date. "We have decided that it is in the public interest to control television in this country through the national stations. We are not going to allow the same conditions to grow up under television as have grown up under the present system of broadcasting. That system grew up without any plan and without any order. If the Bruce-Page Government had taken the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Brown, who was the Director of Posts and Telegraphs at that time, therewould never have been any commercial stations at all in Australia, and we should have had an organization like the British Broadcasting Corporation. The Prime Minister told that story this afternoon. We live in a rapidly changing world in respect of all forms of broadcasting, but we are trying to control .the system of broadcasting that we know, because it operates in the public domain and the profit-making interests of those who own stations are not even secondary to the public interest. The public interests have been entirely neglected. </para>

                        <para>The Australian Broadcasting Commission would like to see a move made towards placing national broadcasting in Australia on a footing similar to that in Canada. The Commission considers that in a country where there is a double system, as in Australia, there should be some means by which it can be co-ordinated, and has pointed out that in the United States of America the Federal Communications Commission looks over the whole broadcasting field and indicates what in its view any broadcasting authority, as a public utility, should be required to do. In Canada, where there is a dual system which, with some modification, is like Australia's, the commercial stations are compelled to adopt certain standards and to do a certain amount of public interest broadcasting. </para>
                        <para>Apart from criticism of the general level of programme standards in the commercial service it is undeniable that there is much economic waste in the multiplication of the same types of sessions by various stations serving the same listeners. For example, as one witness has pointed out, there are no fewer than five stations in one of the capital cities which devote practically the whole of Saturday afternoon to the broadcasting of the same sporting events, involving multiple costs of broadcasting personnel, land-line facilities and other equipment for relays to other groups of stations, which might, in other circumstances, lie diverted to productive purposes clamouring for much more deserving priority in moderate essential needs, without depriving listeners of non-duplicated sport broadcasts. </para>

I do not need to withdraw any recommendations which I have signed in those two documents. As the Prime Minister has explained, the collection and distribution of moneys by the Australasian. Performing Right Association on behalf of overseas and Australian authors and composers is most complicated. The honorable member for Richmond knows the story, because we have furnished him with statements from time to time in connexion with the adoption of the British Copyright Act and other matters. I have two things to say to the honorable member on the subject. The first is that he should accept the invitation of the controllers of the Australasian Performing Right Association to inspect their books and search all their documents. They have offered him that facility, but I "understand that he has not accepted it. </para>

I am entitled to answer his criticism by suggesting that he should accept the invitation of the Australasian Performing Right Association because he will then be in a better position to judge whether his statements are true or otherwise. The second thing which I desire to say to the honorable member is that the drafting of a separate Australian copyright bill will be a task of some magnitude. The Government has not yet had time to undertake it. General amendments of some magnitude -of the copyright law may be required as the result of a recent worldwide conference on copyright held at Brussels, and of a further conference which will be held under the sponsorship of the "United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The honorable member has been good enough to supply me "with the copy of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> from which he has quoted, showing what is seemingly a meagre distribution of moneys by some Australian publishing houses to some Australian authors and composers. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.^</inline> £ thank the House for its courtesy, and shall not trespass for long on its time. The position is better now than it was in 1939. I am certain of that, because of the investigations which I made as a member of the Broadcasting Committee of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> was  chairman,  and of further investigations which I undertook when I was  chairman  of the Broadcasting Committee. There is. on the face of it, a case for the Australasian Performing Right Association to answer, but there is the additional fact that the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations have made continuing agreements with the Australasian Performing Right Association. If they were dissatisfied with the arrangement, they could have made a joint plea to the Government and asked for the introduction of copyright legislation. It is true that a deputation, which was not authorized by the Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations and the Australian Broadcasting 'Commission, came to Canberra to discuss the matter. The members of the deputation -were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Moses, the general manager of the Australian Broadcasting 'Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ridley,</inline> the  chairman  of the Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations, and, by some queer mischance, a gentleman who operates the two stations owned by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang).</inline> However, the Federation of Commercial Broadcasting ' Stations, at its next meeting, disowned its representatives, and, therefore, it cannot be argued that the federation is feeling so outraged about the matter as is the member for Richmond. </para>

                            <para>- The report of Hie Gibson Committee, -which I signed, recommended that one fee should be paid to the Australasian Performing Right Association jointly by the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the commercial stations. We cannot make an agreement, in respect of the use of matters over which the Australasian Performing Right Association claims some ownership, for the national stations only. We have to cover all the broadcasting stations. T(he honorable member may be concerned with the position of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, but that is only one facet of the case. There are two facets, and the Government is examining both of them. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann)</inline> has criticized the bill. I suggest that it is rather indelicate of him to participate in this debate, because he is personally interested in the ownership of a station at Kingaroy, in Queensland. No honorable member who has a personal financial interest in any matter before the Parliament should criticize the Government's proposals in relation to it because, in so doing, he is liable to be misunderstood. People will think that he is putting self-interest before the national interest- </para>

                            <para>- I have criticized the honorable member for Maranoa mildly. The action of the honorable member for Reid, who personally owns two broadcasting stations, in participating in this debate is like the behaviour of certain other gentlemen in another sphere who, in recent times, in spite of protests by the Crown, participated in the discussion and settlement of another matter when they or their families were personally interested. I shall leave any conclusions or deductions on that subject to the imagination of honorable members. </para>

                    <para>I believe that the Australasian Performing Right Association renders a good service to all those who have composed the songs which are sung, or written the stories which are broadcast, or who have done other creative work for which, under our law, they are entitled to claim payment if they possess the copyright. I cite the classic example of McCormack, the schoolteacher in New South Wales who composed "Advance AustraliaFair". He received very little money in royalties during his lifetime, and bequeathed to his widow all his possessions, including the copyright of the song. She received very little money for her interest in it either, but a residuary beneficiary was the Presbyterian Church in New South Wales. Since this Government has made " Advance Australia Fair " the theme song for the news service on the national broadcasting system, and I have persuaded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norman</inline> B. Rydge to have " Advance Australia Fair " played in all motion picture theatres controlled by Greater Union Theatres, the royalties payable to the Presbyterian Church have been considerable. The church is still receiving payments, and will continue to receive them during the lifetime of the copyright, which is now drawing to a close. The period of the copyright subsists for 50 years. If that church had not been made a beneficiary by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCormack's</inline> will, and there was no organization such as the Australasian Performing Bight Association to protect its rights, the use of " Advance Australia Fair " would have been possible without any cost to the commercial or national broadcasting stations. If the performing right fees were not paid to the beneficiaries, their representatives or assigns, the commercial broadcasting stations would have added more money to their profits. The costs of the Australian Broadcasting Commission would certainly have been less, but the swollen profits of the commercial stations would equally certainly have been greater. The turnover of the commercial stations during the past year was about £3,000,000, the net profit being about £400,000. I have thought of lodging a claim with the Presbyterian Church.I have certainly added to its financial strength, and I think it might at least reward me one of these days my making me one of is patron saints. </para>

This annual meeting of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia therefore requests that the Government give all licensed broadcasting stations equal rights and opportunities to use any or all the latest developments in radio transmission which may give better service to the listening public.". - -WITHALL, Director Associated Chambers of Manufactures, Sydney. </para>

                    <para class="block">As I have said, it is evident that the Government intends to exclude the commercial stations from participating in such developments as frequency modulation, facsimile broadcasting and television. Its purpose is to strangle the -commercial stations slowly by monopolizing for the national stations all modern developments. That proposal alone would have warranted the Opposition in dividing the House on the motion for the second reading of the bill, if there were no other reasons for doing se. The technique -of the Government in this respect i9 exactly the same as was its preliminary approach to the banking legislation. Before bringing in its principal legislation to nationalize the banks, it took certain preliminary steps to pave the way for ultimate nationalization. The Government knows that if it is able to render obsolescent the equipment of the commercial broadcasting stations, it can avoid paying just compensation to them when it finally nationalizes all forms «of broadcasting. If the commercial stations can be gradually forced out of business because they have become obsolescent the Government will achieve its purpose without having to pay out one penny in compensation. This is a step towards nationalization. The Govern., ment proposes to prevent the commercial stations from participating in advanced scientific technique in broadcasting. I oppose the clause. It is proposed to insert after the definition of " Commissioner the following definition : - "Departmental Commissioner" means a " Commissioner who is an officer of the Department of the Treasury or of the Postmaster-General's Department. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is proposed to include a representative of the Treasury and a representative of the Postmaster-General'3 Department on the commission. I shall have something to say on that aspect when consideration is being given to that clause, but I cannot let this definition pass without making some comment. I believe that the commission's duty is to develop national broadcasting so as to give to the people an acceptable national network. For example, the commission  arranges  for celebrity concerts. It brings to Australia world celebrities to give performances to the people of this country. Time and time again that procedure hae been financed out of the money made available from the broadcast listeners' fees. A subvention is now to be made from Consolidated Revenue. It will be said by the Minister, I suppose with a certain amount of effect, "If there is to be a contribution, from Consolidated Revenue the Government musthave its officers there to protect its interests ". I object to the principle, because I can see that when the commission lays down a plan for bringing into Australia accepted overseas celebrity artists, the Treasury official may say to the Treasurer, if not to the commission, " There is going to be an expenditure of tens of thousands of pounds for celebrity artists ". Because the funds are to come out of Consolidated Revenue, and because, as we know, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> is not given to lavish expenditure, the right honorable gentleman may say, "Let me have a look at that one ". I venture to say that with the introduction of public servants on to a commission whose job is to attend to the entertainment of the people, the result may be the complete emasculation of the programmes that the people will he provided with. I look with regret at this departure, because I believe that the function of the commission 13 to present entertainment to the people. When public servants are placed upon the commission there will be one or two factors to consider. There will be the overriding hand of the Treasurer on expenditure which may have to be incurred, and, secondly, reports will be presented by the public servants to the Minister. It will be easy for any departture contemplated in educational matters or in entertainment proposals, to be vetoed by the Treasurer by reason of his unwillingness to make finance available, or by the Minister because he, forsooth, will have an overriding power in regard to these matters. The reason why the commission was made a body independent of political control was because it was believed that it should have the right to set up its own entertainment, to bring out its own artists, and to present to the people programmes that would be acceptable to them. When we find that a Minister or a public servant, who may have no knowledge of the entertainment value of artists or of good programmes, is likely to veto programmes of this nature, I can only view with abhorrence the result that will flow from such an arrangement. I believe that the insertion of the word " aural " in the definition of " broadcasting station " will destroy for all time the commercial stations. This amendment will effectively prevent the commercial stations from taking advantage of the current trends of technical development in broadcasting. By placing public servants upon the commission, who will act as watchdogs for the Government, we destroy the true purpose of the commission, which is to give entertainment to the people. </para>

                        <para>. - The Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> has raised two points, one concerning the board and its activities, and the other concerning the Australian Broadcasting Commission. There is nothing new in governments placing public servants on governmental authorities. Public servants have been appointed, for example, to the National Airlines Commission, and also to directorates of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. As a matter of fact, the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is a government representative on that organization. He is there by some extraordinary process, which makes him irremovable. Attempts that were made by a former Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> to remove the right honorable gentleman ended up, under some article of the agreement, by the appointment of an arbitrator, who promptly decided that the right honorable member for North Sydney should remain where he was. Although the right honorable gentleman is supposed to represent the Parliament, the government of the day could not remove him, and there he stays, and will stay, even if he does not become the right honorable member for Bradfield. I think, however, that he is a better bet for that seat than somebody else that  I  know. We have representatives on the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, and they have done good service there. There have been complaints about wastefulness by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and there have been statements by members of the Broadcasting Committee from time to time that the finances of the Australian Broadcasting Commission ought to be investigated. The Gibson Committee said so; the Calwell Committee said so; and the Amour Committee has repeatedly referred to this matter. Who could better look after the finances of the country than Treasury officials, particularly under the present Treasurer, who has such a fine record to his credit. We shall put a representative of the Postmaster-General's Department on the Australian Broadcasting Commission to see that the technical services are safeguarded. If those public servants have to make decisions in regard to celebrity artists, I presume they will be just as competent to do so as are any other members of the commission, all of whom have come from different walks of life, and had no knowledge of celebrity artists or arranging entertainment programmes prior to becoming members of the commission. That remark relates to the members of the first commission which was appointed when the Menzies Government was in office. They were estimable people. Some were not reappointed by this Government, which appointed other people who were just as well, or just as ill, qualified as any of their predecessors, or any honorable member of this House, to determine the value of celebrity artists. The truth is that artists are selected, in practice, on the recommendation of the experts of the commission, who pay full regard to the financial implications. The ability of the artists themselves is probably not made the subject of any serious debate. The recommendations submitted to the commission are carefully studied in the same way as" Cabinet generally studied recommendations of the permanent heads of departments. In accord with the general line of policy this is laid down. </para>

                <para>Although the manufacturers of radio equipment have made a complaint, 1 point out that we will always  get these complaints-. In the days of the industrial revolution in England, there were the Luddites, who objected to the machinery introduced into spinning mills. They saw their jobs going and tried to wreck the machines in some instances. This is what I learned when I was at school, and I suppose that the story is still right. There have been people ever since who have never wanted mankind to enjoy the benefits of the work of the creative geniuses of the race. When people get a vested interest they fight very hard against any change. Every radio manufacturer in Australia will fight to retain the present system of aural broadcasting. If a manufacturer were asked if he wanted to see facsimile presentation or television introduced, he would say that he does not, because its introduction would mean that he would have to change the whole of his plant, get a new set of machinery, and scrap the old. New improvements will come along. It is easy for the Associated Chambers of Manufactures to say, " Give to the present owners of commercial licences the right to add all the new systems that are brought out, give them licences in the new fields, because they are already established". As I have said before, the 102 holders of commercial station licences have no better rights than the other 1,000 people who want licences, but so far cannot get them, to be given these additional facilities. If the Government decided to let commercial stations or private enterprise have the use of these new inventions, perhaps the fairest thing would be to say to the owners of the present commercial station licences, " You have had your day. You have made a lot of money. It is time to let somebody else have a chance ". The manufacturers seem to think that it is a good thing to maintain the present little circle that has benefited so greatly. These commercial stations will still operate, 'probably for some years to come, and people will still build radio sets. It may be that television attachments will be made so simple and will cost so little, that they will be attachable to the present sets. The manufacturers have probably no case at all on which to base a complaint abou the provision in this clause.</para>

With all due respect to the representative of the Treasury, I do not know why he should be appointed.

The <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Mr. Boyer,</inline> had a distinguished university education. He is well read and has great musical knowledge. The qualifications of the other commissioners are similar. What the representative of the Postmaster-General's Department will have to do on the commission, heaven only knows! If anything goes wrong with the technical equipment it will be a job for the technical officers of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, because we were told by the Minister for Information in his second-reading speech, that it is essential to take out of the hands of the Postmaster-General's Department the technical operation of the national broadcasting service and to place it in the hands of the staff of the technical branch of the board. So, goodness only knows why we are to have a technical officer from the Postmaster-General's Department on the commission, which will be mainly engaged in laying down programme policy. Why the Treasury is to be represented on the commission also passes my understanding. Can the commission not be trusted to get the best possible programme value for the people? I suspect that the function of the Treasury representative will be to cut down expense in connexion with the importation and employment of artists and that the result will he second- rate and third-rate programmes when the commission would rather achieve its ambition of presenting the best programmes. It is extraordinary to say that the Parliament should vote money to the commission and then declare  it  to be so untrustworthy that a Treasury officer must be always present to watch expenditure and ensure that the commission shall not spend two-pence or threepence more on artists than is necessary. That is a pinch-penny policy that must perpetuate the poor programmes that the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fraser)</inline> complained so bitterly about. Artistic people are wanted to conduct the affairs of the national broadcasting service, not economists, tabulators of figures, tax-gatherers and publicans. Let us have artistic people.  Otherwise  the programmes will be detrimentally affected and we shall have a continuance of the state of affairs so vigorously condemned by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro. </para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>BEAZLEY  (Fremantle) [9.49 J.The clause confines to the Australian Broadcasting Commission television, facsimile and certain other technical developments. The Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> expressed concern at the dead hand of a Treasury official being placed on new developments in radio. I wish to balance his argument by saying that he ought to express concern at the dead hand of a sponsor on television programmes conducted by commercial broadcasters. The first thing to be said about television is that it involves an enormous capital outlay. Only the Government, or the largest financial interests, or conglomeration of such interests, in Australia could afford the immense amounts of money that must necessarily be invested in this new development. That means that if it were operated by commercial radio stations, advertising rates would be enormously expensive. In the United States of America at present very heavy advertising fees are charged to manufacturers and others who wish to sponsor their products on televised programmes. The effect which was brought out very clearly in a recent <inline font-style="italic">March of Time</inline> film on American broadcasting, is harmful. It is so expensive to  advertise over commercial television stations that the advertiser concentrates his advertising as closely as possible in the time available to him, and a new form of " soap opera " is interspersed with advertisements, the standards of some of which are causing great concern to the American people. Either the Australian Broadcasting Commission must control the type of entertainment that is to be put over on television, or our homes will be made a new medium for a new kind of " soap opera " sponsored by the makers of " Lifebuoy ", or some such people. The fact cannot be escaped that if television is to he a new commercial venture, the heavy outlay must mean that the stations will recoup themselves by heavy charges to  advertisers.  That means a concentration of sponsors' advertisements within the time available. The contrast between the programmes of the Alexandra Palace, which is the British television experimental station, and those of the private enterprise television stations in the United States of America is instructive. I has caused considerable dissatisfaction in the United States of America. We have thrust upon us in the arguments of the Opposition such absurdities as that the representative of the Treasury on the Australian Broadcasting Commission will supervise the spending of twopence here and threepence there. The Acting Leader of the Opposition was constrained to admit that the commission has brought to Australia all the world's celebrities that matter and are available. The same group of people as has brought them here will be responsible for the standard of television entertainment. Educational films without advertising will be broadcast by an institution without any axe to grind. It is absurd to contend that the Government controls the programmes broadcast by an independent commission. It would be just as ridiculous to suggest that the Minister for Information would write to officers of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and tell them what they should put in their daily programmes. There may be ministerial intervention to a certain point, but it would be rare. We must choose between the overriding hand of sponsors of advertisements in the commercial radio field and the overriding hand of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which  employs  many hundreds of the most cultured people in Australia. The commission will become the purchaser of films, the importers of ballet celebrities and, as at present, of celebrity artists of the vocal type. The commission will have behind it grants from the Treasury. The Treasury must be represented on the commission in order to check the expenditure of the grants. We are much more likely to receive good standard programmes from the Australian Broadcasting Commission than from commercial interests. We have had enough of advertisements being pushed into our hemes. The English people are fortunately immune from that fate. Under the arrangements that we are making to-day, we shall be free of having advertisements televised into our homes under the sponsorship of some manufacturer or other. Honorable members opposite are supposed to be concerned with political interference with commercial stations. I know one man who is forbidden use of the air to make political broadcasts because advertisers would not continue to advertise if he were allowed to continue. It is useless to talk about the freedom of commercial broadcasting because it does not exist. The Australian Broadcasting Commission which is independent of the Government and has a wide autonomy will choose the best films and ballet dancers and the like for its television programmes. The programmes will be of the type that the Alexandra Palace in England presents. The commission will be well advised. Its managers in the various States have a large measure of independency to decide their own programmes in the broadcasting of sound and will have it in the broadcasting of television. I come back to my original point. These new developments are enormously expensive. They must be financed by the Government or by powerful vested interests. Honorable gentlemen opposite said that if they were financed by the Government there was danger of interference with freedom. 1 say that they are financed by vested interests, the financiers must recoup their capital by charging high advertising  races, and the effect will be that advertisers will get the utmost advertising out of the time they buy. That will lead to debasement of television. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ARCHIE</inline>CAMERON (Barker)  [9. 59  J. - This clause, in dealing with definitions, raises two or three important questions that this committee ought to consider. On this side, there are two honorable members, the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> and myself, who have occupied the position of Postmaster-General and who have administered the broadcasting law. We two must have made certain investigations and must have certain ideas about the principles to be applied. I think the most important question that we have had to resolve is the alleged one of the nationalization of the air. Let me point out to the committee that the ownership of every wave length is rested in the Commonwealth of Australia at this time. I trust that I shall never <inline font-style="italic">see</inline> the day when it will be otherwise, [t is so by international agreement. All that happens when a broadcasting licence is granted to a broadcasting company or an individual is that the company or individual is given an exclusive right to use for a specified period a certain wave length, and no other, subject to the right of the Postmaster-General to change the wave length from time to time if he considers it desirable in the interests of the proper functioning of broadcasting. Furthermore, under the law passed by this Parliament in  1942 -  and there are some parts of that law with which I do not agree, even though it was passed by the Senate in which the parties 11OW represented on this side of the chamber were then in a majority - any broadcasting licence may be revoked at will by the Postmaster-General. Section  49 <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> (1)  of the principal act reads - </para><quote><para>The Minister may, by notice in writing, . . . revoke and determine any licence for a commercial broadcasting station  in  the ground that - </para><list type="decimal"><item label="(6)"><para>he considers it advisable in the public interest to do so. </para></item></list></quote><para class="block">No more conclusive or comprehensive power could be granted to any Minister than is conferred by that section. It is important to note that this bill does not propose to amend that section. So, we must consider this threat of nationalization from the standpoint of what the Government proposes to do in regard to the holding of a licence by a commercial broadcaster. Many broadcasting licences, are held by the Australian Labour partyitself. My personal view about the holding of such licences by the Australian. Labour party is that it constitutes the greatest safeguard that the other licensees possess. Let us consider the position of station  2KY.  At my request a former Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> supplied me with certain information relating to the operations of that station. Amongst other things that information showed that the station pays no income tax to the Commonwealth whatsoever. As a money spinner for the Australian Labour party the station is unexcelled. I have a strong feeling that in giving effect to his policy of socialization the Prime Minister will stop short of nationalizing station  2KY  and other broadcasting stations in which the Parliamentary Labour party is interested for the simple reason that the profit motive will influence his consideration of their future. Socialists are never blind to the advantages of profits when those profits come close home to them. Television and facsimile broadcasting are similarly the property of the Commonwealth. When the Government is changed - I hope it will be changed very soon - it will be a matter of policy for the incoming government, formed by the honorable members on this side of the chamber, to decide what it will do about the leasing of facsimile broadcasting and television rights. I have a strong suspicion that when that time comes there will be no drastic alteration of the provisions of the bill now before us, for, as the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> said a few minutes ago, the initial cost of installing apparatus for facsimile broadcasting and television will be so great that only the Commonwealth or some very wealthy organization prepared to run great risks will be willing to enter those fields of radio broadcasting. </para><para>Reference has been made to the members of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I may have ideas somewhat different from those held by other honorable members about the future of  broadcasting during my time. In an appendix to the famous Gibson report are to be found column after column of extracts from bills prepared under my direction. So that there shall be no doubt about it let me say at once that they were prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> G. Alderman, K.C., of Adelaide, and free of charge, too. At the time I relinquished office <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alderman</inline> was engaged in the preparation of yet another bill to deal specially with commercial broadcasting, because I believed at that time that the commercial broadcasting stations should be dealt with by a separate enactment. I have changed that view. I believe now that both commercial and national stations can be dealt with in a single act. One of the changes I then advocated in the constitution of the Australian Broadcasting Commission was that the general manager should be styled the director-general and that he should be made as responsible to the Postmaster-General as he is to the commission. My experience of the Australian Broadcasting Commission was not a happy one. I thought it was an inefficient body; that its direction was hopelessly incompetent and that it was extravagant. I believe that on too many occasions the commission was prepared to spend a " tenner " in order to save half a crown. I have reason to believe that its methods have not changed greatly since then. I know of the effect of what has been called " the numbing hand of the Treasurer " on government departments. In spite of the fact that on occasions I had had quarrels with the Treasury, I think that some benefit may accrue to the Australian taxpayers and the broadcasting services of Australia from the inclusion in the membership of the commission of a Treasury representative. From my experience as Postmaster-General I am well aware that representation of the Post Office view in the deliberations of the commission is badly needed. One of the matters with which I had to deal was a demand by the commission that it be cut adrift from the Postmaster-General's Department and that it be given the right to establish mechanical and research sections, and the Lord knows what, which would have cost the country millions of pounds. One of the great ambitions of certain members of the commission in my time was that the commission should be completely freed from political control. I do not believe that any board or commission established by a government should be free from political control. Under the democratic system of government every officer of the Public Service and every board or commission established under the laws of the Commonwealth must be responsible to members of this Parliament. That is a simple basic principle, in democratic government as it is generally understood in all British communities. I am not prepared to depart from that principle. The appointment to the commission of representatives of the Treasury and of the Postmaster-General's Department is not likely to do any harm. Speaking from my own experience, for what it is worth, it L? possible that these representatives will do a lot of good. </para><para>Something has been said during thin debate about programmes and the importation of overseas artists. To those honorable members who were not here when 1 was Postmaster-General, I readily admit that I occupied that office for only a little more than five months.

On the subject of the importation of overseas artists, my own view, and it may be without full justification, was that in my day the commission placed a very high value on the services of some people as well as on its own service.

The point I wish to make is that there is a wider principle at stake than the interests of the commercial stations. We should build an edifice which will enable the individual citizen to get the freest and best possible broadcasting service. I hold no brief for the commercial stations, nor have I any particular respect for them. I do not like their news services and I rarely listen to them. That, however, is purely a matter of taste. When 1 do listen to radio programmes, which is not often, I listen mostly to the national stations. The commercial stations have been getting along fairly comfortably. I regard the letter from the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations to the Prime Minister, which I read in full recently, as a somewhat " wishy-washy " sort of letter because the members of the federation did not have the intestinal fortitude to stand  up  to the right honorable gentleman who, they feared, might he their executioner. I should like to think that there were a few John Hampdens among their members, but unfortunately that is not so. Having said that, however, I still say that I think this country will be better served  if it has something more than a government instrumentality to broadcast news and information to the people.

The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> admits that, technically, it is more advanced in America than in England, but although the British television station is supposed to have a range of only 50 miles, I saw television sets working well on the borders of "Wiltshire, over 100 miles from London.

The reason why television is more technically advanced in the United States of America than anywhere else is that in that country all the genius of private enterprise has been devoted to improving it. There is' no doubt whatever that in the United States of America it is private enterprise that has done so much for television. I will go part of the way with the honorable member for Fremantle and say that I imagine that I should prefer television as transmitted from an English station to television as transmitted from an American station. Having been brought up in the way in which I was, I should prefer the English presentation to the more blatant one that I might see in the United States of America. On the other hand, if I took the trouble to turn a knob and to switch from one American television station to another I should probably find an absolutely first-class programme. It is a matter of taste. If we limit television entirely to our national stations, we are liable to lag in development.

Of course that is not so. "What would it matter if a large capitalistic enterprise developed television in Australia? All the check? and balances that are required are contained in this measure. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board will be able to co-ordinate the activities of private enterprise and prevent any undesirable practices. That is the answer to the honorable member for Fremantle. There is no exploitation that cannot be dealt with by the powers that will be vested in the Government by this bill, when it is passed. If private enterprise is permitted to share in the development of television, the people will have a wider choice of programmes and there will be less danger of propaganda from one side only. The Australian Government will not always be a Labour party government. Honorable members opposite should not forget that this measure may be a rod with which to beat their own backs, and when a change of government occurs they will howl to high heaven about how that Government is using this vehicle of propaganda. I know that some members of the Labour party, notwithstanding what the Prime Minister says to the contrary, are asking what the Labour party is to do when another party is in power. The Government should spread the power, and allow private enterprise to share in this development. I am not sure that commercial stations are enthusiastic about frequency modulation. They are a little half-hearted about it, because it will widen the wave band so that they will have more competition, but I do not care about them. I should like to see some share in these new developments reserved for private enterprise generally, with appropriate controls, which are conrained in this bill. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3481</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KDA</name.id><electorate>Wilmot</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUTHIE, Gilbert</name><name role="display">Mr DUTHIE</name></talker><para>.- It was pathetic to hear the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> criticize the suggestion that a Treasury official should be appointed as a "member of the Australian Broadcasting Commission.

However, it is entirely wrong to argue that the Government has, therefore, nationalized the air. The granting of a licence to an individual im poses certain obligations  upon the  Government. The issue of a broadcasting licence to an -individual immediately commits him to huge expenditure on studios, plant and equipment.

He has made some completely inaccurate statements. After having accused me of being a doctrinaire socialist, he proceeded to be quite doctrinaire on the subject of private enterprise and research, and stated that American private enterprise had produced a superior technical result in television to that achieved by the government service in Great Britain. Sis statement was entirely untrue. Before the outbreak of war in 1939, Great Britain was far in advance of the United States of America in television. Indeed, there was television in Great Britain when it did not exist in the United States of America. That is an historic fact. The honorable member referred to researches by private enterprise in the United States of America. Actually, the researches are conducted by the universities in America as they are in Great Britain, but prior to the war American researches in television were well behind those of their British counterparts. The British had to abandon television during the war, because Alexandra Palace sent out a signal which was perfect for guiding enemy bombers to the heart of London. However, the United States of America was able to proceed with the technical work. </para></talk.start><para>The British Broadcasting Corporation, in all its technical work in 1939, was far in advance of the United States of America and in most branches which it continued, with the exception of television, it remained in advance of America, which had to accept one byproduct of the research workers of the British Broadcasting Corporation, radar, holus-bolus from the United Kingdom. There is no merit whatever in the particular argument which the honorable member has advanced.  His  statement was historically untrue. The national broadcasting system of - Great Britain, except for war exigencies as I have explained, has nothing to apologize for in respect of its record compared with that of the United States of America. I do not know whether the argument was particularly germane to the hill, but the honorable member for Parramatta imagined that it was, and. therefore, it was necessary for me to refute it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3483</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KZR</name.id><electorate>Balaclava</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">WHITE, Thomas</name><name role="display">Mr WHITE</name></talker><para>.- I have not spoken on this bill, and I would not have risen now except that the young member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> has put the emphasis in the wrong place. The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> took him to task because he said that the commercial stations were stealing the freedom of the people. Those were not his precise words, but he intended to convey that meaning. He implied that the listening public was subjected to a kind of tyranny in that they were compelled to listen to commercial stations. Other speakers have expressed dissatisfaction with the advertising of patent medicines and the like from the commercial stations. The honorable member for Fremantle is too quixotic. He is tilting against windmills which he has erected. A person is not compelled to listen to a broadcasting station. If he is dissatisfied with the programme from one station, he may tune in to another, or switch off his set. The Government is making a colossal mistake in claiming a monopoly of television The honorable member for Fremantle was right in one respect. When I was in Great Britain, in 193S, I saw televised programmes of sporting events and plays, but the programmes were restricted to a radius of 50 miles. I believe that the honorable member was incorrect in stating that signals from Alexandra Palace would have guided German bombers to the heart of London. The German airmen were perfectly familiar with the route to London, because, before the war, some had been pilots on the civil air routes and could not have missed the heart of London. </para></talk.start><para>Television was the forerunner of radar, and, at the outbreak of war, Great Britain was ahead of any other nation in that branch. American technicians came to England in order to study radar. It was a good thing for Great Britain, and civilization generally, that it possessed radar, because radar was a chain around the British Isles, just as much as the fighter aircraft, which enabled us to win the Battle of Britain. </para><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>3483</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Mr Lazzarini</name></talker><para>- Order!

Television for commercial purposes ceased in Great Britain during the war. If the Australian Government persists with its present proposals, it will be adopting a short-sighted view. It will be committed perhaps to one type of set, although it is true that independent manufacturers may offer various types of television cabinets. In 1938, the Philips company operated a mobile television service in Holland. The equipment was carried in a truck from village to village. "When a hamlet was deep in snow, the people could remain in their homes and view the film which was shown in a hall or in a small street. The attitude of the Government towards television may cramp the style of an inventor or broadcasting station. This is a great danger. Et is characteristic of the socialist or the dictator to believe that he can run things better than other people can. The socialist is not always right.

Man, speakers in this debate have condemned it, and have stated that nearly every one listens to the commercial stations. As a fairly constant listener, I believe thai no commercial stations gives such a satisfactory service as the Australian Broadcasting Commission does. I enjoy the musical broadcasts from the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and hope that such programmes will he increased. The Australian Broadcasting Commission gives its listeners good entertainment, and its news service is unpolluted and as good as any other news service. I exhort the Government to go slowly in this matter. "When appointing members of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, the Government should not select people for whom it has taken a fancy politically. The members of the board should be as independent as possible. The Government should also permit competition from other broadcasting sources, because competition encourages greater efficiency. If television becomes a government monopoly. Australia will not get the best service. The Government, in this bill, is going too far, and should amend it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3484</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JOI</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BEALE, Oliver</name><name role="display">Mr BEALE</name></talker><para>.- I have no desire to resume my private brawl with the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley),</inline> but I should like to answer one comment which he has made. I am sorry if I have hurt his feelings. He did become a little " crabby " about my reasonable comments. However, I consider that his quarrel if with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> and not with me. I merely used an interjection by the Prime Minister to prove my case. Replying to a comment which 1 had made about television, the right honorable gentleman said that, technically, there were greater developments in the United States of America than in Great Britain. That remark substantiated my point that, because private capital and private enterprise had been able to do the mechanical and technical work in a better way than it had been possible to do it in Great Britain, enormous advances had been made with television in America. The honorable member for Fremantle has not answered that point. It is perfectly true that the Alexandra Palace was closed during the war, which hampered British inventors. Nobody will contest that. But it is also perfectly true that when the Baird and other British inventions found their way to the United States of America, engineers and mechanics, working for private enterprise, made it possible for television to go ahead by leaps and bounds. That is what I said in my original statement, and my remarks were supported entirely by the Prime Minister's interjection. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3485</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JLZ</name.id><electorate>Richmond</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">ANTHONY, Hubert</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name></talker><para>. - As this debate is developing into a party, all honorable members might as well speak. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>3485</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K0E</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">GAHA, John</name><name role="display">Dr Gaha</name></talker><para>-  Members of the Opposition are deliberately stonewalling the bill. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>3485</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JLZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">ANTHONY, Hubert</name><name role="display">Mr ANTHONY</name></talker><para>- The honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Gaha)</inline> has not been here for a fortnight. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN.Order !

The purpose of this clause is to confer upon the Government a monopoly of television, among other things. Only through competition can the public be assured of the best service, whether it be in the field of entertainment or in a departmental store. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> said that television was too big to be undertaken by a private organization and that so much capital would be needed that no private firm would be able to give a television service. If that be so, why is it. necessary to provide in this bill for the exclusion of private enterprise? Economics alone would be sufficient to exclude them. Under a government monopoly, the unfortunate owner of a television set might have to gaze upon the features of the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> as he stands at the head of Man-o'-War Steps, in Sydney, to welcome the " Manila girls " back to Australia; or he might have to watch the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> as he reads out a declaration to the waterside workers on Australia's foreign policy; or he might have to look at the Prime Minister reading one of Lincoln's more famous addresses. Some incident in this Parliament might be televised, and although it might prove of interest and educational value, the fact remains that the spectator would have no alternative but to view those scenes, or shut off his television set. Competition makes for efficiency, and efficiency should be our aim in the interests of the public. The best way to ensure efficiency is to encourage competition, something which is not possible under a government monopoly such a? that provided for in this bill. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Clause agreed to. </para><para>Clause 6 -  (1.)

The Minister should make his intentions clear to the committee. Honorable members are perfectly well aware that on Sundays there are what may be termed Pleasant Sunday Afternoon broadcasts, particularly from Melbourne, <inline font-style="italic">lt is</inline> possible that during that session there may be something of a political or {Controversial nature discussed. Is it the intention of the Minister under this particular power to prevent any of the Pleasant Sunday Afternoon broadcasts? It is possible, as has happened in totalitarian regimes in Europe, that a minister of religion may, from the pulpit, deal with matters of a controversial nature, particularly when his session is being broadcast. I should like to know whether, if a minister of religion should touch on matters of political moment or matters of public importance that may be controversial, the Government proposes to prevent that minister from making such broadcasts! All of this is inherent in this clause, and I think that the Minister should clarify the position so that people will know where they stand under these amendments. The next matter that I shall deal with is the provision contained in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of sub-section 4 of proposed new section 6k, which provides that the board shall have power, subject to any directions of the Minister - to regulate the establishment of networks of broadcasting stations and the making of agreements or arrangements by licensees of commercial broadcasting stations for the provision of programmes or the broadcasting of advertisements. </para><para class="block">We know that the commercial stations have a hook-up through a network which extends over a vast portion of a State, and may, indeed, be a nation-wide network.

The board or the Minister should have power to regulate the establishment of networks of broadcasting stations, and the making of agreements or arrangements by licensees of commercial broadcasting stations with regard thereto, and also with regard to the broadcasting of advertisements. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3487</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>BV8</name.id><electorate>Melbourne</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Minister for Information and Minister for Immigration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CALWELL, Arthur</name><name role="display">Mr CALWELL</name></talker><para>. - The Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> has asked pertinent questions. I propose to tell him briefly what is the mind of the Government in this matter. It would be highly improper for "John Henry Austral " or anybody else, in the middle of a religious broadcast to talk on purely political matters If the public domain is to be used for a religious service, the people using it should guarantee i hat it will be preserved for religious purposes. They should not try to mix politics with religion. They should not crowd into it remarks in favour of any political party. The Acting Leader of the Opposition has asked what will happen with relation to the Pleasant Sunday Afternoon broadcasts from, say, Wesley Church, Melbourne. Those broadcasts are not, in my view, of their essence, religious broadcasts. Hymns are sung, and perhaps something else happens of a religious nature, but they are essentially what they claim to be, Pleasant Sunday Afternoon performances or programmes, during which public men give their views on public questions. In fact, people of all political parties express their views during these broadcasts. That has been the history of these functions, In other days they had much more time on the air than they have to-day. The Australian Broadcasting Commission, by virtue of its independent powers, made arrangements which affected detrimentally the broadcasting from Wesley Church in Melbourne. That, however, is another story. What the Government fears is that some people are inclined to play politics in religious broadcasts, and it is a bad thing for commentators, in the middle of what has been advertised as a religious session, to make statements which seem to identify a particular church or denomination with the views of the commentator. There is no objection to the commentator expressing his views at any time other than in a religious broadcast, particularly since those periods are made available under special conditions. Special advantages are given to people who- broadcast church services over the national network. With regard to the situation posed by the Acting Leader of the Opposition in regard to broadcasts over national stations, all I can say is that from out of the past we can visualize the future. There has never been any objection on the part of any listeners, so far as I am aware, to any of the broadcasts made over the national stations from churches of any denominations in any States of the Commonwealth on any Sunday in the year on the ground that the preacher has said something which might offend somebody'* political susceptibilities. Generally, ministers of religion take a very serious view of their responsibilities, and although they make comments from time to time in criticism of public policy, as far as I know not one has ever misused his pulpit to advocate the claims of one political party as against another. We seek to prevent that happening, because it would not be a good thing for democracy. The board will have powers of definition and discrimination in respect to commercial stations, and I cannot conceive of anything that would cause the Pleasant Sunday Afternoons from Wesley Church, Melbourne, to be adversely affected by the operation of this provision. </para></talk.start><para>On the matter of variety of programmes, the board would certainly be entitled to investigate the operations of networks, of which there are two in Australia, the Macquarie network and the <inline font-weight="bold">Major network.</inline> They could operate dangerously. The board will be empowered not only to protect the public against the undesirable operation of networks, but also the networks themselves against the demands of big advertisers. The Macquarie network lost a very big contract at one period because one big advertising firm in Australia demanded the right to choose stations from both the Macquarie network and the <inline font-weight="bold">Major network,</inline> and certain other independent stations to create a network of its own to advertise its own products. The Macquarie network certainly was not open to criticism for what it tried to do in that particular activity. The board should be entitled to secure variety in programmes. The present Broadcasting Committee has recommended -that, as also did the original Gibson Committee. The public interest should he served first and last. It is undesirable that five broadcasting stations in one capital city should all broadcast racing fixtures on Saturday afternoons, and that persons who are not interested in racing should have no facility to hear anything else. The board can be trusted to ensure a better deal for the public by a better variety of programmes than can the commercial stations themselves. Each  commercial station is an independent concern and has to get a sponsor for its racing sessions. If there is a good listening audience, the sponsor is forthcoming and will pay well for the advertisement. The section of the public that  19  interested in racing is well served on Saturdays, but the section that does not want racing is entirely neglected, overlooked and ignored. The board could bring about some better treatment for the public than has operated previously. Neither the Acting Leader of the Opposition nor any other member of the Liberal or Australian Country parties, or anybody else, has anything to fear from what the board will do in these matters. The board can be trusted to do a better job than individual stations, which have neglected their opportunities in the past. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3489</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JOI</name.id><electorate>Parramatta</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BEALE, Oliver</name><name role="display">Mr BEALE</name></talker><para>.- The aspect of this matter that I shall deal with is the provision contained in proposed new section 6k (2) (6) (ii) that the board shall - ensure that divine worship or other matter of a religious nature is broadcast for adequate periods and at appropriate times and that no matter which is not of a religious nature is broadcast by a station during any period during which divine worship or other matter of a religious' nature is broadcast by that station. </para></talk.start><para class="block">As I see it, that provision may work very wrongly against churches, in certain circumstances. The Minister is perfectly familiar with the points of view which exist in the church communities of Australia, and for that matter throughout the world, on the part that they ought to play by way of leadership on public questions. As the Minister is familiar with that aspect of the matter, I hope that he will listen to what I think will be a useful contribution to a serious debate. I ask the Minister to picture a public crisis or a great public issue of a political nature arising, in which the moral interests of the people are deeply involved, [f the provision remains as it is, it could be used by the board to prevent the leader of some church from making a pronouncement on it. The Minister belongs to one great church. One of his own archbishops, in the course of a sermon or a religious address, might desire to give what he considered to be a lead to the church on a great public  issue.  It might take the form of criticism of, or an attack upon, something that the Government was doing. One of the losses of our community is that our churches have withdrawn from leadership in matters of this sort. Or it could happen that a clergyman in a Protestant church, an Anglican archbishop, perhaps, or the leader of some other church, wanted to make a pronouncement on a great public question. He would normally make it during a church service. It may be that, say, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, addressing not only the people in his cathedral but also the whole Roman Catholic community in Australia, would consider it his duty to criticize or attack something the Government had done or was doing. That might be the right thing to be done by a church leader in Australia. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>3489</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>BV8</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CALWELL, Arthur</name><name role="display">Mr Calwell</name></talker><para>- Hear, hear! </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>3489</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JOI</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BEALE, Oliver</name><name role="display">Mr BEALE</name></talker><para>- I am glad that the Minister agrees with me. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>3489</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>BV8</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CALWELL, Arthur</name><name role="display">Mr Calwell</name></talker><para>- The Government does not object to church leaders voicing the stand of the church on moral issues. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>3489</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JOI</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BEALE, Oliver</name><name role="display">Mr BEALE</name></talker><para>- A political issue might involve a moral issue. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>3489</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>BV8</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">CALWELL, Arthur</name><name role="display">Mr Calwell</name></talker><para>- The moral issue could impinge on politics.

If the question were dealt with from an entirely non-religious angle, the position would be different. It happens in the case of one religious broadcast that a secular commentator comes along repeatedly and delivers political tirades of all kinds against all sorts of people. That creates the wrong impression that the views expressed by the layman are necessarily the views of the religious organization. The religious group of our community that tolerates that is acting detrimentally to its own interests. If that position became general, we should have a lot of people attacking the Government and the Parliament generally because certain people were abusing their authority. If a sermon deals with a matter from a purely religious point of view, no matter what criticisms are uttered, it remains of a religious nature. We have had no national stations offending, and some strong statements have been made from time to time in the course of sermons on public questions by ministers of religion. That will continue. I join with the honorable member for Parramatta in hoping that all religious organizations will give a lead on moral questions, and there is no intention to obstruct, frustrate or interfere in any way with what has happened insofar as national station broadcasts are concerned. But we do not want certain evils that have crept in in recent years in respect of commercial stations to continue or grow. That is the purpose for which the amendment is to be made. </para></talk.start></continue><para class="italic"><inline font-style="italic">The honorable member for Deakin</inline><inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchinson)</inline><inline font-style="italic">having been given the call,</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>3490</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KZJ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LANG, John</name><name role="display">Mr Lang</name></talker><para>-  This is the second time 1 have risen and been ignored by the Chair. </para></talk.start></interjection><para>The  DEPUTY CHAIRMAN.-  The last time the honorable member rose I indicated with a nod that I proposed to give him the next call on the right-hand side of the Chair.

In the second-reading speeches, and since we have been in committee, constant references have been made to " public interest ". I am not sure that the bill is designed to serve public interest or that if it were referred to the public for acceptance or rejection, the public would accept it. I do not think the people want the proposed new set-up for the control of Australian broadcasting; nor do I believe that it will operate in the public interest. When new problems in broadcasting arise in Great Britain, they are investigated by commissions that take evidence in public aud present a report to the British Parliament. Members of the public are at liberty to express their opinion on any new proposals in relation to the British Broadcasting Corporation. Nothing like that has happened in this instance. I' do not know where the conception of the proposed new board originated. The idea may have been hatched in some public servant's mind or in the conclaves of the Australian Labour party, but that if a matter for mere speculation. At all vents, the Government has determined i-o create a board of three. The  chairman  is to have a deliberative, as well as a casting vote, and he will, at all times, be subject to the wishes of the Minister who administers control of broadcasting. The present commission of five members is to be retained, but the powers of that commission are to be seriously curtailed. Power to interfere with programmes is to be transferred to the new board, which will be a kind of inner body, and will represent another example of the enlargement" of bureaucracy. Of course, the new board will have an adequate staff of secretaries and other employees. Under its aegis the present commission will continue to function, but its powers will be seriously curtailed, including even the activities of programme managers and other people who arrange the commission's programmes. Of course, the commercial stations will also fall under the hierarchy of the new board. Is the ap pointment of such a super body necessary? There has been no public inquiry into the matter, and no reason for this action which is acceptable to me has been advanced in the Parliament. I do not believe that it is necessary to have both a board and a commission, and, in any event, if some new organization is required I do not believe that the type of organization envisaged by the measure is the kind which we need. </para></talk.start><para>I have not had the opportunity to make full inquiries into the control of radio broadcasting, but for some time, I have been of the opinion that technical matters should be controlled by the commission. The reason why the control of technical matters has been left to the Postmaster-General is that radio broadcasting in this country has, like Topsy, "just growed' No real justification can be advanced for the continued division of control of programmes from control of the necessary technical facilities. For one thing, the officers of the Postmaster-General are not primarily interested in the development of broadcasting. I should imagine that from 75 per cent, to 85 per cent, of their time is devoted to attending to matters concerned with the postal service, and they have only a fraction of their time left to devote to radio broadcasting. There does not seem to be any real reason why the control of the technical aspects of broadcasting should be divorced from the other aspects, and I can see no reason therefore, to justify the establishment of the proposed new board. </para><para>I believe that the present commission should be reconstructed, and undoubtedly the commission could function to greater advantage if its membership included, in addition to technical experts, such as those which compose the British Broadcasting Corporation, a number of men of sound business and general experience who could formulate policy. It is obvious that the establishment of the proposed new body will enable the Government to influence the controllers of broadcasting. Undoubtedly, the present Government hopes that it will be returned to office after the next election, and through control of this kind to ultimately nationalize broadcasting. Such a course was advocated by the Labour members of  the Gibson Committee and that is the declared policy of the Labour party. If the Government is successful in introducing regimented control of the kind which it now proposes, free broadcasting as we now know it will undoubtedly cease if it is returned to power after the next election. I advocate the establishment of an enlarged commission on the lines of the British Broadcasting Corporation, which has functioned so successfully. From time to time new comets come within the ken of radio technicians, and every encouragement should be given to the implementation of new ideas such as frequency modulation and television. Undoubtedly the present . system of control can be improved, but the matter should have been reviewed by the Broadcasting Committee, or some independent inquiry should have been made, as is the custom in Great Britain and in other countries. Members of the Parliament would then have had some real evidence of the necessity or otherwise to establish a board to control broadcasting in this country, [n my opinion the present legislation is suspect in almost every home in Australia, and on each occasion that the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> has spoken, [ have become more convinced that the Government's purpose is to exercise ministerial control over broadcasting programmes so that the Government can tell the people just what they must listen to. </para><para>I turn now to the subject of coordination of radio programmes, about which quite a deal of misconception has arisen. The Minister twitted me to-night with having signed the principal report of the Broadcasting Committee last year. The convention is that all members of that committee sign the principal report, but submit minority reports on matters on which they disagree with the majority of the committee. That happened in that instance, and the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> and I submitted a minority report, with which the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkinder)</inline> also concurred in some respects. The present legislation contains sufficient power to enable the Government and the Parliament to take advice on the control of broadcasting in Australia and to effect any improvements that may be desired. There is no need to resort to extreme expedients such as those that ar&lt; proposed in this measure. One of the arguments advanced by supporters of the bill is the need for greater co-ordination of radio programmes. Much of their comments is sheer nonsense, because we already enjoy more co-ordination of radio programmes than many people realize. This evening I borrowed from the library the only available copy of <inline font-style="italic">The Listener In,</inline> which is the best radio magazine available in Australia. Incidentally, 1 consider that the Australian Broadcasting Commission should examine that magazine, because it would profit the commission to follow its example. The publication sets out very clearly all the radio programmes, both national and commercial, that are to be broadcast at each hour of the day or night. An examination of that synopsis shows that there is a greater diversity of programmes than people realize. It i9 obvious that each radio station deliberately endeavours to present something different at a given time from any other station and to avoid a clash of similar programmes. For instance, in Melbourne three stations.. 3LO, 3KZ and 3XY do not broadcast horse races on Saturdays. That fact disposes of the criticism that all commercial broadcasting stations in Melbourne broadcast the same events. I understand that in Sydney there are two commercial stations which do not broadcast horse races. An examination of radio programmes also reveals that even in the broadcasting of horse races there is considerable diversity. One station, I believe, gives a complete broadcast of the principal races of the clay in Sydney and Melbourne, whilst others broadcast on ' the main events, so that light musical programmes are interrupted for only about two minutes in every half hour. An examination of the programmes also reveals other diversities of entertainment. Strange to relate, however, nearly every radio station has a children's hour at 5 p.m., although 1 do not know why, as many children are still out playing at that time. That remark does not refer to 3LO Melbourne. Apart from children's sessions, however, there is a very wide diversity in the programmes transmitted by the various stations. Any one who glibly speaks about  the same programmes being broadcast over different stations at the same time is talking nonsense. I shall not say that there is no need for further co-ordination, but I do not see any necessity for committing the country to the expense of establishing a new board. Co-ordination could be dealt with by the Minister in cooperation with the broadcasting stations. The establishment of a board to control broadcasting is a very expensive method of control. I can foresee, as time goes on, that the Minister will interfere more and more with the right of the people to determine what they shall listen to. The chances of abuse under this system are, I believe, very great, and are fullyrecognized by the public. I have found recently that there is very great concern among the people about the provisions of this measure. </para><para>The  DEPUTY CHAIRMAN.  - Order !

They have set a net. to catch some particular fish, but in that net will be gathered up a lot of other fish that were never intended to be taken in it. To my mind this clause if an attack on the religious freedom, not of any particular sect or church but of the people of Australia.It is an attempt to dictate to religious bodies how and what they may broadcast. It denies to them the right to use their own time on the air in the manner that they think fit. Take the in stance of 2CH, which broadcasts a Sunday afternoon service. During that service that station also conducts a forum on public questions. It permits representative people to expound their particular point of view. Sometimes representatives of the temperance movement speak. This proposed sub-section lays it down that -  no matter which is not of a religious nature is to be broadcast during any period during which divine worship or other matters of a religious nature is broadcast by the station </para><para class="block">As a Sunday afternoon session is essentially of a religious nature, the temperance advocates would be silenced. The Pleasant Sunday Afternoon broadcasts from churches would have to cease. If  there  were a broadcast from St. Mary's Cathedral or St. Andrew's Cathedral in Sydney, only matters of a religious nature could be broadcast. If the cleric delivering the sermon desired to speak on any subject - and this is what I wish  the  committee to understand clearly - which the board did not regard as being of a religious nature, the broadcast would not be permitted. The board would not stop the broadcast while it was on, or take action after it bad been made. The religious body concerned would have to submit the script and the clergyman would not be allowed to enter his pulpit to say what he might feel his religious convictions constrained him to say. Persons might be appointed to the board who had no particular political views but on the other hand others might be appointed who were " fellow travellers ". Such members might decide that no attack could be made over the air on communism in any period -  during which divine worship  or  any other matter of a religious nature was being broadcast. </para><para>Imagine the Archbishop of Canterbury entering his pulpit to denounce communism on behalf of the British nation. and  his statements not being permitted to be broadcast. If station 2SM had a broadcast from. St. Mary's Cathedral in Sydney, it would not be possible to broadcast any matter relating to church meetings or functions or any of the usual announcements made by a cleric when lie first enters the pulpit. If 2CH had a broadcast from a Methodist church of an industrial suburb such as Balmain, in Sydney, it would not be possible for the preacher to deliver a sermon on current industrial problems. The board would have the right to say that that was a political and controversial subject and not a religious subject. This proposed sub-section takes away the religious freedom- and churchmen and church leaders. That is a very dangerous step. The board will be able to direct a station that it must broadcast divine worship and other matters of a religious nature for adequate periods and at appropriate times. Most stations already do that. There are a few that do not, and one of them is 2KY in Sydney. Is it proposed that the board shall tell that station that it must broadcast a divine service from some particular church? If so, is the board to select a church ? Does it mean that on Sunday mornings every station will have to broadcast a divine service at the same time? Will there be nothing on the air at that hour excepting religious broadcasts ? </para><para>At present, one religious body pays for the broadcasting of its faith from the profits that it makes in the commercial world. The profits that it earns on week-days are used to propagate its religious faith on Sundays. Will that organization be denied the right to spend its money in the way in which it thinks fit? This clause could be most damaging to religious bodies operating broadcasting stations. I should not give to any board, to any person or to any body of persons the power to interfere with the religious freedom of the Australian people. It is all very well for the Minister to say what he thinks is the meaning of this provision, but the board or the courts may interpret it differently, [f all members of the committee were asked their interpretation of it, I am sure that there would be a variety of opinions. The Minister should be very careful to avoid the slightest suggestion that theAustralian Parliament has put into a bill that will eventually become an act of* Parliament anything that has even  theremotest  chance of interfering with thefreedom of religion in this country. </para><para>It will be interesting to see how the board applies the provision in the proposed section 6k (2) (6) (iii) and what it will regard as " an equitable basis " for the broadcasting of political or controversial matter. What is an equitablebasis? Does it mean that because the Macquarie network gives free of charge to the Prime Minister a ten minutes'" broadcast every Sunday, that it will have to give the Leader of the Opposition a similar free broadcast? That is something that the board will have to decide. Does the provision mean that if 2KY gives time to the Labour party,, it must give an equal time to the Liberal party? The board will also have to decide what is a controversial matter. The decision will not be made by the Parliament. Does " equitable " imply equality of time? If it does not, what does it mean ? Would 2SM be required to give the same amount of time to the Communists as it gave to a cleric who attacked the Communists? Would <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rumble</inline> be given the right to speak over 2CH on Sundays? If 2KY allowed a union to state its case over the air during an industrial dispute, would it also have to give the same amount of time, at an equally favorable period, to the spokesman of the employers? If the miners' federation stated its case over 2KY, would that station also have to give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gregory</inline> Forster free time? </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>3494</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KYC</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">POLLARD, Reginald</name><name role="display">Mr Pollard</name></talker><para>- Certainly not. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>3494</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KZJ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LANG, John</name><name role="display">Mr LANG</name></talker><para>- It would be a grave injustice if it had to do so.

                    <quote>
                        <para>Some time ago I asked the Minister representing the Postmaster-General whether provision would be made for a new poetoffice at Innisfail. The Postmaster-General subsequently informed me that a new post office would be built at that town. There seems to be some delay. Innisfail is a rapidly growing town and the existing post office is both inadequate and shabby compared with other buildings in the town. I have not been told when it is intended to erect the new building. Will the Minister representing the Postmaster-General endeavour to have the buildings provided as soon as possible? </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>The department appreciates the necessity for providing additional accommodation for both postal and telephone purposes at Innisfail and has included two items on its rehabilitation programme for the erection of a new telephone exchange and new poet office building. The erection  of  the telephone exchange building will be undertaken initially and when completed and equipment installed a start will be made on the post office. The priorities for all buildings to be erected in Queensland have just recently been reviewed and those for Innisfail have been advanced substantially. There are, however, many other works of an urgent nature associated with telephone services which must of necessity receive priority over the Innisfail projects, hut the honorable member may be assured that the work will be put in hand immediately circumstances permit. </para>

This figureis somewhat higher than normal in consequence of the estimated higher production. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited has contracted with private shipping interests to clear raw sugar stocks from North Queensland. The allocation of tonnage for all trades is made throughthe Combined Traffic Committee, which is a joint body consisting of representatives of the associated steamship owners, independent steamship owners and the Australian Shipping Board. This committee is kept fully informed by the contractors to the sugar company of the shipping required for the clearanceof sugar. The Australian Shipping Board has from time to time made available ships owned orchartered by the Commonwealth to assist in the shipment of sugar as required by the Combined Traffic Committee. The honorable member may rest assured that I will do everything possible to assist in lifting sugar in order to avoid any hardship or unemployment in the sugar-growing areas. </para>
