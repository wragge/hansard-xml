					<para>Whilst the position in regard to .the supply of motor .vehiclee generally is still acute, it is being constantly reviewed by the Government. I am pleased to be able to say that, as from the ist December next, all motor vehicles coming from soft.cur.rency countries will be freed from control. That decision will naturally exflude :from control the Australian car "Holdeu' to which the honorable member -Jas referred. These relaxations do not indicate that an annp}e of siap'ply of motor vehicles is coming to ,Australia. The latest returns show that there are approximately 76,000 'unsatisfied applications for motor vehicles, of which 49,000 are. for motor cars and 27,000 for utilities. Of, the unsatisfied applications, 70,000 are for motor vehicles manufactured in North America. These figures exclude 19,000 applications for motor vehicles of 12 horse-power and under from which control has now been lifted. Providing that the trade continues to co-operato with the Government in ensuring that essential users shall get first priority in releases the Government believes that it will be able progressively to lift the control as from the 1st December next.</para>

						<para>The Prime Minister will recall that on several occasions I have referred to subversive statements made by Mr. Burns, a Communist executive member in Queensland, in which he indicated that if Russia came into conflict with the western powers, including Great Britain, the Communist party would aline itself with Russia. The right honorable gentleman has indicated that he received a report on this matter yesterday. Having perused the reports, is he now in a position to say what action will be taken against this man, and will he now indicate whether or not he will review the attitude he has adopted in the past in refusing to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the activities of Communists in Australia?</para>

						<para>Does not the Prime Minister consider that the reports that the Russian influence at the election of the President of the United Nations General Assembly was used against Dr. Evatr. prove conclusively that the lying propaganda of the Opposition against that right honorable gentleman has been proved groundless? In view of the attacks 011 Dr. Evatt by the Russian press. will the Prime Minister ask the Acting Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party whether they will assure Dr. Evatt of their strongest support? Further. as the election of Dr. Evatt is a high tribute to Australia, will the Prime Minister ask whether the Opposition proposes to offer him congratulations and good wishes?</para>

						<para>I have not studied the voting list, but I understand that the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) received a substantial majorit' of the' votes. His election to the presidency of the United Nations Genera) Assembly confers a great distinction upon the right honorable gentleman himself and on Australia. I am only sorry that his work in the cause of peace is not so well appreciated by some people in 'Australia as it is by the great nations of the world. With regard to the other matter referred to by the honorable member fot Griffith, one naturally expects a great deal of jealousy from political opponents.</para>

Unless I misunderstand the position, the appointment of the right honorable gentleman to that: office-will: entail his absence from Australia for long periods. Will the Prime Minister consider offering the services of the Minister to act as iriediator in Palestine in succession to the late Count Bernadotte, so that he may carry out the work which he conceived and initiated, and in the fulfilment of Which the Swedish mediator was assassinated?</para>

						<para>The services of the Minister for External Affairs are too valuable to Australia for him to be allowed to ,devote his full time to the work that would devolve upon a mediator in Palestine. I am not assuming that other itiediators will be appointed to endeavour to compose the differences between the sews and the Arabs in that country, but I. am speaking in an individual sense. F expect that, arising from the report of the late Count Bernadotte, a commission 'r similar body will be apuointed to deal with the situation in Palestine. I do not pl'OJ)OsC to consider the suggestion which the honorable member for Barker has made.</para>

					<para>I have received nine telegrams from primary producers at Attunga, in the New England electorate, protesting against the quota imposed on power kerosene and distillate in the farming areas of New South Wales. The farmers who sent these telegrams say that they will not be able to sow their crops or do their ploughing and fallowing. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Fuel whether the Government desires the farmers of Australia to grow more food for shipment to starving people in Great Britain and to ease the dollar position, or to cut clown their production? It will not give them kerosene and power distillate in the quantities that they require, as was done during the war, when the need for restrictions was greater than it is to-day. I desire the information so that I shall be able to tell tlu farmers whether to carry on as they are and grow more food or to restrict proinction.</para>

						<para>The honorable member did not ask this question in the interests of the farmers. He asked it in the interests of certain oil companies. Because I happen to be a member of a Cabinet sub-committee that deals with supplies of petrol and kerosene, I know a good deal about the subject. It must be accepted—and, I think, is accepted by all honorable members of this House, irrespective of party—that it is essential. because of the dollar shortage, to conserve petrol and kerosene. When it was decided that kerosene imports had to be pegged at the quantity imported last year. the Minister for Shipping and Fuel asked the oil companies to agree to a base period upon which to fix quotas for kero- ,sene. The companies could not agree among themselves. The Minister then asked them to refrain, in the meantime, from initiating a sales campaign to increase the quantity of kerosene held by farmers on their farms. An agreement to this effect was reached, and some of the companies honoured it, but others broke their promise, and embarked upon a high-pressure sales campaign in certain districts in order to ensure that, for a particular period of the year, their sales would be at a very high level, so that: when the quota was fixed, they would be able to claim that their average sales were greater than, in fact, they were. I have in my hand correspondence which shows that some of the firms did embark upon such a campaign. The following letter. dated the 1st September, 1944, was sent out by one of the oil companies which broke its promise, and refused to cooperate with the Government :—</para>

						<para>I desire to make a personal .enpleriati:on in reply to the comment of the Minister for Defence -(Mr. Dedman) 'up-on my motives in referring to the great difficulty -in which certain farmers in the Attunga district of Tarnworth have been placed by reason of the operation of the quota system imposed by the Government in the distribution of power kerosene and distillate. -i Claa-m that the . Minister for Post-war Reconstruction misrepresented me when he said that my action had been taken in the interests of the oil companies and not of the farmers, and that I was a "stooge" for those companies. The Minister is an ex-officer of the British army and, as-such,,. is supposed to be a gentleman. I propose to show that I was not a "stooge" for the oil companies. The first of the telegrams of protest that I received in regard to this matter was from A. H. Gallagher, of Attunga. Has any honorable member heard of a "Gallagher oil company" in this country? The next telegram that I received was from H. Scholes, of A ttunga, and others were received from A. Easterman, L. Jeffrey, 0. H. Brines and H. Doolan. Has any honorable member heard of a "Doolan oil company"? Further telegrams were received from H. O'Dell and F. Gallagher. Those telegrams conclusively prove that I was misrepresented by the Minister. The honorable gentleman made his misrepresentation worse by quoting from a letter that he said was dated the 1st September, 1944. It is four years old. That makes it a stale document. I now ask, at this, the first opportunity I have had, that the whole of the, correspondence from which the Minister for Defence quoted be tabled in this House. I ask that that correspondence be recovered from the Linister for Shipping and Fuel (Senator Ashley), to whom the Minister handed it after he had finished his reply to my question. The Minister for Shipping and Fuel thereupon promptly disappeared. I move—</para>

						<para>With the exception of the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley), I suppose that I am closer to the 0ha1ir than. is any other honorable membei. What transpired between tie honorable member for New England and the Chair, was: not audible to me,, and I do not, think, it was audible to the Prime Minister. If the Chair to take action following: some personal conversation between a member of the House and the Chair of' which the House is not awar0 Is the ILouse. to be asked to vote for the suspension of an honorable member in respect of a matter of which the House is not aware? Such a ruling: would seem to constitute a most important departure from thet forms. and practices of this House. I submit that, for the proper conduct of the business of this House, the House should knowprecisely upon what it is asked to vote. Up to now, apart from the tatemeiit made by the Chair, after action had 'been taken to penalize the honorable member for New England, the House is not aware of what took place between, the honorable member and' the Chair.. I ask for a ruling upon whether the suspension of an honorable member may be brought about as the, result of a ceuversafion between. that honorable member and the Chair which, honorable .embera did not hear,, and whether the House is to be called upon to vote oil a. motion. for such suapeirsion without beiu1 aware of what has. taken. place.,</para>

						<para>I raise one question that I do not think can be conveniently dealt with in the budget debate. E have given the vIinister for Civil Aviation (Mr. Drakeford) certain particulars concerning the state of the Kangaroo Island transport services, especially the air service. I have had occasion to refer to this matter before. Kangaroo Island, which is an important part of my electorate, is aeparated from the mainland of Australia by a strip of water. Sea communication is difficult. A ship of the type required o improve sea communication is not vailable. The ship normally employed is going into dock and. will not be availible for several months. The only other method of transport is by air. A service is run by Guinea Airways. The in.fornation I have, is contained in a letter, hich I passed to the Minister about ten Lays. ago. It is to the elfect that the Department of Air intends to penalize Kangaroo Island residents still further by cutting down the normal air srviee during the • coming summer. There are special conditions that apply to Kangaroo Island that do not apply to any other part of my electorate. They may apply in some other electorates. I - lo not know. But Kangaroo Island is a pleasure resort. Great numbers of people go there to holiday or to fish. Most people prefer to go there by air. :[t is a short flight. Ordinarily aircraft fly the journey in half an hour and: improved aircraft in even less time. Local people 'rye not able to hook passages by air as a rule, because bookings- are generally made four, six or eight -weeks ahead. So, with the small amount of steamer traffic offering and the cutting clown of the air service, which is being made by the Minister for Civil Aviation, as the head of the department, people who wish to visit the island as tourists, including fishermen and others are sadly inconvenienced. So are local residents, who are not able to get air transport in an emergency. Another fact that the Minister must take into consideration is that the Government of South Australia, as agent for the Australian Government, intends to settle no less than 250 ex-servicemen on Kangaroo Island in the near future. Commonwealth and State officers, who have to go to Kangaroo Island in connexion with the preparatory work sometimes have to make the visit at short notice. With only one steamer a week providing an inadequate sea service and the air service cut down, it is difficult for local residents, people engaged on official business, prospective settlers, holiday-makers, tourists and fishermen to get to and from Kangaroo Island. I should like the Minister for Civil Aviation to have a good look at Kangaroo Island. He was good enough at one stage, perhaps in a moment of weak-min.dedrtess, to promise to go there with me some day.</para>

							<para>I remember that when I was Postmaster-General I closed down a wireless station and then went. to Kangaroo Island on holidays. The heads of the station concerned had to fly to Kangaroo -Island to apologize to me. It was good Christmas fun. I ask the Minister to make it convenient as soon as he possibly can to go to Kangaroo Island and see the conditions for himself, because, if he is to control the Department of Civil Aviation. it stands to reason that places like Kangaroo Island, which are cut off by water from continental Australia, have a prior claim for air services to those people who have rail, road and private motor services to supply their needs. The other matter I raise is one that J would have raised- at question time had not the Prime Minister curtailed questions. I do not know whether the right honorable gentleman was attempting thereby to celebrate his birthday. At any rate, it is announced in the press to-day that Australia will receive as reparations from Germany the complete production unit bf the watchmaking plant of Franz Hermie and Sons at Gosheim. I should like to know from whatever Minister is concerned whether the plant will be submitted at public auction or whether it will be disposed of privately and, in any case, whether the interests of the honorable member for Watson (Mr. Falstein) will be safeguarded.</para>

							<para>I doubt it. As a matter of fact, whatever is done in regard to the consumption of aviation spirit by civil aircraft will not apply to subsidized services, and I think the Kangaroo Island service is subsidized. In any case, the proposed reduction will not amount to 5 per cent. of existing services, and that relates only to non-subsidized services. So, if the service is conducted four days a week the actual curtailment over a year would not amount to more than a day or two.</para>

							<para>The service, if it is not subsidized, cannot be exempted from whatever cuts are decided upon without incurring the risk of other people coming along and saying that they have an equally strong case. I appjeciate the honorable member's concern about the Kangaroo Island service. No instructions had been issued when that letter wa written for the service to be curtailed. The matter of curtailment of civil aviation services is still being considered by the Government. No fuel order has been issued. Until the fuel order goes into operation, it rests with the Guinea Airways whether it continues the service to Kangaroo Island on the present basis or not. If the fuel order is operated, unsubsidized services will be cut by 5 per cent. As for the honorable member's references to shipping, we have, of course. no control over shipping services. I did tell the honorable member that I should be happy to visit Kangaroo Island and see the place where he had a victory ove, radio people when he was Postmaster. General. But it is not possible for me to go to all the places I want to go to If I can arrange a time to suit the convenience of the honorable member and myself, which cannot he in the immediate future, I will go to the island with him. Time matter of air services is being examined to ensure that the people shall not be deprived of any essential transport. The honorable member mentioned the development of soldier settlement on Kangaroo Island. He said that 250 ox-servicemen were to be settled there. Obviously, when they are settled there, extra transport services will be needed. That will be considered in due course. I do not know of any intention of the Department of Civil Aviation to reduce the existing service to Kangaroo Island or of any order having been given to that effect.</para>

						<para>I desire to bring to the notice of the Government the position of elderly persons, who haveall their lives been good citizens, and have succeeded in saving some money. In my electorate, there. are several such persons, who have saved as much as £1,000 or £1,500. One man acceded to the request of the Treasurer (Mr. Ohifley), and invested his £1,500 in a war loan at 3 per cent., which yields him £46 17s. 6d. a year. That is his only income. The prospectus of the loan appealed to the public to lend their money to the Government, and so prevent inflation. The man of whom I speak applied for an age pension, but was told that he was not entitled to it because he had more than £750. The department suggested that he should spend the money so that he would become eligible for a pension.</para>

							<para>That is so, but the man and his wife could use the money to defray living expenses, and so live comfortably for a couple of years. Then, when it was spent they could apply for pensions, The Government does not give sufficient consideration to thrifty, deserving citizens who have saved money. It treats better those people who, through misfortune in some instances, or through their own fault in other instances, have become destitute. I do not claim that the person who has £1,000 or £1,500 is entitled to a full age pension, but he should be entitled to receive the difference between the pension and the income which his savings yields. I do not propose to state the name of the man whose letter I have here, but I shall supply it to the Minister for Social iServices if that is desired.</para>

						<para>I urge upon the Government the need to ensure that sufficient sugar is made available this year to preserve the fruit crop in the southern States. In the deetorates of the honorable member for Wininiera (Mr. Turnbull) and the honorable member for mdi (Mr. McEwen). and in my own electorate, ,a great deal of fruit is grown, and it is important that sugar should be available to preserve ii. About 20 per cent. of the Victorian fruit crop was lost last year because of the scarcity of sugar, with the result that the growers suffered loss, and the people of Britain, who are so much in need of preserved fruit, had their supplies curtailed. Even in many parts of Australia people are unable to obtain canned fruit. There is a general scarcity of sugar in Australia, and in many districts housewives cannot buy more than. 2 lb. at a time. This is not the fault of the sugar-growers, or of the manufacturers. I was in Queensland recently, and found thai the mills had large quantities of sugar on hand, and that the growers could produce a great deal more cane if they were allowed to do so. The trouble is due to transport difficulties, and the fact that the Government is not prepared to dciii with those who are creating the difficulties. For this reason, raw sugar cannot be brought south for refining. The people to whom I spolce in the north of Queensland were afraid that, because of the accumulated stocks of raw sugar. the mills would not this year be able to take all the cane offering. The fruit harvest in Victoria will begin in a little over three months' time, so that the Government must take action now to ensure that sugar is available for processing the fruit. Otherwise, the fruit-growers will lose the reward of their labour, the people of Great Britain will have to go without the fruit they need, and Australia will lose the value of this export trade. I hope that the Minister for Immigration (Mr. Oalwell) will ensure that sufficient labour is made available to the cane-growers and sugar mills to ensure that the southern fruit crop will not be criminally wasted as happened last year.</para>

						<para>Reference has been made to the production of sugar, the provision of adequate supplies for the people of A'astnalia, and the despatch of the -surplus p.roduts to Great Britain. Honorable members will recall that early this year, a conference of cane-,growers was held ..t Gaafton, in New South Wales. L attended by invita'tio, iand discussed wish the icane-growers' executive prob-Icnrs -associated with the industry.. I promised 't1iat 0O0 Baltic worker would go into the 'sugar-ptoclucing districts of Queensland to it cane. Vhst promise was fulfilled, although it was with' thfficulty that 'we were abFe to arrange ,at such short notice for tb wilecatin of so 11rany men ito •a particular induStry. However, 900 lts ivent into the industry. We also promised to •ebt, ai'n the seIvicCs of 400 former members of the Polish Army, who 1had fought in association with 'the British Army during the war. It vas ails'o a'ranged to issue landing Verrnits on the application of 700 families in Queensland, who wished to rrominate friends or relatives living in Italy, 's o that 'they might 'came to Aust'en'lia t'o cut cane. They 'were to 'conme at the cpcnse 'of their 'w'n reTh tives n'd friends. The A'utralian Government was not 'obliged to 'arrange 1tran5p0rt, or to c'on'trib'u'tc 'to'wn'rds the payment f tkeir fres. 'Strangely enough. when the Baltic workers went into 'the cawe-fid1'ds, many Australians, h'o had preion'ly been 'associated with the iud'ust'ry, but had. no't worked in it 'the -previous year, also '"turned up" when the 'gangs weirt being signed 'on, and there was plenty 'of labour for cut'tig all the cane. The estimated sugar har'vest this year is 800,000 ,tuns, and the e'pecte'd price will be about £5 a 'ton. Thus, the, sugar cheque will be approximately £20,000,90, or £5,000,000 more than last year. When 1 was in Queensland for three or four weeks during July, I saw the Baltic workers in action. I spoke with the millers, the cane-growers and members at the 'executives of the Australian Workers Union, as well as with representatives of the 'shppiiig com,pany, and at 'tih'alt 'time !1 found ev ry'bo'y perfectly happy. The Baits were fitting very satisfactorily nto the indmus'y 'aE kqt 'tiTat time, they were earning 'between i2 and £2 1-0s. ,a day., and 'some Australiain canecutters were earniisig -between 43 And 8 1108. ma day. The sitgar was also being shifted. There was a short interruption following the big strikb in Queensland,, and for a period. the State railway department was unable to .supply u1cient trucks., but by the middle of July, all the sugar which was banked up last year had been shifted. with the exception of about .39 tons a' me .mill. The South Johnstone Mill had despatched not 'only 6000 tons of this year's crop, but also .7,000 tons of last year's crop. I speak, 'not of 'tons of sugam cane, but of tons 'of sugar, and it aequire approximately 7 .tons of •s•gr cane b' yield 1 ton of sugar.</para>

							<para>T'h wharf labourers in 'Queensland have 'been much maligned. Indeed, wharf labourers in many other parts of Australia have been maligned in the press. Often, lack of shipping, the use of obs'l'ete hand'l'ing gear, mismanagement and a shortage of r.'ai'lway trucks are responsible for delaying 'the wharf la,bo'ureims. I pay a tribute to the work 'of the wharf labourers of Queensland in shifting tM's year's crop. I .have net heard ranything, .except in regard to Lucinda Point, to 'suggest that a•nc delay has 'occurred in disposing of this year's crop.</para>

							<para>That -is so. The Governuient also had to decide what was to ibe idone with Ore sugar when it was -lespatched from Queensland to southern parts. We are most -anxious to ensure that 'all the people -of fAustralia shall have an tasaple supply of sugar next summer. 1t is 'a number of years since they have had ia]l the sugar that they s'equlre for jammak-ing and other ipurposes. The ,Aa-r was responsible for most of the inconvenience which the ipeople ' have uff-ercd, :but in order to asist, the Government arranged .to supply .50 men to the Oolomiail Sugar Refining Company Limited, in Melbourne. Those men will be housed in the Royal Australian Air Force camp -at !Fisliermcns -Bend in :order that they may be employed in the sugar refinery-, at Yarraville. We had to provide aceomruiodatioii for those men. We could nOt expect them to work in the refinery iif they did not have anywhere ito live. We eperieneed some delay in 'obta'ithng a'ceramnrodation far thm, :but we hope thit, as the result of the ernloyment of tlaose n-ion in Melbourn-e, 'wad the -work of iusti'a'lia'ns --whe -are already engaged in the industry, we shall -be oble to build u'p a 'stock pile o'f aproimately 15,000 tons of iugaw so that -all fruit-growers a'wd housewives in Victoria this year may have al] the 'sugar that .they require.

						<para>—I desire to -direct attention to a seriow position which has arisen in country -districts as the result of the restr-iction placed on supplies of power -kerosene. I do not want it to be said that, in making nay submissions, I hold a brief for the oil companies. I do not, but I am holding a bi-ief for former soldiers, -sailors and airmen, who were induced to settle on thland in my electorate, and who, to-day. are at their wit' end to obtain sufficieni fuel fur their madhines. Great difficult has been experienced in obtaining an adequate number of tractors to enable primary producers to increase production. o-hih is so vital, but restrictions have now been plwce on the quantity of fuel that primary producers reqidre for their machines. Those restrictions will create a serious -position. Many of the settlers have been induced to 'increase production. They were 'not satisfied to work a 40-'houi week, 'but -used their 'tractors by uday and night -to eulivate -the land. Provided seasonable conditions continue ito -be favorable, they will soon begin to harvest a good crop. Thy view with great a1arn the restrictions -which have been placed upon the sale of power -kerosene. I am not satisfied with -the explanation of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr. Dedman) that the actions of oil companies a-re responsible for the 'lack of adequate supplies of power kerosene to meet 'the reqmñremen of pi-maTy producers. Had the Minister's advisur, taken :the itrouble 'to ascertain the-quanbit of .this fuel --Wh-ih twas ued .tlur-i'ng the past twelve months, and had he based a quota on that information, I believe that the Government would not have found it necessary to introduce the restrictions. An adequate supply of power kerosene is vital to our programme for increasing food production. If increased supplies of fuel are not made available in the near future, the farmers will not be able to harvest the crops, and their hard work for many months will have been abortive. I emphasize the extreme urgency for action in order to avoid that economic loss.</para>

							<para>I was not present in the House when the attack was made, but I read of it subsequently, and I feel that some reply should be made to it. If the attack upon Mr. Lamb had been made in the public interest there might have been some merit in i, but by no stretch of the imagination can it be claimed that it was made in the public interest. The attack was a continuation of a personal vendetta which Mr. Lang has against Mr. Lamb and was made purely for political purposes. It is known to all honorable members of this House that there is no more conscientious or popular member of the New South Wales Parliament than Mr. Lamb, the present Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. His electorate of Granville constitutes the major portion of the new electorate for Reid. which is represented by Mr. Lang, Mr. Lamb's popularity in his electorate is shown by the fact that at the last two elections he defeated the Lang Liberal candidate, sponsored by Mr. Lang, and had majorities of over 10,000 votes. His popularity among his fellow parliamentarians is shown by the fact that he was unanimously elected as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. One has only to converse with members of the State Parliament of all political parties to learn that Mr. Lamb is highly respected by all of them. That makes the attack upon him in this House by the honorable member for Reid all the more deplorable.</para>
						</talk.start>
						<para>Why then, it might well be asked, does Mr. Lang continue to attack Mr. Lamb? It is because he hates him. It is because he fears him and his influence with the electors, whose suffrages Mr. Lang will he seeking at the forthcoming federal general election. The basis of the attack made by the honorable member for Reid—</para>

							<para>If my remarks were offensive to the honorable member, I withdraw them. The basis of the attach upon Mr. Lamb that was made by the honorable member for Reid, and which was delivered with considerable vindictiveness, is that Mr. Lamb, as a director representing the employees on the board of an insurance company, proved himself to. be a bad Labour man and a bad trade unionist. Those charges were listened to in silence by the honorable member who is constantly interrupting me when I am attempting to reply to them.</para>
						</talk.start>
						<para>The basis of the charge made by Mr. Lang is entirely groundless. The facts reveal a very different state of affairs. It is on record at the head office of the insurance company concerned that in 1939 the managing director issued a circular instructing members of the staff to join a union. They did so. After twelve months the two members of the staff who are alleged to have supplied SIr. Lang with statutory declarations .-eased their union membership, the union being the New South Wales Insurance Officers Association. This union ceased o operate later on, and members individually transferred to the Insurance Clerks Federation. It is also on record that it was at the request of the union that Mr. Lamb was appointed as a director to epresent the employees, notwithstanding Wr. Lang's statement to the contrary.</para>

They were lismissed by the managing director, who- :a the circumstances, had no alternative.

							<para>I am quoting from m notes, as I have not such a fund of knowledge as the honorable member for mdi (Mr. MeEwen). I have learned that the company pays all its legitimate claims and charges in full. It shows handsome annual surpluses, and like other such companies, will at no distant date. overcome its present actuarial disability The honorable member for Reid is the last man I. know of who should attack. an company. The manner in which he obtained money from friends and supporters to launch his newspaper the Century, was snide and, dishonest. Those from whom he obtained money understood that they were taking shares in the Century, but latei they discovered that the honorabi. member for Reid had put their money into another company, Express Newspapers Limited. They hav also discovered that their shares in that company are not, and can nevc be, worth the paper they are wj4ttci on. The honorable member put his own money into the Century where it is safe and secure, and likely to show profits because of the support given to that newspaper by the well-known vested interests whose willing tool he is. The honorable member's attack on Mr. Lamb has, don' that gentleman no harm, but has brought contempt on his own head. The honorable member for Reid has the false reputation of being a brainy man, and yet his only contribution to the national welfare since his election to this Parliament has been to trail around a muckrake and to stab and strike first at one individual or organization, and then at another: By his action he has degraded the National Parliament and is not a fit and proper pc,rson to 'be a member of it. On the other hand, Mr. Lamb-,swh-o. is the honorable member for Granville in the New South Wales Parliament, has a long record of loyal service to both the Labour and trade union movements and has been continuoutl-y- a member of both 5i5ice a :ery early age. He is a respected member of the trade union movement and his reputation may be said to be much higher and greater than that of the honorable member for Reid, who has so riciously attacked him. I have no doubt that when the New South Wales. Parliament re-assembles Mr. Lamb will fully answer the charges made against him in this Rouse by the honorable member for Reid and will expose that honorable member for what he is, which is, as the honorable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) once decribed him, a ." nuisance and a menace the political life of this country".</para>

						<para>-'I refer to the question of the despatch •f sugar supplies from northern Queensland. Earlier this afternoon the honorable member for Bendigo (Mr. Rankin) discussed this question from a different point of view to that from which I shall deal with it. He ,put forward a plea for, action to ensure that producers in his area, mainly fruit-growers, should be supplied with sufficient quantities of sugar to enable them to process their crops. I was pleased to notice that the honorable member, no doubt because of' the knowledge gained during his recent totr of Queensland, realizes that any shortage of sugar supplies sent to southern fruit-growers is not the result of production shortages in Queensland.. I thank him for his. acknowledgment of that fact. The honorable member referred in his remarks to the fact that it was possible that, unless sugar at present stored; in mills was shifted at an early date, processing of this season's crop might he delayed. I am pleased to notice that the Minister for Labour and N.tional Service. (Mr. Holloway) is in the House,, as it is. to his department that my remarks particularly apply. The question of the harvesting of the present sugar crop is me which has attracted' attention, for some considerable period; not only in the sugar industry itself, but also in certain departments. of the Australian Government which are associated with it. Recthise of the foresight which has been a feature of the sugar industry for years it was realized early in the past that there were several, important factors which must be considered in any action taken to ensure that this season's crop would be harvested. The first factor was tha there was •a carry-over from last year crop, of a considerable quantity of sugar which was held at mills and wharfs in north Queensland, which, if not shifted before the harvesting of this season's crop is undertaken, would seriously impede the harvest. The second factor was the supply of labour for this year's harvest. The third factor was the shifting' of this' season's sugar production as it became available at mills' and wharfs. With respect to th first factor, as a result of various delibera tions, a good job was performed in lifting a considerable quantity of the sugar carried over, and when this season's harvest comes fbrward wharfs and mills will. in the main, be reasonably free of last year's crop. The Minister for Immigration (Mr. Calwell) stated, a few minutes ago, that he had made available to the sugar industry approximately 1,000 displaced persons from Baltic States to assist in the harvest. I am prepared to pay tribute to his department for that action.. Those Baits are now working in the industry and, froth information. I have had fron time to time, it appears that they are doing a good job. As a result of that, circumstance and of othei considerations, mills are now able to work at something like 100 per cent of their capacity for the first time sine' 1941. The third problem, that of ensur ing that the present crop is shifted at reasonable rate so that mill's will not b forced to cease processing work because of lack of storage space, has not yet beei.i satisfactorily solved; in spite of th statement of the Minister for Immigration that he believed sugar was being shifted at a reasonable rate. That this shall be assured is of great importance, not only to the sugar industry and to Australia, but also to Britain. The Government should do everything possible to ensure that the whole of this year's expected crop, which the Minister stated' would amount to approximatel 800,000 tons, will be lifted within a reasonable period. There are three things to be considered First, it is only reasonable that sugar-growers, who have had a rather thin time during the last three or tour years, should be given every opporriiuity to take advantage of this year's good crop and the high export prices for sugar obtainable at present. Secondly, a large tonnage of sugar is required by Great Britain. It was only yesterday or to-day that an announcement appeared in the press that Great Britain needed this year all the sugar that it could obtain from Australia as its full requirements .vere not available from other sources. It was estimated that Great Britain would require 400,000 tons of this year's Australian crop, the total of which, I repeat, is expected to be 800,000 tons. Australia's own sugar consumption is 100,000 tons, so that if we are to meet the needs of Britain it is essential to produce as much sugar as possible and to keep supplies, moving. The third factor is that after the middle of November and up to the end of December, depending on when the early storm rains come, it is not practicable to harvest sugar in Queensland. Towards the end of December, after rain, the sugar content in the cane decreases considerably. This fact may not be realized by honorable members generally. It is, therefore, desirable that nothing shall impede the rapid harvesting of the crop between now and the middle of December. Efforts of various kinds 'have been made to ensure that this year's crop shall be lifted in full. I have given close consideration to the problem. Unquestionably the position is not entirely satisfactory. I ascertained as the result of my inquiries that at the larger ports, although the tonnages shifted had fallen below the target bet, the position is not yet acute; but, at some of . the smaller ports the position has become acute, because manufactured sugar is not being lifted. This applies particularly to Bundaberg. Some time ago Judge Kirby visited the sugar centres of north Queensland and arranged that all work in relation to the shifting and shipping of sugar should be organized to maximum capacity. After his visit to Bundaberg various bodies, particularly the chamber of commerce, became interested in the problem. Acting as an interinediary, the'chamber of commerce arranged for a three months' test in order to ascertain where the real trouble in relation to the slow turn-round of ships rested. The watersiders agreed to work at reasonable maximum capacitity for a certain time, and the shipping companies agreed to supply ships in sufficient volume to lift all the sugar available. As the result of the trial it was possible to determine whether the real trouble lay in the slow turn-round of ships or whether some other factor was hampering the despatch of sugar from Queensland ports. Yesterday I received from Bundaberg a telegram in the following terms :—</para>
					</talk.start>

Re. pectfully suggest you endeavour move department responsible for control waterfront. Have wired Senator Courtice similar terms.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>It is obvious from the terms of the telegram that the source of the trouble is simply a quarrel between the watersiders and the department responsible for the payment of attendance money. As the result of this quarrel farmers and others dependent on the sugar industry in that district are likely to be severely penalized. One of the responsible millers in the district wrote to me as follows :—</para>

						<para>Our storage space at Bingera is approximately 11,600 tons and little over 50 per cent. of the mills' peak. The crop is estimated to harvest from 28,000 to 28,500 sack tons of sugar.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>The crop this year from that mill will be about 28,500 sack tons of sugar. The mill has already manufactured 10,650 sack tons, but has not been able to despatch one-half of that quantity. In view of the importance of this matter to sugar producers, to the waterside workers who want the work, and to Great Britain which needs every ton of sugar we can produce in excess of our own requirements, I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service and the Minister for Shipping and Fuel (Senator Ashley) to inquire into it immediately so that crushing in the Bundaberg area may proceed without delay. If a mill is forced to stop crushing, the cane-cutters responsible for supplying that mill immediately go elsewhere for work and do not return. I earnestly appeal to the responsible Ministers to do everything possible to settle these differences between the waterside workers and the department so that the sugar may be lifted without delay.</para>

						<para>It would be a great pity if the collective efforts made to lift the sugar crop this year were to fail because of transport difficulties. After being successful in obtaining the necessary labour to handle the crop the Government hoped that its shipment to southern ports would be assured. We hope that the labour supplied to the industry will stay in Queensland and handle next season's crop. :r have received several letters from millers and growers in Queensland thanking me for the labour made available to them. The bottle-neck in the sugar industry has nearly always been at the refineries. Both the companies and the governments concerned will have to cooperate in order to remove the bottleneck. The Government is doing everything possible to secure additional labour for the refineries at Sydney and Melbourne. One of the problems associated with the provision of additional labour is the building of the necessary accommodation to house the workers. I assure the honorable member for Qapricornia (Mr. Davidson) that I shall do everything I can to assist the industry and I shall at once discuss the problem with the Minister for Shipping and Fuel (Senator Ashley) with a view to expediting the settlement of the matters in dispute.</para>

						<para>I wish to raise a matter of more than usual interest not only to those personally involved but also to the people of Australia generally. A fortnight ago the Government announced that frequency modulation was to be introduced into Australia and that this new development in radio would be made available only to the national stations. This announcement gave rise to a good deal of concern, particularly among those associated with commercial radio stations. Unless we have grown completely cynical even in these days when the freedom of the people is being so much encroached upon, this is a matter which must be regarded as of first-rate national importance. This decision on the part of the Government will deny to commercial radio one of the most outstanding technical advances in the industry. The undeniable ultimate object of this decision is to smother and destroy commercial radio in Australia. This is but another step by the Government along the path of socialization, the first steps having been taken last year when the Government announced that it proposed to nationalize the trading banks of this country. When that announcement was made there was intense indignation all over Australia at the proposal of the Government to take control of the people's wealth in all its forms. That move, however, was obvious to every person in Australia. This proposal is much more insidious. This is subtle attempt to socialize an industry by a man who for the time being controls the destiny of this country as Prime Minister. Consider the effect of a similar proposal on other activities. Let me draw an analogy between this proposal and a similar proposal to nationalize the transport industry. Suppose the Government of the day said to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited or to Ansett Airways Limited, "We shall not allow you to take advantage of any technical improvements or advances in the design or operation of aircraft. We propose to limit these technical improvements solely to aircraft operated by Trans-Australia Airlines on behalf of the Government. We shall compel you, not at the moment, but over Vhe yawns., to become an obsolete industry, and (because of your fobsoleseence we 'undoibtedlzy s'hall ultimately destroy you . What would be the reaetion to inch a proposalL? We must remember that we are dealing 'with .a Government that does 'not stop at a mild form of oeialization, but one which stands for ocia'lization lit all its forms, even beyond the limits of the Constitution. In 1945 the Minister for Information (Mr. Oa'lwell) moved the resolution .that -the Labour party stood for 'complete socialization Seven beyond the limits 'of the -Oonstirution The party's policy originally contemplated socialization within the limits Of the Constitution, but the Minister was responsible for the deletion from that plank of the platform of the words 'within the limits of 'the Oomtitution'. Should this Government 'gain complete political -control .of banking it 'would eitrci 'advances, interest rates and -ixehange and thus have nearly 'all the powers it required to smash industry of -every kind. Now it proposes virtually to destroy commercial radio of the future. Let me give another 7exanigle. Suppose it said to the primary industries, "All the great technical advances and improvements that may come out of the tabovatories of :the world, and from research into animal husbandry are to be denied to -you. These are to be used exclusively for enterprises under State control ". We can see at a glance the ramifications of 'this proposal to deny to commercial radio -the latest techjiical advances and improvements. It is not to be wondered at that many people have not yet awakened to the great principle involved in this proposal. They do not understand the proposal because it relates to a technical matter. Frequency moduration is in operation in the United States of Ameiica, having been developed to a very great degree by the commercial radio tatious in that -country. Tlevision, th'oh 'still in As infancy, x6ll soon be available to us. This proposal may not a'ffect 'an;ybody very much 'at the moment, but 'uiimately requenqy 'modulation eil1 provide 'additional wave lengths whióh will 'be amle for both national and commercial stations. That applies also to elevision, and doubtless there will %e furthey 'a'd'vance in 'radio 'science. Imagine The position if iall new technical processes are. iconfined to the national service operated by the .Aaastraliau Broadcasting Commission. 'Oo,nsmercial radio will -be made obsolete. People will be equipped with apparatus built to conform to the latest Fevalapme.n'ts and the commercial stations will have no listeners. An industry can be killed -by the direct process as the lGovernment contemplates 'doing with the Australian private 'banking system, or 'by strangulation by the indirect process of making it 'obsolete, as the Government is seeking to defeat the commercial radio system by making iT obsolete. If the 'Government is allowed to pursue its course of confining the operation .of technical developments to the 'nationail instrumentality, commercial radio will 'nndoubteclly suffer a complete eclipse. An interesting aspect of th second process of 'killing an industry has a bearing on the provision of the 'Cons titet,ion for the paymen-t by the -Go. vernmemt of just compensations for the acquisition of property. The High Court has ruled many times that "just compensation" means "the value of property at the time of acquisition ". if commercial radio stations are gradually squeezed out of the field by being denied access -to improvements, their value, will be reduced to the point of absurdity at which point ,the Government will be able to step in and acquire them. I warn the Australian public that that process need not be confined to the field of radio. There are other fields of industry to which it can be extended by .a Government h-ungry to nationalize industry. I do not believe that the authors of the Constitution had in mind, when they wrote that provision, the thought that a process would be discovered by which ii could be circumvented. Bèople have not fully assimilated all the aspects of the Government's rdecision to confine the operation of -fsaquency modulation -radio to the Australian Broadcasting 'Commission, but -the more thy assimilate then the more they will realize that commcia] radio is doomed. The Broadcasting Committee, of 'which I am a member, is regarded outside this House as "'the travelling civeus, greatest show on earth ". t goes to Queensland in the winter and to Tasmania in the summer. It has; a great objection. to cold. It goes where the weather is warm,, but. not. too, hot; because it abhors flies. Sometimes members of the committee from this side of the House accompany it and sometimes not.. We. regard it as essential that one of us shouTd accompany the circus to keep. it under observation. Its cost must be. considerable.. One. of the two subjects. it most recently investigated was the reception of parliamentary broadcasts' in certain areas-. To make that' invesgation a great peregrination; took place. Journeys were made' in accorda.nce'with a plan to ensure that members would enjoy the. best climatic conditions of the areas which ' the, committee' visited. One would naturally expect' that if any' one were asked, "Would you like to receive parliamentary broadcasts? " the answer would be "Yes". lit did not require any costly committee to journey ai1' over the country to find that out. Nor did it require' such journeyings by the: committee to discover how broadcasts were, to be. received. That is, not a matter, for a. layman to. investir gate. It is a, job for the. technicians of the Postmaster-General's Department. The second question was whether a fund should be' established' for, the assistance of Australian composers.. As can easily be imagined every one interested in benefiting, from, such a. fund turned, up to give evidence. They were "hand, knees and. boomps a daisy" into the honey-pot when it was proffered to them. All members of the committee share the. desire to help Australian composers to get on to the musical map of the world, but, there was no need for the committee to travel the country at great expense to ascertain whether such a fund should or should not, he established. The' Postmaster-General (Senator Cameron) could himself more easily and at vastly less, expense have, arrived at the conclusion which the committee reachecL The committee has those useless tasks referred, to it, but. net such important tasks as inquiring into tile adoption. of the frequency modulation system in. the Australian radio service, which involves such fundamentals in the. British way of life as freedom of the. air and the right of the individual TO enter a. vocation, and advance himself in it. I asked several. tiniest at, ineetingfr of, the' committee, w'hens the subject of freq: uency modulation would come before it. I was never told and. it, never ca-me. before the. committee, and I do not think that it ever will do so. in other words, the committee will he given chicken-feed matters to inquire into at great cost, but will' be denied the right of inquiring into. fundamental questions affecting the national and commercial radio services of this country. Mn. Harry Alderman was right when he wrote tc the Bishop of Nevcas.blë about station 21ID. to the effect that if the bishop did certain things for the Labour party and gave it certain considerations he could be practically sure to. get the licence to operate that station) because there was. a majority of: Labour men on the Broadcasting Committee. It is true that there is a majority of Government supporters or, the committee. There would be a majority of our members of it if we were in power. The point I am making is that party ideologies must intrude into such a committee, and the Opposition parties and the Labour party' an(- sharply divided upon ideologien With ideologies entering into its uonsidrations the committee is incapable of giving an impartial opinion on the problems it investigates. We have been chid in this debate for having faiI3 to suggest how economies. could! be made. I suggest' that the committee' be abolished as soon as possible. it is a waste of public money. It does not; d'e one bit of' good to, any one.</para>

					<para>1 was not present in the Rouse when the, budget was introduced, but since my return from abroad I have listened to several speeches delivered by Government supporters. The dominant note that I have caught from their speeches has beer one of complete complacency. For them, all is well in this best of all possible worlds; this is a good budget, and our defences are adequate. Then there was a somewhat flabby, timid and pacifist suggestion that we should not talk about war. According to them, if wstalk more about peace and less about war, there will be no war. To me that is about the most dangerous attitude that any one could adopt.</para>
				</talk.start>
				<para>I should like to take honorable members with me in spirit on a trip to the other side of the world as I saw it a few weeks ago. I went by a flying boat that left Sydney, and alighted at Bowen on the coast of Queensland the following morning. From Bowen, we flew acrosc the north Australian peninsula to Darwin. Down below we could see a grim and forbidding country, perhaps millions of acres in extent, known as North Australia. It is washed by the waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria and, from the air, that country looks lonely and hopeless. We came down at Darwin. on the northern side of Australia I was forced to remember dunnje the trip that our population numbers 7,500,000 people, who inhabit a continent with an area of approxim-ate1r 3,000,000 square miles; and that half of Australia is and and virtually uninhabitable. Our population density is lea' than three people to the square mile, and a great part of the continent is undeveloped and incapable of development. On the following morning, we passed across the Indonesian Archipelago.. where, in a narrow group of islands, that looked almost like pocket handkerchief spread out on the sea below, 70,000,000 people live and work. A considerabli- area of those islands is uncultivable, consisting area of those islands is uncultivable, consisting as it does of mountain ranges and dense forests, but so much of the land as is fertile has been cultivated to the last inch. There, as I have said, 70,000,000 eke out an existence, and are multiplying year by year. On the subject of world population generally, I read recently that there are now 200,000,000 more people in the world than there were in 1939, notwithstanding the loss and devastation caused by the war. Compared with our population density of two and st half to the square mile, the population of the Indonesian Archipelago is about 600 to the square mile. Another fact which strikes one forcibly is that the people there to work. All the time, the growing population is pressing upon the available pace, and the land is proving too small for it. Ultimately, the time must come when the Indonesians will have to move out beyond their own small string of islands, as, indeed, their forefathers did less than. 100 years ago, when they migrated to Singapore and Malaya. Those who ought to know, such as Vlieland the ernographer, assert that Singapore and alaya were not originally inhabited by the race of people which is now there. It was only after the British, under Sir stamford Raffles, came to Singapore that large numbers of Indonesians moved in from Java attracted by the improved conditions. In the island of Singapore, and in Malaya, there is a seething mass of some millions of people, most of whom toil on the land. Passing over those countries to the north of Australia, I was struck by the importance to the inhabitants of the river systems along which the bulk of the population is grouped. Typical examples are the Irrawaddy River, in Burma, and the river Ganges in India. I was reminded that, in this respect, Australia is at a grave disadvantage as compared with other lands. It is also at a disadvantage in that our great mountain systems run north and south, instead of east and west. That the direction of the lie of these mountain ranges is important is demonstrated by the fact that., in India, the monsoonal winds, blowing always in the same direction, carry the rain away from the Sind Desert, because of the harrier formed. by the Sind Mountains, so that the Punjab is fertile, while Pakistan, to' the . north, is arid. Geographical conditions are of great importance to a country, and Australia is not fortunate in this respect. This throws upon us a greater obligation to do the hest we can with what we have.</para>
				<para>My journey took me over Burma and then over India, vast stretches of which are uninhabitable, but the country nevertheless supports between 350,000,000 and 400,000,000 people. Most of them toil on the land and get their living from the soil, and they are multiplying rapidly. After leaving India, we passed over Arabia and :North Africa, with their dying lands. North Africa, which, according to my history books, was once the granary of Rome, is now, for the most part, an arid desert because of geographical changes. There is a lesson in this for Australia. Similar changes are taking place here as the result of soil erosion. In North Africa, the area of fertile land is contracting, and the population diminishing. Leaving Africa, we crossed France into England, where all the cultivable land is worked to the last inch by people who toil lovingly and faithfully upon it. The French peasants and the English farmers love their land, and deal faithfully with it. They, put back into the soil what they take out of it. with the result that, generation after generation, the land remains fertile.</para>
				<para>Let us take this journey again, from another angle. When one leaves Australia, and passes over the Indonesian Archipelago, one immediately remembers that among the 70,000,001 people who inhabit those islands. there is at present in. progress Communist revolution. It was at first popularly supposed, that the disturbance was an uprising of the people who ,sought self-determination in government. That is not so, as every one is now aware. Alongside the racial revolution, there is in progress a first-class Communist outbreak, which has now progressed so far that the Communists have attempted to take charge of the government of the country. It is the same in Malaya. The night I arrived at Singapore. a state of national emergency was declared because of the disturbances. There were barricades on the roads, and rroops were everywhere. Fighting had broken 'out 'in the hills, and a Oommunist revolt -against the .go'vors'nent was in progress. When I reached 'Singapore -on ray way back to Australia, [ was informed by people who ought to low, and 'whom I believed,, that the ae.volution, 4thougb superficially u.nder -control, was Atill the cause .of ver deep concern. It was -suggested to me that it might be a !osg :time before effective control was re-established.</para>
				<para>Another Communist revolt, sponsored a foreign power, has also broken out itt -Burma, a day's flight to the north-west f Malaya. When the British, in their wisdom or otherwise, withdrew from Burma, they left .a caretaker -government i-n power, but it could not control the ituati-on. A Communist revolution broke out, and is still in progress. In Siam a iimii!ar revolution has broken out. These ere not uprisings of primitive peoples fighting for the right of self-determination; they are alien 'movements sponsoreda foreign power.</para>
				<para>Next -comes India. When ,[ was in London, I was informed 'by eminent members of the Indian community that they were deeply concerned about the spread -)f Commiinis't doctrines in India. Those loctrines are not to be confused with r he 'semi-religious "communalist" beliefs 'chieh have always been current among the Indians; they are straight-out Communist doctrines, and they are spreading rb]-oughout the population. Across half the world therefore, between Australia and the United Kingdom, we encounter at almost every stride the problem of the alarming extension of violent cornmunism. A similar situation exists in ['ta'ly; -and Prance, in my view, at presenthangs in the balance as a democratic power. Throughout Europe itself, ancient states have been gobbled up one after another. But the political situation in Germany demonstrates the final moral for Australian politicians and citizens. Four powers, which were supposed to have been allies in World War II., are now 'trying to control a defeated -power, Germany. I regret that the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) has just left the chamber, because i desire to express my gratitude -to him for making it possible for me to fly. to Berlin, where I stayed fox four days. The aircraft in which I travelled flew down the northern -corrádor Lirom Hamburg. After having -seen 'that 'devastated city, and Berlin, I do net arced to be reminded, by any honor able member opposite of the awful consequences of modern 'warf are. Whether atom bombs or high explosive and :incendiary bombs are used is immaterial Modern war -is too horrible for any responsible persons to want to contemplate. much 'less desire to cause.</para>
				<para>Berlin is 'divided into four sectors—tb British, the American, the French and the Russian. It is idle tc -comment 'on how that 'situation arose, or - say that better statesmanship 'might have yielded better results. The real 'answer is that it was an ad ho arrangement, which was the 'best corn promise that could be reached at the -timeThe arrangement was 'made upon wha seemed to be a justifiable ussumption that 'Soviet Russia -wad genuinely 'desirous of making the compromise won. Unfortunately, events have proved 'that the assumption was not justified. 'TI-to position now is that there is a qnad-partitfgovernment, which does not function be- 'cause the Soviet will not allow it to do so Local-governing 'bodies 'of democr.aticall elected members of the German community are also unable to function be. ,cause the Soviet, by interference, 'and indeed, violence, is preventing -them from doing so. People are being kidnappedby day and night, and shootings are ua common occurrence. The -news of many of the outrages it never published in the press. There 'artforms of 'violence which haunt the minds of the people in the city, hecaus -they do not 'know what will happen -from one day to the next. Finally, Russia has created a grossly fantastic position by 'suddenly 'refusing to allow 'the United States of America, 'Great Britain 'and, France to use road 'or rail transport into Berlin. Honorable members will remember that 'the 'German capital'is -situated nearly 200 miles inside f-he Russian zone of occupation, 'w'hieh begins on the seaboard north of the Elbe River and travels obliquely across -Germany to 'Czechoslovakia. Of course, the Western Powers never intended that tha area should be regarded as Soviei territory. It was to be the Soviet zone of occupation, pending the signing of the peace treaty. Under the arrangement between the Lour powers, the zone was to be occupied by Russian troops, but the German populace in it were to receive instruction in the functioning of the democratic system. But the iron curtain has dropped along the western border of the zone, which, for practical purposes, has now become Russian territory. The exception is Berlin, which, it seems to the American, British and French cornrn. anders and politicians, must therefore continue to be jointly occupied by the four powers, and not solely by the Itessians.</para>
				<para>The reason which the Russians gave for their decision to forbid rail and road transport into the 'city was "technical difficulties . Of course, that explanation has not deceived anybody. The 40-called technical difficulties have not been remedied and for nearly three months no road or rail transport has passed from western Europe into Berlin. The result would have been that, under normal conditions, between 2,500,000 and 3,000,000 Germans in Berlin would have starved or frozen to death, because coal, food and other supplies would have been denied to them. The Western Powers conddere. d that their prestige demanded that they should counter the Russian move, and they resolved that they would cot tolerate the position. I wholeheartedly endorse their attitude. Ever 3inc; we have been transpàrting by air the food and fuel which the Germans in the western sector of Berlin require. The air lift continues every day. As I stated earlier, I flew down the air corridor from aambu.rg into Berlin, and left the city by another corridor. The flights can be difficult and trying adventures. Each corridor is narrow, and Russian planes may fly about them at any time. Weather conditions are not always suitable for flying, and the young pilots with whom I flew, skilled as they were, were obviously under great strain. lut they are doing the job, and I believe that, in the ace of any difficulties that may arise, they will continue to do so.<para>
				<para>At G-abow airport, in the British sector, the commanding officer, a group captain of the Royal Air Force who deeply impress ed me, stated that the -air lift had been increased from three or four airerafi a day to about 300 planes a day and this will increase further to 500 planes a day. That information is not secrel At Templehof airport, which is in th- American sector, American officers told me a similar story. After a small beginning, the Americans are now us1na large number of aircraft in this service. I met many of the important and 'well-informed people there, and all of then stated that the air lift will continue a long as the Russians deny us the use of road and rail transport to and from Berlin. If necessary, it will continue during the winter months. That will not be easy. In October, mists begin to close in over the valleys, and flyingconditions will -be more difficult. In th depth of winter conditions of snow, iceand fog become intense, and flying risky will be further accentuated. Nevertheless, I was informed that the British and' American Governments are determined to continue the air lift.</para>
				</para>At this point, I interrupt the theme of my speech in order to make a plea to tbf Prime Minister that the gesture which he made earlier in offering to send Australian air crews to assist in the air lift should be repeated. The offer watextremely well received overseas, and created a fine impression of imperial solidarity.</para>

I understand that fifteen Dakotas wereoffered, but the Australian Government was informed that they were not required. because bigger aircraft were available. from the United States of America. Speaking subject to correction, I believe that Australia sent abroad the number of air crews required for fifteen aircraft. Another offer of assistance will enhance- Australia's reputation abroad, and increase the feeling of moral solidarity. which is so vital at the present time. Young Australian airmen would -be gladto serve in an adventure of that kind, in such a worthy cause. Yesterday, I asked the Prime Minister whether 'he wouldconsider offering additional air crews,. but in reply be merely said that no request had been made for them. I talked to air crews in Berlin, and to their commanders, and I know that any offer which Australia makes- to supply air personnel will be gratefully, gladly and eagerly accepted. I hope that the Prime Minister will not lose this opportunity to enhance our prestige overseas.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>I return now to the main theme of my .4p0ech. The fantastic conditions, which make the air lift into Berlin necessary, will continue as long as the Russians deny the Western Powers the right of road and rail transport into that city. The remarks which I am about to make are not intended to be provocative, because no one who has a knowledge of the situation in Europe desires to act provocatively, but I believe that the Parliament Thould have the benefit of the opinion of honorable members who have witnessed the conditions in Europe. It is my judgment that Russia intends to take western Europe if it can get it. We must decide whether we shall allow Russia to realize that ambition. I also believe that Russia plans ultimately to dominate the whole world, and, therefore, Australians, who believe in democracy, must make up their minds whether they are prepared to stand by while Russia proceeds to achieve its ausbitiozis. Speaking for other members of the Liberal party, and, I believe, for nearly all Australians, I say that Russia must not be allowed to overrun western Europe. We dare not permit the Soviet to take the whole of western Europe and to flood the world with its philosophy and ideology, discoloured as it is with the -tain of having 12,000,000 people in conentration camps. The Russian Communists believe in government by a ruthless dictatorship, which denies to individuals their right of self-determination and self-expression and is fierce, and utterly destructive of every principle in which we believe. Sooner or later, we must take our stand with the other democratic countries, and deny to Russia the world domination that it seeks. My Opinion may be expressed thus, "If we have to fight, we must fight ". Many knowledgeable people in Europe believe that a third world war is inevitable. God forbid that this should be. Many acres in Berlin where buildings once stood are strewn with rubble and twisted iron. There are thousands of rickety buildings without windows and roofs, and where many of the people live I do not know. Those scenes of desolation and devastation were caused, not by an atom bomb, but by high explosive and incendiary bombs, which are less destructive. I shrink from the thought that this country or any other country should be subjected to such destruction. Nevertheless, the thought that we should have to surrender to Russia because we -did not resist at the right time, or 'because we were not firm in the early stages, is completely untenable. We must not give up the only way of life that is worth while to people like ourselves. I repeat: If we have to fight, we must fight. If we do not make it perfectly clear to the Russians where we stand in the matter. we shall certainly have to fight. We may leave it too late.</para>
					<para>I come now to the conclusions which I draw from the world situation as I saw it in the course of a few weeks. I frankly concede that my examination was in some ways superficial. it could not have been otherwise in the time that I had at my disposal. Australia to-day stands in a position of the most deadly danger. If I am charged with exaggeration, I shall plead, "Not guilty '* . Those words are, if anything, an understatement. Never before in our history. and I do not exclude the year 1942, have Australia and the things for which w' care àtood in such danger. The populations of the small islands to the north of Australia are increasing and will eventually have insufficient space in whici to live. We are, therefore, faced with the danger that one day we may find in isolated places around the Australian coast, which are not at present populated. little groups of people who have drifted to those places in one of the racial movements that tend to occur when economie pressure drives people from their homes. This may occur almost imperceptibly—not in pursuance of a deliberate policy of conquest, but because of the pressure of economic forces. If that happened we could not bayonet or shoot them. The only preparations that can be made against that kind of almost imperceptible movement must be made, in. advance of and not after the event. Then there is the threat of a Communist war starting in Europe and spreading its red tide to our shores. I believe that the only response* to these things is to work desperately hard. We cannot have in Australia a Paradise either for workers or managers. The danger that threatens is too great. We must work hard to increase production, and particularly the production of food, so that we may feed, not only ourselves, but also our allies and people in other parts of the world. When we speak of the and centre of Australia, which probably comprises one-half of the continent, we must isot overlook the fact that, according to the geographers, there is a very fertile it rca of country stretching from the north around the coast to the west. We must develop the rich, fertile ,nd cultivable parts of Australia to the utmost degree and in the shortest possible rjriie. That is a task which demands real ta.tesmanship, and no party shibboleths or preconceived ideas or prejudices should be allowed to turn us from it. We must also expand our defences. Having regard r.o our needs, the defences of Australia at preseit are paltry, shabby and foolish. We could not defend anything with the -hefences which are proposed. We may go down, as other nations have done before. Nothing is static. I do not believe that we shall go down if we manage our affairs properly. But if we do not take drastic and immediate action, and have proper regard for the trend of developrnents in the world, we most certainly .:hall go down.</para>

					<para>I was engaged in preparing notes for a speech, and I did not expect to be called at this moment. However, as honorable members opposite apparently 'ho not wish to speak now I shall step into the breach. I was not in Canberra when the Treasurer (Mr. Ohifley) delivered his budget speech. I was in Queensland. investigating the remarkable job that is being done by the Premier of Queensland, Mr. Hanlon, through the agency of that highly qualified and ':fficient officer, Mr. Hemp.

					<para>Much has been said about providing incentive for workers but I believe that the best incentive that can be given to workers is a sense of security—security of employment and security against sickness, unemployment, and the disabilities of old age. The industrialist, again, can forward his project with most confidence if he knows that demand will be sue tamed. Of this the best, guarantee is full employment and the provision of adequate social services to those people who have to spend the greater part of their incomes on necesearies. Therefore, security, in the largest sense, has all along been the keynote of the Government's financial and economic programme.</para>

						<para>Honorable members opposite do not hold a mortgage on humanity. This talk of security is merely vote-catching propaganda, • and I think that the members of tEe Government know that it is. It is almost a eulogy of the futility of effort. I admit that governments other than Labour governments have introduced social service legislation, but this so-called Labour party has gone further. Social services have now developed into a "gimme club ". The spirit of adventure that built Australia is being killed. This security twaddle does not ring true. The Government knows that it is frequently "taken for a ride" and that many people are receiving benefits to which they are not entitled. That sort of thing is going on under the very eyes of Ministers, but they rarely expose it. The honorable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Thompson) is one of. those who stands up to any electors that he considers are abusing the social services scheme, and I wish that every honorable member opposite would do the same. A creeping paralysis is spreading across this continent. It is sponsored by the Australian Communists. The Communists in Russia do not su,bscribee, to a policy of Less hours. and less work. The idea of workmen being given incentives to increase production is looked at askance by the pressure groups which dominate this Government, and they will not agree to incentive payments. In Russia, howver, outstanding workers are presented with badges, bronze medals and other prizes. The honorable member for Rind:marsh said yesterday that all governments find something good in what is being done in Russia, and no one will deny that they do, but conditions are different in Australia because the Government has yielded to the pressure Or which are demanding shorter hours and which are penalizing or blackmailing workmen who wish to work overtime. It seems to me that the members of this Government, the "stooges" of the Communists, have failed in their duty to the country by not declaring themselves to be in favour of incentives. Instead of giving a lead to the artisans and tradesmen of Australia they are compelled to listen to their masters and, to 4upp0rt what the pressure groups tell them they must support. When the -question of communism was debated luring the last parliamentary seadon, not one member of the Governccent declared himself. [Quorum formed.] The Government has built a Frankenstein, which is personified in its -centralization policy. We have men 30 years of age who actually state that they are looking forward to the day when they can draw the age pension. What the Government should be inculcating in the youth of this country is the spirit of adventure, which will breed the type of individual who pioneered Australia, who himself prepared for his old age and who aid, "I hope I shall never have to draw the pension ". I do not wish honorable members on the Gocern.ment side of the House to misunderstand my remarks. Ever since I have been a member of this Parliament I have supported the age pensioners, the needy and the widows, and I can believe that the Prime Ministei, like myself, is one of those who could quote what Ben .J'onson said when in the streets of London he saw a beggar. Jonson said, "There but 'for the race' of God goes Ben Jensen</para>

						<para>—I have quoted from both the opening and concluding remarks of the Prime Minister's budget speech. Between those quotations we have what is supposed to be the meat of the budget, if there be any meat in it.. It seems to me that the Prime Minister in the main has given us, to use the language of the dietician, a surfeit of carbohydrates: which make only for fatty degeneration, nstead of protein, which has the property of rejuvenating and replacing body tissues. If the Prime Minister asserts that there is meat in this budget, I must say that I am unable to find it myself. Nor can I find any intestinal fortitude in it at all. The Minister for Defence (Mr Dedman) has indicated that there is not much intestinal fortitude in this Government's policy for the defence of this country, but I shall deal with that later. This budget vitally affects the man in the street, the worker, the artist. the carpenter,. I personally think that the true position has been placed very abl. before the Parliament by the honor' able member for Reid (Mr. Lang). I believe that all honorable members on the Government side are painfully conscious of how mercilessly he has criticized the budget. From factual information he showed how little the £1 note can buy at the present time compared with its purchasing power before the last war. He failed to produce the normal manifestations of shame in members of the Government since they did not hang their heads, but he did shame them, as they acknowledged by the attitude of bravado with which they reacted to his speech. They brazened the whole thing out, because they knew that he was right on the target. They hoped that the public would know nothing about their activities and their propensity for catching votes by deceiving the workers of Australia. However, it remained for one of the female members of this Parliament, the honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), to shame the Government thoroughly. Under her courteous, yet incisive and merciless onslaught, members of this so-called Labour Government had the appearance of persons who had been slashed by a sword. I have never seen men so much shamed by a woman. They showed their shame by the whiteness of their gills and the manner in which they hung their heads.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>The Government is apprehensive because it knows that the people of Australia are well aware of what has been happening and how the Government has deceived them. I shall repeat a definition of the word "shame" which I mentioned in this chamber once before, and which was given by the Greek philosopher Aristophanes in the year 400 B.C. He said—</para>
					<quote>
						<para>Shame is an apprehension of a vision reflected front the surface of opinion, the opinion of the public.</para>
					</quote>
					<para>Aristophanes wrote a humorous play entitled q'j,,0 Frogs, a title which would fit the Government to-day. I wonder that the Government, or so-called Government, since it does not govern except by interference, does not ascertain what the people are thinking, and have been thinking since the end of 1945. Above all why does it not ascertain what the war widow is thinking, and those other widows who are in almost as poor circumstances as war widows? The widows are "fed up" with this Government, and well the Government knows it. Do these women go to work in uncongenial surroundings because they wish to? No, they go to work because they must do so in order to obtain sufficient money to keep their homes going. Do they share their houses with other families because they wish to do so? No, they share their homes because they must do so in order to pay the instalments on the duo date. Why are these instalments so overburdening? The answer is, because the cost of building has become so heavy. Why does not the Government mix with the people and find out what is happening, or ask its advisers for the information? The reason why building construction is so costly is because the Government has failed to control the Communists, who have forced a go-slow policy on Australian workers. What does a worker think when he sees his fellow worker going slow on the construction of homes for the people, as they are doing even in Canberra? Workers who wish to work their hardest must also slow down because they are afraid that otherwise their fellow workers might victimize them. The Prime Minister has confirmed his reputation for firmness. He has the firmness of a trap, the firmness of a python with a rabbit in its coils.</para>
					<para>An honorable member has interjected and asked 'when I joined "the party". I have joined the party of free men who may speak as their consciences dictate. Honorable members on the Government side of the committee dare not speak their minds, because their minds were made up for them in 1921 and again in 1924, when the Labour party platform 'was formulated. The shackles are still on their minds. In his remarkable speech, the honorable member for Reid (Mr. Lang) stated that the Government had been mesmerized by figures, and that the £1 had lost its value. I am repeating that statement so that the Government may hear it a second time. When the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden) spoke on the budget he was criticized by the honorable member for Fremantle (Mr. Beazley) for confounding himself, because he accused the Government of producing an inflationary budget while at the same time destroying the purchasing po'cr of workers' wages. If the honorable member for Fremantle had used a little cross-fertilization of mind, and taken into account the purchasing power of the £1, he would have agreed with the Leader of the Australian Country party entirely.</para>
					<para>I shall now turn to the defence, or lack of defence, of this country, and shall refer to the fine speech made by the honorable member for Darwin, in which she trounced the Government mercilessly and made Ministers hang their heads in shame under her fiery criticism. She said that the people were losing faith in the democratic system and even in the Parliament and in politicians, and were, above all, losing faith in the administrative services. I regard myself as -one who always speaks in defence of the public servant, even as one honorable member has just stated in an interjection, the bureaucrat. Bureaucrats are compelled by circumstances to be bureaucrats. Whenever this totalitarian, socialist Government fails it leaves its senior public servants to "carry the baby ". Senior public servants are compelled to be bureaucrats for the simple reason that Ministers refuse to accept the responsibilities of their office. The Government to-day has one obsession and one only. It preaches uniformity, uniformity and more uniformity! This is the nonsense school that has come to this centralized Parliament. If the Banking Bill had survived the test in the High Court it would have constituted, as it were, the first six-inch nail in the coffin of the body politic and the creation of the frankenstein monster would have been completed. Having been a public servant myself, 1. sympathize with the bureaucrats who serve this communistsocialist Government, and are compelled to take the responsibilities which their incompetent ministerial heads refuse to take. Undoubtedly, I could criticize a few public servants, but I pay tribute to very many of them. Members of this Government do not know their jobs. They are square pegs in round holes. They would not know a mine from a rabbit warren, Mitchell grass from spear grass, or a buffalo from an over-sized wombat. On every occasion they place the onus of responsibility on their senior public servants. I should perhaps at this stage indicate what I believe to be the solution of this problem. Everybody knows that I first cunie into the Parliament as a regionalist, bent upon doing my utmost to bring about decentralization. I was confident that sane government would continue in the Commonwealth sphere and that here we had the nucleus of the nation. Xy views have completely changed for the time being. I am no longer a regionalist. A good deal has been said in this chamber about the geographical re-subdivision of Australia, but what authority has been given to regions that have been established and given some form of self-government? They should be given sovereign powers to deal with their domestic affairs. The only way in which this nation can develop to the fullest extent of the inherent value of the soil is by the creation of new states, each with sovereign authority to control its own domestic policy. Every democratic person would support such a proposal. This Government, however, loves power too much to contemplate handing over sovereign powers to minor bodies. Its cry is for uniformity, uniformity and more uniformity. Its masters, the pressure groups outside the Parliament, dictate its policy of centralization. Ministers are mere "stooges" for their Communist dictators. The Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) and the rest of the intelligentsia of the Labour movement are merely being used by the Communists for the time being. They will be disowned when their work is done. The Communists will then take complete control of Australia. We must fight against this menace, and the best way to fight is by the establishment of new regions, or new states, each with control over its own domestic policy. Let us take away the sovereign powers from this gang of hombres that now controls the destiny of the nation. Australia, in common with many other countries, is turning towards totalitarianism, whether to the right or to the left. Pressure is exerted either by the big monopolies or by the Communists through their willing tools, the members of the Australian Labour party. Which of these pressure groups will triumph? The only way in which to fight them is by establishing new States and by vesting authority in many hands instead of in the hands of only one person. No public servant, if he be wise, desires to exercise sole authority. Wherever. possible committees should be established to assist senior public servants to discharge their functions. Consider for a moment how the concentration of authority in the hands of one man was responsible for the failure of the scheme for the settlement of ex-servicemen on the land in Western Australia. Mr. Panton, Minister for Lands in the Western Australian Labour Government, which preceded the McLarty Government, was an old friend of mine in the 51st Battalion, but he was responsible for the failure of the scheme simply because he refused to delegate authority to others. When the scheme failed he pushed the responsibility for its failure On to his senior officers. After the defeat of the Labour Government, the new Premier, Mr. McLarty, seeing clearly the fallacy of concentrating all authority in the hands of one man, immediately established a committee to assist the Minister for Lands and his officers. He regarded the scheme as too big for one man to handle. Every licensed surveyor from one end of Australia to the other agrees with him. Members of this Government, too, wish to retain all power in their hands; and they, too, shelve responsibility and invariably "pass the buck ", as Mr. Panton did in Western Australia. The Tasmanian Government, in its wisdom, has decided to adopt a scheme of regionalization, and it has chosen to direct the scheme one of the most brilliant planners that Australia has ever produced, the Queenslander, Mr. McInnes. I was privileged to servo my articles under Mr. McInnes in 1923. Apart from being a licensed surveyor he also passed the highest examination open to members of his profession. Before the war I suggested to the Government that it should employ him, but apparently Ministers thought that he was merely looking for a job and they promised to put his name on the list. The Tasmanian Government appointed Mr. McInnes as State planner and gave him full authority to go ahead with the regionalization scheme. When Mr. McInnes arrived in Hobart, however, he refused to accept the appointment on the ground that he did not wish to be made solely responsible. Imagine the Minister for Information (Mr. Calwell), who announced recently at Ashfleld that he loved power, refusing to accept supreme authority over anything! Mr. McInnes convinced the Premier of Tasmania, Mr. Cosgrove, that no person should have supreme authority, no matter what his qualifications may be. I mention this merely for the purpose of indicating that if Australia is to develop it must abandon the idea of centralized government and uniformity.</para>
					<para>Every Australian who has the welfare of his country at heart must be disturbed by events in Malaya and Indonesia. The failure of the Government satisfactorily to handle -the Indonesian situation is a disgrace to this great white continent in a yellow sea. Reporting on the efforts of the Indonesian Republic to combat communism, the Sydney Morning Herald. yesterday, published the following paragraphs:—</para>
					<quote>
						<para>Republican sources in Batavia say the Corninunists have between 3,000 and 4.000 troops in Madiun province. They are well armed, mainly with Japanese weapons.

					</quote>
					<para>It would be interesting to know what the Government intends to do about Australia's defence. The right honorable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes), in a fine speech last night on the defence of Australia, told how he had put youngsters into camp in 1911 and 3.912under the scheme that formed the basis of the Australian Imperial Force that went first to Gallipoli and then to France. I was one of them. The right honorable gentleman was criticized by people who do not like giving their services. The right honorable gentleman was then a member of the Labour party. How that party has deteriorated! I do not think the Government has the authority of its supporters to promote a defence policy. Its only policy is to rely on the United States of America and to hide in the funk bole of the guided weapons testing range, which is essentially a project of Great Britain. That and the "push-button" mechanized war are all that the Government can talk about. Labourites are frightened that they would lose votes if they asked young men to give up Saturday afternoons to military training. But young men are waiting to do so. From 1930, when the Scullin Labour Government,  many former members and supporters of which are still in this chamber, discontinued universal training, the Labour party has encouraged Australia's growing manhood to despise defence service and to regard uniforms as something to be ashamed of.</para>

						<para>—Of course it is. When World War II. broke out, thousands of men joined the Australian Imperial Force, but many more thousands, who had accepted the ideology of the new type of Labour party, refused to go anywhere near a military camp until they were called tip. We old "diggers" know the Labour party's hostility towards military service, particularly those of us who went into primary production after World War I. When the returned soldiers who had engaged in pineapple-growing sent their fruit to the Brisbane wharfs for shipment, it was thrown into the Brisbane River by Communists. No "digger" was game to wear his returned soldier badge in any big company, especially a liquor bar, because if he did so he would almost certainly be assaulted.</para>

						<para>—It happened, all right! The spirit of hatred of service and uniforms was inculcated into Australian youths from 1930 by the Labour party, and that had repercussions in 1939. Members of the Labour party must pull themselves together. They know the danger that exists. It is the duty of the Government to ensure that young men shall be imbued with the desire to serve in the defence of their country against the teeming hordes of Asia, who are bound to come against us, if not in our time very soon thereafter. I made a prophetic speech at the Darwin Town Hail in 1937, more than two years before war broke out. I pointed out the necessity for making Australia so strong that nobody would ever want to attack it, and said that only when other nations knew that to send a force hers, would be to commit suicide would we be safe. I exhort the Government to place on the statute-book a defence act worthy of Australians, a white people in yellow seas. I further said at Darwin on that occasion—</para>

					<quote>
						<para>There are several schools of thought about where the danger may come from.

					<para>How nearly was that brought about! We have Japan under control now, but for how long can we keep it under control? Pressure groups are operating in Asia and in Korea. Cut-throats and bandits are leading an uprising in Malaya. A Communist cell in Java has been established by Russia. A Communist cell operates in Darwin and controls the local newspaper. I demand that the Acting Attorney. General (Senator McKenna) immediately send to Darwin a section of the Commonwealth Investigation Service to overthrow the Communists in Darwin. The Minister for Works and Housing (Mr. Lemmon) conferred with those Communists recently. He knows that he was talking to Communists most of the time he was there. They did not introduce themselves to me when I was there last. They avoided me as they would a viper. I demand that in the interests of Australia's safety the Communist element in Darwin, which i.e our aerial meeting point with the wstern hemisphere, be kept under control, so that it shall be prevented from linking up with the Communist cell in Indonesia. We must establish a protective screen throughout the archipelago of islands to the north of Australia— through Singapore, Borneo, New Guinea and the Solomons.</para>

					<para>—There is much that I could say in commendation and amplification of this excellent budget, and in condemnation and refutation of the remarks of the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden) and others in their somewhat feeble criticism of it. However, I intend to 4cvote myself tonight to the Government's defence policy as related to the budget. But first, I propose to deal with one important item about which the Leader of the Australian Country party misled the House. He said that at Geneva I had been responsible for reducing the preferences enjoyed by the United Kingdom in the Australian market. That statement was utterly false. If the right honorable gentleman had followed the course of those negotiations, lie would know that the bargaining between the United Kingdom and the United States of America tdok place quite separately from the negotiations at which the representatives of Australia were present. The United Kingdom did agree to forgo some of the preferences which it enjoyed in the Australian market. In return for those concessions, the Government of the United Kingdom hoped to obtain certain benefits, and neither I, nor any other member of the Australian delegation, or of the Australian Government, had anything to do with the matter. While I am on this subject of preferences, iiiay I direct the attention of the House to the following statement which appeared in to-day's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald: -</para>

						<para>Honorable members opposite must accept the truth. The plain fact is that, under the Ottawa Agreement, the United Kingdom enjoys free entry for certain of its goods to the Australian market. That is free trade, but similar goods imported from foreign countries are subject to a tariff. The Leader of the Opposition said, according to the report in the Sydney Morning Herald, that free trade in the Empire was not worth talking about. I can imagine the Leader of the Australian Country party exclaiming, as he did once before, "Another. stab in the back! ".</para>

					<para>To-night, however, I wish to devote most of my attention to defence matters. The deputy leader of the Opposition made a three-point attack on the budget. His first point was that taxation should be further reduced. His second was that a more positive and comprehensive defence plan should be prepared. In amplifying the second point, he said that Australian expenditure on defence, as provided for in the budget, was not nearly enough. Thus, in one breath the honorable member asked for a reduction of taxation, and in the next he demanded increased expenditure on defence. He quoted from certain remarks made by Field Marshal Lord Montgomery. I propose to quote something which the Field Marshal said at a meeting in Adelaide. He declared that the strength of a nation lay in the following five things :—</para>

						<para>A strong national character.</para>

					<para>That is the end of a quotation taken verbatim from the Sydney Daily Telegraph. The Australian defence plan, for which this budget makes provision, is based on the very points mentioned by Field Marshal Lord Montgomery. The deputy leader of the Opposition chided me for having said that there was no prospect of war for some years to come. Well in making that remark, I was in excellent company. I pray to God I was right. Field Marshal Lord Montgomery said, in similar circumstances—</para>

					<para>I propose to read part of the amendment moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Harrison), to dissect it, and try to find out just what the honorable gentleman meant by it. That part of the amendment which relates to defence is as follows :—</para>
					<quote>
						<para>That the first item be reduced by £1 as an inFtruction to the Government to withdraw and redraft the budget ... in order that, in view of the present grave and tnisettled world conditions, a more comprehensive and positive defence plan commenSurate with the security of Australia may be prepared.</para>

					<para>I shall first deal with the question of defence in relation to the present international situation. Our war-time enemies, which were great powers, were disarmed after their defeat. The enemy countries are now occupied by allied forces. Although it has not been possible up to the present to conclude peace treaties providing controls and guarantees against the resurgence of Germany and Japan, it is obvious that the present unsettled condition of the world is not due to any menace from those countries. The three great powers left in the world are the allies who were victorious in the recent war—the British Commonwealth of Nations, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. All of them made great sacrifices in men and money during the war, and, in proportion to their resources, the United Kingdom, as the principal partner in the British Commonwealth of Nations, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, suffered most. The United States of America, by reason of its vast resources, is now by far and away the leading power in the world. It is also the sole possessor of a stock of atomic bombs. We read in the Scripture—</para>

					</quote>
					<para>Whether or not the Bible is read in Russia these days I feel certain that the truth expressed in the verse I have just quoted is being given deep consideration by those who direct the destinies of that country. While, on a short-term view. the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics may be in an advantageous military position in Europe, one must recognize. on taking the long-term view, that the position would be vastly different once the forces of the great democracies were fully arrayed. It is interesting to compare the present world situation with that of 1939. Germany had suffered no great damage in the first World War. It had had 21 years in which to re-arm. It had, in fact, the best-equipped army and air force in the world. Germany had in Italy, its satellite, an ally possessing a not insignificant navy, as well as army of some size. Away in the Pacific. Japan, under the domination of an ideology 'similar to that of the nazis, had a navy equal in size to that of the United Kingdom, and its land forces were not to be despised. That was the situation in 1939. In this year of peace 1948, the Australian Government has provided in the budget an amount of £87,000,000 for defence. What did the Opposition provide for defence in the budget of the 8th September, 1939, when it held the reins of government, and when Great Britain stood alone against the might of Germany? At a time when it was uncertain where the United States of America would stand, when it was not clear on which side Russia would fight. when the Empire was already at war, the best the government of the day, drawn from the parties now in Opposition, were prepared to do was to provide £35,000,000 for the defence of tli country. They were so smugly selfsatisfied in 139 that they permitted 250,000 people. whom they could have used to prepare for the defence of the country, to remain unemployed. The amount of £37,000,000 provided in this budget for defence is in addition to a further £112,000,000 provided under the heading "Defence and Post-war Charges ", so that the total provision under the two headings is no less than £199,000,000. The amount of £87,000,000 to be devoted exclusively to defence and allied services represents Lii 3s. per head of population, as cornpared with a provision of £5 per head for the same purpose in 1939-40. In Canada and New Zealand, the corresponding budget provisions last year for the same purposes were £6 lOs. and £9 lOs. a bead respectively.</para>
					<para>The amount of the defence vote is a matter for government decision and responsibility, having regard to its judgment of the international position, the provision to be made for other charges on the budget, and the taxation that should be imposed. in a democracy it is axiomatic that defence policy must be compatible with the maintenance of a balanced economy, n ot only because it makes heavy demands on national resources in man-power and materials, but also because, to be successful, it must have its roots in healthy social econoni ic conditions. Never in all the history of Australia was a defence policy so firmly rooted in }iealt.hy social and economic conditions as is this Government's present defence policy. The relation between defence and time national economy is well illustrated in the following statement on Canadian defence policy, which applies equally to Australia—</para>
					<quote>
						<para>The organization that is now being evolved was planned with the following concepts in mind. Canada is a vast country with great natural resources, but a relatively small population. Its people are genuinely interested, not only in remaining at peace themselves, but also in doing what they can to promote world peace. Should anotlar war ever occur, Canada will not light alone but only as one of it larger group of democratic powers. It therefore follows that the aim of our whole defence organization must be to make an adequate contribution to preparations for the d'femmce of freedom with the least possible diversion of effort and resource..; from time peaceful developwent of the country. This cam, best be done by having a small highly skilled minclens that is concerned with plaimnimig for defence and for keeping the defensive resources of the country in mm suitable state of preparedness.</para>

					<para>At the conference of Prime Ministers held in London in 1946, the Prime Minister of Australia expressed the willingness of this country to make a larger contribution to the defence of the British Commonwealth in the Pacific. The corollary to this offer was the acceptance by Australia of the responsibility for developing this country as a main support base in the Pacific. This relates not only to the provision of the armed forces but also to participation in the strategic development and distribution of the resources and population of the British Commonwealth. The method to he adopted in order to achieve that objective is by strengthening the economy of Australia, and increasing its population. The Government's success in attracting capital to this country for the development of secondary indtustlies, and in obtaining migrants under the policy so ably conducted by the Minister for Immigration (Mr. Calwell). are well known everywhere.</para>
					<para>:ao'ever, it would be quite contradictory to pursue a policy of developing Australia as a main support area by the expansion of industry and population, while retarding the economy by with drawing a large proportion of the manpower for continuous military training for several months a year. It is important to note in passing that, at the meeting of the Defence Council last Tuesday, the Government's military advisers expressed the opinion that they preferred the present militia system to a reversion to the limited periods of training of a large body of men in accordance with the universal training provisions of the Defence Act. Therefore, it is quite misleading to assess Australian's defence policy solely in terms of the proposed strength of the forces. The development of Australia by increased man-power and   material resources, as accepted by the Prime Minister at the London Conference in 1946, will provide a constantly growing capacity to enable us to bear a greater share of the burden of British Commonwealth defence. A considered balance must he maintained between the needs or the defence of the country, and the requirements of the national economy as a whole. Confirmation of the adaqnacy of the present financial provision  is indicated by the fact that it was not physically possible, under present economic conditions, for the departments concerned to expend more than £30,000,000 of the £37.000,000 voted to them last year. Defence is a matter of what is physically possible as well a of what is financially practicable. The services and departments concerned have been given a guaranteed programme involving the expenditure of £50,000,000 during a five-year period, in order to achieve the objectives which they have submitted and of which the Government has approved.</para>
					<para>The next matter with which I shall deal is the demand by the Acting Leader of the Opposition for a "more comprehensive and positive defence plan ". Just what the honorable gentleman meant by the word "positive ", I do not know. It i curiously reminiscent of Communist jargon. However, when outlining the Government's post-war defence programme last year, I referred to time fact that the growth of a scheme of collective security under the United Nations would necessarily be slow, and that, in the meantime, reliance must be placed upon co-operation in British Commonwealth defence, and in the last resort, upon the forces than can be raised in an emergency to provide for the inherent right of individual self defence which is prescribed in the charter. It is undeniable that great advances in co-operation in British Empire defence have been made by Labour governments in Australia. For instance, the Fisher Government decided to establish the Royal Australian Navy, and to organize the defence forces on a basis in harmony with growing national aspirations and stature. Another Labour Prime Minister, the late John Curtin, put forward proposals in 1944 for the improvement of machinery for British co-operation which, had they been accepted; would have enabled an. overall plan for Empire defence to be developed. The present Prime Minister, at the London Conference in 1946, stated that, in the absence of such an over-all plan as the late Mr. Curtin had proposed, the only possibility of developing co-operation in Empire defence was on a regional basis. He added, that in the future, Australia must make a larger contribution towards the defence of the British Commonwealth, that that could be best done in the Pacific theatre. and that the approach to a common scheme of defence for these areas in question should be by agreement between the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia and, when possible, with the United States of America, and perhaps later with other countries with possessions in that area. Those views were fully endorsed by the United Kingdom and New Zealand governments. Under that agreement, the United Kingdom and New Zealand have now joint service representatives and staffs accredited to the Defence Department in Australia, and strategic planning for defence has been commenced by the Australian joint service machinery in association with the overseas representatives. Reciprocal arrangements have been made for the Australian Government to be represented in the higher defence machinery of the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Never previously has machinery of this nature been established in Australia, or between the United Kingdom and any of the Dominions, for the planning of common defence measures. That machinery has been created on the initiative of t,h Australian Labour Government.</para>
					<para>The plans for British Empire cooperation are not merely plans on paper. The assumption by Australia of the responsibility for a greater share of the burden of British Commonwealth defence in the Pacific is demonstrated by the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. The supply and maintenance of the force, the original strength of which was 35,000, have been undertaken through Australian channels. under Australian direction and administration, and largely from Australian resources. The original order of battle for the force provided for 32. per cent. of it being Australian, whilst the remainder consisted of contingents from the United Kingdom, India and New Zealand. Approximately 75 per cent. of the present strength of the force is Australian. For certain reasons. the soundness of which the sovereign go ernments concerned are the sole judges, the Indian contingent has been withdrawn, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom contingent is almost complete, and the withdrawal of the New Zealand contingent is now proceeding. Those withdrawals have resulted in an increase of the Australian percentage of the total strength in the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, and in the near future, the whole of that force will be of Australian composition. We recognize that Great Britain has onerous responsibilities in other parts of the world, and the Australian Government has accepted the major share of the responsibility of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in order to render some relief, in keeping with the special responsibility that it is assuming in the Pacific.</para>
					<para>The next direction in which the Government has assumed a substantial corninitment for co-operation in British Commonwealth defence is in defence research and development. The policy of the Australian Government is to take all steps within the capacity of the nation to provide the most modern equipment for our forces. To avoid a wasteful dispersion of effort, the joint policy of the United Kingdom and Australian Governments is to direct activity as far as possible to those projects which, ultimately, are expected to have the greatest effect upon the future conduct of war. Accordingly, an amount of £33,500,000 has been included in the five-year programme for research and development in pursuance of the policy of undertaking a greater share of the British Commonwealth cooperation in defence. The long range weapons project which is being undertaken jointly by the United Kingdom and Australia, is the main item in the research and development programme. A statement by one honorable member that that project is entirely a British plan is not correct. The long range weapons project will increase the capacity of Australia to defend itself with the latest weapons. That is important in view of our small man-power resources and our large territory. The Australian Governinent is giving to this project the highest priority in its works and other requirements, and although there has been a slight lag in the expenditure on works in connexion with the plan, the lag has not been of such a degree as to interfere with the final programme of trials. Other research activities deal with the development and design of aircraft. Various projects relate to armament and other war material which, on account of security requirements, I caniiot describe them in detail. Action is being taken to give civilian scientists training in the United Kingdom in defence research. Last April, we had very useful discussions on aspects of defence science with Sir Ben Lockspieser, chief scientist of the United Kingdom Ministry of Supply. The Government has invited Sir Henry Tizard, Chairman of the Defence Research Policy Advisory Committee in the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, to visit Australia for consultations next November. I submit that the Opposition case for a more comprehensive and positive defence plan fails completely when applied to the Government's policy on defence research and development, which is the No. 1 priority in Empire defence.</para>

						<para>I propose to give some information on that aspect. The strength of the Permanent Naval Forces to be achieved by the end of the five year programme is 14,753, compared with 5,264 in 1939. The strength on the 30th June last, which marked the conclusion of the first year of the programme, was 10,676. Certain steps have been taken to remedy the shortage of personnel. The trained recruiting staffs have been increased, the upper age limit has been raised, and the educational standard has been lowered. The recruitment of 1,000 ex-Royal Navy ratings in the United Kingdom is also being sought. It is anticipated that 400 of these ratings will arrive in Australia shortly on Kanimbla. The naval plan originally envisaged that the first aircraft carrier would he commissioned in June, 1948, and arrive in Australia approximately in December, 1948. Unfortunately, there has been some delay in commissioning the vessel and it is not due to arrive until March, 1949. That is due to. circumstances over which this Government has no control. The establishment of the air station at Nowra is proceeding, and will be completely ready when the first aircraft carrier group arrives in March, 1949.</para>

					<para>Dealing with the naval construction programme, two "Battle" class destroyers, H.M.A.S. Tobruk and H.M.A.S. Anzac, were launched during the last twelve months. The naval programme envisages the construction of four additional destroyers of the "Daring" class, two at Cockatoo and two at Williamstown. The provision of two aircraft carriers and the other increases of the strength of the Royal Australian Navy to which I have referred are contributions to the naval strength of the British Commonwealth of Nations as well as to our own defence. The United Kingdom Government expressed its appreciation of the Australian Government's decision to obtain the aircraft carriers in the following terms:—</para>

					<para>The fact that the personnel strength of the Navy is double that of 1939 and that the Government is taking steps to increase the number of ships and to maintain naval shipbuilding resources provides a further satisfactory answer to the alleged need for a more comprehensive defence plan with regard to the navy.</para>
					<para>I propose now to deal with the Army. The plan provides for a total post-war strength of 19,000 for the Permanent Forces and 50,000 for the Citizen Forces. The present numbers of full-time duty personnel in the Regular Army and the Interim Army are 1.1,000 and 9,300 respectively, making a total of 20,300, compared with the pre-war strength of 3,900. Critics of the Government's policy in relation to land forces should examine carefully the roles which I outlined for the post-war army in a statement that I made to the Parliament last year. I said then that the first role was to provide the forces which might be required to fulfil a possible future commitment to the United Nations, including regional arrangements in the Pacific. That would entail that at least a proportion of the troops should be permanently employed, trained to a high standard and at a high degree of readiness. Nothing else would suffice for that role, because quick action might be necessary in an emergency in those areas. I said that the second role for the army was to participate in arrangements for co-operation in British Commonwealth defence. The forces required for that role would be similar to those required to fulfil a commitment to the United Nations. I said that the third role for the army was to provide the basic organization for expansion in time of war. That must be related to the authoritative view as to where the initial battles are most likely to be fought. In niy opinion, it is impossible to believe that that role would demand a large army. We must be completely realistic about this matter. The Prime Minister said recently that it was well known that if war were to break out in Europe tomorrow the forces of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics could sweep across Europe to the English Channel. If that happened, where would Australia be able to deploy the large forces that honorable members opposite want to raise by compulsory military training? Would the Opposition send them to the Continent of Europe to be annihilated as the Russians swept forward? Would they send them to the United Kingdom. which already has sufficient men under arms to defend itself? Where would the honorable gentlemen desire to send these forces?</para>
					<para>The Leader of the Australian Country party devoted only one sentence of his speech to the question of defence. A notable feature of the debate in fact, is that, so far, the only honorable members opposite who have had the temerity to claim that universal military training should be introduced are those who would be on the back benches if the Opposition parties were to occupy the treasury bench. Not one of their leaders has made it plain to the Parliament and the country that he is at this stage in favour of calling up large numbers of our young men and training them under a scheme for universal military training. I believe that our su?ccess in war would depend largely upon the industrial and economic resources that were available in Australia to produce the requirements of modern armed forces, if a reasonably short period of universal service were adopted, it would lead to the formation of a large army of partially trained and equipped men. Much of the money that is available for defence would be devoted to that purpose and would not be available for essential developments in the other services, scientific research, and the development of our secondary industries. I maintain that the system of universal service is inappropriate to the country's present need. If the Government introduced national service with a restricted period of training in this country, it would be accused of preparing not for the last war but for the one before it. At the meeting of the Defence Council on Tuesday last, our military advisers stated as their considered opinion that they preferred the present plan to one under which universal military training would be introduced. The fourth role for the land forces is the local defence of the mainland of Australia. I suggest that if honorable members opposite carefully study these roles they will be convinced that the present plan is that which is best suited to Australia's needs. I am informed that, having regard to the commitments in Japan, it would be physically impossible for the Army authorities to deal with the large numbers of men who would be called up under the Opposition's plan for compulsory military training in Australia. it is both illogical and unsound to demand a more comprehensive and positive plan in relation to our land forces when the Army is not able to put into effect the one that is provided for it by this programme.</para>
					<para>All. units planned for the Permanent Air Force of sixteen operational squadrons and ancillary units have been formed and are now either at their permanent locations or in Japan. The fighter wing is based in Japan, and plans for its return to Australia are being considered. A fighter squadron in excess of the forces provided for by the plan is also in Japan. A general reconnaissance squadron planned to be based at Townsville has not yet been established. The strength of the Royal Australian Air Force to be achieved at the end of the five years is 13,000. The strength on the 30th June, 1948, was 8,000, compared with a prewar strength of 3,500. I understand that the average monthly intake of new recruits during the last three months has been satisfactory. All units of the Royal Australian Air Force have their full complement of aircraft. The bomber wing is being completely re-armed with Lincoln aircraft as they become available from local production. The fighter wing is equipped with Mustang aircraft. The provision of modern jet-engined fighters, manufactured in Australia, is already well under way. The transport wing is at present equipped with Dakotas. Part of the wing is now taking part in the air lift to Berlin. Reserves of aircraft of every kind are available. They are held in various categories of storage for use as required. For security reasons I do not propose to mention the number of aircraft that is held in reserve. The reserve, however, exceeds both in quantity and quality that which existed in 1939, when the Opposition parties were in power. I regret that I have not time to deal with the supply aspects of the defence programme and that I must pass on to general conclusions in relation to the adequacy of the programme as a whole. The amendment before the committee refers to "a more comprehensive and positive defence plan ". I have shown that our plans in relation to all aspects of defence are comprehensive and positive, that our permanent military forces are much larger than they were in 1939, that the strength of the Navy is double what it was in 1939, and that the strength of the Air Force is more than double what it was in 1039. The total number of permanent and full-time men in all the services new is 39,000, compared with 12,600 in 1939. I submit that the plans that have been put forward by the Government are both comprehensive and positive. On this point, as on all other points, the amendment must fail completely.</para>

					<para>We have listened to a very senior Minister, the Minister for Defence and the' Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) (Mr. Dedman) explaining the so-called I defence policy of Australia. He took the characteristic line of every member who speaks on the Government side, which is that the Government can do no wrong,. and that everything it does is perfect. He opened his speech with a misrepresentation, 'which characterized the remainder of the speech. He sought to suggest that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies), who is at present overseas, had supported his own view upon the destruction of Imperial preference, by quoting the right honorable gntleman's statement that free trade in the Empire was not worth talking about. Even a child with an elementary knowledge of English and of the history of trade relations within the Empire would know perfectly well that what the Leader of the Opposition was speaking about was the need for the development, by the various parts of the Empire, of their own separate economy. Either the Minister knew that that was what the right honorable gentleman was speaking about or he did not know it. If he knew it he misrepresented the position. If he did not know it, he showed his abysmal ignorance of affairs of state.</para>
				</talk.start>
				<para>He outlined to the Parliament what he described as a defence programme magnificent in concept and brilliant in execution, and yet there is no force in this country that could defend anything. He spent half his time in destroying his own argument. On the one hand he asked what there was to fear in this country. He stated that Australia's eliemies had been laid low and that Russia was the only country which, it could be suggested, could attack us. He suggested it could not or would not attack us. On the other hand, he said our defence forces should not be sent off overseas to Europe. If his arguments on both counts are correct. there i no need for any defence force at all, and I am rather inclined to think that that is his policy. The real truth is that the Labour party is approaching the problems of defence in exactly the same manner now as it approached them in 1939, when it constituted the Opposition in this chamber. We always hear a great deal from the Government side of what happened in 1939. 1 shall inform honorable members, before I resume my seat, of somethings that were said and done in 1939 by the Labour party. At the moment I shall direct my attention first to the general nature of the Government's defence programme, and I shall quote shortly the comments of two outstanding men on thatprogramme. It is significant that. when one examines the defence pro grain-me, one can reach only one conclusion, which is that the defence plan of the Government is purely a compromise. How else can it be explained that the Government proposes to expend thu sum of £62,500,000 on the army over period of five years, and, strange to say. precisely the same amount on the Royal Australian Air Force? In 'addition, the defence programme provides for an ezpenditure of £75,000,000 on the Royal Australian Navy. It is quite obvious to any one with any experience of the armed forces of this country, that this programme is nothing more than an unhappy compromise. It was on that particular ground that the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Harrison),- among others, moved his amendment. The Opposition does not regard this question as a mere matter, of figures. It seems to. me that the Minister for Defence is solely concerned with figures, but the Opposition is moriconcerned with realities. Among other things, the Minister stated that there were 11,000 Australian soldiers in the occupation force in Japan, but he does not appear to know the exact number. When the relief of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force commenced on the 15th October, 1946, the strength of Australian troops in Japan was 9,829. On the 4th August this year, the strength of the force was not 11,000 as the Minister has said, but it was 5,384. The Minister does not know anything about the defence forces he controls. Out of the total number of Australian troops in Japan, only 750 men are combat troops. We have no real troops in Australia itself. Any one who has had contact with the Royal Australian Air Force knows very well that Australia could not put more than four sqnadron into the air tomorrow, and yet the Minister makes the pretence that our defence forces are in proper shape. Perhaps he believes that. I do not mind which it is dnee pretence would indicate dishonesty and belief would indicate ignorance. Let toe toll the committee and the people of Australia as I promised to do what two individuals whose reputation, as far as military affairs are concerned, stands far above that of the Minister for Defence, have to say on this subject.</para>
				<para>The first authority I shall quote is General Sir Thomas Blarney. Whatever the Government may say now about him, the fact remains that it was glad to shelter under his wing during the perilous days of the war. He led this country to victory, and during the fiddle East campaign was brought back and sent to New Guinea to retrieve the difficult situation there, which be did with success. He knows more about warfare than all the honorable members Of this Parliament put together. In the Sydney Sun, of the</para>

				</quote>
				<para>Those views came from the Commanderin- Chief of the Australian forces during the war. Yet the Minister for Defence would have the people believe that there is no room for criticism in respect of this magnificent defence scheme evolved. I suppose, by himself.</para>
				<para>The second authority whom I shall quote is Air Vice-Marshal Bostock, a gentleman of whom I have had some experience. We produced, in Australia, no greater leader in the air than Air Vice-Marshal Bostoek. The fact that he worked in the closest co-operation with the Americans and the experience he thereby obtained gives him the highest qualifications in this country in respect of air force questions—certainly as eminent as those of any man in the Permanent Air Force. This is what he said—</para>

Only when American aid to the tune of about 70 squadrons reached us were we able to turn the tide in New Guinea. Yet that lesson seems to have been ignored and we are to depend in future on an air force of a little more than half the strength of that which the initial Japanese onslaught in 1941 destroyed. it was a grim outlook.</para>

				<para>The people of this country will accept the opinion of these two experts in preference to that of the Minister in respect of the value of the Government's defence programme. The Opposition is not concerned with the money involved, but with the necessity for a sound plan. We have not yet heard from the Minister a plan designed to fit in with imperial defence or even with one designed for the adequate defence of this country. As in every debate, speakers pn the Government side take us back over the years. That has been characteristic of the tactics of the Labour Government over the past six or seven years. It tells the people of this country what great warriors the members of the Government were in 1939 and during the war, and how then finally led this country to a magnificent victory. They always draw attention, as this Minister has done, to past years, instead of dealing with the problem of to-day. So that the people will not be misled, it is necessary for me also to go back over the years, but it will not take me long. In 1930 this Laboui party which now pretends to be the sole repository of military wisdom, terminated during an administration under the Prime Ministership of the right honorable member for Yarra, Mr. Scullin, the compulsory training scheme in Australia. It closed down Duntroon Military College and Jervis Bay Naval Station and put a complete end to the military organization and training in Australia at that time. Then we come to the period immediately preceding 1939. Those of us who were in the Parliament then do not require to refer to Hansard to refresh our memories, because we remember that at the time when the Liberal Government sought to increase the defences of this country, meagre as they were, it bad to do so in the face of bitter opposition from the Labour party which then formed the Opposition. Let me tell honorable members what was said in 1938 by a man whose memory I very much respect and who then led the Labour party. I refer to the late John Curtin, and I quote his words because they clearly express the policy of the Labour party at that time. I refer to volume 157 of Parliamentary Debates, which contains a report of a debate which occurred on a motion of want of confidence moved by the then Leader of the Labour Opposition on 2nd November, 1938. That was after the Munich crisis, and I ask honorable members to remember that, those on the Labour side of the chamber were always wise about the Munich crisis and always anticipated Nazi aggression, or so they would have us believe now. But the truth is that they revealed then the same "pussyfoot" attitude as they reveal now. They said then as they say now, "There is no danger ". Here is what Mr. Curtin as the spokesman of the Labour party said less than a year before the outbreak of war—</para>
				<quote>
					<para>Defence expenditure must depend entirely upon the conditions which prevail in the world from time to time. Obviously that must be the position. 1 say that any increase of defence expenditure after the Munich Pact so far as Australia is concerned appears to me to be an utterly unjustifiable and hysterical piece of panic propaganda.</para>
				</quote>
				<para>The honorable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) interjected to the effect that the Government was asking for a policy of "mark your own ticket" in respect of defence, as indeed it was, because it was seeking to prepare the defences of Australia. Mr. Curtin then went on to say—</para>
				<quote>
					<para>That is so; they marked their own ticket, but they have now discarded that ticket in order to write a new ticket, much larger in volume, and I venture to say, not sufficiently justified to this Parliament or to the people. I believe that the greater part of this hysteria is base:l merely on a desire to provide a background for political maenuvring.</para>
				</quote>
				<para>That was stated by the leader of the Labour party, the same party which now wants the people to believe that the present Opposition failed in its duty when it was the Government in 1939. The real truth is that not only before the outbreak of World War II. but also after it, one Labour member after another expressed views in opposition to arming the country. I shall read to the committee statementi made in this chamber by members on the Labour side at that time, some of whom are still honorable members of this Parliament. The present Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Holloway) said on the 3rd November, 1938—</para>
				<quote>
					<para>Time Government is expending much too rapidly on defence.</para>

				<para>Much too rapidly! Now honorable members opposite ask why we did not prepare the country before 1939. The honorable gentleman continued—</para>
				<quote>
					<para>It is making plans for more than the adequate defence of Australia. I make no excuse for saying that.</para>
				</quote>
				<para>He would not make any excuses then, but in the meantime the story has changed, for it preaches falsely day in and day out that the Labour party was the great defender of this country. Another honorable gentleman distinguished for his outstanding strategic knowledge is the Minister for Transport (Mr. Ward) Listen to what he said at that time—</para>

				<para>In November, 1939, even after the, war had commenced, when one would have thought that, unless the honorable gentleman shared the ideology of a few people in this country who regarded the war as an imperialistic war, he would have held different views, he said—</para>

					<para>Instead of carrying on this stupid conflict, an effort should be made at the earliest moment to summon a conference of the major nations for the purpose of ending it.</para>

				<para>This is the crew who would have people believe that they are, and were, the great defenders of this country. These are the people who claim to have steered the barque to victory. They have said time and time again that we left the country defenceless. Let me quote the words of the late Mr. Curtin when he took office in 1941. Prior to assuming office Mr. Curtin had been a member of the War Council. He knew the developments that had taken place overseas and from October, 1940, onwards, he fully endorsed the defence plans of the then Government. When the Labour Government which succeeded the Menzies Government knew that the fruit of our labours was ripe to be plucked, they grabbed the treasury benches. Every one now knows that you cannot start from "taws" and produce aeroplanes within three or four months, Mr. Curtin said—</para>

				<para>The Empire Air Training Scheme was one of the most magnificent schemes ever conceived for the defence of the Empire; but we hear very little of it now. Mr. Curtin continued—</para>
				<quote>
					<para>The equipment of the Air Force had also been much improved. Finally, munitions production and the development of production capacity over a wide range of classes, including aircraft, was growing weekly.</para>
				</quote>
				<para>Is it not about time the Labour party gave up misleading the people into believing that we had failed in our duty, that the Labour Government had to come to the rescue of the country and that its efforts resulted in victory?</para>
				<para>Let us now give some consideration to the real problems of defence that face this country. Apparently the Minister for Defence can see no reason for altering the Government's defence plan which was made long ago. Although in Great Britain there has been a quickening and a rapid increase of the defence programme, and although re-armament is taking place in the United States of America, nothing of the kind is being done here because the Minister for Defence cannot be persuaded that there is any reason to alter the magnificent plan which was apparently conceived in his brain. On the 30th March last, after his return from overseas, the Minister said—</para>
				<quote>
					<para>From knowledge I have gained from my two recent trips abroad there will be no war within the next few years. Nothing has occurred in Europe or elsewhere to cause time Federal Government to think its five years' £200,000,000 defeiice plan should be altered in any way.</para>
				</quote>
				<para>Earlier in the same month there had been the coup in Czechoslovakia. From that time onward we have seen aggression after aggression, with the lights of liberty going out again, not only in Europe, but also throughout the world. Apparently, these events do not arouse the attention of this Government. Ministers would have us believe that nothing has taken place within the last six month which should alter the Government's defence plan one iota. It does not satisfy me to be told that the Defence Council has been called together and that it has not suggested any alteration of the plan. tt is stupid to characterize those who talk about preparation for war as warmongers. An obligation is placed upon us to face up to our rcrponsibilit.ies. We must be prepared to meet the danger that threatens us if war should unhappily come about. No man, vonian or abila can view with anything but the greatesi unhappiness the possibility of another war; but that does not relieve us of the responsibility of doing everything possible to ensure that if war does come we shall be prepared to meet it. The world to-day is in two mammoth camps, and no matter how peaceful we may be we cannot but view with alarm the possibility of Russia making a thrust down through the Malayan archipelago to the very fringes of Australia. Are we to close our eyes and say that what we planned twelve months ago is good 6nough to-day? It seems to me that considering the dangers that confront this country, there is every justification for the amendment proposed by the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Harrison) and that it should receive the approval of every person in this country whose mind is not completely biased by party prejudice.</para>
				<para>My only concern is to see that a proper defence plan is evolved. Let us consider what possible attack we may be subjected to and what plan we can make to meet it. Our prime duty is to defend this country. That does not mean, as we have said on more than one occasion, that we must plan to defend it inside our own shores. It is preferable to keep the thrust from reaching Australia. We can best defend Australia at its periphery. That was the view we held before World War II., and we have held the view constantly ever since. That, however, is not the view of the Australian Labour party and never was its view until very late in World War Ii., and it was accepted then, though with qualification only, because it was thrust upon the party by the weight of circumstances and events. What defences have we to meet a possible thrust? We are told that something is to be provided at Manus l:siaid. From information that has conic to me I know little about Manus Island. Our defences at Manus Island constitute a very poor show. One of the greatest mistakes this Government ever made was to refuse to accept the offer of a great nation with powerful installations on Manus .Island to retain a naval base there. That offer was rejected on the ground that we should not give away territory. Whatever we may have given away there would have been more than compensated for by the security afforded by a naval base of a great and powerful nation lying in the direction from which possible attack upon our country could come.</para>
				<para>Too many Ministers are dealing with this problem of defence. The Minister for Defence and three subordinate Ministers all share in it. A set-up of that type can only lead to compromise and to constant struggles between the service departments for more funds. That compromise is revealed in the budget figures. I would like the speaker who is to follow me to obtain from the Ministar for Defence an explanation as to how it came about that the amount of money provided under the five-year plan for the Army is the exact equivalent Qf that allotted to the Royal Australian Air Force. When two branches of the forces, whose role and method.- of operation are entirely different, are given exactly the same financial provision, it is impossible to reconcile the fact with any other hypothesis than that the defence programme is merely a compromise. Our defence plan should be based on advice given by men who fought in World War II. and whose services are still available to the nation. On Tuesday night the Minister for the Army (Mr. Chambers) made a pitiable, befogged and sentimental approach to this serious problem. The honorable gentleman said that he was praying for peace. While we all pray for peace, the Minister's deplorably weak utterances took us back to the drivelling attitude that was so characteristic of Labour members during the period antecedent to 1039. Honorable members opposite are displaying the same pacifist mentality that they exhibited in the days before 1939. When we say that the only way to meet aggression is to prepare against it, we enunciate what is the simplest of all truths in modern life. None of us wants war, but we must prepare to defend ourselves should war come upon us. Let us examine some aspects of the Government's defence plan as we know it. Let us consider first the Army. There can be no proper conception of any defence plan unless it be one which involves the principle that with the privileges of citizenship go the obligations of citizenship. Since we have heard so much of what Field Marsha] Lord Montgomery has said let me, also, quote a recent statement of that great soldier. Speaking of the British Army as recently as the 18th August last, Field Marshal Lord Montgomery said—</para>
				<quote>
					<para>Without a strong territorial army there can be no national army and no national cdurity.</para>
				</quote>
				<para>That corresponds with the militia forces in this country and is particularly what honorable. members on this side of the chamber are concerned about. Field Marshal Lord Montgomery continued—</para>
				<quote>
					<para>Every man awl woman in Brit%in should understand that if the territorial army fails their homes. frceiom and way of life will be In the greatest danger if we are attacked.</para>
				</quote>
				<para>Every word of that applies with equal force to this country. The statement proceeds—</para>
				<quote>
					<para>The territorial army under post-war reorganization is intended to provide a basis for the extension of the national army in the ,,vent of war.</para>
					<para>It is planned to consist of infantry armed and airborne divisions and a nucleus of heavy. equipment units, which would be uneconomic for a small regular force to maintain in peace time.</para>
				</quote>
				<para>That is precisely what Australia needs. If people who say we do not stand for universal training mean that we do not stand for annually calling up men willy-nilly as they reach army age into the ranks, thereby damaging our industrial economy, they are quite right, but if they mean that we are not prepard to call up annually from each age group by ballot, sufficient men to provide a trained reserve, they are quite wrong. 1 cannot understand how the Government's proposed militia will have any value if it is to repeat the pitiable performance of the Militia before 1939. In these modern days, we should realize that the first need it trained men. That need can be met only by a system of universal service under which men in various age groups will be called up by ballot oacl year and trained. We want trained men for the Air Force, both in the air and on the ground. The Government could train ground crews by first training them in selected trades under a system of universal training and then placing them in key industries for which their training fitted them so that they could be readily available to be called, up in an emergency.. That involves tackling the trade unions and the Government would not have the courage to do it. The union leaders govern this country nowadays, not the Parliament, which has become the mere façade of democracy.</para>

						<para>I will not take the view of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Holloway) abow what should be done in defence matters any more than I would take the views of three or four of his colleagues in the Ministry. There is no indication of any proper defence plan in the Government's policy. Its idea is to have a militia, members of which will spend a little while in camp each year and do their other training periodically during the year. That will not create an army for the defence of the country. What consideration has the Gorernment given to the use of the vast number of pilots that we have in the country or to train their successors? The pilots and navigators of Trans-Australia Airlines would provide a nucleus for the training of other pilots and navigators against an emergency. Few of the things that ought to be done are being done. Above all, no plan has been revealed for the co-ordination of the three armed services. We have limited resources and it is idle to divide them almost equally between the three branches. Many years ago the Labour party's then leader. the late Mr. John Curtin, said that one of the best things that Australia could do was to place more emphasis on the Air Force than on the other armed forces. That appears to have been forgotten by the Labour party.</para>

						<para>The Government must have forgotten it when it proposed to expend on the Army the same money as on the Air Force. We should dismiss the Service Ministers. They perform no real function. With the armed forces we have, they are not needed. One Minister should be in charge of our defences and he should devote his whole strength and intelligence to developing a co-ordinated defence plan which would use our iesOlfl'CeS to the utmost. I agree with the Minister for De.fencf that the whole nation must he organized. That has been axiomatic for seven or eight, years, for we have seen total war waged. We need plans for the best use of our men and materials in war, but they are not forthcoming.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>So every justification exists, on this point alone, for the motion of censure, for such it is, moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition if there is one thing that we cannot close our eyes to, it is the terrifying march of events abroad. We hope and seek to avoid war, but we shall not avoid it by turning our eyes away from what is taking place in the world. I have made these remarks without the desire to make political capital out of them. It is unfortunate that there cannot be a defence council on which the leaders of the Opposition parties, as well as the Government parties, could be represented. That has always been my personal view. The plan put before u by the Government does not provide for the use of our resources to the best advantage and it is producing a hotchpotch that has been condemned by two of the outstanding men in the Army and the Air Force that Australia has produced in this generation. Not long ago, certain generals sought to place their views on defence matters before the Minister for the Army, but were not even given the opportunity to do so. They are men who have fought for Australia and know much more, in my judgment, and I speak with large experience of the Army, about defence than do many of the present advisers of the Government. They were refused even a hearing. Whether that was because most of them were militia officers I do not know. Some of them had fought only in World War II., but others had fought in both wars. In the face of that, how can the Government hope to satisfy the public that its defence plans do not acid up to a huge waste of money?</para>
					<para>In the little time remaining to me, I desire to make reference to the budget itself, not in detail, because. the details have been completely covered by the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden), but broadly. One thing that strikes me about the budget is that the Government, knowing very well that around the corner there must be a decline of prices overseas that will have a most devastating effect on our economy, is still budgeting for expenditure at an extraordinarily high level. Prices paid for our exports overseas are on an average 400 per cent, greater than they were before the war. It must be obvious that that cannot continue indefinitely. Yet we have had placed before us a budget that is inflationary and does not make provision for the inevitable recession. The people will scrutinize this budget more closely than they have scrutinized any other. It is said that large concessions are to be given to the people, but what does the budget amount to in simple terms? I hope I do not over-simplify it when I say that it merely maintains the present rate of expenditure plus specific amounts of additional expenditure, such as £25,000,000 Tor the payment of war gratuity, £10,000,000 as a gift to Great Britain, and two or three other items. The only reduction of expenditure proposed is on subsidies, the expenditure on which is to be reduced by £26,000,000. Taxation is to be reduced by an approximately- equal amount. Nothing more than that one statement is required to prove that the total burden of the budget LS to be no less than was the burden of the budget of last year.. It is obvious that the course pursued by the Government will inevitably result in higher prices which will create a further inflationary trend and bring in its wake the old trouble that most of us have fought against of wages chasing prices continuously. The Government has done a bad thing by withdrawing subsidies. lam not concerned with the political aspects of their withdrawal, but I am concerned with the economic consequences that will follow. When subsidies are removed prices will rise and the rise of prices will mostly affect people on the lower incomes. The honorable member for Fremantle (Mr. Beazley), who usually gives a great deal of thought to his speeches, and to whom I always listen intently, went right off the rails when he said that subsidies could not be given to the States. There is no constitutional bar to the Government's making a grant to the States of the amount of money involved in subsidies, on condition that the States fix the prices of the commodities in respect of which the subsidies are granted. I believe that the Government is praying for increased prices so that next year, as an election bait, it will be able to bring down a budget granting the taxpayers substantial tax concessions from hidden reserves. No doubt it will then say to them: "The rise of prices was solely due to the fact that you did not give us control of prices. You were misled by our political opponents ". N'otliing could be more fantastic or farther from the truth. The decision to withdraw subsidies is characteristic of the Prime Minister (Mr. Ohilley). It was because of pique that he decided to try to nationalize the banks and it was equally due to pique that he decided that subsidies should be withdrawn. He knew what the consequences would be. But the consequences suit him politically. Those capable of judging consider that the Government's defence plans are insufficient and that the budget cannot be justified in the eyes qf the people.</para>

					<para> - This is the greatest budget that has ever been presented to the Australian Parliament, and the attacks that have been made upon it by honorable members on the Opposition side of the chamber have proved nothing to the contrary. Honorable gentlemen opposite did not try to prove anything. They just wanted to cloud the issue. In the budget, it is proposed to give back to the people by way of tax reductions £28,000,000, of which £22,0002000 will be remitted this financial year. In addition, the Government proposes to increase social service benefits by £21,000,000, so that the people will profit by £49,000,000 in tax reductions and increased social service payments. What other government, in the whole history of federation, ever tried to dp as much? When the Opposition parties were in power, it was the hardest thing in the world to get them to provide an extra shilling a week for the old age pensioners. It was the hardest thing in the world to get them even to annul some of the harsh measures which they had introduced in 1932, the first year they were in office after the defeat of the Scullin Government. The present Government has managed the affairs of Australia during its seven years of office in a manner which no previous government was able to equal. It raised the sum of £1,513,970,132 for war purposes. The total national debt, owed by the Commonwealth and the States, is £2,790,215,169, upon which the interest liability is £82,324,768 a year. That amount has to be voted by Parliament annually. We are in debt to those overseas who lent the money to us, and to the people of Australia who subscribed to victory loans, to liberty loans and to reconstruction loans. The only way in which it would be possible to reduce expenditure, as requested by honorable members opposite, would be to repudiate interest payments. This one item of interest payments is almost equal to a pre-war budget, and it cannot be reduced. As a matter of fact, the Government has been successful in reducing the interest rate on our national indebtedness to £2 19s. per cent. In other days, the Opposition, when in power, was in the habit of floating loans at 5 per cent, and 6 per cent. The right honorable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes), when he was Prime Minister, floated a 6 per cent, loan, and the interest was made free of both Federal and State income tax. This Government has reduced the interest burden. It did iiot put the country into pawn overseas during the war. It raised all the war loans within Australia, and repatrited £77,839,812 of overseas indebtedness. If the Opposition were in power again, precisely the same condition of affairs would obtain as existed under the Lyons and Menzies Governments. To-day, the credit of Australia is extraordinarly high. It is so high that every conversion loan that we have floated overseas has been oversubscribed, and every loan that has been floated in Australia has been oversubscribed, also. In 1933, the Lyons Government floated overseas a loan of £9,621,000, of which £3,478,000 was left with the underwriters. It was 86.15 per cent, undersubscribed. The underwriters burnt their fingers over the first loan, as did those who underwrote many of the succeeding loans. The full 40ry is revealed in the following table</para>

				<para>The longer the anti-Labour governments remained in power, the worse the position became and the more the credit of Australia suffered. Their last oversea loan was floated in October, 1939, just after war broke out. It was for £6,000,000, of which £4,788,000 was left on the hands of the underwriters. The extraordinarily large amount of SO per cent, of the total loan was not subscribed by the public because they had lost confidence in the financial tabi]ity of Australia-</para>

						<para>The right honorable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender) was one of the long list of Treasurers who served in anti-Labour governments before the war, and the president of the Liberal party, Mr. R. G. Casey, was another. The only bright spot in the record was when the present Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr.Fadden) was Treasurer. With the Liberal party and its ideological predecessors, it was ever thus. In the days of the Bruce-Page Government overseas loans were undersubscribed. In 1926, a loan of £6,000,000 was undersubscribed by £4,000,000. in 1925 a loan of £5,000,000 was undersubscribed by £2,000,000. Always, when an anti-Labour government has vacated office, it has left an empty treasury, an exhausted loan market and a broken economy. Honorable members opposite have voiced a lot of airy platitudes. They have tried to convince themselves that the Government is giving nothing back to the public in this budget; that the budget is, in fact, a joke perpetrated upon the public, and that there will be no real tax remissions for any one. In a short time, however, the people will find that their pay envelopes are heavier than they were before. They will also receive a substantial refund from the Taxation Branch in July of next year, and that is what honorable members opposite do not like. The Government has honoured its promises in their entirety. We did not go into the auction mart to buy votes at the last election. The right honorable member for Kooyong (Mr. Menzies) said that, if his party were returned to power, he would reduce taxation by £20,000,000. The Leader of the Australian Country party said that he would reduce taxation by £28,000,000. Eventually, the people realized that there was no unanimity among the Opposition parties and that it was simply a matter of huckstering. for votes. The Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley), on the contrary, made no promises. He did not offer any inducements. He said, "Trust this Government which has managed the economy of Australia .so well ", and the people did trust it. It is stated in a document which has been circulated for the information of honorable members, that since 1942, the Government has remitted taxes to the amount of £138,000,000, made up of a remission of £20,000,000 in January, 1946; £17,500,000 in July, 1946; and £33,000,000 in July, 1947. The present proposal is to grant a further remission of £26,000,000. In addition. remissions- -of sales tax and other charges amount to a further £2,000,000.</para>

					<para>This Government has managed the affairs of Australia so well that the people now have £681,000,000 in their savings bank accounts. In 1947, they had £660,000,000 in the savings banks. The total amount in the savings banks was only £236,991,000 when the Opposition parties were in power. Honorable members opposite have accused the Government of destroying the economy of the country, but the fact remains that the people have three times as much money in the savings banks now as when the Opposition parties were in power. And to whose credit does this money stand? It is owned by the ordinary people, whose spending power assures prosperity for everybody. This Government looks after the people, and that is why it enjoys their confidence. It is also he reason why the Government faces the future confidently. Not all persons with the same ideological background as honorable members opposite think as they do. Sir Norman Brookes returned to Australia o :18th August.</para>

					<para>That is not Labour propaganda. It i the opinion of a captain of industry, a man associated with the Liberal party. whose ideas on many matters are thsame as those of honorable membem opposite. As a matter of fact, members of his family have, in the past, stood a candidates for the Nationalist party, the United Australia party, and the Liberal party in parliamentary elections. Sii Norman returned to Australia determined to tell the truth, and all the moanings—to use his own classic expression—of honorable members opposite, will not fool the Australian people. They know that the economy of the country is sound. They know that there is full employment, and thai the people have plenty of money in the savings banks. The Australian people recognize that there are shortages. which are not due to unemployment, but - to a scarcity of ]naterial and man-power. Even the scarcity of materials is due, in the final analysis. to a scarcity of man-power. Australia has not enough people to do the work that needs to be done. Ii is in the paradoxical position of experiencing a depression in reverse. During the depression, there was plenty of labour, but there were not enough jobs. To-day there are plenty of jobs. but not enough men. If Sir Norman Brookes is right in saying that Australia can face the futur. with optimism, it must be because Australia has a good and honest Government. It would be impossible to face the future with optimism if a great many people were out of work, and there was undeserved destitution in the country—</para>

						<para>He did, and everybody is concerned at the possibility of an economic depression. It remains true. however, that no other country has as somid an economy as Australia. I do not, propose to detail all the big undertakings with which Sir Norman Brookes is associated, but he is certainly con- ,iectecl with some of the largest industrial concerns in the country. After hearing the speeches of some honorable members opposite, a listener might be excused for imagining that the Government was squandering money in all directions. It has not squandered any money, but has increased the benefits to those who, it thinks, need them most. The Government is working on the right principle, and, indeed, on the only principle which a democratic administration can follow. Et is doing the greatest good for the greatest number of people. The Government is being attacked virulently and violently because it will not grant tax remissions to the wealthy section of the community. It is because the Government is granting the biggest remissions of tax to those in the lower and the middle income groups that honorable members opposite are so annoyed. When anti- Labour governments were in office, a few years ago, they always granted tax remissions to the people with the biggest incomes, and showed little concern for the people in the lower ranges of income. I shall tell honorable members exactly what happened after the accession to office of the Lyons Government, which was later succeeded by the Menzies Government. The Lyons Government, in its first year of office, reduced old-age pensions below the level to which they had been reduced in accordance with the provisions of the Premiers plan, but it remitted land tax payable by some of the biggest graziers, landholders, insurance companies and banks. Those who had helped to secure the return to office of the Lyons Government, and paid its election expenses, obviously benefited most from that tax concession.</para>

						<para>Every honorable member opposite, who is a wealthy man, secured substantial benefits from the anti- Labour governments that ruled and ruined Australia from 1932-33 until 1938-39. Remissions of land tax in that period totalled £8,700,000, and benefited principally the big landholders in the cities. The reductions of tax were not of such. tremendous benefit to the people in thecountry districts, but were certainly of benefit to 9,100 pastoralists and farmers who, between them, owned property, the unimproved value of which was assessed at £87,000,000, and to 2,800 companieswith property, the unimproved value of which was assessed at £93,000,000. While granting huge remissions of land tax and income tax to the wealthy section of the community, the Lyons Government did not vote a penny in its first year of office for the relief of unemployment, but left that responsibility to the States. The States financed their particular schemes by imposing a tax of 3d. in the £1 on the incomes of every salary and wage-earner. No matter how many dopendants a worker had, he paid a fiat rate of 3d. in the £1 on his wages. In some States, the unemployment relief tax was 6d. in the £1. The honorable member for Reid (Mr. Lang), whose utterances are quoted with such approval by honorable members opposite, promised the electors of New South Wales that if they returned him to office he would abolish the unemployment relief tax of 3d. in the £1, which had been levied by the Bavin Government. The honorable member was returned to office, and substituted for the tax of 3d. in the £1 a tax of is. in the £1.</para>

					<para>I have read many of the speeches which honorable members opposite have made on the budget, and I have noted that they have spoken with diverse voices on various subjects. Some of them want reserves established out of the Government's so-called bulging surplus. Others want the Government to make maximum remissions of tax to the wealthy section of the community. Some of them even sneered at the Government's health scheme, and announced that they were opposed to free medicine. The honorable member for Balaclava criticized the free medicine scheme in the following words :—</para>

I ask those honorable members whether they are opposed to the free medicine scheme.

Gd. a week in respect of each child under the age of fifteen years, but has raised the child endowment payment by 100 per cent. since assuming office. In addition, it has increased age pensions by more than 100 per cent. Expenditure on social security benefits now amounts to £74,000,000 per annum. By the time of the next election, about December, 1949, . January, 1950, we hope to be paying social services benefits at the rate of approximately £100,000,000 per annum to those persons in the community who need them. I pause to remark that the present Leader of the Opposition resigned from the Lyons Government because it would not put into operation the legislation for the national health scheme which Mr. Casey had sponsored and about which he boasted in his newsreel talk. The Leader of the Opposition probably left the Lyons Government because it would not introduce a free medicine scheme and a free doctor service which some honorable members opposite regard as socialistic and extravagant. The Government has never squandered money, but has been most careful with the people's property. When honorable members opposite occupied the treasury bench, they squandered money to an extraordinary degree. There was the instance, small in itself, but indicative of the general mentality of the Bruce-Page Government, of a dog kennel being installed at the Prime Minister's lodge at a cost of £28.</para>

						<para>—In that instance, public mony was squandered. The kennel itself was too rich. The poor dog could not take it. He died in a fortnight. Anti-Labour governments in those days did not provide any social service for the man who was trying to rear a family. It amazes me that in a democracy like Australia, after 80 or 90 years of an educational system that is free, secular and compulsory, we should find any person in the community so lacking in intelligence as to vote for any honorable member opposite. It also amazes me that the Liberal larty and the Australian Country party have any representation in this Parliament at all. The policy which the Labour Government is following is obviously the right policy for the people of Australia.</para>

						<para>—The Liberal party and the Australian Country party have hopes of being returned to the treasury bench at the next general election, but such ambitions are npt likely to be realized. They play up to the press, as the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Harrison) did in his speech on the budget. His first words were to this effect, "I read the leading article in the Daily Telegraph, and it is of the usual high standard of philosophic worth and literary skill to be found in that journal ". On the 1st May, 1940, he made a speech at a Rotary Club luncheon, which was also reported in that newspaper. It was his May Day speech. He said—.</para>

					<para>That statement by the Prime Minister of Australia was given little prominence by the newspapers of this country. It was a statement of government policy, and no amount of misrepresentation by honorable members opposite can change it. We passed legislation to nationalize the banks because they were trying to destroy the 1945 banking legislation which the people endorsed by their votes at the 1946 general election. Because the solicitor for the Melbourne City Council, which launched the attack on the Banking Act of 1945 in the High Court of Australia, happened, by the strangest coincidence in the world, also to be the secretary of the Victorian division of the Associated Banks of Australia. and because the challenge of the Melbourne City Council was directed, not only against the one ection that the High Court declared to be invalid, but against the whole of the act, the Government decided to finish the banks in their present form before the banks finished the people of Australia in another depression. We are anxious to protect the people from depression, and the effects of depression. There are two ways in which that can be done. The first is by keeping a good government in loffice, and the second is by destroying the power of people who are not elected by anybody and are responsible only to shareholders to manipulate the credit of this country. Such people should not have the power to contract credit and cause deflation, or to increase the flow of credit and cause inflation. As I have said on several occasions, inflation and deflation are both cumulative in their ill effects. They both lead to mass unemployment. Honorable gentlemen opposite, who are the champions of confusion and the creators of chaos, would do precisely the same things to-morrow, if they were back on the treasury bench, as they did in the years between 1916 and 1941. During that time, except for brief periods, they had an overwhelming majority in both houses of Parliament and could have prevented much of the misery that was inflicted on the people of Australia. They would not pass a bill through the Senate to create a fiduciary note issue of £18,000,000 for the purpose of financing the sale of wheat and for putting unemployed people to work in a scale which would have involved an estimated expenditure of £1,000,000 a mouth. They said that to do so would destroy the financial stability of Australia. Yet, when Australia was engaged in the last war, this Government used national credit to the amount of £147,000,000 to bridge the gap between expenditure and the amount of money that could be obtained from loans and taxes. The maximum amount that could be obtained from loans was raised, and income tax was increased to a maximum. on the highest incomes of 18s. 6d. in the £1.</para>
					<para>The wheat farmers remember that during the depression years wheat was sold on the Horsham Plains of Victoria. for is. lOd. a bushel, and in the Riverina for about the same amount. The wheatgrowers of Australia were driven into bankruptcy then, but, despite the propaganda of the Country party, they are beginning to realize that this Government is, and always has been, the farmers' friend. If they did not think that the Government was the farmers' friend, 0 per cent. of them would not have voted in favor of the wheat stabilization scheme, which they know to be a Coniuionwealth scheme. It is the Scully plan. [t is a plan that this Government formulated on the advice of the farmers who are in our party. We are a party of all kinds of people— workers, farmers, doctors and lawyers— but in these clays there are no stooges" for big business on the right of the Chair. No one on this side of the chamber has any concern other than to do the greatest amount of good for everybody in the community.</para>
					<para>The honorable member for mdi (Mr. M:cEwen) said that a man with a wife and two children, who earns £300 a year, pays up to £118 a year in indirect taxes. That statement is a complete concoction. It could only be possible if each of those persons consumed a full quota of beer, spirits, wines, tobacco and cigarettes, if the family used 224 gallons of petrol a year and a full share of all other imported commodities, if it were buying all luxury lines that are subject to the higher rates of sales tax, and if it were paying' wages of more than £20 a week and, therefore, contributing to the pay-roll tax. If the members of the family were not doing any of those things, they would not pay even a minute fraction of £118 a year. Contrariwise, the honorable member's calculations could prove that a man earning £10,000 a year need pay only £29 a year in indirect taxes, if he were abstemious. The real position is that a taxpayer who earns £300 a year and has a wife and two children pays no direct taxes; that, buying mainly essential foods s.ncl clothing, he pays practically no sales tax; that he pays excise only to the extent that he uses beer and tobacco; that he pays customs duty only to the extent that it is passed on by merchants. and manufacturers; that he pays no payroll tax; and that he pays entertainment tax probably only at the lowest rate applicable to the cheapest seats.</para>

						<para>An attack by the honorable member for Balaclava (Mr. White) on any honorable member sitting on this side of the committee is a compliment. The Treasurer, according to the Leader of the Australian Country party, has presented budgets to this House on a record number of occasions. But his records are not finished. He will present a .budget next year, and in the following year, and in many years to come. The Leader of the Australian Country party also said that the Treasurer had achieved a record public debt of £2,700,000,000, and had a record number of employees. I remind the committee that most of that public debt was incurred as a result of World War II. and I know that the Leader of the Australian Country party did not intend to be uncharitable or unfair in his criticism of the Treasurer. No other Treasurer could have raised such a huge sum of money with as little dislocation of our economy, or could have persuaded the Australian people as he did to bear their burdens as they did until the end of the war. The Leader of the Australian Country party further said that the Treasurer's expenditure had reached record proportions. That is quite true; and it should be so. Would the right honorable gentleman have it otherwise? Does he want the Government to put people off its nay-roll? Many honorable members opposite talk of driving public servants off the government pay-roll to go to work in factories. That is a form of conscription of labour which this party does not support. We believe that every member of the community should be permitted to take the best job that he can get. The honorable member for Warringah is a barrister. He does not believe that he should be put into a canning factory, although I have no doubt that he would do better work there than he is doing now. The Opoosition would force postal employees and clerks in government offices to work for lower rates of pay, and the hill-billy members of the Country party would ak that dismissed public servants be directed to farm work. The plain truth is that there are not enough people in Australia to-day; but we believe that every person in this country should be allowed to work where he chooses. There should be no cutting of public expenditure just to force public servants into Some other form of employment to make profits for some privileged section of the community.</para>

Raving no constructive criticism to offer, honorable gentlemen opposite talk like parrots hour after hour, saying much the same thing from scripts prepared for them by the banking institutions and Liberal party head-quarters. Everybody knows that they have not enough intelligence to write their own speeches, or that they are so intellectually lazy that if .they essayed the task themselves the speeches would be even greater failures than those they are delivering.</para>

He is a great authority on history. He is always interesting, always amusing. sometimes exciting, and always wholly inaccurate. I shall deal with two or three of his inaccuracies to-night. He referred to the method by which loans were raised during the administration of previous governments. He named the Lyons. Menzies, Fadden, Bruce-Page and other governments, going back over a period of many years; but be failed to state the facts. I shall state them now. During the period to which he referred, there was the most complete freedom on the part of investors to put their money into government bonds, or into private business. Yet. he compared those days with more rccent times when the Australian Government had an absolute stranglehold over all investments. We all know that unless the Advisory Committee on Capita! Issues approved a certain investment. II could not be made.</para>

						<para>Yes, or perhaps for a New Guinea timber lease. and, of course, money had to be kept under Government control to finance the New Zealand wheat deal. Not long ago, another Minister referred to the high level reached by savings bank deposits in this country. He was only £311,000,000 out ill his figures, but Apparently that is near enough when one is dealing with millions. Let it be remembered that during the war, when successful loans were floated by the Curtin and Chifley Administrations, the Australian Government has access to every savings bank in the Commonwealth. The great bulk of such deposits of course were in the Commonwealth Savings Bank. In addition the Government had recourse to treasury-bills. Somes of the most illuminating pages in the budget papers deal with trust funds. Trust funds consist of money paid into the Treasury on trust. In round figures, there is £148,000,000 in trust funds to-day, but of that sum which has been contributed by taxes and by other methods, including payments by insurance companies, etc., no less than £141,000,000 is invested in treasury-bills at 1 per cent. So, the Australian Government to-day has access to savings bank deposits totalling £681,000,000, to funds paid into the Commonwealth Bank of Australia by law. and to certain surplus funds of the trading banks now amounting to nearly £300,000,000, It can dip its fingers into every child's money box and can issue treasury-bills at 1 per cent, as long as it pleases, and without limitation. It stands to reason that a government placed in this position cannot he compared with preceding administrations. I regret that the Minister for' Information is so tired from his exertions that he has had to leave the chamber, but no doubt he will come back soon. He referred to times gone by when there was a surplus of commodities, and when men were out of work.. To-day, he said, everybody was in full employment, but I remind him that there is still a shortage of commodities. How does he piece those two statemeiits together? Does he mean that in the depression days and post-depression days—he said that there were 250,000 unemployed in 1939—the number of people then at work was producing a surplus of the goods and services required in Australia at that time, and that to-day, with full employment, the workers of Australia are unable to keep the country adequately supplied? As the honorable member for Bendigo (Mr. Rankin) pointed out this afternoon, it is not possible nowadays to purchase more than 2 lb. of sugar at a time. That applies not only in the Bendigo electorate, but in every southern electorate in Australia. The only conclusion to be drawn from that, and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr. Dedman) may reply to this at a later stage, is that a high proportion of the people employed in Australia to-day are not giving a proper' return of labour during their working' hours. The introduction of the 40-hour week was, in my opinion, one of the most wicked things ever done in Australia. It stands to reason that with a 40-hour week it is impossible to maintain a supply of goods and services to the extent required. The Government has continually told us about the terrible conditions overseas, but 'while it was doing so its representatives appeared before the Commonwealth Arbitration Couri and argued in favour of the 40-hour week. How does the Government reconcile that action with what it says, and what is in fact true, about the' state of affairs in the United Kingdom, Europe and Asia? The Labour party claims to champion the principle of the brotherhood of man. How then does a Labour Government reconcile the introduction of the 40-hour week, which has' resulted in decreased production and decreased exports of necessaries to othei countries, with its claim to champion the principle of the brotherhood of man? As I have stated on previous occasions there has never been a party in the history of Australia whose inhumanity to man ha been greater than that shown by the present-day Labour party. There is no humanity in that party whatsoever. It is .the most self-centred, selfish party that has ever sat on the treasury benches, of this Parliament. It says nothing outside what the little dictators of the trade unions tells it to say. I may apply to it the words of Charles 1.—altered to suit the particular case—</para>

					<para>The Minister said something about sources of taxation, and added that it was impossible to obtain certain amounts from the wealthy, and the money had therefore to come from those not so wealthy. I have here the latest return of the Commissioner of Taxation for the financial year 1944-45. I apologize to the Parliament because the report is so out of date, but excuse myself on the ground that the Government does not appear to be able to keep its essential printing up to date for the information of honorable members. The return shows that the number of taxpayers earning more than £1,500 a year, which is the figure that the Parliament, led by this Government, decided that the work of honorable members was worth, was 17,958 in that year, and that the total number of taxpayers was 2,049,694. Taxpayers earning over £1,500 a year from personal exertion accounted for £48,000,000 of the £714,000,000 collected in taxes on personal exertion income. Those with property producing an income of more than £1,500 a year accounted for £16,000,000 of the £69,000,000 collected in taxes on property income. Item by item the Commissioner of Taxation shows the income in each income group and how it was derived. How much was left after income tax was paid by those taxpayers? I say to the honorable gentleman on the treasury bench that there was not very, much left. If they took all of what was left they Would not have enough to pay for the fleet of expensive cars which they use at the public expense.</para>
					<para>I shall now refer to the free medicine scheme put before the Parliament by the former Treasurer, Mr. Casey. I am deeply indebted to the Minister for Information for mentioning Mr. Casey's scheme.

						<para>—The Minister stood for election as soon as he thought the electors would accept him. I was on the treasury bench when Mr. Casey's bill was before the House. It did not provide for a free medicine plan such as that provided for by the present Government. There is no comparison whatsoever between the twtr plans. The scheme put forward by Mr. Casey, at the behest of the Lyons Government, was one under which each individual would contribute Is. 6d. a week and in return would receive certain benefits. I personally am one whose parents, in their good sense, enrolled me in a friendly society, the Reehabites. I was nine or ten years of age at that time. To-day, after about 40 years, I pay is. a week into that friendly society and since my parents enrolled me I have been entitled to free medicine. But I have paid for it with my contributions. I am also entitled to free medical service and in due course my executors will be entitled to funeral expenses to meet cost of my burial. I am also entitled to receive the sum of £1 a week from the society during periods of sickness. The Casey scheme was based on the friendly societies' scheme. Under Mr. Casey's plan, the amount of contribution was to be is. Gd. a week. Under the present Government's scheme the amount of contribution is is. 6d. in the £1. The Minister says that contributors under the present scheme receive about twice as much as they would have received under the Casey plan. I do not think that the Government is entitled to any laurel wreaths for its scheme, and if it cares to have screened a certain film of Mr. Casey, I am quite sure honorable members would hear something useful and enlightening, and would also be able to look upon the image of a very good man.</para>

					<para>During his remarks on Commonwealth assistance to countries overseas, the Minister for Information made what I took to be a slighting reference, though I hope I am doing him no injustice by referring to it as such. To-day we hear so much from the Government about dollars that honorable members on this side of the committee are beginning to believe that the Government has some kind of dollar fever. in its Marshall aid plan, the United States of America, a country which has much the same area as Australia but twenty times its population, has done a great deal more, proportionately, than Australia is doing or has done to assist the ravaged countries of Europe. There can be no comparison between the efforts of Australia and those of the United States of America in production, the number of hours worked, or coal production figures. Australia has a population of 7,000,000 and a great industrial need for coal. It is mining about 14,000j000 tons of coal a year. With a population of 140,000,000, the United States of America ought to be mining on a proportionate basis only 280,000,000 tons a year, but last year 702,000,000 tons of coal were produced in that country. Another great distinction between Australia and the United States of America is that in the latter country an overwhelining majority of people desire to work in order to gain something. In Australia, according to the Labour party, the one unpardonable crime is that ally man should want to earn a few pounds. Any one who succeeds in earning a few pounds is beyond redemption altogether. At the conference of the Australian Labour party, held in April, the Minister for Information' stated, as his colleague the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction may confirm, that the real fight to-clay was not between Labour and communism but between Labour and capitalism, and C should be very interested to hear the [inister expand that statement. With regard to his reference to industrial conscription, may I remind the committee that the Curtin Government has the record and the credit of being the only G-vernmeut in Australia which ever had the temerity to introduce industrial conscription, and that Adnjinistration " got away with it", not only with the trade unions, but also with the electors. There was then no question of people being able to cJioose their employment, although members of the prosent Government, about which the Minister for Information is continually boasting, speak of the right of People to pick their own jobs. During the war people were picked out of their homes and businesses and shunted to the Northern Territory, to remote parts of the coastline and to the islands to do any job which thp individuals nominated by the Government decreed they should perform.</para>

						<para>Quite a lot might be said in regard to that matter. For the moment I content myself with pointing out that the present Government has no right to lecture the Opposition on freedom of choice of employment, because that freedom certainly did not exist under Labour administrations during the war.</para>

					<para>The Minister also referred to the advocacy by members of the Opposition of the need for economy. Let me remind him that when he occupied a back bench in this chamber as the honorable member for Melbourne, and was trying to horn his way into the Ministry, he had a great deal to say about economy. He was, I suppose, one of the most stringent critics of the Government in this chamber at that time, and one of the Comitionwealth departments which he now administers, the Department of Information. was his special "pet". He saw flO reason whatever for the continued existence of that department, and I entirely agree with him. However, when he was elected by caucus to the Ministry, the former Prime Minister, the late Mr. John Curtin. decided, with ironic humour, that since he had to allocate a portfolio to such a queer, thirteen-cornered sort of fellow, he would entrust to his administration the department which he bad criticized so bitterly. What happened? Instead of the Department of Information being put down the drain, or wiped out in some other fashion, the Minister proceeded to expand it, and he discovered very cogent and urgent reasons why it should not only be expanded in Australia, but hould also be transplanted overseas and expanded there. The only material benefit which I can discern from the expansion of that department is that the Minister has saved his enemies, whom he calls the "press barons ", the cost of performing a lot of services which he has provided for them which they would otherwise have had to provide for themselves.</para>
					<para>I intend to say something now on defence. I listened to the Minister for the Army (Mr. Chambers) last night, and I heard the Minister for Defence (Mr. Dedman) speak to-night. I entirely agree with the honorable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender) that the separate service ministries should be abolished and replaced by a single ministry of Defence. Because of the size of our preset services, it is rediculous that one Minister should be fully unemployed administering our small Army; that another Minister should be needed to look after the few naval vessels which we possess, and that yet another Minister should be required to administer the handful of aircraft which comprises our Mr Force. Of course, I admit that the M:inister for Air also administers the portfolio of Civil Aviation. However, there is also a Minister for Munitions, and a Minister for Supply and Devlopmeat and Minister for Shipping and Fuel, although I understand that the Departments of Supply and</para>

						<para>Quite so, but two Ministers are now doing the work formerly performed by one; and we have presiding over the service ministries like Jove on Olysnpiis. the Minister for Defence. Such a platoon of Ministers is quite unnecessary, and if we are to learn the lesson which emerged from the recent war, that combined operations override all other military organizations in efficiency, we should abolish the conglomeration of separate service ministries. In those separate ministries each Minister, no doubt, has his own little retinue, "corners ", and bottle-necks. We should abolish those ministries and replace them with a single ministry which can give to the Parliament and the country a concise, co-ordinated and intelligible defence policy.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>When we consider the subject of defence we must recognize that all money spent on war is wasted. I think that even the Minister for Defence will agree with me on that. However, it is a waste of money which has had to be endured throughout history by all nations which desired to preserve their independence. "Wasted" money has to be spent on defence works in times of peace; but if those defence works are not kept up to standard, and the forces employed are not properly trained and equipped, it stands to reason that we shall not be in a position to safeguard our vital interests when the necessity to do so arises. Australia had a very lucky escape in the last war. I recall with some bitternew the debates which took place about the time of Munich. I have in mind also some debates which took place on certain proposed votes after the outbreak of World War II. I recall particularly the day when members of the Australian Labour party demanded a division on the question whether we should send troops to the Middle East.</para>

						<para>And to New Guinea. I recall that I said on that occasion that we should send at least five divisions. I also expressed the opinion that probably ten divisions would be needed. Later we had to raise ten divisions, but at that time members of the Australian Labour party believed that we were engaged in an "imperialist war ". They had not got away from Munich. They were fascinated, apparently, -by that gentleman Hitler, who was good enough to grant a breathing space of twelve months to Chamberlain and Daladier, who was Premier of France at that time. At that time members of the Labour party certainly did not believe in defence or in a global war. :Later we heard •a great deal from them about "global war ", bu at that time they were not concerned with anything outside Australia. As the honorable member for Warringah said tonight, if the Minister for External Territories (Mr. Ward) had had his way on that occasion, the Minister would not have any external territories to administer to-day, because he was quite prepared to allow those territories to be seized by Adolf Hitler, Hirohito, or any one else who chose to come along and take them.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>Having said that, let us look to the future, because it does not do to live continually in the past, as do members of the Australian Labour party. Members of that party apparently have no vision of the future execpt on such matters as pensions or other gifts that are to be doled out to some one at the expense of some one else but never at their own expense, of course. In any view of the future we must have regard to the possible conditions under which we may be impelled to engage in hostilities. It is of no use to burke facts, and it is obvious that the only country with which Australia, the British Empire, the United States of America or the nations of western Europe may have to engage in hostilities is Russia. There is no other potential enemy. No ether country is threatening the peace of the world or trying to grab, in the best imperialist, expansionist spirit of the Czars, he territory of its neighbours. There is no other country which is stretching out into Germany, Austria, the Baltic, and the Balkans; which is threatening Turkey; which is interfering in Palestine; which is threatening Afghanistan, Persia and India; and which is extending its influence in Siam, Indo-China, China, Korea and the Japanese islands. Every one of us should understand c1ea11y the objectives of :Russian imperialism in the world. Russia is a slave state in the strictest sense of the word. It is ruled by what is probably the foulest government that was ever on the face of the earth. It is a country which, I am happy to say, I have never called my ally. I have never used that word at any time in relation to Russia, because I have never had any doubt as to what Russia intended to do. There are, however, many people in this country, and some of them in my own electorate, who at one time held different views. During the last election campaign, I was able to ask some of them whether they held the same views about Russia in 1946 as they had held in 1943. They were not prepared to answer. Our experiences with Russia during the last few years should have taught the Australian Government, and even the intensely selfcentred Australian Labour party, a lesson. Within our own community, we have the Russian fifth column. Recently, that delectable gentleman, Mr. Burns, stated what the Communists in Australia would do, should war with Russia eventuate. He should be dealt with by the Government, but I have no doubt that lie will not be, and that the Prime Minister will say, in his blandest and most disarming way, that Burns was merely giving expression to his own private ideology. In that manner, the whole incident will be brushed-off. If we are to take the field of battle against Russia in the not distant future, what effective contribution to the conflict will the Australian nation make? I should like to know whether the Government would be prepared to take any part in such a conthat. Years ago, before World War II., I stated in this chamber that if Australia became involved in another world war, the area in which our troops would fight would extend from Capetown to Cairo, from Cairo to Hong kong, and from. Hong kong to New Zealand. Subsequent events proved that my prophecy was not very wide of the mark. Should war come again, the theatres of the conflict will range from the Behring 'Straits to Archangel, provided, of course, that Australia, as one member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, or whatever longwinded term we use to describe what was formerly called British Empire, is prepared t take any part in such a conflict and accept any of its responsibilities as one of the white powers of the world. The Parliament has not been told whether the Government believes that it has any responsibilities in regard to overseas operations. Unless the Government has some definite ideas about the part Australia will play in the provision of expeditionary forces by land, sea and air in such a conflict, then so much of the defence scheme as has been madee, known to us to date does not mean a thing.</para>
					<para>There are certain imponderables in regard to Russia. We do not know the degree to which the military situation in Russia has been altered as the result of materials, ideas and man-power which the Russians may have obtained from Germany. We also do not know what effect that may have on, say, submarine warfare, but we do know that in present circumstances and as far ahead as I can see, Australia itself is not liable to sustain any effective external attack by Russia. The only thing which we have to fear is the effects of the Russian fifth column inside our own borders, and the Government shows a distinct reluctance to deal with it.</para>
					<para>The Minister for Defence (Mr. Dedman) said to-night that the Government had enlisted in the Royal Australian Navy 1,000 ratings of the Royal Navy, of whom 400 were to come to Australia in H.M.A.S. Kanimbla. This is a departure from previous Australian naval policy. At all times, some officers and ratings of the Royal Navy have been attached to the Royal Australia Navy, but this new departure makes me wonder whether the Australian Government is held in such low esteem by our young men that they are not prepared to answer the call for recruits for the Navy. We know how difficult it is for the Minister for the Army to get the necessary number of recruits to raise the Army to its planned strength, but when the Government has to admit that it has to obtain large numbers of men from the Royal Navy to make up the requisite numbers for the Royal Australian Navy, I am entitled to inquire whether we are following in the footsteps of ancient Rome, which ultimately had to fill its legions with foreign troops. May we expect that, in the not far distant future, the Minister for Defence or the Minister for the Army will tell us that it is necessary to send overseas in order to obtain the necessary recruits to fill the ranks of the Army, because the voluntary system of recruiting in Australia has failed? If the Government is prepared to adopt this system of recruiting for the Navy, it may have to do so for the Army. These are merely one or two thoughts on the subject of defence to which, doubtless, no effective reply will be given.</para>
					<para>The Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Harrison) referred to the subject of production. I am alarmed and distressed to find that three years after the cessation of hostilities, Australia is in it deplorable economic state. The Government may put into operation its free medicine scheme, and the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Holloway) may scatter unwanted employment agencies all over the Commonwealth, but our economic condition re- - mains deplorable. One of those employment agencies was established in the little town in which I live. All I can say is, God help us if there are any more of those perfectly useless institutions! I went into the local office to secure employment for a young fellow, and I was amazed at the dreadful way in which that and similar offices are conducted. I have spent a lifetime in the bush or on the land, and my own -experience has been that the first person one should go to when endeavouring to place a man in employment is the local auctioneer, and, the next, the local policeman. They constitute the two best employment agencies of which I know. Furthermore, their services are freely given.</para>

						<para>An auctioneer would not charge for such services. Compared with an auctioneer, the local policeman, Ministers and employment agencies would not be in the race. To-day, employment agencies are scattered allover the CommonweaIth. It is of no use for the Government to talk about our wonderful prosperity. It is merely a paper prosperity. The Minister for Labour and National Service referred to the increase of the savings bank deposits during the last few years. Those deposits exist only because the people who own the money cannot exchange it for the goods they want. Those goods are not available, or if they are available, they are too expensive, or can be obtained only on the black-market, upon which many people will not operate. We know that black marketing goes on in many places. We cannot overcome the menace and ensure a proper standard of living for our people until a sufficiency of goods and services is produced to meet all demands. That is an aspect with which the Government does not appear to busy itself. There is a shortage of bricks and timber, notwithstanding statements by some of the Minister's friends. There are shortages of iron, tiles and cement. Some honorable members have declared that there is cement to burn, All I can say is that cement cannot be bought in any quantity in South Australia notwithstanding that it is controlled. It is only possible to procure a bag or two at a time. There are shortages of wire and piping. Only lately has it been possible to obtain gates. There is also a shortage of wire netting. British and American firms are offering to send us wire made of aluminium and other materials, at all sorts of fantastic prices. Despite talk by the Government of full employment, there is practically "empty" production. The output of steel is only up to about 60 per cent, of the pre-war volume, and the requirements of the community are not being met.</para>
					</talk.start>
					<para>The record of the Government is an absolutely deplorable one. Ministers have shown no signs of comprehending the needs of the community. If ever there was a time when the people should be up and praying, it is now. They should all pray for delivery from wickedness and sneers of this Government.</para>

The Minister for Supply and Development has informed me that several large companies are searching for petroleum: Australasian Petroleum Company Proprietary Limited and Island Exploration Company Proprietary Limited in Papua and New Guinea; Shell (Queensland) Development Proprietary Limited in Queensland; Australian Mining and Smelting Company Limited in. Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Another large company comprising American and Australian interests is about to commence prospecting in Western Australia. Smaller companies include Freney Kimberley Oil Company (1932) No Liability in Western Australia; Roma Blocks Oil No Liability and associated companies in Queensland; and Lakes Oil Limited in Victoria; while Enterprise Exploration Company Proprietary Limited is searching for natural gas in South Australia and New South Wales. The Commonwealth Government is assisting the search for oil by making geological and geophysical surveys; by equipping the geophysical parties with the most modern instruments and equipment; by supplying drilling plant at a low rental; by introducing legislation favorable to prospecting operations in the territories, and by sponsoring the importation of prospecting and drilling equipment by companies engaged in the search for petroleum. Geological surveys are in progress in the .Kimberley district of Western Australia and geophysical surveys in the Roma district of Queensland.</para>

Hood, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia, and Mr. Julius Kntz-Suchy, on behalf of Poland, for the supply without charge to the Government of Poland of Australian wool to the value of £A.250,000.

						<para>3. The Australian Government is aware that concern may have been felt in certain quarters that this wool might not be used for the purpose for which it was intended.

						<para>The requirements of wool for Poland and Czechoslovakia have not been fully met by imports during the past year, and it is most unlikely that any wool shipped to these countries has found its way to Russia.</para>
						<para>Czechoslovakia and Poland have always been solid wool buyers from this country. To bear this point out, the following figures show thetotal weight of wool shipped to the abovementioned countries, for a period prior to World War IL and also for the two years after the war:-</para>

						<para>Tim sending it telcgri in to the Council of Foreign Ministers requesting that a report of the Ministers' Deputies should be transnutted to all interested governments and that the Australian Government should be given the opportunity to present its views direct to the council, Mr. Beasley was acting on the instructions of the Minister for External Affairs. The procedure adopted in sending this communication was the same as on previous occasions when the Government has communicated with the Council of Foreign Ministers or the Deputies on the question of the Ttahian colonies. These previous comimnluniea - tions have also been sent by Mr. Beasley on the authorization of the Minister for External Affairs. The Australian Governmemmt has received no formal reply to this communication to the Council of Foreign Ministers. It is understood, however, that no interested governments other than the four major powers were given the opportunity of presenting their view's to the Council of Foreign Ministers. The views of the Australian Government, however, were presented to the Deputies of the Foreign Ministers during the meeting which preceded the Paris session of the Council of Foreign Ministers. In authorizing the sending of this telegram the Minister for External Affairs has followed the consistent policy of ensuring that our views on questions on which we have earned the right to speak are given full consideration. Australian forces made an important contribution to the alhierl Victory in North Africa and it is only right that full weight should he given to Australia's views on the former Italian colonies in this area. Since the Council of Foreign Ministers has not reached all agreed solution the whole question will come before the General Assembly for a recommendation</para>
