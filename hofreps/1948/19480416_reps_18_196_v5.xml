                        <para>- The amount of dollars which can be spent during this calendar year must be very much less than that spent during the last calendar year. I shall not disclose the approximate figure at the moment, but the proposed programme envisages a considerable reduction of dollar expenditure. During the last four or five months, a special committee, which includes officers of the Department of Trade and Customs, has been examining licences in respect of every essential import for which dollars must be paid. As the result of the committee's recommendations, I hope to reduce considerably our dollar commitments for this calendar year, and make a further reduction next year. This plan has been based on the assumption that it will be possible for Australia to purchase dollars from the Empire dollar pool, and further restrictions may  have  to be imposed on purchases from the dollar area.

Has the Prime Minister seen a statement in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> by the Director of Information and Organization at the Hebrew University in Palestine that Melbourne and Sydney Jews had already subscribed Â£113,000 to the Jewish State Appeal Emergency Campaign? Are such subscriptions deductible for income tax purposes ? By what means are such funds which are raised in Australia remitted to Palestine? Is it with the Treasurer's approval that moneys are levied from Jews in Australia to further the Jewish State? Will the Treasurer arrange for the Minister for External Affairs to instruct the officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service to ascertain the identity of those who have subscribed to the fund I have mentioned, the amounts which they have contributed, and what pressure, if any, was brought to bear on them? </para>

The answer is " No " in each case. With regard to the third question, I consider that it would be a dangerous practice to engage officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Servicein making inquiries concerning subscriptions made by individuals to variousfunds, unless such funds are to be employed for a subversive purpose. However, the honorable member suggests that the fund to which he referred falls within* that category, and I shall have inquiriesmade in regard to that aspect of the matter. </para>

The estimated return of lis. 2d. a bushel will be inclusive of freight, but exclusive of the tax payable to the wheat stabilization fund'. The Government consults the CommonwealthBank regarding the money ' to makefurther advances, not the Wheat Board- </para>

                            <para>- The Government believes that its duty is to govern; it has no hesitation in accepting responsibility for the decisions which it makes. The decisions which it has made in regard to the wheat industry so far have been sound. The position  of wheat-growers is so good, because of the sound policy pursued by the Government in regard to the industry and because of the operation of a number of other favorable factors, that several of their organizations are opposed to the early payment of further advances. One particular organization at Katanning in Western Australia carried a resolution that the Government should defer payment of any further advance until after June next. Obviously the reason for its request is that its members do not want to have to include any further income in their tax returns for the current financial year. Individual growers have also -approached me and suggested that no further advances should be made until after June. However, in order that the Treasury may collect the maximum amount of income tax in respect of the current financial year, it is likely that a further advance will he made to wheatgrowers in the near future. </para>

                                <para>- A substantial part of this year's wheat harvest was sold under contract to the United Kingdom at 17s. a bushel and to India at 18s. 6d. a bushel, with the proviso that, in the event of the ratification of an international wheat agreement by exporting and importing nations, the price to be paid by them for any of their wheat unshipped at the 1st August, the date upon which the agreement is expected to come into effect, will be brought into line with the price provided for in the agreement. I said that it was estimated that sales of wheat this year would return to the farmers lis. 2d. a bushel, less freight. The estimate was based on the fact that the Australian Wheat Board considers that shipments of wheat to the United Kingdom will have amounted by the 1st August to about 40,000,000 bushels at 17s. a bushel. The balance of the wheat purchased by .the United Kingdom under the contract will be sold to it at the prices provided for in the International Wheat Agreement, which, it is estimated, will range from 8s. 6d. to 12s. 6d. a bushel in Australian currency. </para>

                            <para>- I shall have inquiries made and furnish the honorable member with a reply as early as possible. I can only repeat the statement I made to the press recently about the seriousness of the shipping position should desertions from British and foreign vessels continue. Until recently, action has not been taken against British subjects who have deserted from British ships; they have been allowed to stay in Australia. That practice has been followed for many years. If persons eligible to come to Australia desert from foreign ships they, too, are allowed to remain here. Representatives of British firms, foreign governments, and foreign shipowners have pointed out the serious position that is developing as the result of these desertions. Apparently, Australia is proving so attractive to large numbers of the crews of vessels coming to this country that we shall be compelled to arrest and deport every deserter, otherwise ships will cease to come to Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Has the Minister for Immigration seen a report that the Melbourne Trades Hall Council has decided to demand that the Immigration Department should confer with Trades Hall Council officers before migrants are placed in industry and that it is seeking an assurance that a condition of admittance of migrants to Australia shall be that they shall undertake to join an appropriate trade union on arrival? Does the Minister intend to impose any conditions as to trade union membership on persons who wish to migrate to Australia? , I ask this question partly because it is well known that many migrants who are admittedly of a desirable type are coming to Australia because they do not desire to return to their native localities, which are now under the Communist control of the Soviet Union. </para>

If it be a factual statement of the decision of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council, it is not clear whether reference is being made to British migrants or to displaced persons. I surmise that it relates to the employment of displaced persons and not British subjects. There has never been any suggestion at any time that anybody should interfere with British subjects who come to Australia. We welcome them, and we use the good offices of the Australian Council of Trades Unions and the Trades Unions Congress of Great Britain to enable them to transfer from their British unions to appropriate Australian unions and thus be given all the advantages provided under </para>

I refer all matters of great public moment on immigration to that body for its consideration and report. I welcome the assistance and cooperation of all of those organizations. We are particularly anxious that people who come to this country should join trade unions, becauseunless a man joins a union he does not obtain the advantages of awards. We want to ensure that everybody employed in Australia shall enjoy full award rates and conditions and employment. We do not, want people brought to Australia to. be employed in circumstances that will break down Australian conditions. Thereis nothing wrong with that. We giveevery encouragement to persons to jointheir appropriate unions, and should any doctors migrate to this country we should' be glad to see them join the British Medical Association. </para>
                        <para>I see in that resolution, if  it becorrectly reported, some hostile intent in some respects.

I have already had several talks with them in order to get them tohelp me in the employment of certain Baits. I am sure that whatever difficulties exist can be ironed out to thesatisfaction of every one concerned. As a matter of fact, some time ago the honorable mem'ber for Henty introduced a deputation to me from the BrickmakersAssociation of Australia which was able to tell me that it had the support of the unions engaged in the brickmaking industry for its request that I allocate 50 Baits to the industry in order to step up* housing construction. I was only too pleased to co-operate with the unions and the employers in that case. The union covering that industry is happy to admit migrants to union membership-. I cannot see why that cannot be done in every industry; and any one who attempts to interfere with that course is doing a great disservice to Australia. </para>

Om the day of his discharge-, the 4th  January,  1946:, an ex-serviceman applied for a course of training as: a typewriter mechanic and submitted himself for am aptitude test, which he passed with a high average. He was then advised that he would be able to undergo a  course  of training as a typewriter  mechanic  although no such course was then listed. On the 26th March, 1946, he received a letter advising him that his application for full-time training in the course had been approved. A course of training as a business machine mechanic was mentioned in the letter. _ On the 26th November, 1947, he received another letter suggesting that he take some other course of training. As he did not desire to do so, he did not reply. On the 11th February, 1948, he received a further letter which read as follows r - </para>

                    <para>He replied to that letter and on the 20th February received a further letter advising him to call on the Deputy Director of Industrial Training, 3rd Floor, Craig's Buildings, Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, in order to make the necessary arrangement for a change of course without delay. When he called at the office he was told that there was no opportunity for him to undergo training as a business machine mechanic. He then suggested that he should undergo a course of training as a dental mechanic, but hewas later told that his education was not of a sufficiently high standard to enable him to do so. Alternative courses sug gested to him covered training as a chef or a. machinist in a trousers factory. </para>

                        <para>- The Government appreciates the difficulty that would be created in South Australia if the whole of the materials required for the Woomera guided weapons range were drawn from South Australian quotas. With regard to materials controlled by the Australian Government, it has been decided that supplies for the Woomera project shall be taken from supplies at the source of manufacture prior to allocation to the States. Thus each State will make its contribution. With regard to materials not controlled by the Australian Government, cement will be acquired mainly from Tasmania and partly from New South Wales and the normal allocation to South Australia will not be affected. Most of the timber will come from the Western Australian export quota, which is at present 10,000,000 super, feet. No State quota will be affected. </para>

                        <para>- I have made it clear previously that the Government does not in any way condone the ban on Dutch shipping. It has been the subject of a number of conferences between <inline font-style="italic">myself,</inline> the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Shipping and Fuel, the Stevedoring Industry  Commission, and the Dutch Minister in Australia. One of the first needs is to get to the Netherlands East Indies equipment and material associated with oil production. That matter is being dealt with now. . Other matters are being pursued in every quarter in the hope of facilitating arrangements to remove hindrances to trade between the two countries. </para>

                                <para>- 1 submit this motion with no sense of pleasure, but because my colleagues of the Opposition and I believe that in this matter there are issues of public importance which cannot be allowed to rest where they stand to-day. It may be suggested that we are trying to blacken the name of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane.</inline> That is not my purpose, and if that proposition be advanced, there are two comments that I desire to make at the outset in relation to it. First, if a cloud rests on the name of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane,</inline> it has developed from the legal proceedings that were instituted by the Government itself and if the Government does not do anything about the matter the cloud will remain. Only by a full public investigation can the Government hope to clear the name of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator, and</inline> to give general satisfaction to the community. My second comment is that there are many other persons whose names have appeared in the evidence given during the court proceedings. Included in these names are those of some senior officers of the Department of Trade and Customs. Their part has been referred to in judgments delivered by those who have dealt with this matter, and I say that it is in the highest public interest that those officers should have an opportunity to state publicly their part in the incident. Alternatively, they should be given the benefit of some official government statement clearing them of any suggestion of participation in what happened. There have been hints at improper co-operation or connivance on the part of certain officers. The Government has not made any statement in relation to these charges, and until it does so some sus picion must remain. The other important aspect is the manner in which the Government itself has handled this affair from the outset. I submit, and I propose to develop my submission later, that the Government is open to the gravest criticism for the manner in which it has dealt with this case since it was first made public. Those are the issues which I regard, and which the Opposition generally regards, as being of great importance. The roles of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goldberg</inline> are of secondary importance. The important issues are the restoration of public confidence in a great revenue-earning department, and the examination of the part which the Government itself has played in the matter. </para>

The purchases which Goldberg had made for Keane and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Keane</inline> were packed in four trunks. One of the trunks reached him in San Francisco already packed for <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Keane,</inline> he did not know what was in it. The other three were packed  by a representative  of  his. Goldberg said that there were some key chains belonging to him which had been packed in the trunks in error. They were intended for various friends whose names were inscribed on them. Apart from this, there were some da-ess rings and " some other goods " belonging to him the nature of which he did not specify. Kirk's two strings of pearls were included in the trunks. Before Keane's death, an arrangement had been made that he, his secretary Kirk, and Goldberg should enter into a business partnership. Goldberg was to find the money, Kirk was to 4o the work, and Keane was to " find the contacts ". Pursuant to this arrangement, Goldberg secured the agency for Australia for  Corocroft  jewellery (manufactured in America). After Keane's death, Kirk (Keane's secretary) gave Goldberg a letter addressed to Kerr (the representative in San Francises of a branch of the Division of Import Procurement of the Customs Department). The letter was in these terms - </para>

                    <para>Kerr gave evidence that in June, 1946, Goldberg produced the letter to him, and asked what could be done about it. - Kerr replied that it should be easy enough as he had a Miss Rosetta Kelly who was with him and was leaving by the <inline font-style="italic">Monterey</inline> within a few days. (Kerr, it will .be remembered, was a high officer in a Branch of a division of the Customs department, and Miss Kelly was secretary of another high officer in the division). Goldberg told Kerr that the trunks in question were at a certain, hotel, and Kerr sent a man who picked thom up. Kerr gave the man some labels and stickers to put on the trunks. They were put on, addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Keane.</inline> The trunks were brought to Kerr's premises, where he checked them personally. He then, had a conversation with Miss Kelly. Kerr believed that the goods belonged to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Keane;</inline> he had sent on other stuff foi- the Keanes. Goldberg did not ask or suggest that the trunks should be dealt with otherwise than as indicated in the letter. Kerr selected Miss Kelly to take the trunks because she already had sixteen pieces of baggage for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore</inline> (a high Customs official &gt; and Miss Baddick  (another of Iiia secretaries), so that the addition of another four (the trunks in question) was an  easy  matter. </para>
                    <para>Miss Kelly, on her arrival in Sydney, made a passenger's baggage declaration in which, under the heading " Goods landed for any other person," she included " four foot-lockers (trunks) <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. R.</inline> V.

                    <para class="block">These are the broad facts as they were presented to the court and which formed the  subject  of consideration when the appeal came before the Supreme Court of New South Wales. For reasons briefly indicated in the judgments which I have quoted, the Supreme Court of New South Wales upheld <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goldberg's</inline> appeal, and the fine of Â£250 was remitted. </para>
                    <para>There are other facts which should be presented to the Parliament. Even though they may not be of great legal interest or significance, they have a profound political significance. As I said earlier, the Government has been determined from the outset to smother up this matter as much as possible and to delay proceedings in order to save itself from political embarrassment. Here are some of the facts which, in my view, support the charge which I make. The fact was brought out in evidence that a departmental committee considered this matter as early as August, 1946. Present at the meeting of that committee were Mr.Maher, who was the principal witness for the Government ; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> who was then Minister for Trade and Customs ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy,</inline> the Comptroller-General of Customs; Inspector Gamble; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hendrickson,</inline> who is now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson.</inline> According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maher,</inline> a ministerial statement was prepared at that time. I point out to the House that no  ministerial statement has ever been made on this matter. The first Government statement in relation to it was in reply to questions which had been placed on the notice-paper by the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> in November, 1946. Honorable members will appreciate that perhaps there is some significance attaching to the dates which I have mentioned. August preceded the general elections of 1946. Although a ministerial statement was prepared prior to the elections, obviously it might -have been embarrassing for the Government to be called upon to make a full statement on the matter then. ]n point of fact, no statement has been made by the Government since that time. </para>
                    <para>Another matter which calls for attention is the bustling out of Australia of Miss Rosetta Kelly, who was the secretary to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> and on whose evidence the Government had to rely largely in deciding to institute a prosecution. Miss Kelly was allowed to leave Australia before the original hearing took place. She was not recalled as a witness at any time, nor has any public statement been made of the facts presented by her in this matter. After the prosecution had been launched, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goldberg</inline> was allowed to leave Australia on a business mission, and he was absent for several months. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> suggested at the time that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goldberg</inline> had been permitted to leave Australia so that the case would not be heard before the elections in New South Wales. As to whether there is substance in that charge, the House will form its own conclusion. The clrcumstances were extraordinary. A most serious charge, in which senior officers of the Department of Trade and Customs and a Minister of the Crown were involved, had been levelled against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goldberg,</inline> yet he was permitted to leave Australia on a business mission and he did not return until at least four or five months  later. </para>
                    <para>Another matter which calls for comment is that certain important witnesses who, one would have thought, would have been certainly desirable, if not essential, for the Government's case against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goldberg,</inline> were not called. Why, may I ask, was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirk</inline> not called? He was obviously a most material witness in this matter. He was the late senator's secretary and he, better than anybody else, could give the true facts. He was involved in the partnership arrangement which had been mentioned, and he was available to give evidence, if required. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirk</inline> was not called as a witness. One would also have thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore</inline> would have been a material witness, because his secretary had been asked to convey the luggage. He, himself, I suggest, had an abnormally large number of trunks to be brought back to Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore</inline> is no longer an officer of the Department of Trade and Customs. Why was he not called at a witness? Was he required to leave the department on account of this incident, or were- there other factors which led to his retirement? The Government has not given to us any information on the matter, and in the absence of information the Parliament and the public can merely speculate. </para>
                    <para>In this important case, in which the good name of the Government and its Ministers and an important department is involved, the Government produced only the barest evidence for the prosecution. It called only two witnesses in order to establish its case. When I referred the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> a week ago to a comment made by the Chief Justice of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Jordan, that " it was curious, to say the least of it, that Goldberg had been selected for prosecution ", the right honorable gentleman became indignant and sensitive on the matter. He informed the House that the prosecution had . been recommended by a departmental committee which had arrived at the conclusion that the only person against whom sufficient evidence lay was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goldberg</inline> himself. But this departmental committee, I gather, consisted primarily of officers of the Department of Trade and Customs. Certainly the evidence for the prosecution was given by officers of that department, and the Chief Justice of New South Wales found that they were the only persons who were apparently directly involved from the time the goods arrived in Sydney until they arrived and were delivered in Melbourne. These are matters which suggest that the Government will not be frank with the Parliament, and will not give the facts to the public. Apparently, the Government is endeavouring to smother up a full presentation of the facts. </para>

All parties appear to have been agreed that no guilt attached to her in any way, and that she was simply made a tool for the smuggling into Australia of the jewellery and other goods to be used in the partnership arrangement. The Chief Justice found it curious, to say the least, that "Miss Kelly is not called upon to give evidence in this matter ". Why has the Government not told the country her story? I come now to the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirk.</inline> I have already referred to the business arrangement. T do not believe that any honorable member opposite would suggest for one moment that the arrangement was not, in the circumstances, a grossly improper one. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirk</inline> was not called to tell his story to the court, and the Government has not made a public statement regarding what has been done in relation to him. Is he still an officer of the Department of Trade and Customs? If so, what position does he occupy in it? Has any disciplinary action been taken by the department in relation to him' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kerr,</inline> who was one of the principal witnesses called by the Government, was the representative at San Francisco of the Division of War Supplies Procurement. In evidence, he admitted that while a full-time officer of the Department of Trade and Customs, he was carrying on the travel agency. </para>

                        <para>I come now to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore.</inline> I do not desire to imply any impropriety against him, but fairness and justice demand that the Government should hold an inquiry at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore</inline> and others could explain just what part they were called upon to play. At present the Government, without justification, is allowing a cloud to rest upon them. As to the Comptroller-General of Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy,</inline> I am certain that every honorable member has the utmost respect for him, and complete confidence in him. I make no innuendo or any complaint against him in this matter; but the Government is not being fair to him or to the Department of Trade and Customs in allowing these matters to rest where they are. The case has received publicity in the court, and the names of these gentlemen have been bandied around, and they have not had an opportunity to tell the facts to the country. That is, in essence, the case which the Opposition puts before the Parliament in pressing for a public inquiry. We rest our demand, first, on the fact that senior officers of an important and respected public department have had their actions called into question and have not been afforded any opportunity to explain their conduct or the degree to which they were involved in this matter. In fairness to them and to the Department of Trade and Customs, and in order to restore the confidence of the public in that great revenue-producing department, an inquiry should he held. Secondly, we submit that the actions of the Government, in hedging with respect to furnishing information, in delaying court proceedings by every possible means, in limiting to the barest minimum the evidence presented to the court and in refraining until now from making any statement, call for the utmost condemnation and criticism by the Parliament. The. Minister for External Affairs has the opportunity now to clear up the matter. It is open to him to do so partly by making a statement in the House, but. in order to dispose of the matter adequately and to the satisfaction of the people he should accept our proposal. </para>

                            <para>. -  I accept the statement of the honorable member forFawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> that in submitting the motion before the House he is not actuated by personal animus against either the late. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> or his wife and that he has no base political motive for dragging their names into the mire in a controversy such as this. However, the importance of the motion before the House transcends the honorable member's personal assurance. The prosecution of Goldberg was one which was undertaken by the Commonwealth in due course before the ordinary courts of law. It was launched on the recommendation of the Comptroller-General of Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy,</inline> to whom the honorable member pays tribute, and the Solicitor-General, who is the highest law officer of the Commonwealth. From beginning to end a certain section <inline font-style="italic">df</inline> the press' has referred  to  the' pr'ose- cution a's" the "Keane" Luggage Ca'se", a*nd' although I accent unreservedly the honorable member's' disclaimer', the' fact remains that- a- deliberate' attempt &amp;aS been made', without- the slightest justification, to besmirch the reputation of th'e Me <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane.</inline> When the matter was mentioned1 in1 the House recently by' tile Honorable member he referred1 to a comment; made by the Chief Justice' of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in the course  6'f  a" jugement which h'e' delivered oxf the appeal lodged by Goldberg against his conviction. The  fact's"  fire that Goldberg' was prosecuted on a'- charge  6'f  unlawfully importing, or attempting to import, certain goods. T.h:6 decision fis" to _ th'e' witnesses to b'e called iri support of the prosecution was  in  the' hands of counsel, who' called the witnesses Whom they considered necessary to prove the case. Goldberg did not give evidence', and nine-tenths of the', statements mentioned .by the Chief Justice in the course of his judgment we're not facts proved to have existed, but were part  O'f  Goldberg's explanation, when he was interrogated by customs officials as to how certain goods entered Australia. 1 emphasize that it  was  Goldberg, artS Goldberg alone,  Who  made" the suggestion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> was involved in the matter. As I say, Goldberg did not give evidence, nor did his counsel call any evidence.  His  case rested oil the submission Of his counsel  that  there  *aS  not sufficient evidence to justify a conviction, because the law provides that a defendant can he convicted only when there i's no reasonable doubt pf his guilt. The explanation offered by Goldberg's counsel was that he bought the" goods, the subject of the charge, in the United States of America On <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane's</inline> behalf, but I stress the fact that a great deal of it was purchased after thd death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane.</inline> Ohe of the most important features of the case was the importation of four trunks of miscellaneous goods, including a large quantity of Corocroft jewellery. Goldberg took delivery of those trunks iri San Francisco. However, the jewellery was purchased after the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane,</inline> which certainly  does  hot suggest that the  late  senator had any  paM oV  parcel' iri th'e whole'. transaction Honorable  meMbers  will understand1 that when! a- prosecution* i&amp; undertaken audi the Crown has <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> rely'  oni meD  missions m'ade by the defendant,  all'  th&gt; statements m'a'de by bini' a-re  not  necessarily admissible in' evidence: In-  the*  case Goldberg made certain admissions a-nd offered certain explanations to customs' official's. He said, * I did this : I was a great friend of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane;</inline> arid this' is how it occurred "'  a'nd so'  on. Every lawyer, and1 most laymen, know that the prosecution, when'  it  places such statements before a court, does riot  a.Â«k  the court to accept' every exculpatory statement made by the defendant. Iri this case the prosecution said, * Here' Â£he person who imported the  good's  contained in the trunks arid he purchased them in the United States of America ". Anything else which Goldberg said was quite irrelevant. Counsel -for the prosecution would have been quite wrong to call Miss Kelly as a witness. According to the report of the committee whip" the Government appointed to inquire into the matter, Miss Kelly acted with perfect innocence and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Keane</inline> disclaimed responsibility for the importation of the goods. </para>

                        <para>Some time ago the names of certain officials' were' mentioned by the honorable mern ber for Wentworth (M-r. Harrison), who raised the matter in the  House,  and the Government appointed a special committee" comprising the acting Solicitor-General, the acting Crown Solicitor and the Comptroller-General of Customs to inquire into the matter. That committee had before it all the documents available in the case; including the  reports  of customs inspectors, arid it was asked to recommend what proceedings should be taken. I do not propose to traverse the entire contents of the committee's report, or of the documents which it had before  it,  but the substance of the committee's recommendations may be summarized as follows: (1) No case was made  Out  against Miss Kelly; (2) <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Keane</inline> was not involved  in  any  contravention  of the law-; (3) the facte disclosed a <inline font-style="italic">prima</inline><inline font-style="italic">facie</inline> ease against Goldberg of aiding in the importation of prohibited goods; (4) no  charge  could be levelled against Kirk; (5) there  was no evidence to  connect  any other person, holding an official position or otherwise, with the unlawful importation. That is the substance, if not the words, of the recommendation made by high officials in whom every member of the House has confidence. </para>

                        <para>So far from endeavouring to cloak the matter, the Government brought proceedings in open court, which is not the method one chooses when one wishes to cloak matters. Indeed, by bringing proceedings before the court the Government gave the fullest publicity to the matter. I emphasize that that has been the practice of this Government, without exception, since it took office, and I think that honorable members realize that fact. In this case we acted on the advice of responsible officers, and- the magistrate before whom the prosecution was conducted thought that there was evidence on which Goldberg could have been convicted. Goldberg subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court of New South Wales against that conviction. It went to the Full Court, but the Full Court thought the evidence was not sufficient for a conviction. I believe it is correct to say that the judgment, in substance, was that although Goldberg exported these goods from the United States, he did not import them into Australia. He was a passenger on the ship in which the various containers were carried, but there was not sufficient evidence to connect him with the bringing of the goods from the United States to Australia, although his dollars had purchased this jewellery in the United States after the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane.</inline> We have no jurisdiction over what happens in the United States. </para>

                                <para>- That is so. I refer particularly to a leading article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun Pictorial.</inline> The case was featured by the Murdoch press, which, no doubt, inspired the motion now before the House. The article contained several errors or misstatements in dealing with my answer to a question asked in the House by the honorable member for Fawkner. The first was that I had said that there was nothing curious about the selection of Goldberg for prosecution, but that the Chief Justice had said that it was curious that Goldberg had been so selected. It had been recommended by the committee that Goldberg only should be prosecuted and that is why he and no one else was prosecuted; but the press turned my words into a statement that I had "stoutly asserted that there is nothing curious about the case ", which I did not say. Of course there is something curious about it. My statement was completely twisted. Honorable members can appreciate how distortion and misrepresentation of this kind may injure innocent people. The next  missstatement  was contained in the following sentence: - </para>

                        <para class="block">I have never said that. It was because there was something curious about it that we got the committee to determine what should be done in the law courts. There is nothing curious or improper about the action taken by the legal authorities, in conjunction with the customs authorities, in prosecuting Goldberg. He was convicted, and, in the circumstances to which I have referred, his conviction was upset. That was the decision of the Supreme Court. The honorable member for Fawkner, having disclaimed any intention to injure the reputation of the late <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Keane</inline> - and I accept his disclaimer, though I cannot speak for others who have abused the incident - what was the purpose of the leading article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline><inline font-style="italic">Pictorial?</inline> It was nothing but a paltry attempt to hold <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Keane</inline> to ridicule, and to injure her late husband, who had been a distinguished servant, not only of the Commonwealth, but also of the State of Victoria which he represented in this Parliament. The last point made by the honorable member for Fawkner - and it was completely unjustified - was that an attempt had been made to smother up the case. I deny that there was any attempt to smother it up. Just imagine the charge that could be made in such circumstances when the case had been featured from one end of Australia to the other, not because it was of the slightest legal importance, or because it had any general significance, but simply because there was a political aspect to it. I deny that charge. As a matter of fact I, and my colleagues, the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> and the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna),</inline> issued the most rigid instructions to those representing the Commonwealth to press the matter forward with the utmost despatch. We cannot .control the order of business of the courts. There is another important aspect of the legal position. One of the points relied upon by Goldberg in his defence was the legal invalidity of the regulation under which the prosecution was brought. Apart from Goldberg's alleged implication in the importation of certain articles into Australia, it was contended on his behalf that the regulation under which the illegality was declared was itself invalid and outside the authority given by the Customs Act. At the time the Goldberg case was pending, the very matter of the invalidity of the regulation was being dealt with in the High Court of Australia. That caused considerable delay. I have dealt with the criticism regarding the failure of the Crown to call certain witnesses. Just imagine counsel being interfered with by directions as to what witnesses he should call. It was not the lack of witnesses that was important and decisive, but the fact that Goldberg's active connexion with the removal of the goods from the ship was not proved. This case was not brought out of any animus against Goldberg or anything of that kind. It is extraordinary to suggest the very reverse of that - that Goldberg was permitted by a government department to go abroad on a business trip during the pendency of the case. What has that got to do with it? Does <inline font-style="italic">tiu</inline> honorable member suggest that Goldberg was being treated too rigorously, or treated with too much courtesy or favour ? The honorable member cannot have it both ways. The truth is that Goldberg was treated as an ordinary litigant, and the delays were due to the causes I have mentioned. We tried to' prevent them. One of the causes of the delay was the High Court action to which I have referred. That is the sum and substance of the matter. </para>

The honorable member talked about certain high customs officials, and he mentioned the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore.</inline> That gentleman figured prominently in the case because on the same ship there were fourteen packages for him. He was, of course, one of the administrators, and the honorable member for Fawkner makes no suggestion against him. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Keane's</inline> name was on four trunks she had not even a key to them. That negatives, I should think, any suggestion of a personal connexion between her and the alleged unlawful act. I suppose she was in a complete state of distress after the sudden death of her husband. The matter of considering the various actions of the customs officers is clearly one for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy,</inline> the head of the department concerned. He was a member of the committee that made the recommendations upon which action was taken, and if there were any evidence of impropriety on the part of any customs officials that matter would, no doubt, be dealt with, in the due course of departmental administration. </para>

                        <para>Honorable members opposite are attempting to U:0 this prostitution as a means of discrediting this Government. That is an attempt that should be resisted. There is nothing in it. The administration of the law in relation to the prosecution has been fair and above board. Both the appeal and the original hearing were in open court. It is perfectly in order to comment on the case. The Chief Justice commented that the selection of Goldberg was curious, but, as I pointed out a few days ago, there were no facts before the court to show why a prosecution was launched against Goldberg. All that the court had to consider was whether or not there was sufficient evidence against him. Had we been given an opportunity to explain matters of that kind before the Full Court - an impossible suggestion, because it would have been outside the court's jurisdiction - a complete answer could have been supplied. I contend before the House that in this case the Government has acted openly, fairly and with single regard to the due and proper administration of justice. Any questions affecting individuals in this matter can safely be left in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy,</inline> the permanent head of the Department of Trade and Customs, to whom the honorable gentleman opposite paid a tribute in his speech, <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline></para>

                            <para>.- The whole of the defence of the Government in this matter by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> rests upon the report of a departmental committee. The right honorable gentleman promised to make that document available to a responsible member of the Opposition and I presume that it will shortly be in the hands of the Leader of of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> Is the Attorney-General content that the matter should rest on that report? If he is I believe that few honorable members opposite will agree with him. This is a case with wide ramifications, and the facts were clearly stated by the honorable member  for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt).</inline> The trunks in question were labelled with the name of -a Minister; they were packed in San Francisco on the orders of his secretary, and they were brought to Australia by the woman secretary of a senior officer of the Division of Import Procurement who was stationed in San Francisco. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>No one has yet mentioned that the trunks were held up in Australia by customs officials. It is most unfair to those men, who were doing their duty, that a proper inquiry has not been held. The explanation given by the Attorney-General is one that would not have been, believed even by Houdini, the escapologist who could get out of a trunk or a case without difficulty. The goods in question somehow got into a number of trunks and came to Australia escorted by an officer of a government department, yet nobody knows who put them, there. That is the same kind of story as is told by a man in the dock in a criminal court who, when asked to account for his possession of certain goods, says " A man in Bourke-street gave them to me ". The action taken by the Government is not fair to some senior officers in government departments, upon whom suspicion may fall. There must be a guilty person. Is the Government content to let him go free? </para>
                        <para>In addition to the Goldberg case, there was a prosecution in Melbourne which involved a young man who was formerly in the service of the Australian Government. He was accused of bringing a quantity of goods into Australia and of attempting to avoid the payment of customs duty. The evidence showed that the goods were the property or part property of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> a gentleman whose name has been mentioned in this case. The young man said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore</inline> had asked him to take the goods from America to Australia. It is apparent, therefore, that goods were coming into various Australian ports and that they were being held up, but the customs officers who did their duty in holding them up .have not been defended. A slur has been cast upon these men. Somebody is being shielded. Why was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> brought into this case? He was not then in Parliament; he was the political secretary to the Minister. </para>
                        <para>I agree with the honorable member for Fawkner that no blame may attach to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Keane.</inline> I consider that she and the young woman who accompanied the goods to Australia were probably quite innocent of what was happening. Nevertheless, somebody put the goods in the trunks in order to avoid the payment of customs duty. Some of the goods involved implicated certain people in Australia, but I do not intend to deal with that aspect in detail. The full list of goods was not mentioned to-day. There has been undue delay. Goldberg has been exonerated, but I believe that he played only a small part in this affair. If the Government does not hold a public inquiry or a royal commission and thus enable all those concerned to give evidence, it will itself remain suspect of condoning corruption, and will allow a slur to remain upon the name of the Department of Trade and Customs, which has, over the years, been above reproach. </para>

                            <para>. - I quite understand the difficulties of the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> in raising this matter, because it is difficult, to deal with a matter associated with a dead man, and I do not resent the honorable gentleman's action in raising it, notwithstanding that the subject must, cause great pain to the widow of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane.</inline> In some sections of the press, particularly one or two newspapers, however, a deliberate attempt has been made to imply that the Government is trying to cover the actions of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> in the hope that the Government will thereby earn opprobrium and the Opposition parties a political advantage. Life becomes a miserable affair if people delve into the grave in order to direct propaganda against the Government by casting doubt on a dead man's honesty. We have heard about customs officers. They are alive and can defend themselves, but a dead man cannot defend his name. I have been associated with the financial side of government for a long time and all I can say is that a clear direction has been given to all Ministers and heads of departments that regardless of how high or low the position held hy a person suspected or found guilty of dishonesty he shall not be shielded , I feel keenly that public administration must be scrupulously honest.  It is perfectly true that the judgment of governments may warrant criticism, but once the suggestion is made that a Minister of the Crown is dishonest, he should not fill an administrative post until his name has been cleared. A dishonest man is not worthy to hold public office. When this subject first arose, three of the most reputable public servants in Australia were asked to examine it and make recommendations. The Attorney-General has already fully dealt with that aspect and all 1 need to add is that officers of their standing would refuse to be influenced by any Minister in a matter like this. The three officers who made the inquiry and the recommendations on which the prosecution of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goldberg</inline> was based were the Acting Solicitor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitlarn,</inline> the  Deputy  Grown Solicitor in Sydney, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> and the Comptroller-General of Customs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kennedy.</inline> I do not think any honorable member who has had any association with them would imagine that they would succumb to influence. </para>

                    <para>That the bill be now read a second time. </para>
                    <para>The purpose of this bill is to enlarge the Commonwealth Parliament. During the first half century of Australia's his tory as a nation its population has more than doubled. During these years there has also been a great expansion, under the stimulus especially of two world wars and a world depression, of the responsibilities borne by this Parliament. The bill seeks to enlarge the membership of both Houses of the Parliament so that the numbers will be more in keeping with these fundamental factors in our political life. </para>
                    <para>In order to function efficiently, a democracy must devise a system of representation of the people in which the diverse views and interests of the community can find' expression. This cannot be achieved if the number of representatives is too small. There is no automatic scale of numbers or areas for securing the best democratic results. Nevertheless, it is clear that Australia has altogether outgrown the small Parliamentary bodies with which the federation was equipped in 1900. How small numerically is the Commonwealth Parliament, in comparison with some of the State legislatures, can be seen from the following figures :  - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="196331194804161_18_0.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para>The Constitution empowers the Parliament to increase its membership if it thinks fit, but lays down certain conditions which must be observed. The most important of these conditions is the rule, set out in section 24, that the number of members of the House of Representatives must always be "as nearly as practicable " twice the number of senators. If, therefore, the number of representatives is to be increased there must of necessity be a correlative increase of the number of senators. Accordingly, this bill effects an increase of the number of senators, with the appropriate correlative increase of the number of members of the House. </para>
                    <para>The bill provides that there shall be ten senators for each State instead of six as at present. Thus, if the bill is passed, the total number of senators will be  increased from 36 to 60. Authority for the proposals contained in the hill is provided by sections 7 and 14 of the Constitution which set out, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> that the Parliament may make laws increasing or diminishing the number of senators for each State, but so that equal representation of the several original States shall be maintained, and, further, that whenever the number of senators is increased the Parliament may make such provisions for the vacating of the places of senators as it deems necessary to maintain regularity in the rotation. </para>
                    <para>Section 24 of the Constitution lays down that the number of members of the House of Representatives shall be, as nearly as practicable, twice the number of senators. Therefore, if the number of senators is increased, as provided in the bill now presented, the number of members of the House of Representatives must be correspondingly raised to a number, as nearly as practicable, twice the number of the senators. The actual number will probably be 121, </para>
                    <para>Pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution, and the Representation Act 1905-1938, the actual increase of the number of members of the House of Representatives representing the States which will follow the passing of this bill will be from 74 to 121. There will be no change in Tasmania, but in the other States the numbers will increase as follows: - </para>
                    <para>New South Wales- from 28 to 47. </para>
                    <para>Victoria- from 20 to 33. </para>
                    <para>Queensland - from 10 to 18. </para>
                    <para>South Australia - from 6 to 10. </para>
                    <para>Western Australia - from 5 to 8. </para>
                    <para>At this point it might be explained that the representation of the several States in the House of Representatives is determined by dividing the number of the population of each State, as revealed at the last census, by a quota ascertained by dividing the number of the population of the Commonwealth by twice the number of senators. </para>
                    <para>The proposed enlargement of the numerical strength of the Commonwealth Parliament which the passing of this bill will permit is regarded as both necessary and warranted. Since the establishment of the Commonwealth the population of Australia has more than doubled. To be exact, it has increased from 3,765,339 in 1900 to 7,580,820 in 1947. At the time of the Senate elections in 1903 1,893,586 electors were enrolled. To-day the number is 4,780,334, or more than two and a half times as many. In 1903, in the aggregate, there was one senator for each 52,596 electors. To-day the ratio is one senator for each 132,787 electors. If the number of senators is increased to 60 as provided in this bill, the ratio at the next elections will be one senator to each S3,000 electors approximately, which is fewer, proportionately, than in 1903. </para>
                    <para>In 1903, each member of the House of Representatives represented, on an average,' 25,247 electors. To-day the average is 64,599, whilst if Tasmania is omitted, and allowance made for the expected rise in enrolment in the meantime, the average for the mainland divisions towards the end of this Parliament will be about 69,000 electors. However, if the number of members of the House of Representatives be increased to 121, the average number of electors per member at the time of the next elections will be reduced to approximately 41,300, or, omitting Tasmania, 41,680. </para>
                    <para>In 1903, the Senate and House of Representatives taken together provided one representative in the Commonwealth Parliament for each 17,059 electors. Today the ratio is one for each 43,457 electors. With the Senate membership increased to 60 and that of the House of Representatives to 121, at the time of the next elections there will be one representative for approximately each 27,600 electors. Therefore, referring again to the 1903 figure, on a proportionate basis there is an argument for an even greater increase of the membership of both chambers than is proposed in this measure. </para>
                    <para>The average numbers of electors for each representative in the State Parliaments of Australia, including both upper andlower Houses, are as follows: - </para>
                    <para>New South Wales, 12,532 electors for each representative. </para>
                    <para>Victoria, 13,657 electors for each representative. </para>
                    <para>Queensland, 10,744 electors for each  representative. </para>
                    <para>South Australia, 7,148 electors for  each representative.  "Western Australia, 3,756 electors for  each representative. </para>
                    <para>Tasmania, 3,290 electors for each representative. </para>
                    <para class="block">For some time past there has been a strong body of opinion that, having regard to the growth of population and the marked expansion of Commonwealth interests and activities, the numerical strength of the National Parliament should be substantially increased. The Parliament of Canada, which dominion comprises an area roughly one-fifth larger "thai* that of Australia and has a population of about 12,000,000, provides probably the best parallel with. Australia. It consists: of a Senate of 96; members- and a House of Commons, of about 250 members. The Australian Government' is- Con'.vinced that in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth, the Parliament ought to- be enlarged to- the degree pro.vided in. the bill, and' since; in any case1, a redistribution of the electorates is due prior' to the next elections; the Government considers' the present to be an opportune time at which <inline font-style="italic">t&amp;</inline> effect such enlargement. </para>
                    <para>It is- proposed to- bring the Senate up to the' full strength of 6'0' senators' a's1 from t&amp;e day of fee first meeting of the Parliament after the next dissolution of fee House of Representatives. This will benecessary in order that membership of th'e Senate' sba-11, from that date, be approximately half of that" of the House of Representatives' a's is1 provided1 <inline font-style="italic">m the'</inline> Constitution. Accordingly, the bill provides feat apart from any long casual vacancies that may haw to&gt; be1 filled, sevensenators shall be chosen m' each- State at the1 next elections. </para>

                    <para>In 1918, the "preferential block majority " system was introduced in respect <inline font-style="italic">df</inline> Senate elections. This system continued the principle of the old "first past the-post" system in that under it all seats. in a State generally go to the. party, or combination of .parties, 'favoured at the time. by a bare,- or simple, majority of the electors. It might 'be described as the "..all or .none'" system, either all or none of a party's candidates being elected. The system used since 1.918 may'be considered an improvement on the old system only to the degree (hat it ensures majority representation as against possible minority representation. The great defect, from the representation aspect, of both the old "'first past the post ".and the more recently used " block majority " system is that at an election, generally all seats in a 'State are won by candidates o'f 'the one party, leaving ,a minority of between 40 to '50 per cent, of the electors without :any representation at all in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> ."Senate. "For many .years there has been .a demand 'that 'the Parliament should provide ,:a system of 'electing senators which would give more equitable results, and enable: the electorate to be more truly-represented in the Senate. The G.o- vernment has given careful consideration bo the matter [and has closely examined alternative methods. Jit h$s '.decided that, in relation <inline font-style="italic">Â£o</inline> the .election :of senators, ,where each .State 'votes ;as .one electorate, .the .fairest system -and .the one most .likely to enhance .the ^status .qf the Senate lis that of proportional representation. </para>
                    <para>The bill -sets out in. detail -the method, of counting ipr.oposed.to be adopted tin respect of ,future elections of .senators. The method is .generally in r.accord with the practice laid down -by the 'Proportional Representation .'Society. AH I need say about the principle is that the marne of the system indicates the result -intended to be achieved,, that .the electors -will be represented, in the number of the.se elected, approximately proportionately to their expression of opinion. -For example, if -five are to 'be -elected and one .party's candidates &lt;po'll 55 -per cent, of -the total votes, the -result - would 'be -that 'that party would have -three candidates elected, and the remaining two elected, assuming that only two parties contested the poll, would be candidates o"f -the opposing party and would represent -45 per cent, of the electors. This system follows closely the provisions contained &gt;in the Proportional Representation Bill 1912 of' Great Britain and the system employed in respect of municipal elections in the United Kingdom and -South Africa. It is virtually identical with the method used in the election of the ^Parliament of :Eire and is similar to the -system which was employed in i respect o'f 'parliamentary elections for the Legislative Assembly in 'New South Wales from 192.0 to 11925. In principle, the method proposed lis 'the same .as that used in Tasmania although 'for reasons of workability .and simplicity it differs slightly in its practical application. </para>
                    <para>It .is not proposed  to  alter the - existing style of .the Senate ballot-paper or the provision 'that  'Candidates  i may be grouped thereon with their mantes in such order within the' group. as they desire. .Nor is it intended to .vary -the .(requirement that voters must indicate -the order of their p reference for all the-candidates. (Whilst this latter requirement might have the effect of continuing to produce a -fairly high informal vote, .it definitely precludes -.the  possibly greater evil of exhausted votes- that -is, votes  which  become exhausted in the process of transfer. If a voter were to indicate his preference for only three of, say, seven candidates, his vote would be effective up to the number of preferences shown on his ballot-paper and after that it would be effective no longer. At that stage, the vote would be said to be exhausted. In Tasmania, the elector need not vote for all candidates and therefore on occasions a fairly high percentage of votes becomes exhausted in the process of transferring the votes of a lower candidate or the surplus of a higher candidate to the next candidate in order of preference. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. One result of a system which does not require the electors to vote for all candidates whose names appear on the ballot-paper is that a candidate may be declared elected although the total number of votes credited to him falls short of the required quota. At the parliamentary elections in New South Wales in 1922 and 1925, the exhausted votes, which far outnumbered the informal votes, were the cause of niuch dissatisfaction and disputation. </para>

                    <para>Clause 8 prescribes the manner in which it is proposed that the several vacancies shall be filled. As hitherto, the count will be carried out under the direction of the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for the State concerned in the offices of the respective Divisional Returning Officers. For instance, in New South Wales, where there will be 47 divisions, the count will be carried out at 47 points. This will ensure completion of the count with the greatest safety, the maximum of speed and the minimum of cost. When the Commonwealth Electoral Officer has received the final results of the count of first preference votes from all returning officers and has totalled them, he will determine a quota by dividing the total number of first preference votes by one more than the number of candidates required to be elected and by increasing the quotient so obtained by one. That appears to be complicated, but if in New South Wales, for example, there were 1,600,000 valid votes and seven senators had to be elected, the total number would be divided, not by seven, but by eight, giving a quotient of 200,000. This would give a quota of 200,000 plus one. </para>
                    <para>This formula for determining a quota, which, in effect, produces the lowest number which, when multiplied by the number of candidates to be elected, leaves a remainder of votes less than that lowest number, is the one recommended by the Proportional Representation Society and is used in Tasmania, in Eire, and generally in all places in British communities where proportional' representation has been applied. Any candidate who, either on the count of the first preference votes or at any subsequent stage, obtains a number of votes equal to or greater than the quota shall be elected, and until all vacancies have been filled, the surplus  vote9  - that is, any number in excess of the quota - of each elected candidate will be transferred in the manner set out in the bill to the continuing candidates in strict proportion to the voters' next preferences. </para>
                    <para>The method of disposing of an elected candida te's surplus votes prescribed in the bill is the one recommended by the Proportional Representation Society and is precisely the same as that used in Eire and in municipal elections in Great Britain and South Africa, and it is similar to the method which was employed in connexion with the parliamentary elections in New South Wales in the early nineteen- twenties. It differs from the Tasmanian practice in that whereas in Tasmania all the votes of the elected candidate are transferred at a fractional value so that every single paper is looked at, under the proposed method only such number of votes as equals the surplus, taken in strict proportion to the preferences on the whole of the votes of the elected candidate, are transferred. No doubt that provision will require some consideration in committee. </para>
                    <para>It is thought that the Tasmanian system, while suitable where the number of votes is comparatively small and all such votes are concentrated at one centre, is&gt; not readily capable of being efficiently worked by too remote a control. I'n order to employ that system at a Senate election, it  would first be necessary to assemble the whole of the ballot-papers for the State at one centre. Not only would that delay completion, involve risks of loss in transit, and increase costs heavily, but also in the larger States the Commonwealth Electoral Officer would be faced with the almost insuperable task of securing for a period of several weeks the extensive accommodation, equipment and staff needed. Whilst it might be claimed that the Tasmanian system is mathematically more exact, tests that have been made reveal that a similar result is obtained by the employment of the method proposed. As an illustration, I shall state a hypothetical case in New South Wales and for this purpose I shall assume for the moment that a Labour candidate has received 900,000 votes of the total number of 1,600,000. The quota being 200,000, he has a surplus of 700,000 votes for distribution. This would usually result in three full quotas being obtained for other candidates on the list. The proposal embodied in the bill is that the officers will not look at all of the votes.. They will take the surplus available and will assume that the No. 2 vote, which would be the effective vote in the first instance, would reproduce a proportion in respect of the surplus of 700.000 that would be true of the total of 900,000. Tests have shown that the result would be the same as if all of the 900,000 votes were scrutinized. </para>
                    <para>Questioned as to the likelihood of difference, eminent mathematicians advised the Proportional Representation Society of England that " Whenever a considerable number of votes is in play the element of chance involved is so small as to be negligible ". Dealing with the point in its comprehensive report on electoral systems, the United Kingdom royal commission of 1908 said, " The chance of the result being affected is too small to be seriously considered. We agree with the Proportional Representation Society that the additional labour involved (in the Tasmanian system) is greater than it is worth ". In a report furnished in 1913, a committee consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> E. Packer, Chief Electoral Officer for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> L. Piesse. LL.B.. and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> F. Daly stated <inline font-style="italic">inter alia, "</inline> We are justified in saying that in each district at each of the three elections - fifteen contests in all - the result would have been the same with the English rules as with the Tasmanian rules . . . We therefore recommend that if the form of the rules should again be considered by Parliament the English rules be adopted ". Thus it will be observed that a responsible local committee reported in favour of the adoption in Tasmania of the time-saving method of dealing with surplus votes proposed in this bill. </para>
                    <para>The bill further provides that if after the count of the first preference votes or after the transfer of the surplus votes of an elected candidate at any stage, no candidate or less than the number required to be elected has or have obtained the quota, then the candidate with the fewest votes shall be excluded and the whole of his ballot-papers transferred to the continuing candidates; and if thereupon no candidate has yet reached the quota, the process of excluding the candidate with the fewest votes and the transferring of his ballot-papers will continue until a continuing candidate has received a number of votes equal' to the quota or in respect of the last vacancy a majority of the votes. </para>
                    <para>Where candidates are elected at the same time, the order of their election shall be determined by the extent of their surplus votes.  The  candidate with the largest surplus shall be the first elected and so on. The same principle will apply in relation to the transfer of surplus votes. The largest surplus will be transferred first and so on. If on any count two or more candidates have an equal number of votes and one of them has to be excluded the Commonwealth Electoral Officer shall decide the candidate to be excluded, or if two or more candidates are elected with an equal number of votes the Commonwealth Electoral Officer will decide the order of their election and the transfer of their votes, or if in the final count for the filling of the last vacancy two candidates have an equal number of votes, the Commonwealth Electoral Officer will decide which shall be elected but that except as so provided the Commonwealth Electoral Officer shall not vote at the election. That is really the last resort. The chance's against its happening in a Senate election are enormous. </para>

                            <para>- That is a gross understatement. Probably millions of millions would be nearer the mark. The result of the system is clear. There will be two major groups of political parties, and seven Senators will be elected, in the absence of any casual vacancies, in each State. The party which secures 53 per cent, or 55 per cent, of the aggregate votes will, provided the party ticket is followed, have four of the seven candidates to be returned. The three remaining seats will be filled by the candidates from the other party which secured 47 per cent of the votes. That is certain. </para>

                            <para>- It operates in municipal elections in the United Kingdom and South Africa, and in the national elections in Eire It also operated in elections held in New South Wales between 1920 and 1925. However, this matter is somewhat complex and difficult, and I do not desire to elaborate it now. In Tasmania, every vote is examined, and the proportion is attached to the No. 2 preference in each case. I shall explain the reason why the alternative method is proposed for Senate elections. Let us suppose that the leading candidate in New South Wales has 900,000 No. i votes. Then 700,000 votes would beavailable for distribution on the assumption which I mentioned. </para>

                            <para>-.- That is the only part in which the selection will be taken. Instead of selecting all the surplus ballot-papers and applying to each a fractional transfer value, the electoral officers will select at random that number of surplus ballot-papers which isascertained by multiplying the total number of surplus ballot-papers by the fraction. In 98 per cent, or 99 per cent, of instances the electors will vote the party ticket. The honorable member is aware of that. </para>
