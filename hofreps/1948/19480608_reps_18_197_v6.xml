                        <para>- It is reported in the press that the leader of the Australian Goodwill Mission to the Par East, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmahon</inline> Ball, told Malayan, Chinese and Indian representatives that Australia's opinion on the. White Australia policy would change within ten years, and that misunderstandings in Malaya over the White Australia policy were the result of individual administrative acts. I ask the Prime Minister whether those reports are correct. If they are, will the right honorable gentleman inform the House whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmahon</inline> Ball was authorized to discuss the White Australia policy on behalf of the Government? Bid his remarks represent a new departure from government policy as propounded by the Minister for Immigration? Does this mean that the Government is prepared to abandon the White Australia policy, which has been the basis of our development as a white race? </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that the Acting Leader of the Opposition has asked this question, because its gives me the opportunity to state without the slightest equivocation that there has never been any suggestion of any deviation whatsoever in the fundamental migration policy of the Australian people, supported as it has been since Federation by every political party. The recent press reports from Malaya relating to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmahon</inline> Ball represent no action, direct or indirect, on behalf of the Government in connexion with the same fundamental subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmahon</inline> Ball's official duties in South-East Asia' were confined, as I told the House last week, to two matters, and two matters only ; first, the organization of relief for the people in those areas who needed it, the Australian Government' having made a post-Unrra contribution for the assistance of people in that area; and, secondly, arrangements and machinery for the awarding of scholarships or studentships to persons in that area, which would bo tenable in Australian educational institutions. Those matters, and those matters alone, were committed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmahon</inline> Ball, and anything else said apart from them simply represents action of a personal character. </para>

                                Ball is carrying out duties on behalf of the Australian Government, and particularly the Department of External Affairs. J. do not wish to say more than that they are limited to the matters I have mentioned and do not include any others. I am glad of the opportunity, to .make that statement. There has never been any suggestion of a deviation in any respect from the accepted immigration policy of the Government, which, as I have pointed out before, has been that of every government of this country.

                        <para>- The daily press recently published some articles dealing with the distribution of profits, if any, resulting from the operations of the Joint Organization and the Australian Wool Realization Committee. Those articles tend to mislead the Australian wool-growers and the Australian public. The position is that the Government has stated that any profits accruing to Australia as a result of the operations of the two organizations to which I have referred will he distributed to those wool-growers who participated in the war-time wool marketing scheme, and has announced its intention of bringing down in the September session of the Parliament the legislation necessary to enable that distribution to be made when the scheme is wound up. The cost of Australia's participation in the scheme was approximately Â£40,000,000. At the time of the purchase by the Australian Government of the wool accumulation in the United Kingdom, it was estimated that it would take from seven to fourteen years to liquidate it. The surplus wool has been marketed so freely in recent years that it is now estimated that the liquidation can be completed in approximately seven years. It must, however, be clearly understood ' by the Australian wool-growers and public that no distribution of profits can be made until the scheme is completely wound up. It is true that at .the moment substantial sum? stand to the credit of the disposals scheme, hut, pending the disposal of the whole of the wool, it is not possible to say what the final amount will he. That is due  to the fact that the Australian Government, in conjunction with the Governments of the United Kingdom, South Africa and New Zealand, annually fixes a reserve price for the incoming clip. It is the responsibility of the marketing organization to buy in, if the growers agree to sell it, any portion of the clip that does not realize the reserve price. That means that, in the event of a catastrophic fall in the price of wool, the Joint Organization and the Australian Wool Realization Committee would be faced with the responsibility of buying in substantial quantities of the current year's clip. Under those circumstances it will- be seen that there is no  possibility of a distribution of any of the moneys being made until the scheme is finally wound up. </para>

                        <para>- I do not usually read the <inline font-style="italic">Sunraysia Daily,</inline> but my attention lias been drawn to the fact that there was ;m article in that paper - I do not know of what date - suggesting that one of the famous bands of the United Kingdom should be brought to Australia in connexion with the tour of Their Majesties and  Her  Royal Highness. No consideration has been given to such a proposal by the Government, the Minister in charge of the Royal visit or myself. I should think at the moment that the provision of accommodation in connexion with the Royal visit will he very difficult. The various States will have to provide accommodation for the Royal party and those associated with it. My first reaction to the suggestion is that apart from the expenditure involved, the provision of the requisite accommodation and transport would present a problem. However, I shall discuss the suggestion with the Minister in charge of the Royal visit. </para>

                        <para>- The Acting Leader of the Opposition asked a question with relation to this matter on the first day of the resumption of the sittings of the Parliament following the recent recess, and in my reply I indicated that Cabinet would recommend to the Ministerial party at its meeting next Wednesday that land sales control and prices control should be handed over to the State governments within three months and rent control within two months. On that occasion I simply said that that was the recommendation being made, and I did not elaborate the matter except to add that whatever administrative assistance could be given to the States in undertaking this task would be given. I might add now, however, that the departments concerned have been instructed to give to the State governments which will be taking over these controls the assistance which they require. With respect to staffs, assistance will be given by the Public Service Board, and with respect to administration it will be given by the Prices Commissioner. One important reason which actuated the Government in making its recommendation was that if the matter were allowed to drag on for any length of time present employees in the Prices Branch and other departments who are mainly temporary officers would most likely, owing to uncertainty about their positions, seek employment elsewhere. That has already been happening. Apart from that, it was considered that there might be some feeling that the Commonwealth officers no longer had the authority that they have previously had in view of the fact that prices control is to be handed over to different administrations. It was also considered desirable that all the physical resources available for the control of prices should be handed to the States as early as practicable and that if the transfer were delayed for too long the Commonwealth officers in the Prices Branch would have been appointed to other positions, which would have placed the States at an immediate disadvantage. </para>

                        <para>- It was stated ' in the press at the week-end that Australia and Poland had signed at Lake Success on Friday an agreement whereby Australia will give Poland wool worth Â£250,000, and will pay for its shipment. I want to know from the Minister for External Affairs what the terms of the agreement are. I also ask whether other nations are participating in the gift to Poland, and whether in fact Poland is a satellite of Soviet Russia and has refused Marshall aid because of that fact. What generally are the reasons for singling out a Soviet satellite for such relief, and what relief of a similar character has been given to the Netherlands and other allies in the war ? </para>

                            <para>- I am not able to give all the details, but as I intimated to the Acting Leader of the Opposition earlier, postUnrra contributions by Australia through the United Nations include gifts of wool. I' shall obtain full information for the honorable member. I think that six countries participated in these gifts which were organized through the United Nations. Poland was one of those countries. I shall furnish the honorable member with the exact terms of the agreement. Certainly there has not been any selection of a particular country or a particular people. The one object has been to meet the requests of the Economic Council of the United Nations that these gifts should be made. At the moment, I cannot give the full list of such gifts, but I shall obtain it for the honorable member. I assure him that there has not been any discrimination of the kind he has mentioned. </para>

                        <para>- Can the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction say whether all building classes under the Reconstruction Training Scheme in New South Wales have been closed and the instructors paid off although 400 recommended men are waiting for training? Has the closing of the classes followed an order from the trade unions? If so, what order was given, by which unions, and to whom? This matter is causing considerable concern in other States. In Queensland young ex-servicemen who were selected for training, but have not begun their courses, are wondering if they are to be deprived of an opportunity to train as apparently has happened in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- Some weeks ago, in the temporary absence of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, I drew the attention of his colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service, to a deadlock which had developed in one of the industrial committees functioning under the reconstruction training scheme. I asked whether, as a result of a union representative having refused to approve of certain establishments, the proprietors of which are members of the Timber Merchants Association, approval had not been given to the transfer of reconstruction trainees to any of those establishments. E understood that the Minister for Labour and National Service was to confer with the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction to see whether the difficulty could be resolved. Is the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction now able to make a complete report as to the success of the negotiations ? </para>

                                <para>- An obligation is laid on the industrial committees set up within the Department of Post-war Reconstruction to approve or disapprove of proposed employers for those who have been partly trained under the reconstruction training scheme. The honorable member will recollect that training is given up to 40 per cent, efficiency, the men being then placed in industrial establishments. During their period of further training, until they reach 100 per cent, efficiency, their employers are subsidized by the Government in order to make up the full award wages of the trainees. It is the duty of the industrial committees to approve of the employers concerned. It is necessary to have an authority to approve transfers, because experience has proved that some employers do not deal fairly with the trainees. That applies to only a small minority of employers, but, it is necessary to safeguard the interests of the trainees themselves. In addition to the union representatives on the industrial committees, there is a  chairman  who is an officer of the Department of Post-war Reconstruction and a representative of the employers, and the committees as a whole have to approve particular employers in relation to this scheme. It is true that some difficulties arose with the Timber Merchants Association, but it is not true, though I do not know whether the honorable member for Fawkner has suggested it, that all members of the Timber Merchants Association have been placed under a ban by the union representatives concerned. </para>

                                <para>- If that was the honorable member's information it is incorrect. Some members of the Timber Merchants Association have been approved by the industrial committee as suitable for giving employment to these trainees, but some difficulty has arisen in regard to six others. The industrial committee will meet at the end of this week, and it is hoped that a satisfactory conclusion will be reached. The committee will probably not approve of at least one of the six firms concerned, but in most cases I think that a satisfactory result will be achieved. </para>

At that time, in good faith, I read portions only of the telegram - which appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> - but as it coincides with another received from the same source, it may be that there are <inline font-style="italic">two</inline> organizations. Knowing what we do about the Minister for External Territories, and the strange things he is reputed to have said and done in New Guinea and Papua lately, we may have been misinformed. I shall therefore read the full text of the message, which was addressed to the Prime Minister, who, I understand, received it. It is as follows : - </para>

                        <para>Despite numerous urgent representations, no positive information has been made available regarding long awaited revised salary rates including marginal allowances which have operated in Commonwealth Public Service for many months although Papua-New Guinea Service classification allegedly based on Commonwealth standards. Cost of living soaring here. For example electricity charges under new scale average Â£(! 10s. monthly per household and large number officers literally unable pay. Recently announced shipping fares and freight charges will further increase financial burden. Local price control system is considered utterly futile. Actual cost of living figures reliably computed submitted Minister last February received only formal acknowledgement but no evidence of positive effective action. All possible reasonable representations have been made to Territories without result except bare acknowledgements. Salary rates of administration personnel compare most unfavorably with those of Commonwealth officers serving here whose recent increased tropical allowances and retrospective marginal allowances aggravate position. </para>

                        <para>In view special protest meetings to be held throughout Territory, Thursday, June 3rd, would appreciate definite information by radiogram on following matters. Firstly Minister's proposals regarding salaries in relation local cost of living. Secondly precise nature of retrospective marginal allowances referred to in various official memoranda and when they will he paid. Thirdly specific ministerial action proposed regarding exorbitant electricity charges. We submit in all sincerity that persistent frustrations and disappointments combined with numerous resignations and failure to recruit new members in Australia make maintenance of efficient Public Service quite impossible.

                        <para>- It is true that the Government, through my colleague the Minister for Supply and Development, off cred a reward for the discovery of new deposits of uranium and thorium from which atomic energy may be produced. So far no one has claimed the reward, but I understand that a number of prospectors are still hopeful of making such a discovery. It is hoped that, as the result of the offer of the reward, new deposits of these two materials may be discovered in Australia and thus ensure that we shall have available the raw materials from which atomic energy may be produced in the future. </para>

I refer to the case of Mr. Lars Gustav Brundahl. a wealthy German, who, before the war, was German Trade Commissioner in Australia, and who was interned throughout the war as a dangerous alien. Since his release, among other exploits, he has been convicted of offensive behaviour, in the unlawful shooting of a neighbour's dog, and of. spitting on a woman. For good measure, he stated in the court that he was an associate of Mr. J.S. Garden. How did it come about that this man was allowed to remain in Australia when Other prominent Nazis were deported? Were any representations made to the Government in his favour, and, if so, were any made by Mr. Garden?Finally, having regard to Brundahl's  notorious conduct, will the Minister immediately deport him so that he may cease any longer to be a nuisance in this country ? </para>

                        <para>- Jurisdiction over deportation and the right of any alien to remain in this country has been vested by an act of this Parliament in the Department of Immigration. An act of Parliament was also passed the effect of which was that matters df this kind should be referred to a special royal commission and Mr. Justice Simpson was appointed for that purpose. I am not conversant with the facts of the case to which the honorable member has referred, but I shall ascertain from the Immigration Department and the Commonwealth Investigation Service the facts relevant to the honorable member's question and shall inform him in full of those matters which still require .answering. As to aliens who had been interned, the Parliament considered that their right to remain in this country should depend on a recommendation of a judicial tribunal. Whether or not such a tribunal dealt with Brundahl's  case, I do not know. I shall ascertain the facts and inform the honorable member. </para>

                        <para>- The whole matter of petrol usage is being reviewed. Arrangements have been made by the Minister for Shipping and Fuel to second from the Rationing Commission the Director of Rationing, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cuming,</inline> who in conjunction with officers of the Department of. Shipping and Fuel, is making a complete examination of all issues of petrol. The objective to date has been to ascertain what allowances are not absolutely essential. That, of course, does not exclude such allowances as are now made for private cars. The Minister for Shipping and Fuel and I have merely had an interim report so far, and I cannot give any indication of the result of the investigations until they have been completed and I have received a final report. However, it is hoped that, by tightening up the issue of licences and the quantities of petrol allotted to certain classes of motor cars, it will be possible to reduce consumption, without any hardship, to a rate that will conform to the quantity of petrol that we hope to be able to obtain and for which we hope to be able to pay. That relates to petrol. The use of aviation spirit is also being examined by the Department of Shipping and Fuel in conjunction with the Minister fc r Civil Aviation and his officers. I am not able to give any information about that investigation at the moment because I have not received an interim report yet. </para>

Did the Government make inquiries about the standing of the men and their wives before they were sent to Malaya? What steps are being taken to protect the interests of these Australian women? Is it not a fact that the manner in which these people were deported has resulted not only in offending the peoples of South-East Asia, but it has also caused embarrassment to the British authorities in Singapore ? Does the Prime Minister not agree that avoidance of mistakes of this kind would do much more to further goodwill for Australia in South-East Asia than the sending abroad of goodwill missions which, to say the least, are received very coolly. </para>

As the honorable member has suggested, some of the regulations applicable to the Royal Navy Iia ve been altered. This action has been referred to as the " democratization of the lower deck ", but some of the changes made by the British Admiralty in this respect merely bring its practices into line with those of the Royal Australian Navy. Now, I come to the matter about which the honorable member is so concerned. The regulations applicable to the Royal Australian Navy have been altered in conformity with the changes made by the Royal Navy, particularly with regard  to the extension of the period of service for chief petty officers, and others. I have discussed the matter of promotion from the lower deck with the present Chief of the Naval Staff with the object of enabling the Royal Australian Navy to avail itself to the fullest degree of the trained and skilled men from the  lower  deck. It is the policy of the Government to extend,wherever possible, the avenues for promotion whether they are from the lower deck in the Royal Australian Navy or from the ranks of the Army or the Royal Aus-  tralian  Air Force. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to provide for the payment of an additional special grant of Â£1,000,000 to Western Australia in the current financial year 1947-48. This payment has been recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in a report dated the 24th May, which  was  tabled recently for the information of honorable members. Under the States Grants Act (No. 2) 1947, a total amount of Â£5,042,000 was provided for special grants to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania in the current financial year. These special grants were recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its fourteenth report. Subsequently, the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania applied to the Commonwealth for additional special grants in 1947-48. These applications were referred to the Commonwealth Grants Commission, and its recommendations are contained in the report of the 24th May. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth Grants Commission takes the view that a system of paying additional special grants is undesirable in principle. The reasons for this view are referred to in the report of the 24th May, and are set out in more detail in the commission's fourteenth report. However, one major reason advanced by the commission is that the practice of recommending additional grants late in the financial year would be incompatible with the obligations of the commission and with the proper exercise of the financial responsibilities of State treasuries. This view is shared by the Australian Government. The commission considers, however, that from time to time it may become necessary to depart from this general principle in order to meet emergencies. Therefore, the applications by the three claimant States for additional special grants in 1947-48 have been examined by the commission with these considerations in mind. </para>
                    <para>The commission has reported that, compared with the estimates available when making its recommendations in the fourteenth report, there has been some improvement of the finances of South Australia and Tasmania. At the time the commission made its original recommendation the deficit expected by South Australia, after receipt of the grant recommended by the commission, was  Â£655.000.  and the deficit expected by Tasmania was. Â£528,000. On the basis of figures available at the 30th April this year, the deficit expected by South Australia is Â£600,000 and the deficit expected by Tasmania is Â£300,000. In view of these facts, the commission has reached the conclusion that it would not be justified in making the departure from the principle which would be involved in recommending additional special grants to these two States in 1947-48. </para>
                    <para>The commission considers, however, that the case of Western Australia is very different. Whereas at the time of the commission's fourteenth report the expected deficit of Western Australia in 1947-48 was Â£285,000, it is now estimated to be Â£1,397,000, so that there has been a deterioration of Â£1,112,000. Increased costs of Â£250,000 due to the 40-hour week, and increased losses of Â£546,000 on railway operations have contributed to this position. These arc factors beyond the control of the State, although, as the commission points out, the losses on railway operations might have been reduced by increased freights and fares. This possibility, however, was taken into account by the commission when it made its former recommendation as to the special grant which should be paid to Western Australia in this financial year. Social services expenditure has also increased by Â£505,000. The commission notes, however, that this increase, though substantial, is almost certainly not so great as to outweigh the favorable 'adjustment in respect of this class of expenditure to which Western Australia would be entitled in due course by virtue of the fact that its expenditure <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> is lower than that of the non claimant States. Hence the Commonwealth Grants 'Commission has reported that a strong case exists for departing from the -general principle, and making a supplementary payment of Â£1/000,000 to meet the special circumstances affecting the Western Australian budget for 1947-48. </para>
                    <para>The special grant already being paid to Western Australia in 1947-48 amounts to Â£1,977,000. Of this amount, Â£1,556,000 represents the grant assessed on the year of review 1945-46, and Â£421,000 an advance payment recommended by the commission on the ground that the assessed grant would not suffice to meet the indispensable needs of the State in 1947-48. The Commonwealth Grants Commission has indicated that if its prosent recommendation is approved the additional grant of Â£1,000,000 would be added to the advance payment of Â£421,000 already made this year, and the total amount of Â£1,421,000 would be adjusted by the commission in 1949-50 when the year 1947-48 becomes the year of review. The Commonwealth Government has closely considered the commission's report, and has decided that in view of the special circumstances referred to in the report, the commission's recommendations should be adopted. Accordingly, I commend this bill to honorable members. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is a short measure dealing with the election of growers' representatives on the Australian Apple and Pear Board. Honorable members will recollect that last year the Apple and Pear Organization Act was amended to provide for the reconstitution of the Australian Apple and Pear Board. Provision was then made for the members representing the growers to be elected by a poll of growers of not less than 5 acres of apples or pears, or apples and pears. It was intended that candidates nominated for election as growers' representatives should also possess the qualification of being growers of at least 5 acres. However, it has been found that there is a weakness in the wording of the act which would permit the nomination and election to the board of a person who may not himself be an actual grower of apples and pears. This amendment will correct the .position. I submit the bill for the favorable consideration of honorable members. </para>

                    <para class="block">On Friday I was dealing with the history of the wheat industry in Australia and endeavouring to reply to various statements that had been made by honorable members opposite. I referred to the fact that in the 1930's circumstances arose overseas that affected the price of Australian wheat and caused hardship to Australian wheat-growers, but none of those circumstances affected the industry so drastically as the legislation introduced by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> when he was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. A3  a result of the restrictions imposed by that legislation production was so reduced that Queensland was unable to grow sufficient wheat to meet its own requirements for human consumption, let alone to supply stock food markets and 'the like, and Australia missed the opportunity to supply markets in adjoining countries such as New Zealand and India. The tragic policy of paying large sums of money to growers not to grow wheat was in force at a time when the Government was paying for the erection -of factories in which power alcohol was to be extracted from crushed wheat. Large sums of money were expended upon projects that were designed to consume wheat, but growers were paid not to grow it. One wonders what sort of an outlook the Government had. When I said that wheat imported into Queensland from the southern States of Australia cost ls. 6d. or ls. 7d. in freight charges in addition to the price of 4s. a bushel, the Vice-President -of the Executive Council interjected to say that that was not true. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable gentleman examines the official report he will :see the statement in regard to which he interjected. I repeat that the lowest price *ait which wheat -could be imported into Queensland from the southern States was 5s. 6d. or 5s. 7d. a bushel. That figure was made up of a first payment of 4s., plus ls. 6d. or ls. 7d. cartage costs. Whilst those sums 'were paid from the Treasury, the honorable gentleman refused to allow -individual Queensland growers to grow more than 3,000 bushels and so avoid unnecessary transport charges. It -was only when production decreased to as low as 57,000,000 bushels that the Minister lifted that restriction and permitted growers in Queensland to increase their production. But following that action, when growers were able to produce the quantities they desired, the honorable gentleman entered into the agreement with New Zealand which was inimical to the industry. Later, the present Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> introduced a measure which had many commendable features which I supported. However, it contained a retrospective provision under which an amount of 2s. 2d. a bushel was paid into the stabilization fund in respect of a crop which had already been sold, delivered and paid for. That provision brought about the down-fall of the scheme. Now, the Minister says, in effect, " The industry shall take what I think is best. I have submitted a proposal to the growers, and they have turned it down. I shall therefore ignore the growers and their representatives on the boards handling the affairs of the industry." The Government through the Minister persists in ignoring the advice of the growers when making contracts for the -marketing of primary products. It is applying that policy in respect of not only wheat but also other primary products, and has enacted several measures on that pattern. The -Government provides for the election of growers representatives on commodity boards, but in all cases 'the Minister retains an overriding authority and he takes care to exercise it. The protests voiced by my colleagues and myself against that policy have been justified by action taken subsequently by the Minister. The reaction of the growers to the Government's policy generally and to this agreement in particular is to lose confidence in their industry. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">Growers must have confidence in their industry if it is to succeed. Where confidence is Jacking we shall not be able to increase production. Such confidence can only be established when the views and advice of growers are respected by the Government, and when the Government acknowledges the growers' ownership of their product. The honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duthie)</inline> referred to this bill as a co-operative measure. When he was criticizing the attitude adopted by members of the Australian Country party towards this agreement I interjected that the Government Â«ras pursuing a policy of socialization and State control. The Australian Country party favours co-operation in industry and co-operative marketing. It upholds the principle that growers are the owners of the commodities they produce, lt is an accepted principle in cooperative marketing that the whole of the realizations, less handling and marketing expenses, shall be paid to the growers of the product. Marketing schemes which <inline font-style="italic">are</inline> based on that principle have invariably been proved to be successful. Who else has a right to those realizations? Even if the Minister acts as the representative of the Government in making contracts of this kind, the Government has no right to take possession of the proceeds from sales because, morally and legally, the product belongs to the growers. The Government is not justified in abrogating that principle; but it has done so in cancelling the contracts made on behalf of the industry. The Minister, following that course, sent <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCarthy,</inline> of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, as the Government's representative to the conference at Washington. We have not been told whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCarthy</inline> acted on his own initiative or on the Minister's instructions while participating in the negotiations. </para>

                            <para>- As I have said, the Government has completely ignored the growers in this matter. The Queensland Wheat Board had not even seen a copy of this agreement up to Wednesday last, whilst the Australian Wheat Board has criticized the agreement and intimated that it knew nothing about it. The Minister admitted that fact when replying to a question in this chamber. Whilst this agreement will have the effect of decreasing present prices, the Government has ensured that it will not affect our existing unfavorable agreement for the sale of wheat to New Zealand. Although Article XVII. provides that in respect of any agreement entered into prior to the 1st March, 1947, for the purchase and sale of wheat the Government concerned shall supply full particulars as to quantities and other details and that these shall be taken into calculation, no specific provision is made for. a review of the pricefixed under the New Zealand agreement. Nevertheless, such action is being taken to the disadvantage of Australian wheatgrowers in respect of our contracts with India and Great Britain. This agreement will have no effect upon our agreement with New Zealand, under which the Australian taxpayer is subsidizing the NewZealand taxpayer to an amount of nearly <inline font-style="italic">Â£2,000,000</inline> annually. </para>

                    <para>This agreement does not guarantee that, buyers shall buy, or sellers shall sell. I admit the difficulty of making such a provision in an international agreement. Indeed, the enforcement of such a provision might involve an act of war. Li is clear that under this agreement buyer? can buy on an advantageous market such as exists to-day from their point of view. But they need not buy during the latter part of the term of the agreement when, if the Minister's assumption be correct, we shall have caught up with production and there will be ample wheat available on the world market, allowing for the free wheat which the United States will then have for disposal as surplus stocks as -well as the stocks of Russia and Argentina. When that time comes </para>
                    <para>We  shall have no guarantee that buyer countries which are signatories to this agreement will adhere to their bargain under it. No provision exists for the enforcement of the terms of the agree1 ment so far as the sellers are concerned. I said in reply to an interjection by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture on Friday that it required consent of two-thirds of the sellers to make any variation. That means two of the three  seller-nations - the United States of America, Canada and Australia. Australia does not command one-third of the votes, and, unless it induces the other two to agree to its demands, its views will not prevail. The agreement does not provide for a price sufficient to cover the cost of production in  the  fourth and fifth year of its operation. <inline font-style="italic">In</inline> the hope that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, in his speech in reply, may be able to set my fears at rest, [ direct his attention to the fact that it appears that the differential freight charges and the hard wheat premium, which, in effect, means that Australia's wheat is not worth so much as wheat grown in Canada or the United States of America, will mean that Australia will receive, under the agreement, ls. a bushel loss than the maximum price of 12s. a bushel. The basic minimum price for 1948-49, the first year of the agreement, is fl.SO. The basic minimum price will descend on a sliding scale in the next four years to $1.10. That will mean a return to 5s. 4d. a bushel at ports to the Australian wheat-growers in the fifth year. So, where is the guarantee of a minimum price of 6s. 3d. a bushel in the fifth year, when ls. a bushel has to be deducted to meet the differential charges and the hard wheat premium? In the fourth year of the agreement, the guaranteed yield to the Australian growers will be only 5s. lid. Neither figure is equal to the  present  cost of production. That is  the  strongest argument against the agreement. The committee appointed by the Government to determine the cost of production of wheat in Australia reported that it cost 6s. 3d. a bushel to grow wheat on present costs. So, with the costs increasing, how can we be assured that the coat of production will be met under the agreement? </para>

                            <para>- The council may, in certain circumstances, vary the price within the maximum and minimum basic prices, but supporters of the Government have described the agreement as a measure to stabilize the wheat industry. When the lag in wheat production is caught up and supplies are plentiful again, we shall find the minimum prices operating, and that may be four or five years henceThen, the Australian wheat-growers will have to supply S5, 000,000 bushels of their grain at 5s. llÂ£d. a bushel at ports in the fourth year of the agreement and at 5s. 4d. a bushel at ports in the fifth year. The growers are required to. accept less than world parity for their wheat now when they are entitled to some compensation, and less than the cost of production towards the end of the term of the agreement. The agreement, in effect,, applies to the total quantity of wheat produced by Australia after edible needs and supplies for other industries have been catered for. Annual production- of wheat in Australia amounts to about 150,000,000 bushels. In time of drought it is considerably less. Hence, we may find it difficult to fulfil our contracts. We use about 40,000,000 bushels or more a year to feed ourselves and considerable quantities to feed our stock. We have to supply 85,000,000 bushels to comply with contracts made under this agreement and we have to place 25.000,000 bushels in the wheat pool. If one adds 40,000,000, 85,000,000 and 25,000,000 bushels and the number of bushels of wheat used for stock feed, we exceed the average annual production of 150,000,000 bushels. In addition to the other shortcomings of this agreement, it provides for no stabilization fund into which money could be paid at times when prices are sufficiently high to offset the effects of the slump in prices when it comes, as it undoubtedly must. I agree with stabilization of the wheat industry and to the degree that the wheat stabilization legislation provided stabilization for the industry, I agreed with it, but I told the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, when the scheme was propounded, that its retro-active provisions presaged its doom. We have a chance when world wheat prices are high to take advantage of them and provide for stability in future years when lean times come to the industry. The agreement provides for the sale of cheap wheat to countries that we are not obliged to assist, except on humane grounds, which, I have to admit, must be considered. I agree with other honorable members that the agreement is seriously deficient in that it contains no provision  for the inclusion of a fair percentage of flour in the contracts of delivery. The Minister himself seems satisfied- that we have no need to worry on that account, but I have yet to be convinced that if cheap wheat is available from countries outside the agreement, the buyer countries will be charitable and stick to their contracts. They will stick to the letter of the law and, when it suits them to demand fulfilment of the contract in wheat and not flour they will demand fulfilment in that way. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)</inline> rightly stressed the interests in this matter of the employees of the Australian flour mills. The Government should show more concern for them. Another important aspect of the need to mill in Australia as much of our wheat as we can is that the offal is essential as stock feed. It is absolutely necessary for the poultry, egg-producing and pig-growing industries whose1 products are urgently needed in the United Kingdom. The offal is also being used increasingly as stock feed by dairymen. Breeders of stud stock also are engaging more and more in that kind of feeding of their herds in order to achieve the best results. In droughts offal is used as stock food in other primary industries. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hamilton)</inline> was twitted by honorable members opposite with having exposed himself to ridicule by, on the one hand, claiming that he stands for the principle of an international wheat agreement, and, by on the other hand, criticizing the terms of this agreement. It is nonsense to claim that the honorable member displayed inconsistency in that respect. Of course, one can stand for a principle and disagree with the means by which the principle is applied. We agree with the principle of selling our wheat to New Zealand, but vehemently disagree with the Government for bartering it for far less than the cost of production. The honorable member is entitled to his view - and I share it - that however good" in principle an international wheat agreement may be, the present agreement contains so many deficiencies and anomalies that it is worthless to the wheat-growing industry of Australia. Experiments with international agreements since the termination of World War IT. have all proved unsuccessful. For instance, there were the international monetary agreements of which much was heard a year or two ago. To-day, we seldom hear the subject mentioned. We also have an International Food and Agriculture Organization, hut when we had a surplus of various primary products in this country and sought some information as to what countries required them, two or three months elapsed before any advice was received. If that is an example of the operation of international agreements, it is time we abandoned them. If the people of some nations are starving, as we are led to believe, the International Food and Agriculture Organization of. the United Nations should be able immediately to say in what countries shipments of food are urgently required. I do not think we have any reason to hope for any better co-operation under the Internationa] Wheat Agreement than we have had under the other international arrangements to which I have referred. The Internationa] Wheat Agreement suits wheat-importing countries at present and that is why we find 34 such nations prepared to enter into it. But there is no protection for the exporting nations. Particularly would such protection be necessary towards the end of the term of the agreement. We are prepared to assist Great Britain and Other countries that are worthy of our help, and have indicated their worth by the spirit in which they endured suffering on behalf of others, but I believe that those nations and our wheat industry could be assisted better by means of direct contracts than by the setting up of an international organization. </para>
                    <para>Briefly, my criticism is that the agreement is deficient in principle, unsatisfactory to the industry, and so lacking in any assurance of implementation that we should not proceed with it. As the agreement has not yet been ratified by the American Congress, what does the Government propose to do in the event of the failure of Congress to ratify it? Are Australia and Canada alone to represent the wheat-exporting countries in the agreement? Or is it proposed to defer ratification by Australia until America has ratified the proposal? Should we by any chance take the -premature step of ratifying the agreement only to find that the United States of America had decided  againstparticipation,  thus making its large surplus production of wheat available to the world's markets, the result would he similar to, but of course of far greater magnitude, than the disaster we are now suffering, because of the agreement made by this Government for the sale of wheat to New Zealand. </para>

                        <para>.- For some clays we have been considering in this chamber a bill to approve the acceptance by Australia of the International Wheat Agreement. The House was particularly interested in the second-reading speech of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard),</inline> who attempted to convey, not only to honorable members, but also to the country, the impression that the negotiation of this agreement had been a real achievement by the Government and its representatives. Indeed, the Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lemmon),</inline> who was the second Government  speaker  in this- debate, suggested that the agreement was a charter for the wheat-growing industry. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In the course of the debate, great disappointment - and that is stating it mildly -has been exhibited by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and other Ministers at the lack of enthusiasm for the agreement on the part of members of the Opposition. That lack of enthusiasm is based on very real factors. Many of these have already been dealt with by Opposition speakers, and I do not wish to go over all the ground that they have covered. However, I believe that it is well worth while pointing out that any proposals affecting the wheat industry advanced by this Government are immediately suspended by the wheat growers throughout the length and breadth of the land. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, and also the Prime Minister on occasions, have taken full credit for what they consider to he the prosperity enjoyed by those engaged in wheat-growing and other primary industries ; a credit that does not rightly belong, to them, because conditions in our primary industries to-day are incidental to the times in which we live. We on this side of the chamber are particularly keen on the adoption of some scheme which will safeguard the wheat-growing industry of Australia. No other industry, primary or secondary, has suffered the same fluctuations of fortune as the wheat industry has experienced. Many attempts have been made, particularly by Governments formed by the Liberal and Country parties, to bring about some degree of stabilization in the wheat industry, and it was with that purpose in view that in the early nineteen-thirties, when the industry was experiencing one of the worst periods in its history due to low prices, droughts, and other factors, negotiations were entered into by the Lyons Government for an international wheat agreement. That agreement was reached, but unfortunately, as the Minister pointed out in his second-reading speech, it failed because one of the signatory nations did not fulfil its undertakings. Upon the outbreak of World War II., certain action was taken by the Menzies Government to assist the wheat industry by enabling the marketing of its product to proceed even under the exigencies of war. Later, a stabilization scheme was approved by the Parliament, at the instigation of the then Minister for Commerce, the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline> Under that scheme, a certain basis of security was provided for wheat-growers. Until then, all efforts to stabilize the wheat industry had been made when prices were low. For instance, the 1933 International Wheat Agreement was not made with the object of keeping prices down; it was made specifically to ensure higher returns to growers in the signatory countries. However, during World War II., and particularly since the war ended, the price of wheat, in common with that of other commodities, both primary and secondary, has continued to rise. Although a sound basis for the conduct of the wheat industry during the war had been established by the Menzies Government, as soon as a Labour Government assumed office,  it immediately began to upset arrangements. For instance, it repealed the Wheat Stabilization Act passed in 1941, and substituted for it what has become known as the Scully plan. That plan, which was designed for  the  political advantage of one party, was responsible for a progressive decline of wheat production, with the result that Australia, instead of being an exporter of wheat, became an importer. Australia had been selling wheat at from 4s. 8d. to 5s. a bushel, but when it became necessary to import wheat we had to pay a great deal more than that for it. In pursuance of his party-political plan, the then Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> actually indulged in the futility of subsidizing farmers hot to grow wheat. 1. know what the answer of the Minister is. I heard him say last week that the Government acted on the recommendation of a very prominent man in the wheat industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teasdale,</inline> I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teasdale</inline> made the recommendation. I have no doubt that the arrangement was a very good <inline font-style="italic">onn</inline> from the point of view of individual growers in "Western Australia, but it was a very bad one for Australia as a whole, and for the people of the British Empire who needed wheat. Moreover, it cost the taxpayers millions of pounds, and deprived the country of the value of the wheat which would otherwise have been grown. The Government also took upon itself to decide which industries were in need of cheap wheat, and, what is more important, to decide that the wheat-farmers should be the one section of the community to bear the cost, of providing the cheap wheat. The Government's decision to sell wheat for stock feed in Australia at less than the world's parity price, and even below the guaranteed home-consumption price, gave rise to one of its first conflicts with the growers. I do not deny that it is the duty of the Government to assist industries in need, but surely this assistance should be on a national, not on a sectional, basis. Any assistance given to the  poultry  industry, or the pig industry should be a't the expense of the people as a whole, and not at the expense of one section alone. "When prices rose, the Government introduced another wheat stabilization scheme based very largely on the scheme that had been repealed in 1942. I was then, and I still am, in accord with the general principles of the scheme, but with some of the details, I, and the wheatgrowers generally, are in complete dis- agreement. As the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann)</inline> pointed out. the Government attempted to make retrospective collections under the wheat tax. It ruled that wheat that had already been sold and paid for should pay the tax. The Government also continued the practice of making the wheat-farmers bear the cost of providing cheap wheat for other industries. The wheat-growers accepted without any qualification the proposal that wheat for local human consumption should be sold to consumers at less than the world parity price because they remembered vividly the time when the consumers paid them 5s. 2d. a bushel, although the world parity price was only about 3s. The growers, however, do not agree that the same principle should be applied to stock feed, the demand for which fluctuates very greatly. Before the war, only about 10,000,000 bushels a year were used for this purpose, but, because of drought, and for' other reasons, the demand during the war rose to more than 40,000,000 bushels. ' The agreement which we are now considering postulates that 25,000,000 bushels a year wil be used for stock feed, but there is no assurance of that. The quantity might very well decline to something far below 25,000,000 bushels, and I am not overlooking the fact that we have made a contract to supply a fixed quantity of eggs to Great Britain. Stock feed represents a variable quantity, and is not a stabilizing factor in the price of wheat. The growers resent the proposal that wheat for stock feed should come out of the pool, and be sold at what is normally regarded as the home-consumption price. The present Labour Government and its Labour predecessors have consistently refused to allow the growers to take full advantage of high wheat prices. On the contrary, they have insisted upon sellingwheat at less than the world parity price. In normal times, this " bearing " of the market is a very dangerous practice. If supply equates demand, the action of one seller in offering a commodity, whether it be wheat <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> wool <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> anything else, at less than the ruling price can have a disastrous effect upon prices generally. The only reason why the Government's policy in regard to wheat sales has not caused greater loss to the growers of Australia is that in recent years the demand has greatly exceeded the supply. Thus, although the world parity price was from 12s. to 16s. ,a bushel, the Government was. able to sell wheat to New Zealand at r&gt;s. 9d. a bushel, and still not produce any important effect upon the general level of prices, but the effect upon Australian wheat-growers was very serious indeed. There can be no doubt that when the Government sold the wheat to New Zealand at 5s. 9d. a bushel it intended that the  growers  should receive only that price. The Government had made a bad deal against the advice of the Australian "Wheat Board, but it was not until the Government realized that its action was unconstitutional - although that would have been a minor consideration, I suggest - and that the political effect of attempting to apply such a policy would be disastrous to the Labour party, that it decided that the growers should receive the world parity price for the wheat supplied to New Zealand. I have never known a government to be more extravagant with the taxpayers' money than is the present Government, which now expects the taxpayers to bear the burden of the bad deal with New Zealand. Recently the Government made contracts with Great. Britain and India, but I believe that the people of Australia desire that, a great deal more assistance should be extended to Great Britain by Australia, than is the case at present. Public opinion is very strong on this vital question of assistance to the Motherland. T contend that, the question of assistance to Great Britain or any of the devastated countries of Europe should be approached from a national point of view; it is not a responsibility devolving on any particular industry in this country. Whenever the question of selling wheat, meat, butter, or -any other commodity arises in this House, and ft protest is made about prices, the Opposition is immediately accused of supporting the making of large profits out of the desperate conditions at present existing in Great, Britain. The Government immediately shelters behind the suggestion that it is in the national interest to ask individual sections of industry in Australia to provide such assistance. Consequent on this policy it makes contracts with Great Britain for the sale of wheat, again ignoring entirely the recommendations of the Australian Wheat Board. It suggest? that Great Britain should be provided with wheat at ls. 6d. a bushel below parity price, whereas in respect of India the Government insists that the parity price shall be charged. </para>

                            <para>- I should be very interested to hear the Minister explain thiposition, but in any event what happened, was that the Government - against the recommendation of the Wheat Board - made contracts with England at that time, for the supply of certain  quantities of  wheat. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> said that when the pronouncement regarding those contracts was made, the whole of the conditions were published. It is noteworthy that in respect of New 'Zealand, the contract price was very much below parity. There is a greater disparity now. That contract is preserved completely by the terms of the international agreement now before us, but in respect of Great Britain and India the contracts are varied to the degree that wheat not delivered before August this year will be charged for at the new price, not the old. Is it surprising, therefore, that. Opposition members have evinced no great enthusiasm for the agreement, that, we are suspicious, and that we examine closely any suggestion or agreement brought forward by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture or any other Minister of this Government? </para>

                    <para>I remind honorable members that when v/e were previously considering questions of stabilization, and international agreements, prices were low, and our main object when engaging in those negotiations, was to secure a higher price for our commodities.

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">It is perfectly obvious that when the Government engaged in those negotiations it was actuated by certain fears, since found to be unwarranted. I recall hearing the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. .Scully),</inline> when Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, expatiate on the New Zealand agreement; he pointed out that it would probably be a great boon to the wheat-growers of this country, but be has been peculiarly silent on that aspect of the matter during the present debate. Doubtless with the intention of lowering prices, the Government is now asking the wheat-growers of Australia to forego their entitlement to substantial sums of money which are already practically within their grasp, in order to obtain a " long-term agreement ". The Government intends not only to reduce the prices embodied in contracts already entered into, but also -to compel Australia to supply wheat to the 33 signatory countries at  a price very much below world parity. Various -estimates of the amount that the wheat-growers are being asked to contribute towards obtaining that security have been made, but I shall not attempt to make an estimate. It- is perfectly clear that, having regard to the variations brought forward, wheat-growers, under *he contracts already entered into, stand to lose Â£12,000,000 or Â£13,000,000 this year. That is a very substantial sum. Undoubtedly, some very extraordinary conditions are imposed under the agreement. Under this agreement Australia is committed to build up carry-over stocks amounting to 25,000,000 bushels of wheat at the end of each wheat year. In the normal course of events we inevitably have carry-over stocks; but under this scheme the farmers are to be compelled to deliver their wheat to a stated -authority, and to accept a certain price for it, irrespective of what the world price may be. Who, under all these changed conditions, is to be responsible for financing these 25,000,000 bushels and what, price will he paid to the growers in respect of that wheat ? That is a pertinent, question. If the cost is to be met by the general pool, and wheat-growers are to be asked to finance the carry-over of 25,000,000 bushels, surely they have something to complain about. The agreement contains a most curious provision under which the Australian Wheat Board - which, I understand, will be the constituted .authority - when world prices fall below the minimum price established in the agreement, will be asked to build up price stabilization stocks. .In other words, it is contemplated that the board shall buy 8,500,0.00 bushels of wheat for that purpose. If the price rises, and world parity is above the maximum price established by the agreement for that particular year the Australian Wheat Board will be asked to sell these reserve stocks. Again I ask, Who is to be responsible for financing these reserve stocks? Is the requisite finance to be provided out of the common pool? Will the wheat-growers be asked to finance the stabilization of their own industry, or is it intended that the Government shall undertake it? I ask these questions because, in spite of the attempt of the Minister to convey an atmosphere of optimism, that desirable condition does not exist among the wheat-growers. If the Minister is so optimistic as to the final results of this agreement, why does the bill in no way commit the Government to ensure that the terms of the agreement shall actually operate during the five year period? If the price stabilization quota fails' and we are unable to dispose of our 85,000,000 bushels of wheat - to say nothing of the additional wheat we may have in any particular year - apparently the Government proposes to do nothing about it. The fact that the wheat-growers are to give up from Â£10,000,000 to Â£20,000,000 under this agreement apparently means nothing to the Government. The growers, themselves, will be expected to meet any losses. It would do much to gain the confidence of honorable members on this side of the House, and of wheat-growers throughout Australia, if the Government would agree to the insertion of a clause in the bill ensuring that the conditions set' out in the agreement shall be the minimum conditions that the wheat-growers will enjoy . during the next five years. </para>
                    <para>I do not propose to support the bill unless the Government is prepared to accept an amendment by which the acceptance of this international wheat agreement is deferred until a poll is taken of registered wheat-growers of Australia and the agreement, is assented to by a majority of them. I am not prepared to sell the substance which the wheat-growers now have for the shadow which the Minister has so optimistically forecast. </para>

                    <para class="block">It seems to me that consideration, of this agreement can be approached from at least two angles; first,, is it in the best interests of Australia that we should approve of an international wheat agreement at all, and1, secondly, is this agreement of such a character that it will be to the advantage of Australia in the longrun ? As to the first question, I think that there- is no shadow of doubt whatever that it is to the advantage of Australia to- join in an- international- wheat agreement. Thehistory of the treatment' of the wheat industry by governments throughout the years proves? that every government, irrespective of it's- political' colour, has endeavoured! t-o&gt; conclude- am internationalwheat agreement. The reason for that is quite plain. History shows that the wheat industry is subject to&gt; very violent price fluctuations. At times the price of wheat has. reached the very low levels of ls&gt;. lOd. and ls. 3d. a bushel.. At other times the price in the world's markets has been very high. While I was overseas last, year I was informed that certain European countries were paying Argentina 25s. a bushel for wheat. I think that that was- a disgraceful pried The Argentine Government was evidently exploiting to the utmost possible degree the misery and suffering of the peoples of Europe. I mention that price merely to show what violent fluctuations have taken place over the years. When prices are high the producing countries, and producers generally, always optimistic, say, " We do not want an international agreement of any kind ". They believe that the high price will last quite a long time and, naturally, fear that an international agreement would be of no. value to them ; but when prices fall to very low levels they invariably favour an international wheat agreement. When prices are low, too, let it be said, the growers: in the wheat-producing countries always turn to their governments for assistance. Over the years, I understand that the wheat-growers of Australia have received government assistance to the amount of  Â£40,000,000  - and that figure does not take into account the assistance that has been, rendered to them in indirect ways through the subsidies on fertilizers and cornsacks and by other means. The producers cannot have it both ways. They cannot say, in time of high prices, " We will tak? what is offering on the world's markets", and then, when prices are low, turn to the Government and' say, " You ought to endeavour to enter into an international agreement in order to raise the price level ". If they want to take, the world price when prices are high, they cannot when- prices- are <inline font-style="italic">low,</inline> expect governments to- give them assistance on the scale on which such assistance has been given in. Australia in the past. </para>
                    <para>I' arn quite sure that, if the questionweise put to Australian, wheat-growers in that: way,, there; could, be no doubt as- to their answer. On this- point ! accept the assurances.- of the honorable member for Riverina (jM-r. Langtry)-, the. honorable' member for. Hume: <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr-.. Fuller)</inline> and others who are in much-, closer contact with the wheat-farmers than- I am-. If given the choice, between accepting- high prices at one period and- extremely low prices at another period!,, or- a. guaranteed price- for a number, of years, I am surethat the growers throughout Australia would unhesitatingly decide in favour of  an international wheat agreement guaranteeing them stability over a period of years. </para>

                            <para>- The guaranteed floor price under this agreement will be, I understand, approximately 6s. 3d. a bushel. Comparing that with the prices which were received by wheat-growers in Australia during certain years in the thirties, I think the farmers will get a very good deal indeed under this agreement. They will have a guaranteed minimum price, and the range will be from approximately 12s. 5d. a bushel, the upper limit, to 6s. 3d. a bushel the lower limit. M!y point is that, if the growers were asked whether they would prefer to take the high prices that are offering to-day and then, at a later period, take the low prices which are sure to come, at the same rime giving a guarantee not to apply to the Government for assistance or to urge it to reach an international agreement in order to increase prices- </para>

My point is that, if the wheat farmers of Australia were asked, " Do you want an international agreement which will give you an average price over a period of years, or do you want to accept high prices as they are offered tc-day in the world's markets, taking the risk of low prices that will come into force before very long?" I am sure that the answer of farmers throughout Australia would be, " Give us an average price which will return to us the cost of production and a reasonable income over and abovethat, instead of allowing us to face the risk of very low prices in the years tocome ". </para>

                            <para>- I am sorry, but I did not hear the honorable member. If hedid say so, he is the only member of the Opposition who has made his position clear in this matter. As a matter of fact.. I believe that the honorable member was a member, or at any rate a supporter, of a previous government which endeavoured, to negotiate an international wheat agreement. However, that is by the way. The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. ArchieCameron)</inline> - since I am dealing with hisinterjection - also said that I had declared-' a few years ago that Australia at that time had enough wheat to last for a couple of years, but that later we had been: obliged to import wheat. That is perfectly true. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McBride),</inline> who is alsotrying to interject, went one step furtherand said that, for the wheal, which was allegedly imported, the Government had to pay far more than the price which it obtained for the wheat which was exported. The honorable member was quite wrong. Australia had to pay nothing at all for the- wheat that was imported. It came here under lend-lease arrangements. </para>

                    <para>The circumstances of that case are quite clear. There was plenty of wheat in Australia at that time, but most of it happened to be in Western Australia. There had been a very bad season in the eastern States; but because of the necessity for a concentration of our effort in the war in the Pacific in order to finish it as quickly as possible, we had to provide the food requirements of a large number of American forces and of the British Pacific Fleet, which had come to Australia. Therefore, it was necessary for us to devote all of our energies to the production of as much food as possible. The wheat to which the honorable member referred was brought into Australia under lend-lease arrangements, specifically for use as stock feed. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. That arrangement was necessary in order to build up food production in Australia at a very rapid rate. We did not have the internal transport facilities necessary to bring wheat from Western Australia. The honorable member knows quite well that, to say that the importation of a very small quantity of wheat at that time proved that I was wrong a couple of years earlier in saying that Australia had sufficient supplies of wheat to last for two or three years, is an exaggeration and distortion of the truth. </para>

                    <para>As I said earlier, the first thing to  be  decided in relation to this bill is whether or not it will be to the advantage of Australia to enter into an international wheat agreement of any kind. I say that the whole history of the wheat industry and of the treatment it has received at the hands of various governments of different political colours shows that every political party believes international agreement? to be in the best interests of Australia. The next question that arises is whether this agreement is the best agreement that could have been made. It is all very well for honorable members opposite to criticize the details of the agreement as they are set forth in this bill. Some honorable members opposite, at any rate those who have held ministerial rank, know that when a person attends an international conference he puts forward what he considers to be the best proposition from every point of view, particularly his own. Naturally, there is a period of bargaining, during which delegatehave to give way and make concession.of one kind and another. It is quite clear that the agreement is not the ideal document that would have been prepared  had  the Government and its representative, Mi\ McCarthy, had their own way. It  would  have contained certain  other  provisions could we have  had them  incorporated in it. Australia  was  only one of 36 countries represented  at  the conference, and naturally we could not get all our own way. This  is  the best agreement which our representative  could  obtain. Had  we  shown an uncompromising spirit,  the  other 35 countries might have said. " Well, if Australia cannot agree to the? it can remain outside and we shall arrive at some kind of agreement on our own". The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)</inline> has never had any experience of negotiations of this kind.  Other  members of the Opposition have had such experience. I had the same experience  at  the conference which preceded the making of the Geneva Trade Agreement. When  the  final conclusion has  been  reached, one's attitude must be, " This is  the  best kind, of agreement I have been able to obtain because of  the  viewpoint of others  who took  part.  in the negotiations ". The question which arises is whether this agreement is acceptable to us or not. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Wimmera seemed to imply that the Australian delegation was to be condemned because it could not get a better agreement than this. Every one who has  taken  any part in negotiations of this kind knows perfectly well that the best of everything cannot be obtained. The opinions expressed and the arguments advanced by delegations from other countries have to be taken into account. As I "have said the main point that arises is, not whether this is an ideal agreement, bu't whether it is the 'best kind of agreement we could get, and will be of advantage to Australia. On balance, the agreement will ensure that the wheat-farmers of this -country -shall obtain a stable price for their wheat during the period specified, &amp; price ranging from 6s. 3d. to 12s. od. a bushel. That will provide them with a much better income than they have been in (the habit of receiving. It is true that at times  they  have -received very high returns, but it is also true :tha:t at other times they have received very low prices. The records show that during those periods when prices were extremely low thousands of wheat-farmers had to go through the bankruptcy courts of this country. Those were periods when the parties now in opposition were in office in this country. In spite of those years of high prices, taking into account the many years of low prices when anti-Labour .governments were in power in this country, wheat-farmers got deeper and deeper into debt. But from the time when a Labour Government assumed office, the farmers have been able to write off increasing amounts of their  debts  to the financial institutions of this country. All of this is history. I believe that this agreement will ensure to the wheat farmers a period of prosperity. 'Their income will be much higher for the five years during which the agreement is -to  operate  than  it  would be if they accepted the  high prices  ruling (throughout the world to-day and later had ito accept the low prices which inevitably will .rule after the expiration of that five-year period- </para>

                        <para>For the first time since the war created a shortage, a world surplus of grains above restricted needs is probable, according to a preliminary estimate of the exportable world surplus of bread grains - wheat and rye - made by economists for American wheat industry interests. They indicate that the volume of these grains available for export may total or exceed 910,000,'000 bushels, compared with the effective demand under present policies, of- 876,000,000 to 900,000,000 bushels. </para>

                    <para class="block">These experts, in assessing the probable world production of wheat, and the demand for it, have indicated that, in their opinion, the time will arrive shortly when supply will overtake demand. At that stage, prices will begin to fall. Although this is not an ideal agreement such as, perhaps, would have been reached had we had all our own way in the negotiations,I nevertheless believe that the agreement will benefit Australian wheat-growers generally, and provide them with a much higher standard of living than they have enjoyed in the past. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> has dealt with a number of matters in a manner which calls for a reply. I had not intended to participate in the debate, but I do so in order to combat certain misrepresentations of the actual position. The Minister claimed that the International Wheat Agreement would stabilize the wheat-growing industry in Australia. I have before me the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act, which was assented to on the 9th August, 1946, and the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act (No. 2), which was assented to on the 14th December of that year. They may be regarded as successive stages in the Government's activities to stabilize this industry. Section 4 of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act 1946 provided for the establishment of the Australian WheatBoard. A substantial number of its members were to be elected by wheat-growers, arid other members were to be appointed by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. The functions of the board are prescribed in section 10, which reads -  10. (1.) The board may, subject to any directions of the Minister, for the purposes of the export of wheat and wheat products, the interstate marketing of wheat -and the marketing of wheat in the Territories of the Commonwealth - <inline font-style="italic">(a.)</inline> purchase or otherwise acquire any wheat, wheat products, corn sacks, jute or jute products; [!&gt;) sell or dispose of any wheat, wheat products, corn sacks, jute or jute products purchased or acquired by the board; </para>

                    <para class="block">Australian wheat-growers are asking this question : In what way was the Australian Wheat Board consulted in accordance with the provisions of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act regarding the disposal overseas of the wheat products of the Commonwealth ? All the evidence, and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction himself has admitted it, proves that this gigantic deal has been effected in the most authoritarian manner that any government could adopt without a single reference to the Australian Wheat Board. Now, the Government tells us that, because it is all-wise, we members of the Australian Country party, who have a special knowledge of the problems of the man on the land, should support the International Wheat Agreement. To that proposition we shall . not assent. At the moment, I shall not -concern myself with the intricacies of the agreement, because they have already been fully analysed by other members of the Australian Country party. For example, the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> in a comprehensive -examination of the agreement, showed that, as an initial gesture, Australian wheat-growers will be asked to sacrifice no less than Â£12,000,000 or Â£13,000,000 In the first year of the operation of the agreement. The Government claims that by forfeiting that sum and the immediate prospect of additional money in the bank, wheat-growers will possibly achieve in later years a degree of stabilization in their industry. That submission is open  to question. If that is to he the result, there may be something to be said for the -agreement, because it is a desirable end in itself, but that is only a . claim, and an examination of the facts will not substanti  a te it. 1 shall refer briefly to the various  countries  to which Australia will make r.his concession under the International Wheat Agreement. For the moment, I pass over the United Kingdom, and grant that special concessional treatment may be accorded to our kith and kin because of their problems. However, Australian wheat-growers, and members of the Opposition in this chamber, claim that the  rost  of any special concessions which are ro be given to the United Kingdom at this particular period of its history when it so urgently requires them, should be borne, not by the wheat-growers alone, but by the whole of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. That remark applies also to other primary Products, including dairy produce. , Every Australian should be prepared to shoulder his share of any sacrifice which has to be made in order that Great Britain may be helped. I hold in my hand a booklet issued recently by the. Commonwealth Department of Information, which gives some information about contracts other than those made with the United Kingdom. It says that, in addition, as a result of the negotiations between the Australian Government and the Indian Food Mission. Australia has contracted to supply the Indian Government with 25,000,000 bushels of wheat from the 1947-4S crop at 18s. 6d. a bushel Australian currency, f.o.b. Australian ports. Although the Indian Government has contracted to take that quantity at 18s. 6d. a bushel, by the application of this agreement the price will be reduced to approximately 12s. a bushel. The wheat-growers and others in this country are entitled to ask the price at which the Indian Government is selling jute bags and sacks to Australia at the present time. Recently, I asked a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs regarding the probable cost for the current season of corn and wheat sacks from India. The reply was that the price will be approximately 30s. a dozen, compared with about Ss. 6d. at the outbreak of war. The Indian Government is taking full advantage of the present world shortage of jute products, but the Australian Government, by reducing the price of Australian wheat sold to India by approximately 6s. 6d. a bushel, is making that country a present of about Â£8,000,000 in the current financial year. That money properly belongs to the Australian wheatgrowers. It is suggested that by this means stabilization of prices will bo secured. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction insulted the wheat-growers of Australia when he said that the Government had made them gifts and paid them subsidies amounting to approximately Â£40,000,000 over a periods of years. The assistance that has been granted to Aus.tranial wheat-growers is no greater than is the assistance that protective tariffs have given to Australian industrial workers. The wheat-growers do not concede that they have received any gift from the Government that is proportionately greater than the assistance that other sections of the community have received from our fiscal policy. The benefit of protection to Australian secondary industries over a period of years would amount not to Â£40,000,000, but probably to something like Â£1,000,000,000. It has been claimed that this agreement will result in stable wheat prices. If there were any guarantee that its terms could be enforced at any time when the price of wheat fell below that which is provided in it, there might be some merit in that argument, despite the fact that the representatives of the wheat-growers were not consulted and that the Australian "Wheat Hoard was ignored. How much reliance can be placed upon many of the countries  that  have signed the agreement? First, there is Afghanistan. Then there is Austria, which is now, unfortunately, a satellite of Russia. After Colombia mid Cuba there is Czechoslovakia.  President  Benes has just been compelled to resign the presidency of that country because it, too, has fallen under the influence of the Soviet.. Then there are the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, India, Lebanon, Liberia, Mexico, and New Zealand. There is no doubt that New Zealand would honour this agreement if it had occasion to do so, but it is already enjoying the benefits of a contract under which for the next three years it will purchase Australian wheat at 5s. 6d. a bushel, or a t about Â£2,000,000 a year les? rhan the market price. As a result of the famous New Zealand wheat Agreement which was negotiated by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> when he was Minister foi- Commerce and Agriculture, Â£2,000,000 a year is being lost by the Australian taxpayers. The honorable gentleman will be remembered for that long after he is otherwise forgotten. The agreement contains the names of thirty-three purchasing countries. With due respect to the best, of them, not one is in any way bound by the terms of the agreement other than by the mere statement that it will perhaps purchase wheat at some future date. If the price of wheat on the world's markets falls below 6s. a bushel to, for example, 3s., is it conceivable that many of these countries .will buy wheat from Australia at 6s. when it can be obtained at half that price from other sources not affected by the agreement? If there is again a vast surplus of wheat in the world, anxious sellers from every wheat-growing country will be trying to dispose of their surplus, because if they do not the weevils will get it. </para>

In that event, they would be paid a price of from  18s.  6d. to Â£1 a bushel for the 1947-4'S crop. They would havethat money in their pockets. As a result of this agreement, they will receive a lower price and in three or four years' time will probably be compelled to take whatever amount is offered. </para>

                    <para>My principal complaint about thisagreement, apart from its terms, is the manner in which is was negotiated. Th&lt;Australian Wheat Board was created for the purpose of negotiating agreements in respect of wheat. In conformity with the claim of the Government that its desire was to give growers control of their own industries the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act provided that the Australian Wheat Board should have a" say in the disposal of the Australian wheat crop. That is set out in the clearest of terms, subject to one proviso, which is that the board may sell Australian wheat, grist Australian wheat, and manage and control Australian wheat subject only to the direction of the Minister. And the direction of the Minister is that they shall not perform any of those functions when it comes to anything worth while. The will and direction of the Minister is that in the sale of 85,000,000 bushels of wheat per annum overseas, and in respect of every grain of Australian wheat intended for export, the elected representatives of the growers shall have no say whatsoever. Control has been taken out of their hands. The deal has been negotiated over their heads not by the Minister but by a solitary public servant. I am not criticizing the capacity of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCarthy,</inline> the gentleman who was sent abroad to negotiate this deal. He is one of the best type of public servants. He is keen to discharge his duties, and I believe that he carried out his task to the best of his knowledge- and ability; but be is not all wise. No public servant, no individual, is all wise. That is; why growers' organizations- exist to enable the growers to. make available the benefit of their experience, very often bitter experience over long years, in the negotiation of contracts of this kind. But the growers were completely ignored. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCarthy</inline> alone was sent abroad, and. he brought hack this agreement, which commits every wheat-grower in Australia to conform to its contents for the next five years whether they like it or not, and whether they believe it to be wise or not. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, in the course of his speech, said that he had not the slightest doubt that if this agreement were submitted to a vote of the wheat-growers of Australia they would approve it. If the Minister believes that, why did not the Government consult the representatives of the wheat-growers of Australia in its negotiations? That was a simple proposition. It was not necessary to take a vote of the growers; it was only necessary to convene the board which was elected for that particular purpose. The Government is just as confident of securing the approval of the wheat-growers to this agreement as it is of securing the approval of the people of Australia to its bank nationalization proposals. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not think anything could have done more to deepen the Opposition's mistrust of this measure than the speech made by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> this afternoon. The Minister suggested that if this measure were approved, the Australian wheat-growers would have a guaranteed price for their product. The fact is that there is no provision in this measure for a guaranteed price. The only guarantee that it gives to the wheat-grower is that the prices-he is now receiving under existing contracts with the United Kingdom and India will be reduced by nearly 50 per cent. The Minister also claimed that if a poll were taken amongst wheatgrowers, these proposals would be favoured by an overwhelming majority. [ envy the Minister his confidence and self-assurance; but I remind him that only three weeks ago he was asserting just as vehemently that there would be a large affirmative vote in the rents and prices referendum. I am confident that a poll of Australian, wheat-growers on the rati-flea tion  by this country of the International Wheat Agreement would meet the same fate as the Government's referendum proposals. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Government's entry into this agreement has been disastrous. Only three wheat-producing countries havesigned it although 34 importing countries, which obviously are expecting to be able to buy wheat at a cheaper rate during the next five years than would be possible in ordinary circumstances, have signified their intention of participating. That is the real reason for the willingness of the 34 countries to enter into the agreement. It is also interesting to note that whilst the agreement will reduce the return to Australian wheat-growers, it will not interfere in any way with the contract entered into by the Australian Government with New Zealand. The price of the wheat that we have contracted to sell to India will be reduced from 18s. 6d. to 12s. a bushel for all wheat delivered after the 1st August next. In respect of the United Kingdom, the reduction will be from 17s. 6d. to 12s., but there is to be no alteration of the price of 5s. 9d. at which this Government has contracted to meet New Zealand's wheat requirements for the next five years. Surely there should be two-way traffic. If it is in the interests of the whole world that an international agreement of this kind should be made, then the substantial reduction of the price at which Australian wheat is being sold to certain countries, should be accompanied by an increase of the price at which it is sold to New Zealand, a country which to-day has the most favorable wheal contract in the world. When the New Zealand wheat agreement was first mentioned, we were assured by the Government that no such contract existed. Australian wheat at that time was selling at approximately 9s. a bushel, but when the contract with New Zealand was finally signed, the price had risen to 14s: 6d., and not many months later it had gone up to Â£1. In justification of the New Zealand contract we were told that in probably two year's time wheat would be selling on the world's markets at very much less than 5s. 9d. a bushel. The measure now before the House indicates very clearly that the Government does not believe anything of the kind, and after all if we are guaranteeing only that there will be a reduction of the price that we shall receive this year, of what use will it be to the Australian wheat-grower? </para>
                    <para>We were informed by the Minister that Argentina had sold large quantities of wheat at 25s. a bushel. I remind the honorable gentleman that that country stands outside the International Wheat Agreement and that the more wheat it sells now at 2os. a bushel, the more it will be able to sell at a cheaper rate should the glut that we are told to expect within a few years, become a reality. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction read some extracts from an American newspaper indicating that the time was not far distant when the supply of cereals would be much greater than the demand. I thought for the moment that he had been reading last night's Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> which stated that a good wheat harvest in Australia was assured because of the present rains. Could anything be more stupid or ridiculous? </para>
                    <para class="block">Gould anything show more clearly a complete ignorance of the subject? After all, the wheat-farmer himself does not know what his yield will be until the grain is bagged. </para>

The Minister's interjection reminds me that when the rumoured sale of wheat to New Zealand at 5s. 9d. a bushel was first mentioned in this House, it was indignantly denied. Government spokesmen said that no such agreement existed, and that nothing of the kind had ever occurred. However, after there had been a general election in this country and in New Zealand, we found that the agreement had been ratified and that the contract price was that indicated when the matter was first mentioned.

If the honorable gentleman does know all about it. he has succeeded in keeping the information to himself. All that the Australian taxpayer knows is that because of the signing of that contract, he will subsidize the price of bread sold in New Zealand to the tune of Â£2,000,000 a year for the next five years. If he can derive any comfort from that knowledge he is welcome to it. If agreements of this nature are to be entered into without the people most concerned having any say in them, we are nearer socialization in this country than most people believe. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction referred to the affluence that wheatgrowers and primary producers generally are enjoying to-day, and endeavoured to give the impression that it was due to the actions of the Labour Government. 1 shall tell him the real reason. The tragic world conflict through which we have just passed is the sole reason for the enhanced prices of those commodities, and increased returns are being enjoyed by our primary producers to-day in spite of the administration of this tragic Government. I should not have participated in this debate but for the provocative manner in which the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction put the case for the Government. I am sure that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture realizes that the Government's case looked much better before the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction tried to justify it. He made the job of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture much more difficult than it would otherwise have been. If it is necessary to enter into an international wheat agreement the people to be considered first and last are those who produce the wheat. They who labour throughout the year to produce this essential commodity are entitled to some say in its disposal. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">m reply</inline> - I regret that the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> is absent from the House because of illness. He led the debate on this bill on behalf of the Opposition. He criticized the International Wheat Agreement, and his criticism was certainly not constructive. It was not even merely destructive. lt consisted rather of a number of absolute falsehoods and of statements which had no foundation in fact, so that I must devote a considerable amount of the time at my disposal to refuting his allegations. The honorable member said that the agreement had been introduced to reduce the price on contracts of sale to the United Kingdom and India by from Â£12,000,000 to Â£13,000,000, and that it had taken this amount literally out of the growers' pockets. On the other hand, the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.  Anthony)</inline> said to-night that the agreement had a desirable end in itself. Whom are we to believe, the honorable member for Richmond who said that the agreement had a desirable end, or the honorable member for Indi who made the infamous statement that the agreement was entered into in order to deprive the wheatgrowers of Â£12,000,000 or Â£13,000,000? The honorable member for Indi referred to this amount of Â£12,000,000 or Â£13,000,000 no fewer than four times. Evidently,  he is a believer in the kind of propaganda used by Goebbels and Hitler to lead their unfortunate people astray. The honorable member further said that the Government was exposed as one which had no compunction in seizing the property of individuals, and bartering that property in accordance with its policies. Tn my second-reading speech I said - lt is true, of course, that in the first year, Australian growers will make a monetary sacrifice; they will receive less under the  agreement  than if there were no agreement. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">That statement, however, does not justify the rash assertion of the honorable member for Indi that the growers would lose between Â£12,000,000 and Â£13,000,000. Indeed, it is possible, by a careful examination of the circumstances associated with this year's wheat crop, to sustain a case that, in the absence of an international agreement, the loss could, in fact, be greater than Â£12,000,000, and that the price of wheat unshipped at the 1st August next would fall below the minimum fixed price of one and a half dollars provided for the first year of the agreement. </para>
                    <para>Our export wheat surplus this year is approximately 130,000,000 bushels. Because of road and rail transport limitations, the maximum quantity which we can shift to ports and ship before the 1st August is little more than half that quantity, and is about all that can be lifted by the ships available from the purchasing countries. All the wheat that the United Kingdom and other purchasers could lift in the time has already been shipped. </para>
                    <para>The Australian Wheat Board's policy, repeatedly declared, is : Sales no further ahead than quarterly at prices then ruling. The United Kingdom is the only purchasing country with sufficient shipping to lift <inline font-style="italic">80,000,000</inline> bushels, spread over approximately twelve months, and is the only country able to provide ships for India for the smaller quantity of 25,000,000 bushels over about six to seven months. Without a provision in these contracts for a price revision in the event of an International Wheat Agreement the United Kingdom and India would not have agreed to contracts at 17s. and 18s. 6d. a bushel respectively. Obviously, the Australian Wheat Board's quarterly quotation policy would have been a safer policy for them to follow. A gamble on good United States of America, Canadian, European, Russian and Danubian crops coming in after the 1st August, bringing prices down, would be a safer bet. </para>
                    <para>It has to be appreciated that the Wheat Board was prepared to supply the United Kingdom, and probably India, with the above quantities on the quarterly quote basis only. How, then, could the  much-harped-on  loss due to the International Wheat Agreement occur? As a matter of fact, it is highly probable that the revision provision in the United Kingdom and India contracts was' a great factor in bringing those countries into the agreement. </para>
                    <para>Since negotiations for the international agreement were commenced in January, prices of United States of America and Canadian wheat have fallen about 80 cents. In January, Canadian Manitoba No. 1 was 334 cents f.o.b.Fort William. Yesterday, it was 261 cents - a fall of over 73 cents, or 4s. 6d. a bushel Australian. If falls of this 'description continue, the price could go below the minimum of 150 cents, or 9s. Australian, fixed in the agreement for the first year. I do not say that this will happen, but it could happen. For the honorable member for Indi to say that the bill was introduced to reduce prices to the United Kingdom and India is stupid, although it was meant to be subtle. It fails in that respect for it is out of line with the Opposition's accusation that this Government is not helping Britain adequately. The honorable member said that the Government did not warn growers that it might enter into an international agreement to reduce arbitrarily the value of their wheat. That accusation has been bandied about the country by other members of the Opposition, some of whom knew it to be untrue and others being completely ignorant of the facts. The statement of the honorable member for Indi is a perversion of the truth, for when contracts with the United Kingdom and India were entered into by the Government, every daily newspaper, and all the Wheat-growers' journals, published the details in full, including the proviso for the revision of prices in the event of an international wheat agreement coming into operation. Does any honorable member deny that? Only a fool would expect purchasing countries with 80,000,000 and 25,000,000-bushel contracts to enter into an agreement which did not contain a stipulation for price revision. I do not regard the honorable member for Indi as a fool ; but he delights in trying to fool the farmers. Most reasonable people are astonished that under the International Wheat Agreement purchasing countries have agreed to a ceiling price as high as approximately 12s. 5d. a bushel f.o.b. Australia, a floor price in the first years of approximately 9s. a bushel f.o.b. Australia, and a continuing ceiling price of appoximately 12s. 5d. a bushel for five years, descending in ten 10-cent stages over the remaining period of the agreement until it reaches a floor price in the fifth year of between 6s. and 6s. 3d. a bushel approximately. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the most serious accusation that has been bandied about the country by the honorable member for Indi and members of the Opposition generally, some of them knowing it to be false, and others being completely ignorant of the facts. The accusation is, that the Government acquired the wheat without consulting either the growersor the Australian Wheal Board, and entered into contracts to sell for 17s. . a bushel to the United Kingdom and18s. 6d a bushel to India, when the residue was selling at 20s. 6d. a bushel and upwards. It is true that the Government acquired wheat without consulting the Australian Wheat Board. In that respect it followed the precedent established by the Menzies Ministry, supported by the honorable member for Indi, in 1939, and continued in 1940 by the Menzies Ministry, in which the honorable member for Indi was a Minister, and the Honorable Horace Keyworth Noek, of Nelungaloo fame was an honorary Minister. In theabsence of complementary State legislation for its 1946 Wheat Stabilization Act - legislation which the various States had agreed to introduce - the Chifley Government was faced with two alternatives. These were : To abandon Commonwealth organized wheat-marketing and throw the growers back to where they were in 1919, subsequently to reap the whirlwind between 1919 and 1939, or to carry on acquisition of wheat for another year, in the hope of the States enacting the complementary legislation previously agreed to. The Government did not continue the acquisition of wheat without consulting the State governments, and at the last Premiers conference, in August, 1947. all the State Premiers supported the following resolution :  - </para>

                    <para class="block">In view of that resolution, does the Oppositionstill contend, that acquisitionof wheat should not have operated this year? The Premiers are all responsible men. The Premier of South Australia is a Country-Liberal party man, and the Premier of Western Australia is somewhat of the same political brand. I stress the point that no responsible wheat-growers' organization has offered any dissent from the continuation of acquisition in respect of the 1947-48 crop. Why, then, should there be all this hullabaloo and all these accusations and theattempt to brand the Government with having done something evil? </para>

Honorable members opposite and some of their associates have accused this Government of indifference to the unfortunate plight of the people of the United Kingdom. It was the Australian Wheat Board which, for almost a fortnight, did not consider it important enough to reply to my inquiry as to the basis upon which a' contract should be entered into with the United Kingdom for the supply of wheat for five years, which showed complete indifference to the plight of our kinsmen overseas.

The second was that, following consideration of my request for its ideas on approaches by the United Kingdom for supplies, the board had expressed the view that r&gt;0,000,000 bushels should be reserved for shipment to the United Kingdom, of which 300,000 tons would be as flour. The board also said that the price should be based on its current export quotation from time to time, less ls. a bushel, anil that firm contracts be arranged in accordance with its genera] policy, that is, shipment over three-monthly periods. Honorable members opposite have talked of concessions. I draw their attention to the fact that the board of its own volition had suggested a concession of ls.

It is difficult for them however to make much further progress been use of the unexpected termsof the contract put forward by the board . The board's proposal is that whilst prepared to reserve this total quantity for us they are willing to sell only one-fourth of this amount at a price of 1 12s. a quarter (14s. 6d. a. bushel.) and that we must make a fresh purchase for a like quantity every three months. . . . This, my officials feel, and I am hound to say that I fully share their view, is an unreasonable proposal and will make it impossible for us to arrange ahead the various substantial and intricate shipping programmes involved, besides placing in some doubt the continuity of supplies on which our rationing system depends. I am sure you will appreciate that this is a very real point of difficulty but 1 believe that although our views have been put to the wheat board by their London representative they are not convinced of the necessity to depart from this feature of their proposals. . . . </para>

                    <para>I had hoped that some reconciliation of these opposing views in price would have been possible in the recent discussions between the representatives, but the board have been given no authority to modify the proposals they have conveyed to us, and a situation very near to deadlock has developed. Jt is this aspect of the negotiations which gives me most concern, and on which I should be grateful to have your assistance and that of the Government. It seems tome that it would be very much against the interests of both countries if the discussions on price were to be unduly prolonged and if it were to he suggested publicly either that my officials were sticking on an unduly low offer or that the wheat board  were seeking a price which was unreasonably high. Our aim surely must be to find elbowroom for both parties. </para>
                    <para>The deal, however, covers a very large quantity of grain to be taken up over a period of twelve months, for which Chicago future prices may be more relevant, and involves questions of "shipping of some magnitude beyond the capacity of most buyers to solve. On such commercial grounds as these, I think a price of something less than 14s.6d. could be justified. Chicago prices cannot really be said to represent the true world value of wheat, or to hear any recognizable relationship to the costs of production,or the capacity of importing countries. Apart <inline font-style="italic">tram,</inline> the fact that the Chicago future price has already declined, it must be remembered that this price is in any case particularly influenced by the concentration on the United States of America of the heavy demand of European and other countries which are desperately anxious' to secure wheat on a short haul at almost any price. The Chicago market is also affected by the pessimistic outlook for the new United States of America maize crop. Nor can I ignore the fact that the Canadian Government (on a four year contract, it is true, but taking <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> balanced view on the advantages for the Canadian economy) accepted $1.55 a bushel for the first two years and $2.00 for the third year of their contract with us. . . . </para>

Australian currency f.o.b. for United Kingdom and17s.6d. for delivery elsewhere. The Wheat Board explains that when it made the offer to the Ministry of 17s.6d. and 18s. 6d., its price was then 18s.6d. subsequently United States of America prices rose, and the board increased its price to 19s.6d. The fall in the United States of America prices which subsequently took place, and which is noted in the Minister's letter, would bring the board's basic price no lower than the 18s.6d. upon which it based its original offer to Ministry. </para>

At this stage the basic quantity of 80,000.000 bushels has not been resolved but I know you are giving this serious consideration. But really I hope that our figure will be finally accepted but my chief concern for telegraphing direct to you is on the question of price for it is troubling me more than I can say. Your latest advice indicates a willingness to let us have the wheat for the United Kingdom at 105s. 7d. sterling a quarter (16s.6d. a bushel Australian) but you feel that a price of 112s. sterling a quarter (17s.6d.) for the other areas for which we procure must be paid. This creates a ' very great difficulty in principle to us in the United Kingdom for we will then be accepting a departure from all previous practice and will be called upon to charge our colonies for whom we procure a higher price than we ourselves are paying. This will unfortunately create a situation wholly inconsistent with our position as trustees for their peoples and we will be charged with the accusation that we were getting our wheat at a lower price at their expense. </para>

It may be also claimed and I do not think it is your wish that Australia was demanding more for supplies to the colonies than to Great Britain. May I suggest strongly that the principle is that the price of 105s. 7d. f.o.b. (16s.6d. Australian) which we cannot but feel is a high price especially when compared to the recently fixed price with Canada should apply to all the wheat for which we contract. We for our part would be prepared to redistribute the cost of transport to the various destinations in such a way as to ensure that the same c.i.f price applied all round. </para>

                    <para>While I am dealing with the charge of unlimited ministerial authority let me illustrate concisely, and, I hope, effectively, what humbugs members of the Opposition in this Parliament and their supporters outside it are. Within the last twelve months the Australian Country party-Liberal party government in Western Australia - an anti-Labour administration - introduced legislation for the purpose of having in readiness an organization to handle wheat, should the Australian Government not continue to acquire the Australian wheat crop. This legislation includes all sorts of restrictions, and vests unlimited authority in the State Minister for Agriculture. Before I read some of its provisions, I remind the House that this legislation was sponsored by members of the same political parties as those to which members of the Opposition in this Parliament belong. Yet they have criticized this Government for having exercised authority which any government with a  sense  of responsibility must exercise in certain circumstances.

The anti-Labour Government -of Western Australia has incorporated in its legislation the kind nf control which the Australian Government, with a due sense of responsibility, operates for the protection of the Australian people. I go a little further. In 1947, when a Labour Government was still in office in Western Australia, it appointed a committee to inquire into wheat-growing and stabilization. The members of the committee were John Smith Teasdale - he is one of the most knowledgeable men in the Australian wheat industry and a respected member of the Australian Wheat Board - Stephen Bede Donovan, J ohn Sadler, and Richard Philip Roberts, of the Department of Agriculture. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donovan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sadler</inline> were wheat-growers.

                    <para class="block">That effectively answers the humbug on this subject that has been uttered in recent months. With regard to ministerial control, I have vivid recollections of the actions of a government that pre.ceeded this one in regard to meat contracts with the United Kingdom. <inline font-style="italic">[Further extension of time granted.]</inline> Out of consideration for the House, I shall not relate that story, but I assure honorable gentlemen opposite that it. is not a very . palatable one from their point of view. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Indi said it. was difficult to understand why the Government committed itself to the International Wheat Agreement without permitting the Australian Wheat Board or the producing industries to express their opinions upon it. I have already demonstrated that, in view of the attitude of the members of the Australian Wheat Board, it was useless to consult them in reference to the agreement. There was nothing to prevent some members of the hoard., or   the board in its corporate capacity, submitting an opinion to the Government or to me as Minister in charge of the appropriate department. The honorable member said that I have prevented the Australian Wheat Board from being allowed to know even the details of what was being discussed at Washington. That was only natural. Then he referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tadman</inline> as an official out of the London selling broker's office and as being merely an officer to advise <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCarthy.</inline> The fact is that the Australian Wheat Board thought sufficiently highly of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tadman,</inline> its London representative, to put him in charge of the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Australian Wheat Board for the sale of wheat. The Board knew that an agreement was under discussion. It had ample opportunity of its own volition to express an opinion, if it so desired. I emphasize the statements that I have already made about the attitude of the board on the United Kingdom agreement, which was that there should be no contract except on a quarterly price basis and no floor price. That point of view in itself excludes the board from forming a constructive opinion on the International Wheat Agreement. As far as producing interests are concerned, at the request of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, I met the federation's executive officers in Canberra on the 27th April, 1948, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCarthy</inline> explained every detail of the agreement and answered all questions. Although the Australian Ambassador formally signed the agreement in Washington, that did not commit the Australian Government to it any more than the signing at that stage on behalf of all other participating governments, including that of the United States of America, committed their countries. This Government by executive act - and the Washington signature was not that - could ratify the agreement, but it has not done so, and the agreement has not and will not be ratified until the Parliament approves of it. The lapse of time between the Government's announcement of the conclusion of an agreement between the three exporting and 33 importing countries and the date on which the Parliament will pass this bill will be over two months. </para>
                    <para>Surely neither the honorable member for Indi nor any other honorable member will contend that that does not provide ample time for the growers and., others to examine the details of the proposals and to indicate their hostility to them if they wish to do so. </para>

Notwithstanding the consultation on the 27th April, there has not been any move from the Australian Wheat Growers Federation to request the Government to desist from this parliamentary action to ratify the agreement. It should be emphasized that the Canadian Government has ratified the agreement by executive action and will not submit a bill to the Canadian Parliament, and that the United State? of America is taking similar action to that taken by the Australian Government. All attempts to link this question with party politics must fall to the ground, because Canada has a Liberal government and the Government of the .United States of America is certainly not a Labour government.

                    <para class="block">International "Wheat Agreement of 1933 - a bill to implement which was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Stewart - likewise contained no penalty for non-performance. That did not deter the Lyons Government from ratifying it. "What practical enforcement measures could be imposed? ls it suggested, for instance, that the Australian Government, either individually, or in co-operation with other parties to the agreement, could take military, naval or aerial action against a defaulting nation? Is it contended that if a defaulting nation has assets- in Australia, those assets should be frozen as a means of enforcing compliance with the terms of the agreement, or that economic sanctions of any kind could be imposed? If these suggestions were practicable, it is quite obvious that there could have been no agreement. This agreement, like many others, whether they be individual, national or international, depends upon the good faith of the participating countries, all of which regard as important the respect in which they are held by other nations. If the Australian Government ratifies this agreement, following a debate in this Parliament, it will honour it, and will expect other contracting parties to do likewise. </para>
                    <para>Reference was made to the importance of protecting the Australian flour-milling industry. The honorable member for Indi quoted an extract from an American trade journal expressing the alarm of American millers at the possible repercussions on their trade of  implementation  of the International Wheat Agreement. If the American flour trade is. alarmed, it would appear that no disadvantage is likely to be suffered by the Australian flour-milling trade. If the American flour-milling trade faces ruin, the ruin visualized would be as a result of a loss of export trade in flour, and such a loss to the United States would obviously react to the advantage of the Canadian and Australian flour trade. As a matter of fact, the Australian flour trade will not be disturbed in the slightest degree, because, even without the agreement, Ceylon, J ava, Malaya and other countries will want flour that Australia can sell to them. Under the agreement, this position will remain precisely the same. These countries either have no mills at all or insufficient mills. They must have flour, and we have it to sell to them. Prices for flour will be based on export prices for wheat, as they always have been, and therefore there will be no change. . </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Indi continued to indulge in subtle propaganda when he spoke of the harmful effects which the agreement might have upon the poultry, pig, dairying and sheep industries. He deplored the insistence of the Government upon the sale of wheat to those industries at concessional rates. I and my colleagues when in Opposition in this House continually urged the provision of wheat for poultry and stock feed, but previous governments resisted our pressure. However, during the war period when ample wheat was available this Government implemented that policy and one result of it is that the poultry industry is now enjoying a greater, measure of prosperity than it has ever experienced in the past, whilst, at the same time, the Australian Wheat Board has been  able  to pay no less a sum than Â£12,000,000 to growers in respect of wheat supplied at concessional prices to those industries. At present, the board is required to sell wheat for stock feed at the figure accepted by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation as the actual cost of production of wheat in this country. The honorable member for Indi spoke a lot of " hooey " when he tried to play upon the fears of those industries. Had it not been for this Government's concessional poultry feed price policy and its insistence upon: wheat being supplied to poultry-farmers at a price in line with the cost of production accepted by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, the poultry industry would not have reached its present magnitude. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Indi claimed that the Government had gained the support of primary producers on its promise that it would put the affairs of every primary producing industry in charge of a board of which the majority of members would be elected by the producers themselves; and he described that promise a* a confidence trick. lt must i&gt;,-  realized  first, that on most boards appointed by previous government* to deal with primary production, the producers di&lt;? not have majority representation secondly, that members of those boards were elected by primary producers only in rare instances; and, thirdly, that all of those boards were subject to ministerial control. This Government has at least made provision for majority representation of primary producers on commodity boards on an elective basis. The only exception I can call to mind is the Australian Wool Board on which the producers' representatives are nominated by primary producers' organizations. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Indi had much to say about price equivalents under the agreement. Obviously, he is confused with respect to the Australian equivalents. He mentioned India in this respect. The position is that before the war marketing machinery was such that Australia sold all of its wheat and flour, whether to the United Kingdom, India, Java or any other country, at world prices. They were European landed prices, less costs, and there was one f.o.b. price for all. In earlier negotiations with respect to equivalents, importing countries sought to preserve that system, the United Kingdom being particularly insistent upon it with regard to its. purchases for Malaya and Ceylon. Australia contested that position and, ultimately, a formula was evolved on the basis that where we may be in competition with Canada, as in deliveries to the United Kingdom, we sell at landed competitive prices, and where we are not in competition we sell at the Canadian f.o.b. price, a straight conversion into Australian currency without quality discounts or any other consideration. The difference between the old and the new methods varies according to freight.

                            <para>- To those honorable members who say that we should not have entered into the agreement because it does not contain any provision to guarantee enforcement, I again point out that such a provision has not been included in any previous agreement of this type, because it is impracticable to enforce such measures. Those who postulate the  unworkability  of an international agreement which does not contain enforcement provisions ignore the lesson.1: of the past. Several agreements lacking such a provision have been notably successful. I refer to the International Postal Union agreement and agreements made through the International Labour Office, as well as the International Food Council Agreement which met with outstanding success during the war. Every country associated with the Allied cause was a party to that agreement, and it honoured its obligations. That agreement is still operating although on a diminishing scale. Just as agreements of that sort succeeded, this agreement also can succeed. </para>

Neither of those parties is game to call for a division on it.

Taking a long range view, honorable members opposite hope to bring about a position in which, eventually, they will throw the wheat of Australia hack to the dealers, merchants, and speculators, just as the Hughes Government did in 1919 : and the trade remained with them until  the outbreak of the war in 1939. </para>

                    <para class="block">In order to honour this agreement the Australian Government will be obliged to acquire all wheat produced in this country. However, the Constitution provides that the Government can acquire property only on just terms; and it is questionable whether, under the agreement, the growers will be justly compensated for the wheat acquired by the Government. I do not intend to discuss the legal aspects of the problem. I move my amendment because I, believe that tie best approach the Government can make in the matter is to <inline font-style="italic">ask</inline> the wheat-growers, who are the real owners of the wheat, whether they are prepared to accept the agreement. As the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction has stated that he is convinced that they will approve the agreement I have no doubt that the Government will accept my amendment. </para>
                    <para>Mr.TURNBULL  (Wimmera) [9.30]. -It was my intention to suggest an amendment such as that now proposed by the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McBride).</inline> It is essential that the wheat-growers of this country should have an opportunity to express their opinion on this vital measure. Much has been said by Government supporters about the wheat-growers having been consulted, but it is common knowledge that the growers throughout Australia have not been asked whether or not they approve of this International Wheat Agreement. What is really happening is that the Government is taking control of the industry from the growers, find handing it over to other countries, because, of the 1,000 votes to be exercised by the exporting countries, Canada is to have 490, the United States of America 350, and Australia 160. This means that little heed will be paid to Australia's views when maximum and minimum prices are being fixed. The Government is taking control of the wheat industry from the growers, and being unable to exercise control itself, it is handing it over to dollar area countries, which obviously is not in the best interests of Australia in general, or of the Australian wheat-growers in particular. </para>
                    <para>On numerous occasions honorable members opposite, particularly the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> have said that the wheat grower is not the only one to be considered. They admit that the wheat-grower is being called upon to make a sacrifice for the people of Australia generally; but surely the wheat-grower has made enough sacrifices. As the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> has pointed out, the wheat industry has been subsidizing other primary industries by providing cheap feed for stock. </para>
                    <para>I support the amendment with pleasure and enthusiasm. It is only right that the people who grow wheat should have an opportunity to express their opinion on the Government's proposals. No government has the right to ride rough-shod over any section of the community as the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture is doing now by forcing this agreement upon the wheat-growers. If the Government refuses to accept the amendment, it will be assuming the powers of a dictatorship in a so-called democratic country. </para>

                        <para>.- What the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> wants to tell the wheat-growers of Australia is that this agreement is to be saddled on them whether they like it or not, and that no matter how much the surcingle may pinch, he intends to tighten it. The wheat grower is to be made carry, not only the  3addle,  but also the Minister sitting in the saddle and the International "Wheat Council as well. When the wheat stabilization plan was passed by this Parliament in 1946, not only the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture - then a private member - but also Ministers and other private members supporting them, gave the most unqualified and unequivocable assurance that the plan had the support of the wheat-growers of Australia. But what happened ? The plan was to be implemented by the passage of complementary legislation by the States, but, only one State - South Australia - passed that legislation. </para>

That poll was held and the plan was rejected. It would have been rejected by a much greater majority had the facts of the New Zealand wheat agreement been known early enough. Labour Ministers to-day, although they claim to be dyedinthewool democrats, are not prepared to trust the democracy which is the Australian wheat industry. They are not prepared to submit this agreement to the people who will have to carry it out. They do not care a ripe fig, or even one with fruit fly in it, whether the wheatgrowers like the agreement or not. They are determined to ratify it. These are the gentlemen who have told us for so long that they are the great servants of democracy and that they can survive politically only while the people of Australia are in agreement with the policy that they carry out. On occasions like this, we see them in an entirely different light.

                        <para>.- -The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> has made a lot of noise about the Government's wheat stabilization plan. It is true that that plan was submitted to the South Australian wheat-growers and rejected, but the fact remains that growers' organizations in every wheat-growing State favoured stabilization. When the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill was passed by this Parliament, the Government gave a certain assurance to the wheat-growers' organizations in regard to the cost of production of wheat. The plan then had to be approved by each State before if. could become operative. In South Australia, the proposal was submitted to a poll of wheat-growers and defeated by a narrow majority, only a small percentage of the growers voting. South Australia was the only State that took that action. To-night, members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party were not " game " to back up the opinions that they have expressed upon this measure by dividing upon the motion for the second reading. They claim to be the elected representatives of the growers, but they had not the backbone to call for a division. Now they are asking the Government to submit the proposal to a poll of wheat-growers throughout the Commonwealth so that' vested interests may spend vast sums of money on propaganda aimed at defeating the plan. In almost every action taken by honorable members opposite relative t:o the wheat industry since the parties i.o which they belong have occupied the Opposition benches in this Parliament, there has been evidence of an endeavour to deliver the industry back into the hands of the merchants and private speculators. To-night, they were not prepared to divide upon the second reading  of  the bill. They want the Government to hold a poll of the growers so that the wheat merchants and their representatives may stump the country as they did when a poll was taken in South Australia on the wheat stabilization plan. On that occasion, the agents of such large organizations as Elder Smith and Company Limited and Dalgety and Company Limited were posted throughout the State to visit wheat-farms and disseminate propaganda aimed at securing the  defeat of the proposal. But, even then, the -scheme was defeated by only a very narrow margin. To-night we have heard the humbugs and hypocrites of the Opposition saying, in effect, " Let the wheat merchants do their damndest. We have ,1 nt the political backbone to vote against lie measure, but we hope that the power  if  money will secure its defeat." I am confident that the Minister will not accept rite amendment and so will deprive the merchants and speculators of an opportunity to destroy the International Wheat Agreement. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lemmon)</inline> said that honorable members on this side of the House did not dare to try to defeat this measure by calling for a division on the motion for the second reading. Any one who is aware of the respective strength of the Government and the Opposition in this chamber, will realize how empty was the Minister's gibe. The Minister knows quite well that, if a division had been called for,  38  regimented supporters of the Government from Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and the other cities - all advocates of the farmers' interests, of course - would have trooped into the House to vote in obedience to the orders of caucus, so that the small number on this side of the House should be overwhelmed. Therefore, we did not waste the time of the House by making what would have been merely an empty gesture. We contend that the question should be decided by the wheat-growers themselves, the men who produce the wheat by their sweat and toil. They alone are entitled to say how their property should be disposed of. Replying to the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McBride),</inline> the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> said that the agreement could not be submitted to a poll of wheatgrowers because it had to operate from the  1st  July next. Although, by implication, he agreed that the growers ought to be consulted, he said that it would not be possible to do this and keep within the terms of the agreement. I have the agreement here, and it is evident that the Minister has not stated the position accurately. Paragraph  3  of article XX. of the agreement contains this passage - </para>

                        <para>With respect to governments which deposit their instruments of acceptance after 1st July, 194S. the agreement shall enter into force on the date of such deposit, provided that in no case shall articles I. to IX. inclusive be deemed to have entered into force before 1st August, 1948, as a result of such deposit. </para>

                    <para class="block">Obviously, that means that the Government can, at any time after the 1st July, enter into the agreement and lodge a notification of acceptance subject to the general condition, that it would not be bound by certain obligations which would have operated had acceptance been lodged prior to the 1st July. However, the Government knows well that the agreement would be rejected if it dared to invite the opinion of the growers, the persons who have the greatest right to express an opinion. Since the Government has challenged us to a division on this issue, I inform the Minister that the honorable member for Wakefield and I, as well as others on this side of the House, will call for a division on this amendment, so that we may see just where members of the Labour party stand in regard to it. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the most insulting thing that has  ever  been said of the wheatgrowers by any Minister of State. Any one who believes that the wheat-growers know so little about their own business that they &lt;-an be bought or bluffed by the expenditure of a few shillings by a city wheat merchant has a great deal to learn about the wheat-growers, however much he may know about the wheat industry. Since 1939, no wheat merchants have been operating in any State of the Commonwealth except as agents for the pool. Under regulations issued by the Government which preceded the present one, they were forbidden to trade in wheat. </para>

                            <para>- The Government dares not submit this issue to a poll of growers. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> knows that there would be no chance of the agreement being accepted by them. Were such a poll taken the Government would have to explain to the growers why they were being saddled with the agreement without their consent. Does the Government believe that the growers are not fit and proper persons to decide the issue? The very men who seek the amendment of the Constitution as this Government has done time after time are supposed to be fully qualified to express an opinion on the most intricate questions of law, but when the question is one of what the wheat-growers shall do with their own product the Minister for Works and Housing claims that by the expenditure of money a few Adelaide wheat-merchants can get the wheat on their own terms. I invite the Minister to accompany me to any part of my electorate and make that statement to the growers. He may choose the place and time, and I shall be with him, and we shall have a copy of the International Wheat Agreement. I made a similar offer to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard),</inline> but up to date lie has not accepted it. He went to Pinnaroo without me. I now invite him to go there with me. I should not mind if the Minister for "Works and Housing accompanied us. I assure him although the citrus industry is not established There: he will get all the "lemons"- he wants. </para>

                            <para>- The amendment refers to a poll of the growers. Legislation passed by the Government of Western Australia included provision for a poll of growers. It was not embodied in the measure introduced in and passed by the Legislative Assembly. That measure could not become law, because of objections raised by the Legislative Council, until it included a provision for a poll of growers. Because complementary legislation was defeated in South Australia nothing was to be gained by proclaiming it or putting it into operation. Without the agreement of all the States the poll could not become operative. The honorable gentleman talked about there being no merchants operating who could, because of their financial strength, influence. growers in the matter of polls. The fact is that in all the wheat-growing States, all the wheat merchants are operating to-day as agents for the Australian Wheat Board. Furthermore, in Western Australia the position is somewhat, different, for the reason that 9S per cent, of the wheat produced is controlled by bulk handling, which is operated by one company. Throughout the war, the wheat merchants continued the practice of having registered offices and agents at all wheat sidings. Doubtless, they hope that the Commonwealth wheat pool system will suffer disintegration and they will again be able to go into the market as speculators. The honorable member for Barker has shown how little he know? about the physical handling of the wheal crop in Australia from 1939 to the present time. </para>

When the honorable member for Indi interjected, " Did the Australian Wheat Board have the agreement ", the Minister replied, " No ". Surely, then, we cannot be accused of uttering falsehoods when we base our statements on the Minister's own statement! The purpose of the amendment is to have the matter submitted to the growers. In Queensland, where a similar provision has been operating successfully, there is the same ministerial directive a? the Minister claims is embodied in the Western Australian legislation. But I remind the Minister that it is not applied automatically. Under the Queensland legislation, the growers have the right to demand a poll on the matter of the continuation of the term of office of the board and other such vital matters, if 10 per cent, of their number asks for one to be taken. It is available for automatic application should that be sought by the growers. Because the Minister here exercises the right to dominate the industry, he makes the charge that we have m&gt; right to say that the Australian Wheat Board was not consulted, although hp himself said in this House that the agreement had not been submitted to the board, and the only member of the board who could be classed as a representative of the growers was a clerk out of the London office of the board. </para>

The honorable gentleman characterized as a falsehood the statement of the honorable member for Indi, that the International Wheat Agreement had not been referred to the Australian Wheat Board. What was said about this aspect of the agreement by the honorable member for Indi was perfectly true. The Minister cannot evade the issue by making such accusations against the veracity of an honorable member who is ill and unable to be present to defend himself. He should be prepared to accept the amendment and consult the growers on this matter. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member's interjection proves conclusively what this Government thinks about the wheat-growers. The actions of the Government brand it as a dictator determined not, to give the wheat-growers a chance to express their views as to the disposal of the product of their labours. The- Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> said that if wheatgrowers were asked whether they would like to have very high prices, or good even prices, would they favour the latter. Certainly they would do so. But that does not entitle the honorable gentleman to assume that they favour this agreement.  His  speech consisted solely of apologies for the agreement and left us even more convinced that the growers are disgusted with it. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> devoted three-quarters of an hour to telling us that he had written to the Australian Wheat Hoard in regard to the contracts with India and the United Kingdom and that, its the board had not answered his letters he did not. think it necessary to consult the board in respect of the International Wheat Agreement. That was the case submitted by the honorable gentleman in answer to criticism that he had not consulted the board. </para>

                    <para class="block">That has been the position from the beginning of these negotiations. Is it any wonder, then, that the Government cannot accept the amendment ? The wheatgrowers are to be made a chopping block for this Government. The Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lemmon),</inline> clearly showed that he thought the wheatgrowers should make some contribution to the Consolidated Revenue as he stated that they had already received assistance from the Commonwealth amounting to approximately Â£40,000.000. That estimate may be right or it may be wrong - it is probably wrong - but even if the wheat-grower? had been granted assistance to that amount, they have contributed at least 50 times as much to the welfare of the.country, and accordingly they should be given a chance to voice their opinion as to this agreement. The honorable member for- Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duthie)</inline> spoke of the hardships endured by the wheatgrowers down the years. I notice that honorable members opposite are laughing. </para>

                        <para>.- I regret that the Government will not accept the amendment. I am sure that upon reconsideration the Minister will admit that the reasons he gave for the rejection of the amendment have no foundation in fact.  His  contention that no opportunity exists for the holding of a poll of wheat-growers is entirely beside the point, for the agreement provides that the signatories may come into the scheme at any time. The Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lemmon)</inline> stated the real reason behind the Government's rejection of this proposal when he made insulting remarks as to the capacity of the wheat-growers to express a considered view on this very important issue. The Government has not displayed any reluctance in the past in submitting to the people of this country, including the wheat-growers, many important questions affecting their welfare. When the Government's proposals have been rejected, Government spokesmen have invariably said that the issues were decided not on their merits but as the result of undue influence or the incapacity of the electors correctly to assess the true position. We recently had an exhibition of petulance on the part of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> following the publication of the results of the referendum on rents and prices. </para>

                            <para>- It has been suggested that a poll should not be taken because the wheat-growers are not competent to express an opinion on the merits of the agreement. The Government is afraid to consult them on the matter fearing that they would reject it. Those who expend their time, labour and money in the production of wheat, know something about wheat and have very definite ideas as to what should be done with the product of their labours. They should be given an opportunity to express their views regarding the merits or demerits of the proposed agreement without having their commodity sold willy nilly by the Government. I hope that the Government will agree to review the matter even at this late stage and accept the amendment. </para>

                            <para>-Order ! The Minister is entitled to reply to any statements that are made. However, I conaider that the discussion is a little wide of the subject before the committee. The clause under consideration deals with the date of operation of this legislation, and an amendment has been proposed providing that a poll of growers shall be taken before the measure is put into operation. [ ask honorable members to confine their remarks to those two matters. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the amendment proposed by the honorable member for "Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McBride).</inline> It is designed to give the wheat-growers the right to declare whether they approve of the proposed International Wheat Agreement, which has been signed by the representative of this Government at Washington and is now before the Parliament for ratification. As the .honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)</inline> has pointed out, the agreement will be ratified whether the growers approve of it or not. I have never before known a Minister, who claims to represent primary producers in this Parliament, insult them as the Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lemmon)</inline> did to-night. He said that the Opposition wanted to submit this agreement to a vote of the growers in order that vested interests might once again secure control of the marketing of wheat. In effect, he said that the wheat-growers of Australia are so stupid as to be incapable of making their own judgment about the international agreement and that they would be guided merely by the propaganda of agents. What the Minister did not tell the Parliament is that this Government, which is the very father of referendums, having referred more questions to the people in the course of its existence than had any other government in the previous history of Australia, is denying to the owners of the wheat the right to decide whether or not they will accept the proposed international  agreement. The sooner the Government realizes that the farmers. are the true owners of their own products and that the Government i? merely the trustee of their interests, the better it will be for the producers and for Australia generally. The wheat farmers have an absolute right to decide how their product shall be marketed. Therefore, the Government should conduct a poll so as to enable them to exercise that right. Whenever this Government has wanted to obtain additional powers under the Constitution, it has appealed to the people without the slightest hesitation. Yet it refuses point-blank to permit the wheat-growers, one of the most important primary-producing groups in Australia, to decide how their product shall be marketed ! I believe that the growers have never been consulted about the international agreement, either through their representatives in this Parliament or through the Australian Wheat Board. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, in the very long speech which he made in this chamber to-night, told us a great deal about the contract which was arranged for the sale of Australian wheat to the United Kingdom and India, but he admitted that there was no arrangement- </para>

                <para class="block">The effect of this amendment would be to put the wheat-grower in the only possible position in which the agreement could be of any use to him. if carried on. As it is, the wheat-grower is not protected against contingencies which may arise, and if the agreement should break down it would be too bad for him; he would get nothing. If the agreement does, in fact, mean what the Government has guaranteed it means - and is in fact worth what the Government says it is worth - then I contend that the only practicable way to express the intention of the Government is to insert the amendment I have suggested, defining "guaranteed prices" in clause 3. If this is done, the wheatgrowers of Australia will know that for a period of five years the lowest price they can get for any one of the crops grown in those five years, is the minimum price set out in the schedule. It will mean that for the crop being sown in 1948-49 the grower must get 1.50 dollars; for the  1949-50  crop.  1.40  dollars; for the  1950-51 crop, 1.30  dollars; for the  1951-52  crop,  1.20  dollars; and for the  1952-53  crop,  1.10  dollars. </para>
                <para>It is not enough that the Minister claims that this is a wonderful agreement. [ say that it is not. I challenge the Minister, on his own grounds, that if the Government is sincere, this guarantee can be given without causing any worry; if the Ministeris not prepared to give such a guarantee, I say that he is speaking in the most eloquent way possible to the Australian wheat-growers, but that the Government has no faith in the document. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron).</inline> If the Government is really behind this scheme, it will have no hesitation in accepting the amendment. On the other hand, if the Government does not accept the amendment, there is absolutely no guarantee whatever of the prices suggested during this debate being, available to the wheat-growers. As honorable members are aware, Russia and Argentina are outside the agreement. Should prices fall, the Australian wheat-growers will not get the prices mentioned in the agreement, and will stand to lose  Â£12,000,000  immediately, from sales to Great Britain. I ask that the Minister reply on this aspect immediately, and inform the House clearly of the Government's intentions regarding the guaranteed price to the wheat-growers. Of the  33  importing countries there may be some which will not stand up to the agreement. </para>

When there is a conflict of opinion relative to a clause before the committee, it is the custom in this chamber for the Chair to accord to the honorable member who wishes to speak to the clause an opportunity to do so. I know of no occasion on which that custom has been, departed from. I ask you, sir, as a matter of courtesy, to extend that privilege to the honorable member for Richmond. </para>

                        <para>- Article XX. provides that the agreement shall become operative if certain conditions are fulfilled. The Minister stated earlier that acceptance had to be notified by the 1st July next. Article XX. can, I suppose, be interpreted in many ways. Although I do not pose as an authority on its interpretation, it appears to me that it provides for the grant of an extension of time to parties to the agreement whose instruments of acceptance are not deposited by the 1st July.

                <para>Articles I. to IX. deal with the objectives of the agreement, the rights and obligations of importing and exporting countries, the names of those countries, reports to the council, enforcement of rights, adjustment of obligations and a number of incidental matters. Article XX. continues -  . . . between  the  governments which have deposited their instruments of acceptance by July 1, 1948, provided that any such government may, at the opening of the first session of the International Wheat Council, established by Article XI. of this agreement, which session should be convened in Washington early in July 1948 by the Government of the United States of America, effect its withdrawal by notification to the Government of the United States of America if in the opinion of any such government the guaranteed purchases or guaranteed sales of the countries whose governments have formally accepted this agreement are insufficient to ensure its successful operation. 1 assume that that means that if there is not ratification by a sufficient number of governments, the whole agreement will fall to the ground. The next part of the article is the one in which I am particularly interested, because it would give Australia further time, if that is desired, to enable investigations to be made to ascertain the views of wheatgrowers and others. The article continues - </para>

                    <para>With respect to governments which deposit their instruments of acceptance after July I, 1948, the agreement should enter into force on the date of such deposit, provided that in no case shall Articles I. to IX., inclusive be deemed to have entered into force before August 1, 1948, as a result of such deposit. lt is only common sense that a country such as Australia which fails to deposit its instrument of acceptance by the 1st July should have an opportunity to do so later, and that is expressly provided for. I suggest that the Government should exhibit a little hesitation before depositing the Australian instrument of acceptance. </para>

                    <para>.- An important aspect of the  problem  that 1= raised by this clause is the position of the United States of America, which is one of the three exporting countries. The agreement provides that its export contribution is to be 185,000,000 bushels. The American position must be clarified if there is to be any stability in this arrangement. Under Article XX., the countries concerned must indicate acceptance by the 1st July of this year. So far as I am aware, the legislature of the United States of America has not yet. adopted this agreement, . and, presumably, as it is in the nature of a treaty it requires the sanction of the American Senate. Obviously, if the United States of America does not ratify the agreement, and bearing in mind that Russia and Argentina are to remain out of it, the agreement would be an insubstantial affair so far as Australia is concerned. In view of the late stage we have reached - only a few weeks remain before the? article will commence to operate in its present terms, can the Minister tell the committee what are the prospects of the agreement being ratified by the United States of America? I understand that public hearings have been held and, no doubt, there are in the United States of America those who have their doubts about the efficacy of an arrangement such as this agreement in which so many countries are involved ; and which, if previous experience be any guide, is not likely to have the smooth future which the optimists who present it have forecast. Having regard to the obligations Australia is to assume and the specific reference in Article XX. to the requirement that, as far as practicable, the signatory governments must indicate acceptance by the 1st July, can the Minister inform us whether the agreement is likely to be ratified by the United States of America, and, if so, when? </para>

The only question for the committee to decide  is  whether approval is to be given to acceptance by Australia under this article. Some countries - I think Canada is one - have indicated acceptance under the executive or prerogative powers of the Crown, without parliamentary sanction. What the Government is asking the committee to do is to approve its executive act of acceptance under the article. The only form of acceptance is that indicated  in  paragraph 2 of Article  XX.  which says -  </para>

                        <para>- No. Paragraph 3 operates partly from the  1st  July and partly from the  1st  August; but should  it  appear in July next that a country like the United States of America will not ratify the agreement, a right is given to countries already parties to the agreement - and I assume Australia will be one of them - to effect withdrawal. But should Australia, or any other country, wait until the last moment in order to see what other countries, such  as  the United States of America, do, that would get rid of the agreement. </para>

                        <para>- The Bretton-Woods Agreement differs from this one. Under this agreement a dead-line is fixed and Australia, if it is to be a party to the agreement at all, must accept it by the 1st July. The only purpose of paragraph 2 is to indicate whether approval would be given by the legislature to the course of action taken by the Executive. </para>

Australia could not satisfy either of thosconditions. First, we are not an importing country; and, secondly, we are1 not prevented by a recess of the Parliament from ratifying the agreement before that date. Therefore, Australia cannot answer the description of a Government depositing its instrument of acceptance after the 1st July; we must be a Government depositing an instrument of acceptance by the 1st July. </para>

                    <para>- One could practically make a second-reading speech in respect of this article. However, I do not propose to re-open the subject as a whole. I take this opportunity to express again my disapproval of the agreement in its present form, and to reiterate that the Parliament has not been given an opportunity to deal effectively with the agreement. We must either accept it or leave it, and as the Government is determined to ratify it we must accept it whether we like it or not. </para>

                <para class="block">A ttorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has raised ;m issue of great consequence, which the committee should not lightly pass by. He said that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> is of opinion that the prospects of the agreement being ratified by the United States of America are "fair to good ". In other words, there is a considerable element of doubt as to whether the United States of America will adopt the agreement, and whether it will do so within the prescribed time. Assuming that the prospects instead of being good ms the Attorney-General hopes, are not good, and that, in point of fact there is such opposition to the agreement in the United States of America that that country does not come into the scheme, I invite the committee to see just where Australia stands insofar as the written text of this agreement affects us. I invite also the attention of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and the Attorney-General to this matter because it may be that there are other avenues of escape for Australia. In paragraph 3 of Article XX. the only opportunity for a country placed as Australia might be placed to effect a withdrawal from the scheme would occur if it could be shown that there were insufficient purchasers to take the wheat that that country had guaranteed to sell. With the United States of America, Russia, and Argentina, remaining outside the scheme and selling on an open market at probably a higher price than would be available under the terms of this agreement, Australia might well find itself bound to honour the agreement approved by this Parliament. If there were sufficient purchasers to take all the wheat that Australia had guaranteed to provide, this country would be required to sell at the price specified in the agreement. Whilst that might not be so unsatisfactory in the. first year of the agreement, as the years went by, with those other countries remaining out, the discrepancy between the cost of wheat on the open market and the price which the Australian wheat-growers could charge might, become very wide. The committee will require a stronger assurance on this matter than that given by the Government so far. We should, I suggest, be in an intolerable position if the United States of America refused to ratify the agreement, and the only way that Australia could withdraw from it was by establishing that there were not sufficient purchasers to take all the wheat that we had guaranteed to export. I invite either Minister at the table to clarify the doubt that has been raised in my mind on this point. I know that in other parts of the schedule there are provisions for representations to be made to the Council as a whole, but the Council is not yet in being. That may be a very shadowy right so far as Australia is concerned, and for the time being at any rate, we must look to the literal obligations that we accept under the agreement. </para>

The proposal can further be ruled out of order on the ground that it may commit the Consolidated Revenue to a financial. liability for which no provision has been -made by the Governor-General. </para>

                        <para>. -  On article XIX there is a definition of " free-market prices ". How there can be free-market prices without a free market I do not know. I have heard Ministers speak about the evils of a free market, and of merchants, but there cannot be a free market without merchants, and I should like to know under what, conditions the Government expects this free market to operate. Does it expect to re-establish merchants in Australia operating on a free market? I should like to know how this free market will work in the world in general, and in Australia in particular. </para>

                    <para>. - 1 think that the definition of " free-market prices " is perfectly clear to everybody. Unlike the previous international wheat agreement, this agreement allows for the exporting of wheat other than that provided for in the agreement. For instance, Australia will be entitled to sell to the contracting importing nations 85,000,000 bushels of wheat annually, but the situation may arise, and in fact is likely to arise, in which Australia will have a quantity of wheat for export over and above that 85,000,000 bushels. That would come within the definition of freemarket wheat and Australia would be entitled to sell it on the world market at whatever price it could obtain for it. </para>

                    <para>.- I again press the Government to give some attention to the point which  I  previously raised. Quite clearly, the Parliament  would not accept this agreement if it did not believe that the United States of America was a party to it. I do not approve of the agreement. </para>

                        <para>- I am against it because it is visionary and wholly impracticable. It will break down under its own weight, I invite the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> to remind me in five years' time that I was a prophet of woe, but I am confident that the soundness of my observations will then have been established. The United States of America is one of the three principal exporting countries involved in the agreement. So far, the legislature of that country has not ratified the agreement, and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> cannot give any assurance that it will do so. We are entitled to know what will be the position of Australia as a contracting party if one of the principal exporters refuses to adopt the agreement. Paragraph 3 of Article XX. provides, that if in the opinion of any government, the guaranteed sales of countries whose governments have formally accepted the agreement are insufficient to ensure its successful operation the government - in this case the Australian Government - could effect its withdrawal. </para>

            <quote>
                <para>Following upon the honorable member's question, I asked the Commonwealth authorities concerned to furnish me with a statement as to the present position. I have ascertained that 450 tons of zinc for Lysaghts arrived at Newcastle on the 16th May and a further 300 tons on the 22nd May. I might point out that the Commonwealth Government 1ms no control over the allocations of zinc but the Department of Supply and Development endeavours to ensure that Australian consumers are provided with reasonable supplies. This has involved close contact with the producers, Electrolytic Zinc - Company of Australasia Limited, and representations to this Company have always met with ready response. The Company has given an assurance that it will use its best endeavours to improve the supply position, but for a number of reasons cannot undertake to provide Lysaghts with stock equivalent to a month's usage. The Electrolytic Zinc Company states that only minor interruptions to production have occurred at Lysaghts owing to the shortage of zinc and these have been due to the shipping position which has now improved. There is no actual control over the export of zinc from Australia, but I am informed that approximately 75 per cent, is reserved for Australian industry, and that the rest is sold to Britain. It is necessary for some of the zinc sold to Britain to be shipped at a port on the mainland as direct shipping is not available from Tasmania. This is the reason why some of the zinc has been transshipped at Newcastle. I might add that the shipments made to Britain mean a great' saving in dollar expenditure, because if the quantities supplied by Australia were reduced, Britain would have to turn to dollar sources of supply to meet her essential needs. </para>

<para> Yes. The head of a diplomatic mission in a foreign country or the High Commissioner in one of the countries in the British Commonwealth of Nations, is the principal representative of Australia in that country. As such he is, in the last resort, responsible for the actions of all Commonwealth servants in that country and for the making of all representations on a government level. He is also responsible for ensuring that the policy of the Government is carried out and that any action proposed by the Government or by a Commonwealth department does not prejudice Australia's interests in the country in which he represents Australia. Officials of other Commonwealth departments are under the general jurisdiction of the head of the mission. They correspond with their own departments directly on routine matters and generally through the Department of External Affairs or (in the case of the High Commissioner's Office, London) the Prime Minister's Department, on matters of policy or important matters of administration. The arrangement must necessarily be flexible, but there is no reason to doubt that up to the present it has worked satisfactorily in the interests of Australia and the countries in which Australia is represented.</para>

                        <para>Consideration has been given to the extension of the absent voting provisions to permit an elector for any division voting at any polling place within the Commonwealth, but for several reasons such an extension is regarded as inadvisable. At a general election it would involve  the  supply of printed Senate ballot papers  for  all States to all polling places with increased quantities of blank House of Representatives ballot-papers, lists ofcandidates  for  all divisions and lists of polling plaices  for  all States. The supply of  so  many different ballot-papers and forms  and  necessarily enlarged instructions, would  'contuse  many pollingofficials, resulting in  frequent  usage of incorrect ballot-papers, invalidating  the  vote. In many casesdoubt would arise as to the elector's division and in consequence many votes would be recorded informally. Absent votes recorded at outlying palling places for distant divisions would take weeks to reach the appropriate returning officer for scrutiny and the finalization of the counts would be held up unduly. Electors' absent from their home States are qualified to vote by post and may so vote at any time after nomination day. It is considered this provision reasonably meets requirements. </para>

These treaties will become operative with respect to Australia upon their deposit in Moscow. With regard to regulations permitting British subjects, who were former residents in Italy,Roumania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Finland, to make claims against the ' Governments of those countries for restitution,compensation, &amp;c., I understand that inquirers have been informed that pending the ratification of the treaties they should appoint an agent in the country where their property was situated to make a formal claim and watch the interests of the owner. When the treaties have been ratified, it is proposed that regulations under the bills will be promulgated and claims for restitution, compensation, &amp;c. will then be transmitted through the appropriate official channels. </para>
