                            <para>- I hope that the Minister, like myself, regards this as a matter of urgency. The honorable gentleman has stated that he is prepared to lay the agenda-paper before the House for discussion at the earliest moment. That seems to me indefinite, and I should like him to say whether he will be prepared to have the discussion within two or three weeks, or a month, so that we may have ample time to deal with the matter, rather than have such important business left to the last days of the session. </para>

Ample opportunity will be given to honorable members to consider the agenda-paper of the Imperial Conference. The Government will choose the time when it is possible to put it before the House, but I give my assurance that there will be ample time to discuss it before the close of thesession. </para>

                        <para>- May I point out, in the first place, that this is a question of policy which the Government cannot deal with by way of answers to questions. In the second place, it is desirable in the interests of honorable members themselves, whose questions are all of the greatest importance, that opportunity should be given to the Government to supply them with the fullest information available. Unless a question is so urgent that even the delay of a day is impossible, the Government must ask that it be placed on the notice-paper, when it will receive the consideration that I am sure every question deserves. </para>

They could deal effectively with the need for carrying out the North-South railway, which means so much to the advancement and development of Australia, and could speak of the neglect of the Government to honour the contract made by the Commonwealth with the State of South Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- I take this opportunity of bringing under the notice of the Ministry an instance in which a good deal of economy could be exercised. Prior to the opening of the last session no fewer than twelve highly paid officials entered the Library of this building, walked around it, and looked at the tables and the chairs to see what the Governor-General would have to do when he attended there to await the presentation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> If one <inline font-style="italic">aidedecamp</inline> had come and asked our Librarian, who has had probably thirty years' experience of similar functions, he could have seen all that was required <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be seen, and there would then have been no necessity for sending along the Admiral of the Fleet and, I believe, also, the Commandant, as well as ten other highly paid officials. The Ministry cannot be blamed for this ridiculous expenditure, but now that their attention has been drawn to the waste of money I hope that they will realize that an <inline font-style="italic">aide-de-camp</inline> could quite easily consult the Librarian as to whether the Governor-General'schair has been placed in. a proper position. </para>

                    <para>.- While we are preparing an Address-in-Reply to  His Excellency  the Governor-General's speech, it is surely competent for us to point out that in our opinion a good deal of the flummery and ceremonial attached to the opening of Parliament should be abolished. We should intimate to him clearly that all this flaunting and ceremony in the streets should be done away with. Fancy us, a democratic community, having our Governor-General drawn through the streets in a State carriage with uniformed post ill ions in powdered wigs and with outriders on prancing, fiery steeds ! </para>

                    <para>.- The Governor-General, in his Speech, addresses honorable members of this House, and the Address-in-Reply, which we propose to present to him, should reflect the opinions of honorable members of this House. The Government proposes to appoint two honorable gentlemen to express its views, but the whole of this House, and not merely the Government, should do that. This question may not have been raised in previous Parliaments; the excuse for raising it now is that we are endeavouring to improve upon the parliamentary procedure of the past. The amendment proposes the names of two other honorable gentlemen, who, we think, can better express to  His Excellency  the views of members of this House. I am becoming tired of formalities in which everything is prepared in advance, and I desire, if possible, to present to  His Excellency  an Address-in-Reply which will reflect the opinion of the whole of this House, which is composed, not merely of the Government, but also of an Opposition and a third party. At present we do not know what are the opinions of the third party. All we know is that the two honorable gentlemen who have been named have been chosen by the Government to express the views of the Government. Obviously, they cannot express the views of other honorable members. I hope the opinion of the House will be tested on the subject, and that, in future, the House as a whole will have an opportunity of replying to the Governor-General's Speech. </para>

                    <para class="block">I desire to express my thanks for the very cordial reception that honorable members have extended to me. I take it to be a demonstration of kindness to a new member breaking the ice in making his maiden speech. Being both a new and a young member, I approach this subject with a great deal of diffidence and trepidation. That I should be asked to move this motion, I regard, not as a personal compliment, but as a tribute to the great and important electorate that I have the honour to represent. </para>
                    <para>A perusal of the reference to proposed legislation in the Governor-General's Speech shows that the session promises to be one of great moment to Australia. The subject which appears to me to be of outstanding importance is that of the Imperial Conference. The announcement that the Prime Minister proposes to represent Australia at that Conference has given universal satisfaction in Australia. The chief subject to be dealt with at the Conference will be defence. The time has come when Australia, together with the other partners in the great commonwealth of nations called the British Empire, must seriously face this question. Australia must be prepared to play her part, and do her share as a partner. We must all realize that times have changed, and that methods which were serviceable yesterday will certainly not be adequate for the contests of to-morrow. We, in Australia, cannot defend ourselves. It is certain that 5,000,000 people cannot hope to hold this country, particularly in a time of world crisis, without support from outside. To my mind, the only way in which we can hope to defend Australia and keep it for ourselves is by a well-thought-out and well-considered scheme of Imperial naval and military defence. Britain should be made to understand thatAustralia believes that the different portions of the Empire must stand or fall together. I believe in the League of Nations, and I am hopeful that it may some day be able to insure the peace of the world, but to-day it cannot do so. Until the day comes when our hopes in this direction are realized we must be prepared to play our part and make certain that we are well equipped to protect ourselves. Wrapped up in this problem is the important question of migration. Only by bringing people to Australia can we hope adequately to defend this country. We need population, not only for the defence, but for the development of Australia. Some critics urge that the introduction of population will create a surplus of labour and result ultimately in serious and widespread unemployment, with all its attendant horrors. This is a proved fallacy. Much the same cry was raised when labour-saving machinery was applied to production, and I am satisfied that no one in the labour world to-day would say that the introduction of machinery has had that result. But it is obvious that, hand and hand with migration, there must be some well-considered plan for the development of Australia. There must be a nation-wide stocktaking of our resources, and consideration given to the possibility of their expansion. Such a course would permit of the preparation of some comprehensive plan to absorb the added population from year to year. No sane Government would induce people to come to Australia if it did not know what it was going to do with them. When we regard the vastness of this continent and consider its productivity, and when we remember our proximity to countries with teeming millions of people, we must realize that our only chance of keeping Australia white, or, perhaps, of keeping it at all, lies in the direction of a great access of population. I trust, however, that the people to be introduced under the scheme now in operation will be of the right type, and not comprise a large proportion of those who, instead of settling upon the land and becoming useful producers, will gravitate to the cities. With increased population and a correspondingly increased production, we shall be  faced with the problem of finding an outlet for our products. I believe the solution of this difficulty will be found in -some well-thought-out reciprocal policy on all economic questions, and particularly a scheme for the development of trade within the Empire. Such a policy will enable us satisfactorily to dispose of  our primary products, such as wheat, wool, beef, butter, and cotton, to mention only a few of them, as well as our manufactured articles. Australia willingly and grudgingly -played her part as a component part of the Empire during the recent war, and would do so again if necessity arose. It is not unreasonable, therefore, to suggest that in some such Empire development scheme this country is entitled to better consideration. We all know that quite recently important contracts for the supply of beef for the British Army went to America. Britain must be told, in no uncertain' voice, at the approaching Imperial Conference, that the prosperity of the Empire is wrapped up in the progress of the Empire as a whole. </para>
                    <para>I desire now to refer to the operations of the Commonwealth Bank. We all have watched with great pleasure the progress made by that institution under the able administration of the Governor, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller, and, I feel sure that I am voicing the sentiments of every member of this House when I say that we all deeply regret his untimely death. The proposed reorganization of the Bank and the appointment of a Board of Directors will, I believe, enable the Bank more truly to discharge its functions as a national Bank. I believe an extension of its activities to the primary producers is essential to the prosperity of the country. At this point I desire to stress the claims of my own State, with its special and peculiar tropical interests, for representation on the Board. </para>
                    <para>I was pleased to notice in  His  Excellency's Speech that the Government propose to concentrate on the construction of the first section of the North-South railway line by the continuation of the existing railway as far as Daly Waters. I hope that the line will be deviated from that point into Queensland, which is the natural outlet for the Northern Territory. No less than four-fifths of the population of Aust, -ralia is centred on the eastern sea-board." If the line be deviated, as I suggest, through western Queensland, it will traverse some of the best grazing lands in the whole of Australia. Such a scheme will, in my opinion, go a long way towards solving the problem of - Northern Territory development, lt should be remembered also that the Public Works Committee recently concluded an exhaustive investigation into the merits of the rival routes, and came to the conclusion that the time was not opportune for the construction of an expensive line connecting the Northern Territory with South Australia. While on this question of railways I would like to say that,- in my opinion, the present time is not favorable for altering the whole of the railway systems of the Commonwealth to a uniform gauge connecting the capital cities. I believe that the new proposals, as outlined by the Prime Minister, will serve the needs of Australia for the time being, and at the same time open up for development a large area of new country. I am personally acquainted with a great portion of the country to be traversed by the Kyogle-Beaudesert-Brisbane line. This railway will be almost, entirely, developmental, and will' serve an immense area of undeveloped land. </para>
                    <para>I am exceedingly pleased that in connexion with Canungra, Beaudesert, and  other saw-mills and timber areas in Queensland, the Government have been bold enough to declare for the disposal of the mills. They have taken the only reasonable course open to them. I trust, however, that there will be no undue delay in finalizing the tenders, and that shortly we shall hear that the wheels of - industry in those areas have been set. in motion again. </para>
                    <para>I wish now to refer to a question of vital importance, not only to my own State, but to the whole of Australia, namely, the position of the sugar industry, which ranks amongst the largest of our primary-producing interests. The Prime Minister, when speaking recently in Brisbane on this matter, said - </para>
                    <para>Economically, the sugar industry is of even greater importance to the nation than a superficial examination of trade statistics would indie te. For it should  always  be remembered that, if S..ar were not produced in Australia, from £5.00(1,000 to £6,000,000 would have to be remitted each year to foreign countries, which buy in return scarcely any of our goods. During the Government-control period just expiring, over £47,000,000 was thus kept and spent in Australia in respect of the locally grown tonnage. </para>
                    <para>I'he naliim.ll or political significance of the industry is even more arresting to the mind. In t/,ls regard rue. sugar  industry  stands in a  unique  position in Australia - for it is the sole industry of any magnitude ut ali that has been successfully carried on in those bar North coastal lands that are or such strategic importance to the White Australia policy. </para>
                    <para>Looking at the map observers will notice that the Northern Territory .is practically in the same latitude as Cairns, innisfail, Mossman, Herbert River, and other very large closely settled sugar districts. Yet the Territory's white population is lower than it was thirty years ugo, and the problem of developing it seems as difficult of solution as ever. On the other hand, the sugar districts mentioned have witnessed constant substantial increases in farms, commerce, and population. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister's statement is, I think, sufficient justification for the claims by the growers of Queensland that the industry should be stabilized. I also remind honorable members that the 1912 and 1920 Royal Commissions recognised the obvious fact that the continuance of the sugar industry" waa bound up with the very existence of Australia as a nation. The policy of the Government as announced recently in Brisbane is far from satisfactory to the people of Queensland, and I earnestly request them to reconsider their proposals with a view to extending the embargo on the importation of sugar for a period of at least five years, or, as an alternative, that adequate Tariff protection be given to insure the preservation of the industry. Stability is essential for its progress. </para>
                    <para>It is very gratifying to know that there has been a wonderful increase in the production of cotton in Australia. I desire to express my gratification at the announcement that the Government intend to enter into a joint agreement with the States to encourage this new and important industry by a guarantee, and by otherwise .safeguarding it. I can speak on. this question in the light of knowledge and experience, gained in my own electorate, where, despite a very severe drought, through which we have just passed, cotton of the highest grade has been produced in large quantities. This industry, I predict, is destined to bring about a great change in the land settlement policy of Australia. </para>
                    <para>I express my gratification at the announcement made in His Excellency's Speech that the Government will introduce a measure to liberalize and increase old-age and invalid pensions. I am  pleased  also to observe that it is proposed to introduce, in the interests of the returned soldiers, a Bill to amend certain provisions of the War Service Homes Act, In conclusion, I have only to say that 1 appreciate very much the new policy which the Government has adopted of- taking the people into its confidence in respect, to all national questions. It is imperative that the public should be given the fullest information concerning all matters that affect the national wellbeing. </para>

                        <para>. - In rising to second the motion moved so ably by the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. Francis),</inline> I desire to say that I also take it as a compliment to my electorate that I have been selected by the Government to discharge this duty. I remember that when we mci here, not very long ago, the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> twitted the Government in a witty and sarcastic speech, declaring that  His  Excellency's Speech at the opening of the first session contained but very little. That charge cannot be laid against the Speech which we are now considering. It may well be said of it that it is full measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running oven. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>One important matter in  His  Excellency's Speech to which I should like to refer is the statement that the Government intend to take steps for the abolition of dual income taxation. At the present time the Commonwealth collects taxation indirectly through the Customs, and directly from the individual by levying, as do the States, a graduated income tax. .With the right hand the Commonwealth takes toll from the individual, while, with the left it pays back some of that toll in the shape of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> grant to the States. The public, . no doubt, is fully conscious of any extortion that is practised by the right hand, but is equally forgetful of any benefit handed out by the left. One is reminded that the Government in the past has at least been carrying out the scriptural injunction, " Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth." The Commonwealth Government has been incurring the odium of collecting a certain amount of revenue which the State Governments have had the privilege of expending. By the abolition of dual taxation, we shall  adhere to the principle that the Government which collects taxation should spend it - that any money spent by a Government must be collected by that Government. The duplication of taxation is indefensible. We have at the present time an army of Federal and an army of State tax gatherers, both operating in the same field, and it cannot be denied that if the people are tired of the waste which this duplication .involves, they are still more tired of having to fill in separate schedules based on different methods of assessment. The practice has to cease. Much has been said regarding the necessity of abolishing this duplication of taxation. It has been spoken about from many platforms, and it is gratifying to know that to-day the proposal is getting beyond the oratorical stage and is being raised into, the more rarefied atmosphere of action. Simplicity is a merit in mechanism, and it is equally meritorious in respect of taxation methods. The abolition of this duplication will naturally involve, on the part of the Commonwealth, the giving up of the power to levy income tax on individuals which the States have so long held. The Commonwealth will retain the whole of the Customs revenue, part of which it now hands over to the States under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> agreement, and will cease to impose income tax on individuals. It will confine itself to the collection of income tax from companies at the source, by means of a flat rate. The flat-rate system is carried out successfully to-day in New South Wales. . A certain degree of criticism has been levelled against the flat-rate method of collecting income tax. It has been said that, as compared with1 the  scientific method of income tax collection, operated by the Commonwealth to-day, it is unjust in its incidence; hut, although on the surface there may be an appearance of injustice, in actual fact there is little, if any. I was informed to-day by an accountant of many years' experience that he does not know of one case of a small holder of shares in a company which will he taxed under the flat-rate system now proposed, whose income is low enough to be exempt from taxation under the present system.  Doubtlesss.  the scheme will involve an increase of income taxation on the part of the State Governments in order that they may recoup themselves what they will give up by the abolition of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> grant. But even if the State Governments should increase their income taxation to an amount equal to the income tax at present levied by both the State and Federal authorities, the individual income taxpayer will at least be able to rejoice in the fact that he will receive only one assessment, and will so be spared much trouble and harassment. Another point worthy of notice is that while this scheme will, not involve any increase in the cost of collection to the States, it will be an immense saving to the Commonwealth. It will be just as easy for the States, should they have to increase their income taxation, to send out an assessment for, say, £10 instead of £5, or for £20 instead of £10. It will cost no more in paper, ink, stamps, or effort than it costs now to send out a claim for the smaller amount. </para>
                    <para>Another feature of His Excellency's Speech which commends itself to thinking men is the promise that provision will be made for compulsory sinking funds, for loan redemption purposes, on the part of both the State and Federal authorities. This is but prudent finance. Great strides are apparently to be made in the near future towards doing away with duplication, and I hope the effort will also embrace joint electoral rolls. </para>
                    <para>Mention has been made of cotton, and the fact that the Government have made arrangements with the States to do something to encourage its growth in Australia. The world shortage of wool and the prospect of good prices for wool being obtained for quite a number of years offer probably the best insurance we could have against any considerable drop in the price of cotton. The value of the one sympathetically helps to raise the value of the other, .and I hope we shall see in the growing of cotton the establishment of another great Australian industry. </para>
                    <para>The House will  welcome  the assurance that it is to have placed before it the agenda for both the Empire and the Economic Conferences, at which we expect to be represented by the Prime Minister. We must realize that Australia's defence and future safety are inseparably connected with those beneficent tfes which bind Australia, loosely, yet firmly, to the Motherland, and that it would be wise to defer until the return of the Prime Minister from the Imperial Con-"  ference any expenditure on defence which this Parliament in its wisdom might consider it advisable to make. Mention of the Economic Conference gives rise to the hope that, in future, sentiment may go hand in hand with trade, and that preferential trade within the Empire may soon be established. That which has been described as " the crimson thread of kinship," and the knowledge of common sacrifices made, should surely be more potent factors in determining the course of future trade relations than any consideration affecting British capital invested in; foreign countries. </para>
                    <para>I am glad that we are to 'be fully represented at the League of Nations. I agree with every word uttered in regard to this subject by the mover of the motion. It is our duty as a nation to do all that we can to deprecate any attempt that may be made to belittle the League of NTations. Despite its present limitations, it is to-day the hope of the civilized woil'3. Its weakness at the moment lies apparently in the fact that some great nations are holding aloof from it; but I hope the time will soon come when it will be a league of all the nations. Looking back at the history of the world's quarrels, we find that they began between individuals - between Cain and Abel - and that thereafter we had families, then clans, then small nations, and, later still, larger and larger combinations fighting against each other. Law has sufficed to restrain, to a great extent at any rate, fighting between man and man, family and family, clan and clan - as in the case of the Wars of the Roses - and to-day there is very little warfare carried on between small nations. The tendency has been for small groups to join forces and to make war upon a larger scale. Surely, if law in the past has sufficed, step by step, to make it more and more difficult for war to be carried on as between individuals, as between families, clans, and small States, it should not be impossible in the future for international law to supplant force in the larger sphere of world-wide warfare. Lord Robert Cecil is regarded as being, perhaps, one of the greatest exponents of the League of Nations. He has done much to build up its constitution, and is particularly optimistic as to its future. "We in Australia can only hope that his optimism will be justified, and that the League will yet become a mighty instrument for the prevention .of war. We have in this Parliament a new member' who is an eloquent and able exponent of the League of Nations; and I may be permitted to express the hope that during the session we shall have the pleasure of listening to him- on the subject. </para>
                    <para>A measure is proposed for the liberalizing of old-age pensions. In the present system there are many anomalies which need rectification, and one which appeals particularly to me lies in the fact that an old man, who is capable of doing a little work intermittently, and is thereby made- to feel that he is still a useful member of society, is penalized to some extent if he earns something in that way. To penalize a man who thus raises his income a little above the standard laid down as the limit, means that, we destroy incentive and do something to paralyze energy. </para>
                    <para>I am particularly pleased to note that, a Royal Commission is to be appointed to inquire into certain phases of the War Service Homes scandals. This proposal, I am sure, must be appreciated by every lover of clean administration. If unsavoury facts are elicited, and justice is meted out without  fear or favour, it will redound to the credit of the Government ; if, on the other hand, nothing amiss is found, all the better for Australia's reputation for commercial morality. Whichever may be the result, such an inquiry will, at least, allay any possible suspicion that there is something tei hide. </para>
                    <para>The Government announces its intention to co-operate with the States in immigration schemes for land settlement. As one who is on the land, I should like to say that there are four necessities for successful land settlement) - four necessities apart from hard work. These are : cheap money, reduced Tariff burdens on the staple necessaries of primary production, cheaper freights, and more markets. In "Victoria many returned soldiers in the dairying districts are putting up a tremendous struggle against a heavy interest load. I mention this because I wish the Government, in any financial arrangements they may make for soldier settlement, to do the utmost in the way of making available cheap money to ' the States for that purpose, on condition that the. States themselves make further sacrifices in interest to the soldier. -I realize that the conditions laid down for soldier settlement are entirely a matter for the States ; but I take the opportunity to mention the Commonwealth's obligation to provide cheap money, because there seems to me to be a very intimate connexion between the success or failure of our soldier settlement and the success or failure of our future immigration schemes .for land settlement. If ° there should be any general exodus of soldiers from their ' blocks, that would do more to hurt our immigration schemes than anything else could. It would immediately be said, " If your own diggers cannot make good, what is the use of now chums trying?" ' Cheaper freights arc particularly necessary, more necessary, perhaps, to-day, than ever before. "We in Australia are handicapped, as compared with' Canada or the Argentine, in sending our goods to Great Brita'n, owing to the fact that we are separated by 12,000 miles of water. Canada arid the' Argentine are much nearer to Britain than we are. We cannot hope to have freights as low as theirs, so far as Great Britain is concerned; and I  am  particularly glad that the. Government announce their intention to do something in the direction of subsidizing shipments to the East. We have a geographical advantage over Canada and the Argentine,  so  far as China and India are concerned. We are much nearer to those Eastern ports than either of those two countries; yet,  at  the present t:me, we find that the freight from Australia is infinitely higher than those ruling from the more distant places. Under such conditions it is impossible for Australia  to  do business to any extent with the East. Many factors contribute to cause high freights, and, possibly, not the least is the hig'h port charges. It may surprise honorable members, as it certainly surprised  mV  to learn recently, that, if a ship of 9,000 tons net spends three, days at each of the principal Australian ports - Fremantle, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane - it pays something over £2,000 in port dues. These charges must have a very considerable  effect on freights. High freights have had a great deal to do with the enormous difficulties of the fruit industry, in which a large proportion of our returned soldiers are engaged. The Treasurer's statement made some little time ago iu regard to the large losses on the Fruit Pools was sad reading, but we have to realize from that statement that, even had nothing whatever been paid for the fruit, there still would have been a great loss. This proves that any spoon-feeding has really been given to the secondary end of the industry, and not to the grower. Had the grower provided the fruit to the canning factories for nothing, the whole of the price obtained would still have been insufficient to meet the demands of this secondary end. There is an urgent ne-d for new markets, and the scheme for subsidizing ships seems to open up prospects in that direction. In China and India there are immense populations. It has been said that the people of China are too poor to purchase Australian fruit; but the population there is given as between 400,000,000 and 600.000.000, or something like thirty-four people to the square mile; and, even assuming tha\ only 5 per cent, of this population are sufficiently well-to-do to purchase our products, there is still an immense market. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> Louey Pang, in an address he gave recently on the prospects of an Australian fruit trade in China, said that the Chinese have not yet learnt the art of fruit cultivation, and that Australian apples and oranges bring high prices there. He also said that Hong Kong alone, in 1921-22, imported 1,000 tons of sultanas, and China, as a whole, imported £1 000,000 worth of fresh fruit, of which Australia supplied only £3,000 worth. These figures show the- immense possibilities ahead of this proposed shipping subsidy for the East. It appears that Canada and the Argentine are already subsidizing steamers which go to those markets, so that Australia only proposes to do what is already being done in other parts of the world. An effort will, no doubt, be made to place before the Ministry a schedule of rates at which Australia could hope to successfully do business with the East. To my mind, it is of no use to subsidize services to the East - to send boats, even with the greatest regularity - if the question of freights is not first settled. In calling for tenders fer such services, freights must be predetermined, and the subsidies based on  them. This would make it possible to do business on a successful basis with the East. While such services will, no doubt, occasion loss for the first year or two, regular dependable arrivals of Australian produce, carried in refrigerated space, will gradually build up a regular demand. That this view is shared by prominent exporters is proved by the fact that recently seven or eight exporting firms in this city have appointed a joint agent, at a large salary, to endeavour to open up markets there. This shows that these reputable exporting firms have great faith in the future Eastern trade. </para>
                    <para>It is pleasing to learn that the Government propose to put the Commonwealth Line of Shipping under a non-political Board, that annual balance-sheets are to be placed before. Parliament, and that the value of those ships is to be written down to something like present-day levels. It is difficult to realize what it means to attempt to make a profit on ships which cost in the vicinity of £100 a ton. The <inline font-style="italic">Moreton Bay,</inline> the fine model of which honorable members have seen in the Queen's Hall, cost the Government something like £1,250,000, or £100 a ton. These figures, of themselves, do not, perhaps, convey much, but when we know that that one ship represents, in interest alone at 5 per cent., over £62,000 per annum, or practically £200 a day, wo. realize the stupendous cost. The only possible way in which we can hope to show even a bookkeeping profit is by writing down the value of these ships. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to briefly call attention to the position that obtains in the coal-mining industry. This is a matter that affects the whole of Australia, and if something is not done quickly the consequences may he serious. A dispute has been in existence in the coal-mining industry in New South Wales for six or seven weeks. I have placed the matter before the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> both by letter and by deputation, and endeavoured to prevail upon him to intervene in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth. He promised that he would give consideration to our request; but, up to the present, no action has been taken by- the Government. It is to the credit of the leaders of the men that, so far, they have confined the dispute to a certain area; but I do not know how long they will be able to control the position if some action is not taken to put in motion the machinery set up by this Parliament. The Commonwealth Parliament passed legislation for the settlement of industrial disputes, in which special recognition was given- to the peculiar circumstances of the coal-mining industry. I read in a recent article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> a statement that the miners are making certain demands. They are not making any demands; they are virtually locked out. I have no wish to hide the facts, and I shall briefly state the reasons that led up to the dispute. For some time prior to this question arising, there had been a good deal of feeling against the police magistrate in the district concerned. The shire council had lodged a prosecution against a man for allowing his cattle to stray in the streets of Cessnock. In consequence of a death in the family of the person accused, he was unable to attend the Court, and the prosecuting officer asked the magistrate to ad-  Burn the case. Despite the extraordinary circumstances which were responsible for the accused's . absence, the magistrate refused to adjourn the case, and fined the man in his absence. That action incensed the miners; and when he presided at the Police Court, they refused . to go to work. I do not contend for a moment that they did the right thing. I admit that they acted wrongly. Their proper course was to place their objections before the Justice Department of New South "Wales. But after having made the initial mistake they presented themselves for work, and the proprietors refused to permit them to go into the mines. As the miners are working under a Commonwealth award it is idle to say that the dispute is purely local, that it does not extend beyond the boundaries of one State, and that consequently the Commonwealth authority has no power to intervene. Although the men did wrong in the first instance, that is not sufficient justification for the refusal of the proprietors to allow them to work now and for the withholding of supplies of coal from the community. There has been a good ' deal of complaint by the proprietors about an undue number- of stoppages in the mines. The miners are endeavouring to discipline their forces, and have decided that in future any member of their organization who stops work without following the constitutional procedure shall be fined for a first offence, and for a second offence shall be expelled from the association. A union could not take any stronger disciplinary measures. But the proprietors say that, unless the men comply with the conditions which they have laid down, the mines shall not be worked. One of those conditions is that the proprietors shall have the right to victimize about eighty men whom they regard as extremists. No union of any standing will allow its members to be victimized in that way, and this Parliament should not permit its legislation to be flouted by the proprietors for purposes of victimization. The duty of the proprietors is to allow the miners to return to work under the award of the Tribunal created by this Parliament, and if they desire to propose any new conditions they should submit them to the Tribunal for consideration. They are no more justified in locking out the employees than the employees were in stopping work in the first instance. Two w 1'0nga do not make a right. The miners stopped work on one day and then presented themselves at the mines, and there is no reason why this country  should suffer a shortage of coal simply in order that the proprietors may impose upon the men certain conditions. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but since then the union has taken the action I have already mentioned to discipline its * forces. Further than that no union could go. In regard to the charge of attempted victimization, honorable members may jump to the conclusion that there are in the union some  80  or  100  men who are such extremists that they wish to hold up the whole machinery. That is not the case. The trouble is that there are some men of ability who are prepared, from time to time, to exercise their talents on behalf of their fellowmen. Men of that class are not wanted by the employers, but I say that it is in the interests of the country that men of ability should have some scope to apply themselves to the betterment of the condition of their fellow-men. . The fact that some men do that does  not justify the  proprietors  in.  locking out their employees. I venture  to  say that if the honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> were still Prime Minister, he, having a thorough knowledge of industrial conditions, would have settled the dispute three or four weeks ago. It is the duty of the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> to intervene and instruct the  chairman  of the Tribunal to take action. "Whilst I admit that the men should not have stopped work, I must also remind the House that it has been customary in the mining industry to allow men to resume their employment if they were not away for two days. The present dispute is nothing more  or  less than a lock-out. The employers have seized the chance which the men gave them, and the whole country is suffering in consequence. It is the duty of the Prime Minister to consider the welfare of the general public. The dispute can be settled very easily if the Government take the right steps now ; inaction by the Commonwealth Government will be an invitation to the men engaged in the industry to extend the trouble  throughout the Commonwealth, rather than continue paying 15 per cent, of their wages to the men out on strike. If the trouble does extend industry will be held up everywhere, and the industrial life of the com.munity will be paralyzed. I call upon the Prime Minister to see that the legislation enacted by this Parliament is put into operation ; the proprietors should be told that if the men are prepared to work under' the award of the Tribunal the mines should be thrown open to them. </para>

The cause was similar to that in the present dispute; the proprietors wished to victimize about ten engine-drivers, and to that end held up the whole industry. Judge Scholes said to me, " Charlton, you will never get this trouble settled." I replied that I would; and I persevered until it was settled. The proprietors are now keeping the men locked out in order to enforce upon them new conditions, which properly should be referred to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Tribunal after work has been resumed.

                    <para>.- I support the claim that has been made by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton).</inline> When the Industrial Disputes Act was passed, the coal-mining industry was treated as a special industry, and in addition to provision for a general tribunal there was provision for the appointment of subsidiary courts or boards to deal with disputes local in character. Now we are told that -:hf Federal authority cannot intervene in this crisis because the actual dispute has not extended beyond the borders of one State. The dispute is affecting all the States. When a shortage of coal occurs through the stoppage of a big coal-field like Maitland, ' every industry and every private consumer in several of the States is affected. The coal proprietors have an Inter-State federation , and so have the coal-miners, and it is idle to say that the dispute is not Inter-State simply because the stoppage of work has occurred in only one State. It is Federal in essence and in fact, and the Prime Minister would be well advised to take the matter in hand. I believe that a settlement could be effected if he would do so. The parties met in conference after the stoppage, and threshed out the whole question until they came' to this stumbling block, the matter of the victimization of certain men. I have been reared in the coalmining industry, and I want to say that. although the members of a coal-miners' union might give way in regard to wages and other conditions, they would never submit to the victimization of the men who speak in their interests from time to time.I believe that if a tribunal were set to work in connexion with this industry, to deal with what the Conference has failed to agree upon, a solution would be arrived at. I hope the Prime Minister will realize this, because if there is any extension of the trouble I am afraid it will become the most bitter fight that  has  ever occurred in Australia. I appeal to the honorable gentleman to try to restore harmony to the most important industry of the continent. </para>

                    <para>.- I take the earliest opportunity of entering an emphatic protest against one section of this House being allowed the privilege of having the  chairman  of the Tariff Board at its Caucus for a conference in regard to Tariff matters. I was astounded when I read in the newspapers that this had occurred. When we realize that five Ministers and one Government Whip are members of the section of the House in question, it is quite apparent that a certain amount of influence must have been used to secure the attendance of a gentleman who is supposed to occupy a position in which he should exercise an absolutely independent judgment, and should not be interfered with in any way. What discussions took place I do not know, but when this fact is made known to the public, they will surely wonder that this Parliament should permit such a thing. I do not desire to impugn the integrity or the honesty of the  chairman  of the Tariff Board. I think that he is one of the most honest men we could have for the position. I claim, however, that when a section of the House which has a share in the so-called composite Ministry asks this officer to attend its Caucus meeting either to divulge information, or to be influenced in a certain direction, it. is unjustifiable conduct. The Government cannot exonerate themselves, because half of the Ministry were present at that particular Caucus meeting. If this practice continues the public will begin to lose confidence in the administration of a most important Board appointed to adjudicate, and hold the scales evenly be tween various sections of the community. On the precedent which has been established, members of the Labour party would be perfectly justified in asking the  chairman  of the Tariff Board, or even the whole of the Tariff Board, to come to their Caucus. Had the Labour party done what has just been done, there would have been a howl of indignation throughout the country. What has the government of the country come to when we find a most important officer being summoned to a Caucus meeting by a section of Parliament ? </para>

                    <para>. -  I listened very carefully to what the Leader of the Opposition said with regard to the coal situation. The honorable member has written to me with regard to it, and he also saw me on a deputation when I passed through Newcastle, about ten days ago. It is very desirable that the Government should not appear to be partisans in a dispute which is taking place in the coal-fields near Maitland. The Leader of the Opposition has shown very clearly where he stands, but the Government do not stand for one party or the other in the dispute. It is merely their task to see that the law is carried out, and, where it can beneficially do so, take any action to try to settle any disputes that may occur in the industrial sphere of Australia. However, the facts should be put clearly, and I do not think the honorable member has done that. He has led the House to believe that some action has been taken in the Maitland district which should in the natural course result in the Tribunal, which has been established to deal with the coal industry, being invoked to try to settle a dispute or take some step in regard to it. </para>

                        <para>- I think my friend will admit that I am stating the case perfectly fairly. I want to tell the House how the dispute arose, and what the present position is. I do not want it to be suggested that the Government have any leaning to one side or the other. It is no part of a Government's function to concern itself in industrial disputes. It is a matter for the industry itself, and it is not the function of a Government to take sides in any dispute. The present Ministry have no intention of doing anything of that sort. The question is whether it is desirable that a Government should take action and intervene in the present dispute. I am not conveying the suggestion that we should not intervene on the ground that the dispute has not extended beyond one State. That is a reason that might be advanced, but I am not advancing it. As the honorable member has pointed out, the coal-mining industry works under a Tribunal appointed under an Act passed by the Federal Parliament, but we consider that there has been rather too much interference by Governments in industrial matters. </para>

                        <para>- When industrial disputes are in progress, instead of allowing the ordinary Tribunals to follow their proper course, there has been a tendency to demand that the Government should intervene.I quite realize that on many occasions during the war certain action was from time to time taken which was absolutely necessary, and, indeed, imperative, for the safety of Australia; but we shall not get this country running on the best basis if, although we have proper machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes, as soon as a certain point is reached in any dispute there is to be a clamour for the Government to step in and settle it in a way which, as we have seen, is generally on a thoroughly unsound and uneconomic basis. The position in regard to the coalmining industry at the present time is very serious, not only for the district in which the mines are situated, but also for the State of New South Wales and for Australia as a whole, and the Government are watching that position very closely. If it is necessary for them to take action, we shall take whatever step is required, but we must be convinced before we act that we can do something for the benefit of the Commonwealth. </para>

I do not want to argue the question from a partisan standpoint, otherwise I would have to read the findings of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibble</inline> in regard to the perpetual stoppages in this particular industry. All I wish to say is that the Government in this, as in every other industrial matter, are quite impartial, and stand neither for one side nor the other. We must allow the methods employed for the settlement of industrial questions in this country to take their ordinary course, because Government interference in such cases very often leads to the most disastrous results. </para>

All that has happened is that the  chairman  of the Tariff Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Oakley,</inline> was asked by the Minister for Trade and Customs to see the Treasurer with re gard to certain matters. Those matters were discussed between the Treasurer and the chairman of the Tariff Board, but whether any other members intervened or not I do not know. I can only say to my friends opposite, as the Minister for Trade and Customs has already said, that if any honorable gentleman is desirous of obtaining information, and it is possible for us to place at his disposal an officer who can help him, we shall be only too pleased to do it. It is regrettable that an attitude should be adopted which suggests that the Tariff Board has become an object of suspicion. The Board is doing valuable work for Australia, and attempts ought not to be made to stultify its efforts by such suggestions as have been made. </para>
