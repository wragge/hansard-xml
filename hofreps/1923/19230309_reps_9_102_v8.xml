The position is that the State Attorneys-General have met, and, I understand, have some proposals to submit to the Commonwealth Government for consideration.

                        <para>- I wish to direct a question, without notice, to the Prime Minister. By way of explanation, I may remind him that under the agreement made between Amalgamated Wireless Limited and the Commonwealth, the time allowed for the erection of high-power reciprocal stations in England and America expired some time ago. An extension of six months was given, and that period has also nearly expired. I ask whether an application has been made for a still further extension of time, and whether it is the intention of the Government to give a further extension. I may be permitted, as a kind of consequential question, to ask whether, in view of the proposed erection in England by the Imperial Government of a station sufficient to serve Australia, the Government will reconsider the agreement with Amalgamated Wireless Limited, and will take advantage of that station instead of erecting a new one? </para>

                            <para>- With respect to the first part of the honorable member's question, I have to say that no specific application has been made for an extension of the time within which the company is required to fulfil its ' obligation to erect reciprocal stations in Great Britain and Canada. In the event of such an application being made, the Government will probably consider it very favorably, and will advise their representatives to agree to the request. On the question of the position of the reciprocal stations, it is obvious that the situation has been profoundly modified by the very welcome announcement made a few days ago on behalf of the British Government, that they intend to erect a station themselves, and further propose to grant facilities, under control, for private enterprise to erect stations. That will probably greatly assist us in the task with which we are faced. At present the Government and their representatives on the Board of Amalgamated Wireless Limited are considering what action should be taken in view of the developments that have occurred. In reply to the third part of the honorable member's question, with regard to the station here, notwithstanding what has happened in Great Britain, the Government have no intention of departing from their proposal to erect a wireless station in Australia. </para>

In view of the proposed erection by the Imperial Government of a high-power station in Great Britain, designed to serve Australia, among other places, will the Government reconsider the proposal to build an independent station at the expense of the Australian Commonwealth, thus avoiding duplication and competition between two stations? </para>

                            <para>- I think there is a misapprehension in the honorable member's mind. It was never contemplated that the reciprocal stations, either in Great Britain or in Canada, should be built at the expense of the Australian taxpayers. Concerning the British station, I said that the whole position is fortunately modified by the intention of the British Government to erect a long-distance wireless station, but we shall have to ascertain if, while catering for the other Dominions, it will be able to give us the traffic facilities we may require. </para>

                                <para>- That is not the position at all. No company is shut out, either by the time limit or the conditions of tender. I understand that some complaints have been made, but that no representation has been addressed to the company on the matter. If any company that desires to tender for the services' we require feels that the time allowed is too short, or that the specifications contain conditions that cannot reasonably be complied with, the obvious and proper course is to make representations to that effect. I can give the honorable gentleman an assurance that the fullest consideration will he given to any representations of that character. I want to emphasize this point, because I understand there has bee;1 some sort of political agitation in connexion with the matter. </para>

Their anxiety would doubtless be increased by the statement made last night by the Treasurer that it is the intention of the Government to borrow over £100,000,000. I ask the Treasurer whether Parliament will be given an opportunity to deal with the question of war loan obligations, which is one of the most serious problems we are called upon to face. </para>

                        <para>- The question of appointing a High Commissioner for the United States of America is obviously one that would have to be considered by the Government as part of its policy. As t« the second point, I am afraid I cannot give the honorable gentleman the assurance he asks for. If it is deemed necessary to appoint a High Commissioner, it is probable that the Government will have to take prompt action, and if anything were done, the Government would, of course, be responsible to Parliament. </para>

                        questions evidently refer to the Corps of Armament Artificers. At the request of the members of this corps that they should receive the rates in force for their trades ,in outside -establishments, those rates were taken as a guide in fixing their pay, as from 1st July, 1921. This meant at that time, and until recently, a substantial increase in pay, but recent awards have reduced the outside trade rates, and the rates for armament artificers have been reduced accordingly, but not 'below the trade rates.

Materials so admitted arc then in the same position as if they were specifically mentioned in item 404, and are therefore "elsewhere included " in the Tariff.

                            <para>Yes. Efforts involving a considerable expense have been made to extract elemental sulphur from pyrites, but have not been a commercial success. Pyrites have, however, been used for many years in the production of sulphur as an intermediate step in the process of manufacturing sulphuric acid. These efforts have not been abandoned, but are being very extensively increased. The c.i.f. and e. prices of imported sulphur and Australian pyrites are respectively £4 7s. 6d. and £2 5s. per ton. . The latter price equals £5 per ton on sulphur content, and is considerably less than the price of sulphur plus duty. </para>

                        <para>Tariff Board Report</para>
                <para>The Tariff -Board has very carefully considered the question whether the duty on sulphur should be further deferred after 31st instant. All the papers on the subject have been carefully perused, and representatives of the mining and superphosphate interests have been consulted. </para>
                <list type="decimal-dotted">
                    <item label="2.">
                        <para>It is clear from the statements made by a deputation that waited on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Massy</inline> Greene in November last that the manufacturers of superphosphate had then arrived at a definite agreement with the producers of pyrites, and assured the Minister that if he would postpone the duty until 31st March, 1922, they would then be in a position to use the locally produced sulphuric acid. As far as the Board can ascertain practically no effort has been made by the two superphosphate manufacturers - who gave such assurance - to prepare for the roasting of the necessary concentrates to obtain the sulphuric acid required. </para>
                    </item>
                    <item label="3.">
                        <para>There can be no question that there are many years' supply of the necessary pyrites already available in Australia, and it seems most desirable that in every possible way the use of such material should be encouraged. </para>
                    </item>
                    <item label="4.">
                        <para>The Board has ascertained that the price ruling for imported sulphur is at present £4 15s. per ton, whilst the local pyrites can be supplied at an equivalent of £5 10s. per ton. </para>
                    </item>
                    <item label="5.">
                        <para>It must be remembered that the price of. sulphur in war time went up to £14 per ton, and until last year was still in the region of £8 to £9 per ton. Evidently owing to the proposal of the Government to place a duty on sulphur the price has decreased very rapidly, and enormous supplies have been obtained by the companies. Representatives of two companies examined by the Board estimated their present stock is available to meet all their requirements for the next nine months. </para>
                    </item>
                    <item label="6.">
                        <para>When it is remembered that the Superphosphate Companies undertook about five months ago to be ready at the end of this month to use the new system of roasting, it will be seen that the companies can readily get into a position of manufacturing from' local material long before their present supplies of sulphur are exhausted. </para>
                    </item>
                    <item label="7.">
                        <para>The mining companies interested have given the Board a definite undertaking that they will not take full advantage of the duty of £2 10s., nor will they increase their price over the present amount unless contingencies arise such as increased wages or more stringent conditions are imposed. </para>
                    </item>
                    <item label="8.">
                        <para>As far as the mining companies can see there is rather a tendency to reduce than increase, as the wages and other conditions are likely to become easier. It has been made clear to the Board that the imposition of the duty will not result in the increase in the price of superphosphate to the farmer. </para>
                    </item>
                    <item label="9.">
                        <para>It must be remembered that 1 ton of sulphur will make 10 tons of superphosphate, so that the duty would amount to about 5s. per ton. As the company is only taking advantage of a little more than one-half of the duty it is evident that in the coming regulation of prices there must be a reduction in the price of superphosphate to the farmer. </para>
                    </item>
                    <item label="10.">
                        <para>The supplies of superphosphate up to the present are being manufactured from sulphur costing between £8 and £9 per ton, so that so far as sulphur is concerned, at the next fixing of prices of superphosphate, both the cost, of sulphur and wages have been reduced, and that reflection should show in the price to be fixed for superphosphate. </para>
                    </item>
                    <item label="11.">
                        <para>There can be no question that the imposition of this duty will be of immense importance to the mining industry, and should provide work to a great number of men as well as transport service for our idle ships, and the Board has no hesitation in recommending that the duty should be imposed as from 31st March, 1922. </para>

This information was-  placed at the disposal of the Committee with the greatest freedom and candour.

                <para>As representatives of the primary producers, we beg to submit a minority report, placing on record our opposition to a further impost on one of Australia's greatest industries - wheat growing - land upon those rural industries in which superphosphate is used, over 400,000 tons being used annually in Australia. </para>
                <para>To-day superphosphate of the same analysis is sold in South Australia at £5 10s. per ton (lists enclosed). At the meeting to-day the calculations were based on the Victorian price of £6 3s. per ton. One South Australian firm advises that the duty on sulphur would mean 7s. per ton increase, not 5s. </para>
                <para>We consider it no part of the farming community's duty to hear the whole burden of establishing the industry of sulphur production. Such cost should be borne by the whole community. </para>

                </para>
                <para>The following notes further explain the position in the various States: - </para>
                <para>Victoria. - All the sulphuric acid required in Victoria for the manufacture of superphosphates can be supplied from the large supplies of pyrites available in Tasmania. </para>
                <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> Company is arranging to use only pyrites immediately its supply of sulphur is exhausted. The firm of Cuming, Smith and Company were making arrangements to use pyrites from Tasmania. The firm has half, of its burners in position, but action has been taken to buy further sulphur, and the erection of the remaining half of the burners is not being proceeded with at present. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cuming</inline> has, however, notified the Board that as soon as his present supply of sulphur is sufficiently reduced he will operate one-half of his burners on Tasmanian pyrites, and should he ascertain that they are cheaper to use than sulphur obtained overseas, plus the duty, he will continue to use pyrites. </para>
                <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> Mining Company is willing to supply all manufacturers of superphosphates in Victoria with Tasmanian pyrites at the same price as that charged to the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> Superphosphate Company. </para>
                <para>The price of sulphur, however, has been further reduced in the United States, and the Board is cabling to America to ascertain whether the price charged to Australia agrees with the price for domestic use in the United States. </para>
                <para>It will be noticed that an amount of 1,200 tons of sulphuric acid has been deducted from the Victorian total available. The sulphur representing this quantity is required by the Explosives Company, who can use only sulphur in the manufacture of explosives, but all the other companies in Victoria can obtain pyrites from Tasmania if so desired. </para>
                <para>New South Wales. - There are only two companies in New South Wales manufacturing superphosphates. The Australian Fertilizers Company at Port Kembla have been using New Guinea pyrites. Recently they have ordered 1,200 tons of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> pyrites from Tasmania, and_ should this trial prove successful, these pyrites will be used in future. </para>
                <para>The Sulphide Corporation at Cockle Creek is making arrangements to use only locally-made raw material, mostly zinc concentrates, and will not import sulphur. This corporation is installing a costly contact plant at Cockle Creek, which will manufacture high grade pure sulphuric acid, which  Should  meet practically all the requirements of the industries in New South Wales now  using  sulphur. </para>
                <para>South Australia. - The largest works in this State are the Wallaroo and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> Fertilizers Limited - at Wallaroo and Port Adelaide. This company manufactures almost half of the output of the State, and supplies its own sulphuric acid from Australian  raw  material. The Electrolytic Zinc Company  is  installing at Port Pirie  a  plant to make sulphuric acid to cost about £80,000. The company has entered into an agreement with the Adelaide Chemical Works to supply the latter with all the sulphuric acid they need,  at  the same cost as the acid is supplied to the other company. A similar offer has been made  to  the Cresco Fertilizers Limited, and  negotiations  are proceeding, but the Cresco Company appears  to  be keeping the matter open in  the  hope that some relief may be obtained in  the  remission  of  the duty when the foreign  raw  material will  be  continued.  lt is understood that half of the sulphuric acid required for South Australia is being supplied, and the whole of the requirements will be available in eleven months from 1st October, 1922. </para>
                <para>Western Australia. - This is the only State where, under present conditions, the whole of the local supplies of raw material are not available. About 35 per cent, of their sulphur requirements is being obtained by one of the manufacturers from pyrites mined in Western Australia, and experts believe that there are sufficient pyrites available in the State to meet all the requirements, but their use is precluded owing to transport charges. </para>
                <para>The only solution advanced to the Board has been to grant the manufacturers of superphosphates in Western Australia the use of sulphur free of duty. The Board considers this would be an unconstitutional proceeding, and, in addition, it believes the most satisfactory method of meeting the position would 'be by taking action to assist the manufacturers in obtaining their pyrites within the State. This could be done by the State Government granting as reasonable railway rates as possible on pyrites, and, if necessary, the Commonwealth Government could assist by granting a bounty to enable the manufacturers to meet the extra cost through railway and other charges. The manufacturers concerned have expressed their willingness to take early action to obtain local pyrites if possible, provided some relief in transport charges is granted.  While  in Western Australia, the Board will discuss this matter with the Premier, in the hope of arriving at a satisfactory solution. In Queensland and Tasmania, no superphosphates are manufactured. Queensland draws her supplies from New South Wales, and Tasmania from Victoria. </para>
                <para>From the foregoing explanation, it will be seen that practically 71 per cent, of the total requirements of sulphur is available from locally produced materials, and when the present plants now being erected are completed, and the arrangements suggested by the Board in Western Australia are made, the whole of the sulphur requirements for the manufacture of superphosphates will be produced in Australia, and. further, the Board desires to emphasize that all supplies at present available are offered at uniform prices to all companies. </para>
                <para>Price of Imported Sulphur and Local Sulphuric Acid. - It is understood by the Board that the price of sulphur before the war was £4 7s. 6d. per ton. It is, however, now being quoted to Australian buyers at £4 4s. per ton from the United States, although other countries have been charging much more. Adding £2 10s. duty to the price stated, and the total is £6 14s. per ton. The Mount Lyell Company has offered the Victorian companies pyrites at a price the company states is equal to £5 17s. 6d. per ton of sulphur. The companies in New South Wales (with one exception), and South Australia (with one exception) are to be fully supplied by locally-produced sulphuric _ acid. Pyrites from Tasmania will not be supplied to those States except to one company in New </para>
                <para class="block">South Wales, which will receive the same offer as the Victorian companies. The one exception in South Australia is now considering an offer from the Electrolytic Zinc Company to supply sulphuric acid at the same price as that supplied to the other companies in South Australia. The actual price arranged in South Australia for the sale of locally produced sulphuric acid is the equivalent of £6 per ton of sulphur, and as the companies have already made the agreements, it is concluded these must have been on a satisfactory basis, as no complaints of any kind have been made. The price of £6 is an estimate, and the Zinc Company has undertaken, wherever possible, to reduce costs, in which event any saving will be passed on to the manufacturer of superphosphates. </para>
                <para>Price of Superphosphates. - Last year's price for superphosphates was: - Victoria, £6 3s. per ton; South Australia, £5 10s. per ton. From the 1st July last the price has been reduced to: - Victoria, £5 10s. per ton; .South Australia, £4 6s. per ton. </para>
                <para>The Victorian manufacturers have yet to fix their price for the coming season, and the Board believes that a further decrease of 5s. per ton will be considered. The prices would then be - Victorian, £5 5s. per ton; South Australian, £4 6s. per ton. </para>
                <para>It is very satisfactory to note that notwithstanding the imposition of the duty on sulphur, substantial reductions have been made in the price of superphosphates for the coming season, thus disproving the contentions of the opponents of the duty that it would increase the price. </para>
                <para>The Board is waiting to hear the price fixed by the Victorian manufacturers for the coming season, and unless a further satisfactory decrease is made on the £5 10s. per ton, the Board will certainly recommend to the Government that investigation be made under the Tariff Board Act to ascertain whether the manufacturers are not charging an unnecessarily high price for their goods. </para>
                <para>Recommendation. - In regard to the supply of sulphur for the manufacture of superphosphates in Western Australia, the Board recommends that inquiries be made to ascertain whether the difficulty in the supply of pyrites from the local mines in Western Australia could not be overcome. </para>
                <para>The Board believes that the present supply can be further developed, provided the State and Federal Governments assist in the development of the supply of pyrites by granting assistance in freight. This will prove of greater national advantage in developing local industries, and avoid the spending of money on foreign sulphur, thus making Australia independent of outside supplies. </para>
                <para>With the concurrence of the Minister, the Board will negotiate on this matter with the Government of Western Australia during its proposed visit to that State. </para>

                <para>Tariff Board's Recommendation. - The Bylaw will permit the admission of sulphur to be given under item 404 for the manufacture of superphosphate in those cases where satisfactory evidence is furnished that locally produced sulphuric acid is not obtainable, each application to be decided individually on its merits. </para>
                <para>The result will be to relieve the users of superphosphate of any unnecessary extra charge arising from the duty on sulphur, especially in those States where the local manufacturers are not yet in a position to supply sulphuric acid. The latter companies recognise the necessity of making a concession to meet the special position. </para>
                <para>The Tariff Board recommends that a By-law in the above terms be approved. </para>

                <para>The present position in regard to the production of sulphuric acid in Australia for the manufacture of superphosphates is as follows: - </para>
                <para>New South Wales. - One company is exclusively burning pyrites from the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> mine in Tasmania. This practice will be continued under any circumstances as the residue of the burnt pyrites is required by the adjoining related company for use as a flux in the smelting of copper. </para>
                <para>A second company is erecting a contact add plant at Cockle Creek to manufacture sulphuric acid from zinc ore concentrates from Broken Hill. This' company will also supply pure sulphuric acid to users for other purposes than the manufacture of superphosphates. </para>
                <para>Victoria. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lyell</inline> Company is burning pyrites from Tasmania to obtain sulphuric acid. Cuming Smith and Company are at present using sulphur, but are almost immediately utilizing eight burners for burning pyrites from Tasmania. On the result of this trial will depend whether pyrites only shall be used. </para>
                <para>It is understood the other companies have not yet utilized pyrites, but are continuing the use of sulphur. </para>
                <para>South Australia. - The three companies in South Australia have definitely entered into agreements covering a number of years with the Electrolytic Zinc Company for the latter company to supply sulphuric acid obtained from ore concentrates from Broken Hill mines. The supply of this sulphuric acid will not be available until October or November next except for one company. In the meantime approval has been given for the two other companies to obtain any sulphur required free (British Preferential Tariff) or 10 per cent. (General Tariff), to enable them to continue manufacturing. </para>
                <para>West Australia. - Although the Tariff Board has made every effort to obtain a local supply of sulphuric acid from pyrites for the two companies in West Australia, their efforts have failed. Approval has been given for these companies to obtain their sulphur free (British Preferential Tariff) or 10 per cent. (General Tariff) for the present, and until some other development takes place- This arrangement results in a refund to the farmers of about 4s. for the past year. </para>

                                <para>- I do not intend to touch upon the merits of the case. This Committee is a very useful and valuable body if its reports and recommendations are accepted and put into effect. If its work is to be ignored, however, the appointment of a fresh Committee becomes more or less farcical. As for the specific matter which I have just indicated, after the Works Committee had given its verdict, a secret Commission was appointed. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Sheldon was given the task of making a fresh and secret investigation. </para>

I can only draw my own conclusions. I want to learn something definite before the House rises. The whole business has been hanging about too long. Nearly £80,000 is involved, and, although that is much less than the amount which the Government should have been awarded, Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh should be compelled to pay. Parliament is entitled to know what the Government have done, or propose to do. </para>

The firm raised certain legal objections, and asked the Government if they would consent to the reference of the award back to the Arbitrator. The Government refused, and insisted upon standing by the specific terms of the award. They had made a demand for the payment of the sum involved. That is precisely how and where the matter stands to-day. </para>

                                    Sheldon made known his award to the Government at least ten months ago. He showed that this shipbuilding firm had  absolutely robbed the Australian people of thousands of pounds, and that it was building ships which, if they were manned and put to sea, would imperil the lives of Australian seamen. Yet the Government now say that all they have done has been to demand payment of the amount specified. Why should there have been months of delay? Is the whole unsatisfactory situation due to the fact that the members of the firm are friends and supporters of the Government and of the Anti-Labour party? Is that the reason why they have not been promptly called upon to make good?

But the affair which has been alluded to constitutes a grave scandal, and should be very strictly handled by the Government. During the last Parliament the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> bitterly attacked the Government, and accused them of being  a  blundering business Administration. The critic is now at the head of the Treasury himself. How many more weeks does he intend to add to the ten months' delay since the award of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Sheldon was announced? Does he propose to consent to further indefinite postponements of settlement? </para>

                    <para>.- "Some of the older- members of this House are anxious to know what powers are possessed by the members of this Committee, who runs the Committee, and whether its members are answerable for the supposed acts of the Committee. Last session we had to perform the disagreeable task of passing what some people might regard as very rude remarks in reference to the acts of this Committee. Many members found it hard to believe that there could be returned to Parliament such an autocrat as was one of the gentlemen who sat on the Committee. Certain  members  of the Committee claimed the right to call a meeting and decide what should be -done. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> will have a place on this Committee, and I want yon to see that it is not run by one individual - who, it appears, lost his head when he was given a place on the Committee. It is a funny thing that some persons, when they obtain authority, think they are going to rule the universe. T. hope that these remarks of mine will have the effect of altering that state of affairs. If it is not altered we shall have the time of- this Chamber occupied at some future date in calling atention to the matter - and you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> will be one of the culprits unless you carry out the will of this House. I have no desire that that should take place. I hope that you will assist the members of this House' to see that- the work done is sanctioned by the Committee, and not by any particular -individual who for the time being considers himself to be the monarch of all he surveys. </para>

                        <para>- I have nothing to say regarding the merits or demerits of his offence. It is not creditable that men who receive the emoluments we receive should pay such a miserable salary to men employed in this establishment. In some cases the employees here do not come within the scope of the Arbitration Court or of Wages Board awards. These matters do not come to the knowledge of honorable members. The  Speaker  or the  President  takes it upon himself to dismiss one individual, promote another, reduce this one and advance that <inline font-style="italic">one.</inline> Not until afterwards do the members who form the Committee find that these discreditable things have been done behind their backs. No man can occupy a position on this Committee without a clear understanding that he will not be merely one of a number of marionettes sitting round u table, but will insist that nothing shall bc done behind his back. Honorable gentlemen on both sides of the House ought to make sure that nothing is done by the gentlemen in charge without their knowledge. And they ought to see that no man employed in Parliament receives less than he would receive outside. While we members of Parliament set an excellent example in regard to our own salaries, we ought also to set a not less good example in regard to the poorest men who work in this establishment. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise to amplify and support the remarks of the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey).</inline> I was a member of the House Committee at one period when the question of waiters' salaries came before us. We raised them by 2s. 6d. I was told that we had been misinformed ; that the men were not being paid as much as they would receive outside. Another meeting was called, and we did the right thing. We raised their salaries a little beyond that fixed by the " dagoes " in Bourke-street. I was well satisfied at the time, but a week or more elapsed, and I found that one of the waiters had been discharged. In this way the money expended in bringing the salaries up to a level commensurate with the dignity of this institution was more than saved. I raised my objection to the man's dismissal, but the autocrat of the Committee would listen to no protest. He maintained that he had a right to dismiss the man, and he sidestepped me - 'I presume, knowing what his activities have been since - by telling me that the waiter was a temporary hand, and in ordinary circumstances would not have been there. I then put the question, "Why did you have him at all?" He replied to the effect that it was thought expedient at the time. In that way one man in the establishment was made to pay for the increases in wages received by all the others. I am not stating a fictitious case of what might happen on the House Committee, but I am informing the House of what actually did happen. I hope that every member of the Committee will insist upon being a live factor in its work, and will not leave his task to one or two others who happen to be in a position to act without the knowledge of the Committee. </para>

                    <para class="block">In accordance with the provisions of the Act I lay on the table plans of the proposed works. The proposal, as expressed in the sketch drawing submitted, is for a group of buildings of light brick and concrete construction in accordance with views elicited from the <inline font-weight="bold">President, Mr. Speaker,</inline> and officers of Parliament, in which the functions of legislation may be conducted until such time as it may become possible to proceed with the erection of the permanent construction of the whole building which was at one time contemplated. The buildings now projected thus conform to the advice tendered in its first general report by. the Federal Capital Advisory Committee. The site for which the buildings have been planned lies in front of that proposed in the approved city plan for the permanent Parliament buildings. On this site the provisional buildings will enjoy in considerable degree the same central relationship to the general development works of Canberra, as these progress, as the originally contemplated monumental Parliament House would have done. In this position also the provisional buildings, after their occupation by Parliament, might for a term of years be conveniently used as departmental offices. The buildings are designed on simple lines, but in order to meet the varied requirements of Parliament are necessarily somewhat extensive. To assist the Parliamentary Committee in its investigations, full information respecting the projected work will be furnished in evidence. The cost of the proposed works, which include all relative engineering services, but exclude furnishings and fittings, is estimated at £174,000. </para>

The group as planned will consist of twelve separate office buildings, and a refectory and recreation building of light timber-frame construction, also two buildings of brick construction to accommodate functions and records whose preservation from fire is important. The proposal is thus on lines recommended by the Federal Capital Advisory Committee in its first general report, that temporary buildings be provided to do duty until the time arrives when it may be expedient to erect . permanent structures. After service as offices, the proposed buildings may be eventually removed for use as schools, dwellings, stores, &amp;c. The Advisory Committee's report contemplated that by the time Parliament meets at Canberra, some 140,000 feet of floor space will be requisite for Departments. The proposal now submitted will contribute about 84,000 feet of that estimated space. Further office accommodation is intended to be provided as may be required in a similarly planned group of buildings in a correspondingly' relative position to the east of the site suggested for the provisional parliamentary buildings. Full particulars regarding the proposal will be detailed in evidence before the Parliamentary Committee. These office and other buildings, according to the sketch drawings now submitted, including relative engineering services,  are estimated to cost about £135,500. </para>

                    <para>.- I am delighted that at last some effort is being made to push forward the construction, of the Federal Capital at Canberra. I have not much confidence in the Advisory Committee, because I have never considered the members of it big enough for their' jobs. We were told that Parliament could not assemble at Canberra in less than four years. I direct the attention of honorable members to the time occupied in the erection of the Exhibition Building in Sydney in 1879, and the Exhibition Building in Melbourne in 1888. The former was completed, and occupied within nine months of the "footing" being laid. The construction of the Melbourne building occupied twelve months, the longer period being accounted for by the fact that the annexes were built in brick and cement. This building was supposed to be of , only a temporary character, but it has been erected for thirty-five years, and is still, giving great service to the community. The State Parliament meets in one wing, another is utilized for the purposes of an Aquarium, and other parts of the building are used in various ways for the benefit of the people of Melbourne. Knowing something about the erection of buildings, I believe that a parliamentary building at Canberra of the same size as the Melbourne Exhibition Building could be completed within two years. I repeat that the members of the Advisory Committee have never been big enough for their jobs. The foundations of the Federal Capital at Canberra were laid under the direction of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O'Malley,</inline> who was Minister for Works in a Labour Government, and he made all necessary provision for light, water, heat, and sewerage. Whenever a complaint was made in Parliament about the progress of work at Canberra, the Minister immediately sent a "chaser" among the depart-  mental officers, and in this way he speeded up the work. Since he left office there has been no earnest attempt on the part of those in charge of these works, either Ministers or officers, to hurry on the building of the Capital City. About £2,000,000 has been spent at Canberra, but the Commonwealth has value for the money; not a penny has been wasted. I hope that henceforth more energy will be infused into the creation of the Capital, so that at the earliest possible date Parliament may assemble there in circumstances that will be conducive to good legislation and administration in the interests of the Commonwealth. I feel strongly on this matter, irrespective of the fact that I am a New South Wales representative. The anxiety of the people in my State is not so much that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales as it is that the Commonwealth Parliament should be able to do work of a national character, which is not possible in the parochial atmosphere of Victoria. I have some knowledge of the opposition which the Minister has to meet in this matter. I know that the last Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Foster)</inline> met with" opposition from the Cabinet, but I hope that the present Minister will be big enough for his job, and not allow anything to interfere with the progress of this work, which is so essential in the interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to obtain from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> before the House adjourns, some information as to the actual position in connexion with the offers for the purchase of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, . Sydney. This morning, in reply to my question, which I think is of some importance to the people of Australia, he said it was not considered proper that the information should 'be made public. I should like to know if tenders for the purchase of the Dockyards were advertised publicly, or is this latest action of the Government merely another of those secret, behind-the-back movements for which the last Nationalist Government were so notorious. Here we have a Commonwealth activity, worth considerably over £2,000,000, and apparently it is to be disposed of privately. The people are to know nothing about the transaction. If it is the policy of the Government to sell these State activities, at least it should be done openly. Everything should be above-board. We want none of those secret aud keep-it-dark methods of the previous Government. If we are going to dispose of these Government, concerns our intention should be advertised to the world at large, and the highest tenderer should have the opportunity of purchasing. There should 'be no opportunity for friends of the Government and enemies of Labour to get in behind the back of Parliament, and secure these valuable business assets. I protest very strongly indeed against anything being done by the Government in this secret manner. Weil do we remember the present Minister for Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> and the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> assailing the last Government, of which the Prime Minister was Treasurer, for smothering up transactions, and keeping dark matters that should have had the light of day thrown upon them. Of course, we hear no words of indignation from them now, because they are responsible Ministers of the Crown. The people have a perfect right to know what the Government propose to do. We are all aware, of course, that the Government intend to get rid of these Commonwealth activities, but I object very strongly to the manner in which they propose to accomplish their end. I leave the matter now in the hope that the Prime Minister will take the people of the Commonwealth into his confidence. He cannot 'lightly pass over an important matter like this, and withhold information from the public. </para>

I have in my mind, particularly, the case of a lady, who now is in very poor health, and whose husband was deported, leaving her charged with the responsibility of supporting her little daughter. She is an. Australian, and she married this German in all good faith. It is now beyond her strength to support the child, and she is thrown on the world with no one to assist her.  Her  husband was  taken away from her without any explanation  as  to why he was to be deported - I presume, to Germany. </para>

                        <para>- Then the obligation on the Government to do something to relieve the position of these people is all the greater. Those for whom I am speaking had no hand in bringing about the war; indeed, I doubt whether this lady, even in the defence of her husband, ever acted or spoke in a way to call forth any charge of disloyalty. Today she is dependent upon charity, and she naturally comes to me  as  one of the representatives of the State in the Parliament which governs the lives of the citizens in matters Federal. Now that the war is over, and we have a " composite " Government, which is not bound to the fetishes the worship of which kept the previous Government in power - and the days of wild screaming hysteria, . are passed - I think it is time we displayed true British spirit and expressed our willingness to be friends with an opponent if he is prepared to be friends with us. A great proportion of the people affected are Australian - born, and certainly did nothing to injure the Commonwealth, and it is time that the Government should ask itself whether it is really " playing the game." I have been a commercial traveller in my time, and in that capacity visited the German towns and villages of South Australia, where I became acquainted  with many estimable gentlemen in. business there who were highly esteemed by the firm by which I was employed. These men displayed honour, integrity, and probity - all those qualities which, are regarded as the mainstay of the country's commercial life - and I have been asked by some of them to speak on their behalf in this Chamber. In one case I made an attempt to get an. accused man a trial, but was unsuccessful, and, as a matter of fact, in the majority of instances there was no legal procedure of the kind. One of the accused, as decent a little man as ever lived in Australia, had a trial, and he was sent to the Liverpool Camp, where he died during an epidemic. These residents are taxed in order that the laws under which they have been accused may be enforced, and, at the same time, they are exposed to venomous taunts . about having been "behind the wires." They desire an opportunity to prove to the world that they were detained, not for what they said or did, but, as in the case of the political offenders in England <inline font-style="italic">some</inline> sixty or seventy years ago who were sent for seven years to Tasmania, as an example and deterrent to others. I do not cavil at people being interned for the safety of the Commonwealth ; but I think the Government might, in the majority of cases, make a declaration that it was thought expedient at the time that these gentlemen should be arrested. Perhaps the Government thought that they might be imbued with the sentiment which actuated the poet when he said - </para>

                <para class="block">I suggest that the Government give favorable consideration to the position of these people and go through their records, sifting, out those cases in which the evidence was mere hearsay, or the result of scheming by persons who desired that certain people should be got out of the way. The honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> has told us of one German resident in South Australia, whom I know, who is prepared to give £400 to the War Memorial Fund of the town in which he resides, if he is" given such an opportunity as I suggest. This German is a prominent business man, and I know him and his family well. I regard him as a decent man in himself; whether he was carried away by sentiment regarding the country of his origin, I know not but, in any case, all he desires is to clear his character before his friends and his family, which is now in the second generation. The children of such, men are the future citizens of Australia, and it is only fair that any unjust stigma placed upon their parents in war-time should be removed." I take no side on the question whether the treatment of these people at the time was just or unjust; but I should be failing as a fair-minded Britisher, and as one who fought in the war, if I did not regard generously men who suggest that they have been penalized, and did not give them a " square " go. I hope the Government will take a " big " Australian view of this matter, and see that justice is done. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to take this opportunity of correcting a statement made last night by the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. C. Riley),</inline> who, in discussing the question of immigration, said that he had been informed that a number of boys brought to Australia under the Dreadnought scheme, who were employed on dairy farms on the north coast of New South Wales, were being sweated, as they were paid only 5s. per week. I know the honorable member was making the statement on information supplied ; but I wish to inform - him, and other honorable members, that I am in a position to authoritatively deny the accuracy of his assertion. I am a member of the council in New South Wales which receives these boys in Sydney, and at the last meeting of that body it was mentioned that not a single complaint had been received from boys who had been brought out under the scheme. Honorable members are probably aware that the lads are taken from conditions which, unless they came to&gt; Australia, would necessitate their drifting into overcrowded professions and blind alleys in Great Britain. Here they are placed in positions where they can carry on useful work under healthy conditions. The only communications about them that we have received have expressed thanks and appreciation for the help received. </para>

                    <para>.- I should  like to take advantage  of  this  opportunity to put the  position  as  it  appears to me  in respect  to the  wireless agreement, concerning which  I  addressed some questions  to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> this morning without notice. On the  question  of  fact,  he and I do not seem to be  quite  in  agreement.  The  wireless agreement,  as  honorable members will probably recall,  was  designed for setting up  a  wireless  system by  mutual obligations incurred  by the Commonwealth  and a certain  company,  and was executed some time  in March of  last year.  As  a result  of discussion  in this  House and the  subsequent inquiries made by  a  special  Committee of  this  Chamber, of  which  I was a member,  whose duty  it was to  inquire into  the  practicability  of the  scheme  and the wisdom or otherwise of the Government  becoming  a  partner with  the  company,  we  decided against  the  draft agreement submitted,  but  a majority  of the Committee  favoured entering into another agreement, which, although vitally amended  in  many particulars,  was  still,  from my  point  of  view, objectionable.  That  agreement contains, amongst other things,  a  covenant  by the Company -  paragraph  of  clause  5  - which  reads -  To provide the main trunk stations in Australia and the United Kingdom within  two  years from the date of this agreement. </para>

                <para class="block">Clause 12 of the agreement refers to the paragraphs quoted, and reads - </para>
                <para>The company shall, within six months after the date of this agreement or within such extended time as the representatives of the Commonwealth on the Board may approve, enter into an agreement providing for the erection and operation of the stations mentioned in paragraphs (f) and <inline font-style="italic">{g)</inline> of clause 5 of this agreement. The agreement shall contain guarantees of such a nature and to such an amount as are approved by the Commonwealth representatives on the Board of directors for the provision of a direct commercial wireless service between Australia and the stations in the United Kingdom and Canada. </para>

I suggest that in the circumstances time might very well be regarded as the essence of the contract, and that the opportunity presented under this clause might be taken advantage of to withdraw from an agreement which is likely to cost the Commonwealth a great deal of money without assuring it . any corresponding gain or advantage. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. We should not exercise the discretion of granting' an extension of. time when the company has failed to do what it should have done within the time prescribed in the agreement and the further extended time. Now is our opportunity. It is curious that this Government, which has set its face so strongly against Government enterprise which is in competition with their old friend, private enterprise, should nevertheless see fit to place £500,000 of public funds into the  moTe  or less discreet hands of this moneymaking company, when the better opinion in Great Britain, and the better opinion in Australia, as represented in this Parliament, on this side of the House particularly, is now in favour  of  making wireless communication, if not a Government monopoly, at least a Government enterprise. We have gathered from the «ables that the British Government has decided to erect, as a Government enterprise, a high-power station capable of serving the needs not only of this country, but of practically the whole of the civilized world. I suggest to the Prime Minister that the action of the British authorities is a broad hint worth taking. We could erect our own high-power stations in Australia as a Government enterprise in line with the Government station on the other side of the water, and withdraw from this money-making company, controlled as it is by the great Marconi Trust, which is desirous of exploiting the Commonwealth in the  company's interests. Instead of making the erection of high-power stations in the Commonwealth a Government enterprise, just as the Post Office and wireless has hitherto been exclusively a Government undertaking, this company is permitted to call for tenders for the erection of a high-power station in Australia. Tenders arc being called, and on the face of it various companies and individuals may compete for the supply of the best articles at the most reasonable price; but when we examine the tender forms we find that they are skilfully drawn up, nominally by the Amalgamated Wireless (Australia) Limited, but really by the Marconi people, who will be competitors, if competition there will be. The conditions of tender are drawn up in such a way as to make it dependent upon the Marconi Company whether any tender other than their own will be accepted: In other words, it is a foregone conclusion that the Marconi Trust is to erect the high-power station in Australia, if it is to be erected at all, at it3 own price and upon its own terms. I am informed by a correspondent, who is well known, and whose views coincide with my own that - </para>

                    <para>When Amalgamated Wireless Limited signed the wireless agreement, it was generally anticipated that if they were compelled to call for tenders, these would be of such a nature that the  contract  for the erection of the Australian station would be safe for the Marconi Company. This was evident from the fact that within a few weeks after the signing of the agreement, Amalgamated Wireless Limited despatched a member of its engineering staff to London, in order that he might become acquainted with the Marconi apparatus. That officer is still in London. Proof of their intention was further evident from the announcement by the Marconi Company in the English press, to the effect that the Australian high-power station would be erected by them. </para>
                    <para>Amalgamated Wireless Limited signed an agreement which stipulated that they would arrange for the provision of reciprocal stations in England and Canada. They were given six months in which to complete negotiations, but were unable to do so. They were then allowed a further six months, and although the extended term has almost expired, they have still proved unequal to making these arrangements, and at the end of the present month the Government will be approached for a still further extension. Notwithstanding this, Amalgamated Wireless require tenderers to undertake the very work which they have been unable to perform, and allow only ten weeks in which to do it. </para>
                    <para>In the first place, according. to the agreement, the negotiations with other Governments are strictly the business of Amalgamated Wireless, and it is absurd to include these functions in a tender which it was intended should relate to the erection of the Australian station only. Being unable to carry out the duties which they contracted to perform, they now endeavour to throw the onus of responsibility on some other company. This is merely another move to prevent other firms from tendering. Secondly, the time limit of ten weeks is ridiculous. Even were the other conditions of tender, reasonable, there is plainly no chance in the world of any company being able to tender in this time. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The Marconi people are publicly stating in London that the high-power station is to be erected by them, although the tenders have not yet 'been received. Pot nearly twelve months they have been endeavouring to complete the negotiations, and now they have the cool impertinence to insert in the conditions of tender that tenderers for the work must conclude the negotiations that are proper work for the Amalgamated Wireless Company itself, and not for the tenderer for the high-power station here. By the time the House re-assembles the extended time given to the company will have expired, and the discretion that the Government enjoy as to whether or not the time is to be further extended will have been exercised. I think I VOl Co the opinion of a united party on this side of the House in repeating the protest we made previously against committing the Commonwealth to any further extent in connexion with this undertaking. We say that the action of the British authorities in proceeding to equip a high-power station on the other side of the world as a Government concern should be an additional incentive to us to equip our high-power station as a Government enterprise in Australia. As I stated in my minority report, we should not allow ourselves to become a joint of the tail of the Marconi Trust. The Leader of the late Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was strong in his condemnation of trusts and combines of the nature of the Marconi Trust. In common with other honorable members I explained on a previous occasion how far this Trust's ramifications extended, even into ex-enemy countries; but, leaving out altogether the question of ex-enemy territory - I cheerfully leave it out at all events - the fact remains that this gigantic Trust is playing with the Commonwealth. It may be said that the company stands to lose or gain just as the Commonwealth does; but that is not a fact. If the tenders are examined it will be seen that the Marconi Company is free from all responsibilities, but stands to be a gainer in the use of its apparatus in experiments in long-distance wireless telegraphy, and in a variety of ways that were eagerly sought for by the representative of Marconi here. It is a very curious and unhappy fact that the gentleman who is in England to-day expounding this matter on behalf of the Commonwealth and of the Amalgamated Wireless Company, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk,</inline> was absolutely distrusted - I think I am justified in saying this - by the majority, if not the whole, of tha members of the parliamentary Committee. I was one of those who distrusted him. It is a sorry state of affairs that we should be made his instruments for the glorification of the Trust instead of maintaining our independence in  this truly national matter, and. securing to Australia inalienable rights, not associated with any other country, in the best interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. I do not expect the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> to promise me to withdraw from the agreement, but whether he does so or not, I take this opportunity to record my protest, and I. feel sure I may say also the protest of every honorable member on this side of the House. </para>

                    <para>. - I think I should say a word or two in reply to the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> regarding the position of the Amalgamated Wireless Company in relation to tenders for the station to be erected in Australia. Throughout the negotiations for establishing a long-distance wireless system here, the honorable member has hardly done himself justice. He certainly did not do so in the action he took as a member of the Committee of this Chamber that went into the question. And he has not done himself justice by the way in which he has put his case to the House. I would remind honorable members that the honorable member for Batman sat on the Committee and concurred in all that was done by it. There was not one member who believed that the honorable member would refuse to sign the Committee's  recommendation. Every other member of the Committee has publicly expressed the view that he had not a shadow of doubt as to the attitude that the honorable member for Batman would adopt. But as soon as its recommendation was framed he repudiated the whole action of tha Committee and put in a minority report. I do not wish to traverse the history of this matter, but I would remind the House of the attitude adopted by the honorable member on a previous occasion with rergard to the wireless scheme. Since then he has consistently endeavoured to cast doubt and suspicion upon the arrangements made, not by the Government alone, but by Parliament. The honorable member for Batman said that his attitude had been indorsed by the whole of his party. That is only partly correct. When this matter was discussed in Parliament, such indorsement was given; but it is also true that one of the representatives of the Labour party - the then honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts),</inline> who was a member of the Parliamentary Committee, concurred in the. decisions of the Committee. I can quite understand, of course, that honorable members opposite would now dissociate themselves from any responsibility for what the former member for Cook said and did. I attach importance, however, to what the Leader of the party, the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> also said and did. He studied certain proposals for altering the agreement which the honorable member for Cook had prepared for submission to the Committee, and he- indorsed them, remarking that they safeguarded the position. That fact should be remembered. The honorable member for Batman now says we should refuse to grant an extension of the tendering period, and so make it impossible for the company to proceed. Such an attitude might commend itself to a lawyer, but it is not one which would appeal to any responsible and respectable business man. The Amalgamated Wireless Company is carrying out the contract into which it entered, and, for the Government to say at this stage, when tenders- have been called for, and the date of their return publicly advertised, that they wish to get out of the arrangement, would be absolutely dishonorable. I need only add that the Government have no intention to so express themselves. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>As for the actual tenders, the Government are determined that they will not hand this wireless business over to the  Marconi  Company, or to any other body. The Government have specifically so instructed their representative directors on the Board of Amalgamated Wireless, and are determined that the expressed wishes of the Committee of this Parliament shall be carried . out. Whoever erects the Australian stations will do so for the sole reason that they have been the successful tenderers in  an  open field. </para>
                <para>The honorable member for Batman read a letter and said that as the sentiments were identical with his own, he would refrain from mentioning the name of the writer. If the letter was not actually written, it was inspired, by  a  rival company. Many other honorable members have received similar communications. This practice, by the way, is, in the special circumstances, altogether improper. . The position which the company responsible for the letter adopts is that the period of tender is inadequate. The company maintains, further, that one or two of the technical conditions are impossible of fulfilment. If the company which says that it .desires to tender is really  in  earnest, it should have taken an obvious course. Instead of circularizing members of Parliament, the writer should have applied to the company' which invited the tenders for the erection of the wireless station, and pointed out that the time was too brief. He should have pointed out at the same time also that certain of the conditions were such that they could not be technically complied with. Had that course been followed the Board would have considered his representations; and, with respect to the matter of time, there would not have been the slightest difficulty in1 providing for an extension. </para>
                <para>As for the objection that the successful tenderer would be required to provide for reciprocal stations in Canada and Great Britain, I may say that the Board made that provision for the obvious reason that it would be absurd to proceed with  a  station here if it -could not get into communication with the other side of the world. The Amalgamated Wireless company was under an obligation, .in the terms of the contract, to see that reciprocal stations were provided. However, the position in regard to these oversea stations has now been changed, and in a very satisfactory manner. The British Government, during the past few days, have announced that they are proposing to erect a station in Great Britain which will be capable of communicating with all the Dominions. They have also stated that) under proper control, they will grant licences to private enterprise to erect similar stations. Thus the task of placing Australia in wireless communication with the world should be made very much more simple. Also, the Board of Amalgamated Wireless now finds itself in a position in which it should be able to make arrangements for reciprocal stations. The Government have -been in consultation with their representatives on the Board, .and they have made certain suggestions to them which should have the effect of removing any objection on the part of a tenderer that his', company would have to undertake the erection of reciprocal stations elsewhere. </para>
                <para>I ask the House to view the whole matter most carefully and seriously, .and to disregard the clouds of suspicion which hove emanated from interested persons. Wireless communication with the outer world is all-important to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- From some quarters, but not from the honorable gentleman. He said we are going to dispose of the dockyard. We have never said anything of. the sort. That matter has to be. considered, and when we' meet' the House again we will inform it what -we are going to do. The honorable member made some rhetorical remarks about " murky dealings," and inquired if tenders have been asked for the purchase of Cockatoo Island Dockyard. They have not. The late Government had nob as part . of its policy the disposal of Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and this Government has not declared any policy for disposing of it. How could we ask for tenders when we had not proposed to dispose of it? That is the first difficulty in which the honorable member is placed. It is perfectly truo that a number of off era have been made for the purchase of the dockyard. The honorable member says that details of these offers should he furnished to the public to let them know what the position is. I suggest that that is quite wrong. When there is any proposal to dispose of Government property, the matter of what offers have been received, or of what action has been taken to dispose of it, is obviously one that the public are entitled to know all about. But if people make the Government offers for various public assets of which the Government have no intention of disposing, have we to publish a daily list of all those wild offers - even that made for the building in which this Parliament is now housed? To do so would be absurd, and the honorable member knows it. </para>
