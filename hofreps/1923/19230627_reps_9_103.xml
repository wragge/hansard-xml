          <para>.- In taking this course, I desire it to&#39; be clearly understood that honorable members on this side are concerned not about particular individuals, but for the maintenance of the great principle of trial by jury, which has governed British justice for centuries past.We dissociate ourselves from happenings abroad and from expressions of opinion on Irish affairs. The hope of the. party on this side is that the people of Ireland may be able, with their new form of government, to work out their own destiny along lines which will bring contentment and happiness to the people of that island. </para>

        <para class="block">Having made that clear, I want to say that this is the first occasion upon which action has been taken under certain legislation passed by this Parliament in 1920. Honorable members will recall the fact that we on this side opposed that legislation. &#34;We pointed out at the time very clearly that in our opinion every individual against whom a charge was made should have the right of trial by jury. Later on, this Parliament also passed an Act dealing with passports. Honorable members on this side opposed that measure, too. I recollect that the Minister in charge of it <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> assured the House that it was necessary in order to facilitate the travelling of persons who might go abroad from Australia. We objected that the legislation proposed was a relic of the war period, and claimed that as we had got back to normal conditions the people should not be hampered by the passport legislation submitted. However, the House passed the measure referred to. The two gentlemen mentioned in my intimation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> who are to be deported from Australia, came here furnished with British passports, not with passports issued by the authorities of another country. Their passports were indorsed by the Australian authorities, and they were allowed to land. They held meetings in Victoria, but no action affecting them was taken. They then went to &#39;New South Wales, and held meetings there. A certain section of the community objected to their speeches, and criticised the action of the Commonwealth Government in permitting these gentlemen to land in Australia. They claimed that they should be deported. As a result . of that criticism, the New&#39; South Wales Government took action against these gentlemen for sedition under a law under which the Commonwealth Government might have taken action had they so desired before the State Government intervened. The law under which the New South Wales Government acted assure to these gentlemen trial by a jury. After the State Government had taken action the Commonwealth instituted proceedings against them under the following provision of the Immigration Act 1920.-  8a. Where the Minister is satisfied that, within three years after the arrival in Aus tralia of a person who was not born in Australia, that person - </para>

            <para>- They may not be aware that they are biased. In a community like this such a pernicious procedure should not be permitted. In this particular case a Board was appointed by the Commonwealth Government, and the envoys were summoned to appear before it in order to show cause why they should not be deported. Their counsel appealed to the High Court to declare that the provision of the Immigration Act under which the Board had been appointed was unconstitutional. However, the Court held that the Act was valid. Meanwhile the hearing of the charge of sedition levelled bythe State Government was stopped. The Immigration In-&#39; quiry Board resumed its sittings after the decision of the High Court had been given, aud recommended that these two gentlemen be deported. , The next step in the chain of events was the appearance of the envoys in the State Court to answer the adjourned, charge of sedition, and the police magistrate, before whom they appeared, is reported to have criticised the Commonwealth authorities severely for having practically held a State Court in contempt by delaying proceedings. I should say that there was justification for that criticism. </para>

            <para>- I am glad to hear the Minister&#39;s denial. In company with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunn,</inline> I waited on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bavin,</inline> the State Attorney-General, and he told us that the State Government were not responsible for thedelay, but that the fault lay with the Commonwealth Government for having taken proceedings under the Immigration Act after the State Government had initiated&#39; a prosecution for sedition. He said that obviously the State could not proceed with its prosecution when the Commonwealth stepped in. I asked if, under the charge of sedition, the envoys would have the right to trial by a jury, and he replied that there was no question of the accused losing the right to a trial by a jury under the charge the State had laid against these gentlemen, and, further, that the proceedings had been initiated under a Commonwealth Act. If the State Government could proceed under a Commonwealth Act, which gave the accused the right to a trial by a jury, how was it that the Commonwealth did not proceed in the same way? How was it that they allowed these gentlemen to address meetings in Victoria and also in New South Wales, and that they took action only after the State Government had done so? </para>

        <para>I hope that there will be no effort to make it appear that honorable members on this side, are holding a brief for the persons concerned. I do not know these gentlemen. I have never met them. I am no more concerned with them than I would be with any other person ordered to be deported by a Board appointed under the Immigration Act.. When section 8a was discussed in this House we pointed out the clanger that might be incurred by persons expressing their opinion of the existing system of government in Australia. Within three years after his arrival in this country a&#39; man who may have been a good citizen for over two years may happen to say something during industrial trouble which may be held to be&#39; in contravention of this section of the Act, and a Board may be appointed to deport him. No one can tell where this sort of thing will end, and for that reason we cannot allow these two gentlemen to be deported without raising our voice in protest. If we do not do so we shall be regarded as giving tacit consent to the action of the Government. </para>

            <para>- It is a very serious position. Whatever may have happened during the war, when every one was in  a  state of excitement, we are not justified in perpetuating the procedure of that period. If the Government think they are justified in putting into operation a measure of this kind in the circumstances I have outlined, what may not happen to our liberty of speech or to the right to trial by a jury? I am ventilating this&#39; matter solely because I am anxious that nothing, should be done to abolish liberty of speech or trial by jury. Had the Government taken a course of action which would have allowed the envoys to be tried by a jury, no one could have found fault. But that was not done. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth Government intervened, and so delayed the State proceedings that the police magistrate who was dealing with the case felt called upon to comment on the Commonwealth&#39;s action. To me the action taken by the Commonwealth is beyond understanding. </para>

            <para>- There may be something in that view of the matter. It seems to me that the Commonwealth Government must have taken fright when  a  certain agitation commenced in New South Wales. Probably they thought that the proceedings instituted by the State Government were, in a way, a reflection upon themselves, and, of course, astheState (Government had already (preferred . a charge of sedition against the envoysunder a Commonwealth Statute, they were obliged to look forsomeother means of taking action, and accordingly commenced proceedings under the Immigration Act. I would like to hearthe Attorney-General explainwhythe Commonwealth did this when the gentlemen inquestionwere already answering a charge of sedition, which would have to be decided by a jury, and not by a Board appointed by theGovernment. Ido not knowthe members of the Board, and I make no reflection upon their personal , probity when I say that it is possible for men to be unconsciously biased by public clamour in connexion with a proposeddeportation.. Therefore, the community having againsettled down to peace conditions, we should revertto our pre-war procedure, which gaveevery man the right to trial by ajury of his fellow countrymen. That right is the bulwark of British justice. We have upheld it for hundreds of years as a pattern to &#39;be followedbyother nations in framing their judicial systems. Yet in this enlightened age, aftertrialby jury has been in operation for hundreds of years, and has proved to beaneffective safeguard of the liberties of the individual, and the safety of thecommnnity, the Government are attemptingto deny it to two persons who have arrived in the Commonwealth. Do not forget that they arrived as British subjects, with British passports. Honorable members opposite talk a lot . about the Empire, and the necessity forEmpire solidarity, and for meting out even-handed justice ; to every man who is protected by the Britishflag. In this instance, that principle has been lost to sight ; the usual method . of administering British justice has been set aside. Not only every Britisher, but every person of any nationality who comes to Australia, isentitled to trial byjury. The men who are about to be deported arrived with a passport which was equivalent to a icertificate by the BritishGovernment of the exemplary character of the bearers. No other view can be taken of , a -passport issued by British . officials. They have no right to issue passports to undesirables, and it may be assumed that they would not do so. These Irish . envoyswere hall-marked as reput ablecitizensoftheEmpire ; yet theCommonwealth proposes : to depoutthem withoutaccording themtrial by : jury. immediately afterthe New : South Wales magistrate had expressedhis disgust &#39;with the action . ofthe Commonwealth Law Department in delayingto take action against these men; immediiartely after &#34;he had declined to further remandthem on the sedition charge brought by the State Government, and had released them, theywerere-arrested. Probably , they will be deported in the near future, but it is notyet too lateor the Commonwealth Government to retrace their steps, and have these men tried by a jury, a procedure to which they, like everybody else in this country,are entitled. </para>

It was a law deliberately made by this Parliamentfor the purpose of regulating the admission of immigrants to Australia, and excluding undesirables.

            <para>- I am showing that the basis of the Act is administration by the executive authority, which is entitled, by the law itself, to exclude prohibited immigrants if they are known to be such at the time of their arrival. This Parliament deliberately adopted that law as the settled and determined policy of the country, and I submit that it was right in so doing.. A person who advocates the overthrow of any established Government in the King&#39;s Dominions is by the law of the land a prohibited immigrant. Itis obvious that in the specification of undesirable immigrants it is the character of the individuals which is aimed at. It is not always possible to discover at the moment of an immigrant&#39;s arrival in the Commonwealth whether he is or is not disqualified on the grounds set out in the paragraph I have quoted. Parliament, realizing the possibility of undesirables evading the law, and thereby getting a footing in. the Commonwealth before their characters are discovered, wisely enacted that if within a period of three years after an immigrant&#39;s arrival he proves himself or is found to be within the category of prohibited immigrants he can be deported. But in order that he should not be treated unfairly, a clause was inserted providing that the Minister could not deport a man charged with being a prohibited immigrant untilhe had appointed a Board to adjudicate on the case, and the person charged had failed to appear before such Board and show cause, or the Board had recommended that he should be deported. In this case those conditions were fulfilled. The honorable member <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> said that it is an unheard of  proceeding to have a law administered in this way; he said that it is a violation of the right to trial by jury. May I remind the honorable member exactly what that right is? It is conceded to a man who has committed an offence against the laws of the country in which he resides. </para>

            <para>- The Commonwealth did not stop the proceedings. I am dealing with the law under which we took action. I say that that law considers only the question whether a person is a desirable or an undesirable immigrant. If he is thought to be an undesirable immigrant, it is a matter for the Executive Authority to determine that fact, and deport him from Australia. This law is not unknown to British communities or to countries inheriting British traditions. Canada passed an Immigration law in 1910. That was well before the outbreak of the war, so that it cannot be contended that that law was the result of war conditions. It provides that whenever any person other than a Canadian citizen, within three years of landing, has been convicted of a criminal offence in Canada, or enters or remains in Canada contrary to the Act, he shall be reported by the Immigration Officer to the Minister. Section 41 provides - </para>

If the Board is satisfied that the person is a prohibited or undesirable immigrant he may be deported forthwith, subject to an appeal to the Minister. The Board of Inquiry consists of three or more immigration officers, of whom the Immigration Officer in charge must be one. </para>

        <para>Canada is a British community corresponding to our own which, prior to the war, acted in exactly the same way as we acted in 1920. Nobody can say that the Dominion of Canada is less British than Australia in its institutions andin its care for the liberty of the subject. Executive provision relating to deportation may be found in the Undesirable Immigrants Exclusion Act of New Zealand. Under that Act, the AttorneyGeneral of New Zealand may order any person to leave the Commonwealth if that person is disaffected, disloyal, or liable to be a source of dangerto the peace, order and good government of New Zealand. The South African Act also has provisions dealing with exclusion. The United States of America has a law exactly similar to the Australian Act, and in it provision is made, in addition, for the examination of immigrants by a Special Board of Inquiry consisting of three immigration officers. Honorable members will see, therefore, that there is nothing novel in our law; it is similar to laws which have been passed by other British communities and by the United States of America. These laws are not deemed by those countries to be a violation of the liberty of the subject. The passage of our Act was perfectly justified. The Act is brought into force by the Minister on the advice of a Board, in order that action may be taken promptly to exclude from Australia persons found here who are deemed to be undesirable. </para>
        <para>There is no necessity to discuss the proceedings that took place before the </para>
        <para class="block">Board. A copy of the Board&#39;s finding has been laid upon the table of this House. The Board found that these men had advocated the overthrow by&#39; force and violence of the established Government of a civilized country, to wit, the Irish Free State. </para>
        <para>Exception is taken to our intervention. The responsibility is thrown upon the Department of Home and Territories to administer this Act. The New South Wales Government, on its own initiative, took action under the Crimes Act, and charged these persona with sedition. The action of the State Government did not remove from the Commonwealth the obligation to take whatever action they felt was necessary for the removal from Australia of undesirable immigrants. </para>

            <para>- Not necessarily. The object of our Act is to exclude undesirable persons from Australia. Immediately the Commonwealth Government are in a position to do this, it is their duty to take action. So soon as we were in possession of evidence which showed that these men were undesirable under the provisions of the law, we deemed it to be our duty to take action. Action was taken independently of the State. The men were charged before a perfectly impartial Board. Immediately that Board was constituted, objection was taken to its constitutional authority. The constitutional issues were carried to the High Court of Australia. The attitude of the Commonwealth all through has been not to take any technical advantage, but to have the constitutional issue and the merits of the case decided according to law. The High Court of Australia affirmed the constitutional validity of the Act which we passed in 1920. The Board having made a recommendation certifying to all the facts essential for the deportation of the persons concerned, it is the duty of the Government to comply with the law. </para>

        <para>The Leader of the Opposition took the stand that because these men had been supplied with passportsby the British Government, no action should have been taken against, them here. The passports gave them authority to move within, the British &#39;Empire, but contained the conditions that they were issued subject to the immigration regulations of all parts of the Empire. Therefore, there was nothing to prevent the Government from pnoceeding in accordance with the Commonwealth immigration law. </para>

I am not concerned&#39; in any way with their message. It would be presumption, on my part,, to attempt to- dogmatize on the Irish question when the Irish people themselves are so much divided over it. What I am concerned about is that this Government should out-jingo the jingoes of Britain in their determination to keep this an. utterly loyal country. The Irish envoys were quite well-known in Great Britain, but they got their passports for Australiawithout the slightest trouble. Members of the British Government,, whatever their faults may be, are not, asa rule, as hysterical as this Government.. They recognised, no doubt, that the position of. affairs in Ireland could not be altered, and so passports were issued fa these men, who&#39; came to Australia. </para>

            <para>- They made, speeches&#39; containing gross reflections on the British Parliament, and they were in Australia for a month or six weeks before any action was taken. I am not concerned at all with the nature of their views, but I protest that persons who come here on passports issued by the British Government, should not be liable to be incarcerated, or deported as undesirables. If this course can be upheld it is&#39; quite possible that in due time, when some of my colleagues: from the Bnitish Labour party come to Australia,  the Commonwealth Government may deport them in the same manner. On the other side of the House there are honorable members who have committed enough sedition to justify their deportation a dozen times over, and I am: certain that, on this side, there is not one member who has not made seditious speeches. I defy any man to fight effectively on behalf of the working classes without being guilty of seditious utterances. The absurd Act &#34;under which the Irish envoys are tobe deported was not, as the Minister has said, passed in time of war, but because the War Precautions Act was being repealed, and it was thought necessary to keep the jingoistic spirit in existence, so as to be ready for those who might come to this country, and by their speeches, attempt to disrupt the great British Empire.

            <para>- The honorable member, nodoubt, would act if he had the opportunity. If there were an insurrection in China, for instance, and a delegation representing the workers of China came to Australia to lay their case before the people in the Commonwealth, he could under this law be deported. The whole Act is characteristic of those hysterical people who have been governing the Commonwealth during the past six years. The accused persons, who have made twenty or thirty speeches in Australia, have not caused a greater ripple in public opinion than would be caused by a pebble thrown into the sea at St. Kilda; but Governments aided, abetted and incited by certain organizations in this community have been led to believe that not only the British Empire and her Dominions, but the whole of the civilized world is endangered. These organizations, have, therefore, used their force and influence to compel the Governmentto take action. </para>

No sooner had the State Government taken action under their sedition law than the Commonwealth Government instituted proceedings under their Immigration Act. There are sufficient Commonwealth and State laws under which a person may be tried for sedition. But these were thought insufficient to deal with these particular gentlemen, and the Commonwealth is therefore acting under the drag-net section which I have quoted, and is about to deport them from the Commonwealth.

        <para class="block">Even the stipendiary magistrate became heated. These gentlemen 4were eventually discharged into the hands of a policeman, who took them to a penitentiary. During the trial by a biased Board, one of the accused - I am informed by an onlooker, not through the press - was assaulted, and when he asked for protection he did not receive the courtesy he was entitled to. It is a further reflection upon the Commonwealth Government if men charged with sedition are allowed to be assaulted as this man was. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> said that an impartial Board was appointed. God save us from impartiality of this kind ! Of all the conservative, biased, and prejudiced men in the community, I doubt whether it would be possible to secure three more partial, conservative, biased, and prejudiced men than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stinson, Mr. Macfarlane,</inline> arid <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Manning.</inline> When one knows the beliefs of these men it is easy to realize that they had formed their opinions as soon as they were appointed. I followed the trial closely, and came to the conclusion that, irrespective of the defence that would be put up, the accused would be deported. That was the order. It is useless the Minister informing us that it was an impartial trial, because the whole thing was &#34;rigged&#34; and &#34;faked&#34; by the two Governments concerned. I earnestly pray that honorable members on this side of the House, if their liberties are at stake, may never have to appear before such an impartial Board. British justice! There is no such thing under such a Board. I can only lodge my protest as I did when that hysterical, jingoistic piece of legislation was placed on our statute-book, and I always regret that such an Act remains, particularly when it is misused, &#39;as it has been in this instance. The Government has not used it in the interests of the British Empire. The British Government should at least be given some consideration, for it would not foolishly and hysterically endanger the peace of Great Britain and Ireland by taking such ridiculous action as the Commonwealth Government has taken. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to congratulate the Government upon the action it has taken in connexion with the deportation of men whose sole purpose and desire, it has been proved, was to overthrow all constitutional forms of Government. I am surprised that any member of this House should blame the Government for trying to keep the pure air of Australia free from pollution by men whose sentiments lead them to desire the destruction  11  ot merely of Australia, but of the British Empire. They have had a fair and rea,sonable trial, according to the forms of British justice. I regret that the powers of the Commonwealth Government are not even greater than they are. If the Government desired me to do it, I would support action to compel every person to subscribe to the oath of allegiance before landing in Australia. I know that we have power to compel individuals to take that oath, but in some cases, such as the one under notice, disloyal people have slipped into this country without the knowledge of the authorities. Some honorable members have  endeavoured to make capital of  the fact that these men were admitted to the Commonwealth on a British passport, but if after entering Australia men behave in a manner which undoubtedly proves that they are not fit to continue as residents, the people ought not to be compelled to harbor them, either temporarily or permanently, merely because they hold a British passport. I congratulate the New South Wales Government on what it has &#34;done, and regret that action was not taken earlier. The mass of the people of the Commonwealth have come to the conclusion that if the Commonwealth Government had not acted&#39; as it did, it would have violated the trust reposed in it. Both the hearts and the minds of the people have been impressed, and they are determined not to tolerate any Government that will sympathizewith and assist the disastrous propaganda of rebels. I would not give support for one instant to a Government which would condone the action of members of the Opposition in defending people who are not worthy subjects of the British Empire. </para>

It is, however, determined to dispense justice and to stand for the unity of the Empire. It will not harbor in our midst men who are traitors and rebels to the country. Those who were appointed to investigate the case were men of a high calibre, who had filled other responsible positions, and they came to the unanimous conclusion that these men were rebels and traitors to the Empire. Australia, therefore, cannot retain them in this country. </para>

            <para>- It is all very well for members of the Opposition to say &#34; Hear, hear,&#34; and to talk of forming a Republic in this country. They will not get&#39; very far with that kind, of propaganda. The people of Australia are within the bonds of the British Empire, and that Empire, no matter what may be said by honorable members opposite, is the greatest Empire the world has ever seen. No Government that is true to its trust can permit Australia to be polluted with Sinn Feiners, rebels, and traitors. I congratulate the Government, and I hope it will take steps to rid Australia of many more men of the calibre of these Irish envoys, who should be deported as soon as it is possible to make the necessary arrangements. The people desire it, and are behind the Government in the action taken, not because the Government is one-sided, but because it is national. The Government represents not any particular section, sect, or colour in the community, but the people as a whole. Other Governments, if they get the chance, may do otherwise, but this Government must keep Australia free from the contamination of rebels and traitors. The people of Australia will learn from this debate that there are men even in the Commonwealth Parliament who would harbor and foster in this country people who are not fit to live here. I hope the present Government will long continue to control the affairs of the country, for its loyal sentiments have found expression in the deportation of men who are not fit to pollute the pure air of Australia. </para>

          <para>. -Before the question is put I should like to make it clear that in voting against the Government I do not, in any way, father the cause of the Irish Free State, or that of the opposing forces in Ireland. The vote which I intend to give will be a vote in favour of trial by jury. On many occasions in the last Parliament, when the war hysteria affected the people, I endeavoured to obtain justice for men who had been in Australia, not merely for a few weeks, but for many years, and who had been deported without a trial by jury. I took that stand then and I am in duty bound to adhere to it on this occasion. Whether a person who wishes to enter this country, is of Irish, German, English, or other origin is of no matter to me, providing he is of the white race. The Irish envoys should have been given a trial by jury, upon which is based the whole edifice of the British system of justice. The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. F. Francis),</inline> because one of these gentlemen holds the title of &#34;Father,&#34; could not miss the opportunity to butt in. Any honorable member who has been returned to this House largely on a sectarian vote must, at all costs, cultivate that vote in order to retain it. Such action, despicable though it be, is absolutely necessary. These gentlemen spoke in Victoria, and very little comment was made. They then went to New South Wales. The Government there were largely returned upon the sectarian issue, and it is to their interest to fan the flames of sectarianism as much as possible. For that reason they commenced an action against these Irish envoys. The honorable member for Henty first of all congratulated the Commonwealth Government for having decided bo deport these gentlemen, and then he congratulated the New South Wales Government for their action, although a State magistrate acquitted the gentlemen in question. If one can gauge the honorable member&#39;s mentality by bis  remarks, the electors of the Henty district must feel dissatisfied with their selection of him in preference to men of the calibre of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boyd</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gullett,</inline> who are bothcapable men. This honorable member, in one breath, congratulates the Government for acertain action, and, in hisnextbreach, congratulates another Government for doingpractically the opposite. I shall castmy vote in favour of every person, particularly British subjects, having the opportunity oftrial byjury priorto beingdeported, fined or imprisoned. </para>

          <para>. -I renter myprotestagainstthe proposed action of theCommonwealth Government to deport the Irish . envoys. These men, no matter from what country ithey come, should have trial by jury before being deported. The Attorney-General pointed out that in South Africa and Canada, provisionwasmade under the immigration laws forthe creation of aspecial Board consisting of three immigration officers. The Commonwealth Government are now acting on the finding ofa Board consisting not of three Government officials or three immigration officials,but of three distinct partisans. The Board comprised <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McFarlane,</inline> a magistrate who has received from the Government quite a number of commissions to proceed on fishing excursions, to try to ferret out evidence of the alleged maladministration of the late Labour Government; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stdnson,</inline> who is actively connected with the King and Empire Alliance; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Manning,</inline> who is a prominent Tory. How could any one expect these three men to arrive at a fair and impartial finding, knowing their past activities and associations with the Government? If theGovernment had created a Board consisting of three members of the judiciary, one might have expected a fair and honorable finding from them. Apart from the creation and thepersonnel of the Board, these Irish envoys should have been afforded the opportunity of trial by jury. I raise my voice at all times in protest against any person being deprived of liberty. I have been actively associated with a movement to bring about the amendment of the law of New South Wales concerning lunacy laws. In many cases persons have been incarcerated in asylums without being given the protection of a proper inquiry. The cases have been submitted to a magistrate, and on his finding, together with the certificatesof two medical practitioners or two justices of the peace, persons have been committed to mental hospitals for life. I am opposed to the present practice in New South Wales ofconsigning persons to mental asylums without trial by jury, and I am also opposed to the decision of the Government to deport thesetwo Irish envoys without affording them a trial by jury. They were charged with being connected with seditious enterprises,, and, before being deported from the Commonwealth, their case Should be submitted to a jury to ascertain whether they were actually engaged in a seditious enterprise or not. It is said that it is a matter for the CommonwealthGovernment to see that the laws of the country are put into effect; but to illustrate to honorable members how easy it would be for one of these gentlemen to be found guilty of being engaged in a seditious enterprise, I refer them to a section of the War Precautions Repeal Act, which contains a number of provisions quite as hysterical as those of the Commonwealth Immigration Act passed in 1920. According to that section, it is a seditious action to promote ill-will and hostility between  His  Majesty&#39;s subjects so as to endanger the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth. I submit that every honorable member ofthis House has committed sedition at one time or another. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stinson,</inline> a member&#34; of the Board, is associated with the King and Empire Alliance, which organization undoubtedly creates strife and dissension among  His  Majesty&#39;s subjects. No honorable member could put forward his views on the platform without bringing himself within the provisions of this reactionary law. I hope theGovernment will reconsider their decision and give these men an opportunity of appearing before a jury to show that they are not engaged in a seditious enterprise. </para>

            <para>- I withdraw it. Nevertheless it is deplorable that expression is given to such sentiments as these we have heard from the honorable member. He is always on the platform talking about his loyalty to the Empire. But though a much younger man than several honorable members who fought for their country during the late war, the honorable member for Henty did not go on active service. He was a still younger man atthe timet of the South African War, but he has no medals to show that he participated in that campaign. He likes  to  dwell upon the subject of loyalty to the Empire, because he represents a constituency where the electors, owing to sectarian considerations, are-&#39; easily influenced by such talk. I come from a North of Ireland family, but the bitterness engendered between the north and south of Ireland should not be displayed by the descendants- of Irishmen in Australia. Those differences should be settled in Ireland.I emphatically protest against the deportation of the Irish envoys. The only trial they have received has resulted in their acquittal&#39;. Cases of deportation were numerous during the late war,, and the only justification that, the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> can offer for the precipitate action of the Government is the fact that some Act was passed by the Nationalist Government in 1920. That measure was not acquiesced in by the. Labour party. We bitterly opposed every line of it, because it could be used not only against persons expressing republican sympathies, but. also against any people having the temerity to express views not in accord with those- of the Government in power.I trust that the Ministry will not proceed with their deportation. If the mem in question are guilty of sedition, let it be proved before a properly-constituted tribunal. Only upon that proof being furnished would deportation be justifiable. </para>

              <para>In November, 1922, the British War Office called for tenders for the supply of 900,000 (12 oz.) tins of corned beef. The tenders closed on the 11th December, . 1922, and the agents in Great Britain of the various Australian packers were promptly notified. The successful tenderer was a South American packing firm, whose name is not known.  His  price was 5s. 4&#189;d. per dozen. The American quotations ranged from 5s. 3d. to 8s. 6d. per dozen; the Australian quotations from 8s. 6d. to 10s.6d. per dozen. In February last the British War Office called for tenders for the supply of 1,080,000 (12 oz.) tins corned beef. The tenders closed on the 17th April, 1923. The agents in Great Britain of Australian firms were informed by the War Office, and all meat exporting firms in Australia were notifiedby the Comptroller-General of Customs. The War Office would have placed portion of this order with an Australian firm had the firm been prepared to give the financial guarantee required by the Imperial Government. The successful tenderers or the price accepted by the British Government are not known. During 1922, an Australian meat export company secured a British Army contract for frozen beef which absorbed about 20,000 first-quality bullocks, and the same company secured another similar contract this year. </para>

The public in Great Britain have subscribed about &#163;58,000,and one donor, it is believed, subsequently gave &#163;50,000. I am informed that the British Government is not providing any funds for the purpose, but is allowing an appeal to be made to the public. Under the circumstances it wouldseem reasonable for the Commonwealth -Government to adhere to the same principle. An appealmight, if desired,be made to the people of Australia, say, under the auspices of the Navy League. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave).</inline> - Several questions have been asked in this House recently as to whether the Government propose to take any action with regard to the coming wheat crop in Australia. To these questions I have replied that the Government were giving the matter consideration. After the very fullest investigation of the position, the Government have decided to participate again this year in the financial arrangements connected with the forthcoming wheat harvest. The assistance will be by way of guarantee through the Commonwealth Bank in the manner employed last year. The basis of the guarantee will be the same also as that of last year, namely, 3s. per bushel at the siding and 8d. per bushel to cover freight and handling charges. The Government have given a great deal of consideration to this question, because they are certain that it is not in the best interests of the primary producers, or indeed of any class in this country, that they should look to the Government for financial assistance in the marketing and handling of their products. But, bearing in mind the adverse climatic conditions to which many parts of Australia, and particularly New South Wales, have been subjected for some considerable time past, we have felt that we should give those engaged in the wheat industry a further opportunity to make arrangements for the handling and marketing of their harvest without governmental assistance. For that reason, we propose to continue the wheat guarantee for another year, but in doing so we wish to make it very clear to those engaged in this industry that we are giving them an opportunity to make their own arrangements, and we hope that before the next harvest they will have put their industry on a basis which will enable that to be clone. The Commonwealth Bank will take the necessary action, and the Government will stand behind the Bank and guarantee an amount of 3s. 8d. per bushel. We have asked the Commonwealth Bank to take steps to get into touch with the States, and ascertain whether they desire to participate in the guarantee. As soon as replies have been received, an agreement will be prepared giving effect to the proposed guarantee. That agreement will be submitted to this House, when honorable members will have an ample opportunity of expressing their opinions in regard to it. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Defence has just moved for leave to introduce a measure dealing with the defence of Australia. I consider this such a very serious and vital question that the Minister should take advantage of the earliest opportunity to explain to the House in some way how he proposes to amend the existing Act. He should give us some broad outline, at least, of what the Government&#39;s proposals are. I have it in mind that it is the intention of the Government to make some very drastic alterations of the Defence Act. I fear that they are endeavouring to introduce conscription into Australia again, and I wish to take advantage of every opportunity to oppose anything of the kind. </para>

          <para>.- The Government are evidently asking for leave to bring in a Bill to remit the Excise duty on beer. It is lamentable if they should seek to do this at a time when there are many evils in our midst crying out for redress.Surely beer could stand over for a little while. As the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> has just said, the Minister would have been better employed in asking for leave to bring in a Bill to increase invalid and old-age pensions. I hope the Government will accept what honorable members are saying as an intimation that they are expected to come down to-morrow with&#39; a Bill having that purpose in view. </para>

Questions submitted in regard to the increasing of invalid and old-age pensions are met with supercilious smiles, and the unsatisfactory reply, &#34; Wait a while.&#34; Before proceeding to afford protection to the Boy Scouts&#39; Association, or looking after the wines, beers, and spirits of this country, we should have some declaration from the Minister that he will bring in. a measure that will give the House an opportunity of increasing the pensions for the aged people of Australia. </para>

That is the only reason why the Government are not introducing at once the&#39; measure relatingtoinvalid and oldage pensions. The figures at present available show that we. can go to a certain extent in increasing the. pension and liberalizing the conditions, but it may be that when the figures for the current year are finalized we shall find that we can afford&#39; to be more liberal&#39; than we feel we are entitled to be in the light  of  the information now before us.

        <para class="block">The Audit Act provides that all grants made by Parliament for ordinary services, but not including&#39; grants, made in respect of special or loan appropriations or&#39; trust funds, such as old-age pensions and war pensions, shall lapse at the end of the financial year; but. as it is essential that the ordinary services shall continue, it is necessary that Parliament shall vote money towards defraying their cost. This measure provides for two months&#39; Supply for those services. Before that period has expired I hope to afford the Committee the opportunity of. discussing the Budget for the ensuing year.. I hope to bring down the Budget before the end of July, first of all in order to give honorable members the most ample opportunity for discussing it during the remaining part of the session, and secondly, to give the- public the earliest possible opportunity ofknowing what is the financial position of the Commonwealth, and&#39; what are the financial proposals of the Government </para>
        <para>The sum for which we are asking under this Bill is &#163;4,154,085. Included in that amount is a provision of &#163;300,000 for refunds of revenue, and &#163;1,000,000 for advance to the Treasurer; leaving for ordinary departmental expenditure and war services payable out of revenue a sum of &#163;2,854,085. Those figures have been based upon the Estimates for the current year, which were approved by. Parliament ; they do not contain any new items. The estimated departmental expenditure and War Services payable from revenue for 1922-23 amounted to &#163;17,967,000. One-sixth of that sum would be &#163;2,994,000; but we are asking the Committee to approve of the expenditure of only &#163;2,854,000, despite the fact that during the next two months five pay days will occur, and there really is necessity for greater provision than one-sixth of the annual appropriation. The sum of &#163;300,000 is being set apart for refunds of direct taxes which have to be made by the Taxation Office. The provision includes considerable arrears which will be carried forward to 30th June, 1923. Regarding the advance to the Treasurer of &#163;1,000,000, it has been customary to provide for all works actually in progress at 30th June as well as to meet expenditure of a recurring nature on new works pending the passage of a Works Bill, which will be brought down immediately the Budget speech has been delivered. In following this practice we are asking for a lesser amount than is usually asked for, judging by the monthly statements of previous years. The Committee will not be consenting to any new commitments, because none are contemplated in that provision of &#163;1,000,000. </para>
        <para>Until the Treasury books have been closed, at the end of the year, it will be impossible to give a statement setting out the exact position of the Commonwealth. I hope to lay before Parliament, on 4th July, a statement showing the approximate revenue and expenditure for the present year. All I am able to do at present is to indicate, from the figures that are available, that the surplus of &#163;6,408,000 which was carried forward into the year 1922-23 not only will remain untouched, but will be substantially augmented by the excess of revenue over expenditure during the current year. </para>

          <para>.- It is pleasing to hear from the new Treasurer that he anticipates bringing down hia Budget by the end of July. I hope that his expectation will be fulfilled, as it is absolutely necessary that we should have that Budget before us as early as possible, in view of the declaration of the Government that this House shall rise early in August. It is obvious that, if we are to give full consideration to the Budget, we must have some time in which to discuss it. There should be an interval of at least one week, after the statement  taa  been made by the Treasurer, before wo are called upon to deal with it. That will bring us to within a week or a fortnight of the closing of this House. I am at a loss to understand how we shall be able, in a couple of weeks, to deal intelligently with the Budget and the Estimates, quite apart from other legislation. </para>

            <para>- In many cases the contribution was compulsory, because persons were told by their employers that they had to take up a certain amount. Assistance was rendered them to enable them to- do so. That class of depositor requires his or her money, and conversion will not take place in such cases, so that a considerable sum will have to be raised in some other manner. My objection to the loan is that it is not short-dated. I cannot understand why the honorable gentleman and his Government decided upon a period of twenty-five years; I be- .lieve too, without the option of paying it off earlier. They made it a  long-dated loan in face of the fact that the interest rate is falling in every part of the world; and if we are to be guided by expert opinion, it is likely to fall considerably within the next two or three years. I believe that the honorable gentleman himself is credited in some papers with having made the statement that in three years the interest rate will be about 4-J per cent. Another statement, which he was credited with having made, is that in about seven years the rate will be 4 per cent. How, then, can &#39; the Government justify the issuing of this loan at 5 per cent. free of State income tax, and. carrying a bonus of &#163;1 for every &#163;100 converted ? It does not bear out their contention that they are exercising the strictest economy. It is evident that this country is going to be made pay considerably more than it should. If it were possible to convert the whole of the &#163;38,700,000, by giving a bonus of &#163;1 for every &#163;100 we would lose about &#163;387,000. A little while back I read that New Zealand had converted, in England, a loan amounting to some millions, at 4 per cent. Surely, then, the Commonwealth can convert at a cheaper rate than 5 per cent. ! Not only has the re te of interest for the conversion&#39; loan been fixed at 5 per cent., but it is to be free of income tax as well, and this will- mean, probably, an additional ^ per cent, to the investor. </para>

            <para>- Because, I presume, many people who, during the war, thought it their duty, from patriotic motives, to invest in loans, cannot afford now to have their money tied up for another twenty-five years. Therefore, the terms are likely to be attractive only to wealthy people who, in addition to getting a high rate of interest for another  twenty-five years, will also get probably another &#163;1 for every &#163;100 converted, and this will represent a large sum of money. </para>

            <para>- There. is nothing to prevent holders from selling on the open market; but my point is that if the rate of interest is likely to fall in the near future we have no right to offer such anattractive investment for such a . long period. It is claimed by stock exchange authorities that if the rate of interest drops to 4&#189; per cent, this conversion loan stock will sell for &#163;107, and that if it  drops to 4 per cent, the stock will command &#163;115 in the open market, so it will be possible for &#34; jobbers &#34; to make considerable sums of money out of these transactions. Interest rates have fallen in Great Britain and America already, and it is being urged in respect of this conversion loan that investors would be well advised to convert, because, in the near future, interest rateswill be lower than at present. I submit, that, in view of the probabilities, the terms are not wise, and that we should use every endeavour to get our money as cheaply as possible. </para>

            <para>- At present no one can say what amount has been converted. We shall not know until the Treasurer has made his statement. If money is likely to be cheaper within the next six or seven years, those investors who convert their stock will be on a very good wicket indeed. The terms are not in the best interests of the Commonwealth. During the war no loans were issued for a period extending beyond ten years. Why have the Government, at this late hour, and when interest rates are likely to fall, issued such a long-dated loan? Why should we be asked to pay away &#163;387,000 of the Commonwealth money to induce people to convert their holding in a war loan ? . We cannot afford to pay away large sums of money in this way simply because our revenue is buoyant. Every one knows that it is not likely to be buoyant in the future, because our principal source of income is the Customs duties, and it is the business of this Parliament to see that exorbitant revenue is not derived from that source. There is no justification whatever for this long-dated loan. It should have been short dated, so that we could take advantage of any favorable trend in market rates of interest, and. in that way save a considerable amount of money. We are paying interest on about &#163;416,000,000, so we should be as careful as possible to get the capital sums as cheaply as possible. </para>

        <para>Another matter to which I desire to refer is the action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy President</inline> Webb in the Arbitration Court recently. I am reluctant to mention it, but I believe it is only right that I should do so especially as I have been appealed to by very many trade unionists ou the subject. It will be remembered that in January last an award was given in connexion with an action taken by the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners against the Victorian Government, Anthony, and others. The essential principle of arbitration is that the parties to it shall observe the award, otherwise they will be in contempt. That is the position in which the Victorian Government stands in connexion with the award I mention, but, notwithstanding this, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy President</inline> Webb permitted them; to approach the Court. In this way there was unfair discrimination, because recently the Australian Workers Union, which failed- to give effect to an award, were not permitted to be heard, and certain officers of the union were fined heavily.

But, if I may It)e &#39;permitted to say so, I think it is very unfair to discriminate between parties to an award.

I could quote exactly what took place, but I do not think it necessary to do so, and I do not wish to occupy the time of the Committee unduly.

            <para>- The figures were sufficiently accurate to enable the Go- vernment to deal iwith the question of income tax, which involved a very big principle, at a recent Conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. Although those proposals were based von this year&#39;s figures, which the Treasurer., in effect, now states he has little knowledge of, the Government are endeavouring to force the House to deal with them in the remaining seven weeks of the session. If it were . not for the objections raised by the State Ministers, a measure embodying the income tax proposals would -have already been introduced, and the Government, in order to get business through, will be submitting Bills, the provisions of which they have not thoroughly digested themselves. </para>

            <para>- Yes, and when conferring with the State Ministers certain figures were submitted for their guidance; but the Treasurer now says that a decision cannot be reached until the position of the Commonwealth at the end of the financial year has been considered. These facts support what I stated in moving my no-confidence amendment, that the States do not know where they standi, and that the whole proposition is &#34; loaded.&#34;The Government now find themselves in an awkward position, and everything which has happened of late gives colour to my previous suggestionthat the measures to be introduced in connexion with the taxation proposals should mot be rushed through Parliament in the few remaining weeks of the session. It would be better to keep them back than to find, in six or twelve months&#39; time, that we had consented to something which was mot in the best interests ofthe Commonwealth orof the States.. We ought togiveproper considerationto these matters. </para>

        <para>To-day I allowed the Government to introduce some Bills because I. wanted to see them. If Bills are to be turned out like sausages from a machine, it is necessary that weshould get them a day or two in advance,  so that we may Study them. There is sufficient business before the House to keep it occupied until next Christmas, if it attends to its work as it should. Yet we are told that legislation must be forced through, by means of the closure, in seven weeks. That can only be done by not giving proper consideration to the measures. Members of the Opposition will seize every opportunity to make their position clear to the people of Australia so that, if any wrong is done, the Government will have to take the full responsibility. The Opposition will not be to blame if unsatisfactory measures are forced through without proper discussion. There will be the Budget to consider in a month&#39;s time, and the Estimates, which will carry us on to July of next year, to pass. It is time members of the House put on their considering caps and asked themselves whether they ought to allow legislation to be passed in this manner. Supporters of the Government should ask themselves whether they do not owe a duty to their constituents, as well as to the Government. It is their responsibility, just as it is ours, to inquire into these matters, and not to accept blindly whatever the Government puts forward. I hope honorable members will see .the wisdom of bringing pressure to bear upon the Government to induce it to give more time for the consideration of measures to be submitted. </para>

          <para>.- As a member of this National Parliament, I am pleased to see that the two sections forming the Government are working together in harmony, and I hope the continued association of Ministers will rapidly bring about a more complete amalgamation of the two parties on this side of the Chamber. A useful programme of legislation is to be found in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, and if the policy of the Government proves acceptable to the two sections of their supporters, a closer unity should clearly be possible. In my opinion, there is no room for more than two parties in the political life of Australia. As the Labour party has definitely embraced the Red objective, and while there remains the possibility of the workers being misled by the promise of a heaven upon earth, I think minor differences of opinion on this side of the House might easily be set aside in the endeavour to open the eyes of the electors to the true position. </para>

        <para>The proposal to abolish dual income taxation has been given much prominence in the newspapers of the different States. Personally, I have yet to be convinced that the proposals of the Government will result in the reduction of taxation. </para>
        <para class="block">Representatives of the States appear to be under the impression that with the loss of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, and the interest on transferred properties, increased taxation will be necessary. Possibly the Treasurer may be able to tell the House why no mention has been made of certain loans which were issued free of taxation so far as the  States were concerned. Many investors are very anxious to learn whether the contract made with them will be kept, or whether the Commonwealth will make some arrangement with the &#39;States. I hope that on this and other important matters more information will be made available when the particular .proposals are brought before the House. </para>
        <para>Like many other honorable members, I have received a number of letters from the employees of the Taxation Department. They suggest that some scheme of compensation similar to that arranged for the employees of the Defence Department should be applied to them. It is quite apparent that not more than onethird of the present employees of the Department will be taken over by the States, and, undoubtedly, many cases of hardship will result. This is one of the problems which the Government must take into consideration. </para>
        <para>Probably the most important problem with which the Government has to deal at the present moment is that of immigration. This question has been debated from many platforms, and in every Parliament, for many years past. We are all familiar with the arguments. We are told that Australia abounds in empty spaces, and that there are 1,000,000,000 coloured people near us crying out for elbow room. It is a fact that until recently the immigration policy of Australia consisted in collecting the city workers of London, dumping them down in the capital cities of Australia, and leaving them to shift for themselves. </para>

            <para>- I am inclined to think that some improvement has been made; but I hold that, in the future, the Government must make better arrangements in Australia than they have made hitherto. The time has arrived for doing big. things in Australia. The bringing of carefully-selected men, women, and children to this country will do much to  solve the important problem of defence. I would rather spend&#39; money in schemes of water conservation and land settlement than in the purchase of guns and the building of warships, which so soon become obsolete. It ought to be clear to all thinking people that we should aim at getting 20,000,000 people in this country before talking seriously of spending money on guns and ships for the purpose of defending long reaches of coastline, which at the present time have not a single inhabitant. </para>

        <para>Can we claim that our soldier land settlement has been successful ? It is painfully true that we have had a large number of very expensive failures. Everybody will admit that the successful farmer can only be reared on the land, not in the city. It is too much to expect men to become successful farmers who, before the war, were working in factories, behind counters, or in offices. Those who are being brought from overseas will be handicapped to an even greater extent. From the experience gained in connexion with soldier land settlement, we should endeavour to establish training farms, and expect every applicant for land to put in a period of training on one of them, so that his suitability can be determined before we supply him with money or land. We must improve our methods of farming. The general opinion is that the dairying industry has been successful, but .the average yield per dairy cow in Australia is less than it is in New Zealand, and about half of that in Denmark. Our fruit industry is very indifferently carried on. The London cables recently notified the sale of 45,000 cases of tinned fruit, and the rejection of a similar number of cases because of inferior grading and packing. &#39; These matters require very careful investigation, so that increased land settlement will not result in huge disappointment and very heavy financial loss. If the policy to promote production is to be successful, the industrial unions of Australia must assist in the scheme to bring migrants here to take part in the development of our secondary industries. While the Labour party refuse to assist this branch of national development, it will be difficult to formulate a successful scheme. </para>
        <para>I congratulate the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> for his promptitude in officially visiting each of the States, and </para>
        <para class="block">I hope he will fulfil his promise to visit the coastal districts of Northern Queensland. He can then form an estimate of the possibilities of successful development of those splendid tracts of agricultural land. If it were possible for the people of the southern States to visit the sugar &#39; districts of Queensland, the growers there would not need to ask a second time for effective protection for their industry. The visitors would see for themselves what sugar production has done for both the State of Queensland aud the Commonwealth. &#34; When in Queensland, the Prime Minister made the statement that the Government would not discriminate between town and country or State and State. If the Prime Minister maintains that attitude, and is bold enough to brave the criticism of the southern States, he will give to the sugar industry the measure of protection to which it is justly entitled. </para>

            <para>- The proposals of the Government concerning the sugar industry are not worthy of a moment&#39;s consideration. The continuance of the existing embargo on black-grown sugar for a further period of two years is, at most, but an insurance to the Government against the loss of &#163;280,000.

          <para>In formulating its plans the Commonwealth Government have been faced with two important circumstances&#39;, which unavoidably dominated the situation : First, that there will be in Australia at the end of 30th June, 57,500 tons of Government sugar; second, that sugar alone of our primary industries has no outside market whereby this surplus could be sold by virtue of the fact that all com-, peting sugar is produced by black labour, which is paid wages far below the standard prevailing in Australia..... This dilemma can be escaped by the Commonwealth Government selling its surplus abroad, but that course would involve a loss of probably &#163;(! or &#163;7 per ton on 49,000 tons (the excess carry-over), equivalent to from &#163;240,000 to &#163;280,000. </para>

            <para>- The honorable, member can criticise my remarks when. he. speaiks, but there is no pointto his interjection. I. should like a renewal of the sugar agreement in a modified form, but the Government have definitely decided against it. While theGovernment refuse to renew the agreement, they are seeking, to enter into another agreement with the growers which is not acceptable. The price of sugar outside Australia, has advanced because of a world&#39;s shortage, and- it may happen that the aggressive attitude now adopted by the southern States against a. renewal of the agreement may be changed&#39; in a very short time to a demand that the Government make other terms with the growers. </para>

            <para>- A correspondenty writing to me, put the position in a nutshell, when he stated that the Government, in effect, says to the grower, &#34; We expect you to supply Australia with sugar more cheaply than it can be imported when the world&#39;s prices are high, and to compete against the cheap black-grown sugar when prices are abnormally low, with a duty only sufficient to. protect you when the price of sugar is normal. That statement describes appropriately the value- of the present sugar&#39; proposals of the Government. People in the southern Statesdo not seem to realize that the sugar industry is one of the most important activities of the people of Queensland, and one in which a great deal of labour is employed. Only by sugar-growing can theempty spaces of North Queensland be- permanently settled. I can readily imagine that the Government would cheerfully expend millionsof pounds if they were sure that a considerable population could be successfully settled in the Northern </para>

Queensland, and a number oflarge towns, and at is the clear duty of the Commonwealth to regard the sugar industry asa national one,and to endeavour to retain the population there.

The honorable, member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Seabrook)stated</inline> a few evenings ago that concessions had been madetoQueensland. Considering what the sugar industry has done for Amstr-alia compared with what the Commonwealth has done for the industry, ione  is forced to the conclusion that Chose engaged in it are entitled to much better treatment than they have so far received.

        <para class="block">Critics in the southern States pretend to encourage the industry when sugar prices outside Australia are high, but the industry needs a duty that will give the growers sufficient protection when prices abroad are low, because when prices are high the growers can take care of themselves. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> cannot think that Queensland has sufficient protection at present, oi else he would not consider the proposed embargo for two years necessary to enable &#39;him to dispose of the stocks of sugar at present on hand. The people of Queenslandare anxious to know whether their two representatives in theCabinet were consulted when the Government&#39;s proposals were recently announced. I cannot imagine that the Attorney-General (Mr.Groom) or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> agreed to the suggested conditions, and the electors in my State are asking whether these. Ministers willquietly submit to such an important matter being dealt with in the manner indicated. The industry does not ask to be pampered, but it desires the settlement of conditions over a period of years. Owing to interferences in the past, themill proprietors have felt unable- to make extensive alterations or add to their plant, because they have been quite at a loss to know what to expect in the course of twelve or eighteen months. Thesugar crop takes at least eighteen months to mature, and the suggested embargo of two years is practically of no use to the industry. It is quite possible that the growers, realizing that they have little option inthe matter, will accept the Government&#39;s proposal. Without an embargo or an increased import duty, the industry would soon become a thing of the past. People in the southern States should not think that the Queenslanders areonly humbugging them when they talk of the importance of keeping Australia white by stabilizing the sugar industry in North Queensland. </para>

        <para>Mr.FORDE (Capricornia) &#91;6.8&#93;.- I am glad to have the assurance of the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> that both parties on the Government side are now one. It is evident, in view of the proposals of the Government on the sugar question and on other questions appertaining tothe welfare of the man onthe land, that the Country party has been swallowed completely. It has no &#39; &#39; punch &#39;&#34;&#39; in the present Cabinet. A perusal of the policy on which many members of the alleged Country party won their seats shows clearly that a great number of the electors who had very little sympathy for the Nationalists were cajoled into voting for the Country party, believing that it was a separate party. These electors .were inclined to vote on the Labour side, hut certain candidates declared that they would have noticing whatever to do with the Nationalist party. They pointed out that, they were as strongly opposed to the Nationalists as were the Labour candidates, and that, if elected, they would be an independent group, prepared to fight for the interests of the men on the land. Owing to those representations numerous electors throughout Australia were cajoled into casting their votes in favour of the nominees of the so-called Country party. The fourteen points enunciated by it were no doubt drawn up with the authority and assistance of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> and they were published for the purpose of deceiving the farmers of Australia. We find that certain definite promises were made in those fourteen points. Here is one of them - </para>

          <para>The Assurance of stability of employment in the cities and towns is dependent upon pur-, chasing power created in the country. That purchasing power can best be secured by making primary production profitable by the establishment of  ia  Commonwealth Land Bank, with  a  system of co-operative and rural credits, as  an  integral part of the Savings Bank Department. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That was a definite promise made by the Country party to the people of Australia on the eve of the elections. Has any reference been made in the Government policy speeches, or by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> when speaking to-day, to the establishment of a Commonwealth Land. Bank? In the Governor-General&#39;s Speech there is no indication of the widening of the scope of the Commonwealth Bank, although we are told that the management of that institution is to be vested in a Board; indeed, it appears that the idea is to restrict the power of the Bank to compete against private banking institutions. When the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank was proposed by a Labour Government, and a Bill to that enid was before Parliament, honorable members then in Opposition bitterly opposed the idea on the ground that the pri- vate banking institutions were well able to carry on the banking business of the country. Personally, I believe that the scope of the Commonwealth Bank should be widened so as to provide for a rural credit system. The Australian farmers have very good security to offer in their productive lands, and a scheme is required to enable them to procure capital on reasonable terms so that they may not, in a period of depression, be harassed as they are to-day by the many exacting private banking institutions. A rural credit system on the lines of similar systems in America and Canada would perform a very useful function in this country. We have every right to expect the Government, which includes in its ranks men who call themselves Country party members, to bring such a scheme to fruition. .Rural credits in. America and Canada have altogether changed the very life of those countries; they have created prosperity where previously there was adversity, keeping at bay the usurer and speculator, and enabling the genuine farmers to obtain loans on the best possible terms. </para>

          <para>- That is what the Labour party aims at, and I ask the present Government to introduce a scheme of the kind. We do not want this matter to be put aside until Labour is in power; and if the Government introduces a scheme, I am certain honorable members on this side will support it, and further endeavour to improve any banking policy that will tend to help the majority of the agriculturists. We recognise that the successful farmer of to-day has to be more of a business man than his predecessor ; he must make improvements, and have the most up-to-date implements. I .greatly deplore the fact that the Government, although it promised, through certain candidates who are now members of the Ministry, to introduce a land bank or rural credit system, has foreshadowed no proposal of the kind in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. The Hughes Government some years ago was urged by Labour members to widen the scope of the Commonwealth Bank, so as to provide rural credits; but absolutely nothing was then done, because behind that Administration there were all the big banking institutions of Australia, which were, of course, averse to any competition. </para>

        <para class="block">I do nOt know whether that was meant to convey that the Country party stood for some rural organization for the men on the land. In Queensland the Labour Government has established such a scheme, and it is doing great work. Although that scheme is only in its infancy, it is confidently anticipated that it will improve the status of farmers generally, and help them to help themselves. Although there are country members in this composite Ministry they have done nothing whatever towards launching a rural organization scheme for the whole of Australia, or to assist the States in a work of the kind. Yet the effect of the promises made on the eve of the elections was that this would be done. One of our greatest problems is how to secure a large and virile population, and its solution, I believe, is to be found largely in the development of agriculture. It is recognised that all wealth springs from the land, and if we are to settle people in the remote parts of Australia we must be prepared to assist them in the initial stages. It was found in Queensland, and, indeed, all over Australia,&#34; that there were party political organizations exploiting the men on the land. These organizations were controlled by men who could not secure selection, as candidates under the Liberal or Nationalist banner, and who saw an opportunity to get into Parliament by forming primary producers&#39; organizations, and in working up some of the farmers into a frenzy against the Labour party and the existing Tory party. For a time in Queeusland these men did exploit certain sections of the farmers by such Tory organizations, but their weakness was found in the fact that Labour farmers, and also certain Conservative farmers, were against them. Then the Labour Government in Queensland introduced a rural organization scheme on non-party lines, embracing all sections of political thought and every producer in the country. The scheme is a great uplift to the men on the land. It is recognised that it will encourage co-operation, and teach the farmer the great power he can wield by organizing on industrial lines. Primary producers in- Queensland to-day realize that co-operation can reduce the difficulties arising from the fluctuation of markets, and keep down the charges which accumulate between the cow and the counter, between the field and the factory, and between the orchard and the dinner table. This  i3  what the Labour party is aiming at in the northern State to-day. A unified organization of farmers is the first important step towards the establishment of a rural credit system, and that is why Labour supports such a scheme. An organization of the kind could be called the Australian Producers Association. The Queensland organization is called the Queensland Producers Association. In brief, the scheme I propose for the whole of Australia provides for the establishment of a branch of the Australian Producers Association in each State by - (1) the formation of local producers&#39; associations in local centres and consisting of not fewer than fifteen primary producers; (2) the constitution of district councils by the&#39; election of representatives from local producers&#39; associations; (3) the constitution of a Council of Agriculture by the election of representatives from district councils. The association is to be open to every person engaged in the occupation of dairy farmer, wheat, maize, or cereal grower, sugar grower, cotton grower, fruit grower, grazing farmer, and general and mixed farmer. These embrace practically all the men engaged in primary production. The objects of the association should be the development of rural industries, the investigation of and dealing with problems relating to rural industries, the advising of agriculturists with regard to matters which require scientific knowledge, research work, the securing of effective action for the controlling of diseases and pests, the question of markets, and improved means of transport and other matters appertaining to the welfare of the man on the land. I recognise that these schemes should, if possible, be taken up by the various State Governments, but the Commonwealth Government could  work in co-operation with them, and assist .them in the initial stages. I would be prepared to support the placing upon the Estimates of a sum of money to enable the Commonwealth Government to assist such- a scheme to the extent of one-half the cost during the initial stages. The Queensland Government are paying the whole of the cost of the local scheme, for the first twelve months. In that State, we have local producers&#39; associations in each district discussing the grievances of the farmers in their respective&#39; localities. These local associations, have the. right to send a representative to the district council, and the district council has the- right to send a representative to the Central Council of Agriculture. In this way we have: established a veritable farmers? parliament, discussing the views and opinions of those engaged in primary industries in the different localities, and im a position to put before the Queensland Government practical propositions for the benefit of the man on the land. Such a scheme to be really effective* must be extended to1 every State- in Australia. Then, in addition to a Council of Agriculture in each State, we could have a Grand Council of Agriculture sitting in Melbourne, with access to- the Prime Minister and Federal Departments. If there were, such a grand&#39; council sitting in Melbourne at the .present time,. Queensland representatives would be expressing&#39; their indignation at the treatment meted out to the sugar-growers of their State by the Commonwealth Government. The rural organization scheme provides for the appointment of experts to assist tha men on the land, and in Queensland it is recognised by men engaged in rural industries who have been opposed to the present Government of that State-,, that the scheme enunciated by the Government represents the first constructive proposal ever put forward by any Government in the history of Australia to organize the men on the- land along nonparty lines, and furnish them with the machinery whereby they will be able to uplift themselves and secure- a larger share of profit from their labours. I find that, other countries in the world are interested in tha Queensland rural organization schemes. The Department of Agriculture at Ottawa, Canada, recently communi- cated with the Queensland Minister of Agriculture, asking for particulars of the scheme. The Canadian Commissioner mentioned that in Ottawa he had seen a book on the matter, and it had so stimulated his interest that he was writing for a copy for his own use. The rural industries of Australia, and amongst them the fruit industry, and the meat industry, have during recent years experienced very trying times, and any action which the Government can take for their assistance will tend to further development and progress in Australia. </para>

He, at least, has had the pluck to stand up for his opinions and give public expression to them. We know the feeling that animates many of the captains of great industries, the representatives of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and representatives of wealthy interests ever ready to exploit the people-. If they were able to do so they would reintroduce black labour into Australia as they did&#39; in the sugar industry before the influence and power of the Labour party were exerted, in the interest of Queensland and Australia generally, to prevent its continued use. </para>

            <para>- The Commonwealth Government&#39;s proposals in regard to the sugar industry will give no real security nor, indeed, any prospect of stability to those who are engaged in growing sugar. The price which has been fixed is far below the world&#39;s parity, and will cause a- loss of &#163;1,000,000 to the growers, on the present season&#39;s crop.

        <para class="block">The sugar industry should be regarded, not from the point of view of Queensland only. It is a question of national importance and it is just as well that the conditions which led to the making of the first sugar agreement should be. reviewed. It is closely bound up with the White Australia, policy. Previously the conditions under which theindustry was carried on were exceedingly bad. The growers were not making, a decent living, and they were not in a position to pay a: living wage to the. workers. In 1907-8, field labourers were paid. &#163;1 2s. 6d.. a week and keep in the off season, and &#163;1 5s. a, w.eek and keep in the crashing season,. These wages- were not sufficient to- enable a man to keep his wife and family.. In 1911,, the cane cutters asked for a. wage of 30s. a-. &#39; week of forty-eight hours, and were. -. forced, to declare a strike. On that, occasion the growers proved that, they could not afford to pay a living wage to the workers. It was demonstrated that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company had the growers, so much in their power that the latter were obliged to sweat their employees. On the 9th August, 1911, in an article commenting on the sugar industry,, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Colonial Sugar Refining Company controls the price which the consumer must pay for sugar. Then, seeing that the company fixes the price for raw sugar, the sugar monopoly also regulates the price paid to the cane-grower for <inline font-style="italic">hia</inline> raw material. Every stage of the industry, from the growing of the cane to the bagging of the finished article, is ordered and&#39; directed by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Its vice-like hold upon one of the necessities of human life is a- most striking example of commercial monopoly probably without a parallel in any part of the world. </para>

        <para class="block">Before a Labour Government <inline font-style="italic">came</inline> into power in Queensland the cane-growers were absolutely at the mercy of the Colonial Sugar Refining1 Company and the millers, and were obliged to accept whatever price the millers offered. In many instances cane inspectors passed through, the districts offering 10s. or 12s. a ton, or very little more, for the cane, and the growers had to take these prices or allow their cane to rot in the fields. When the Labour party came into power in Queensland it passed the Cane Prices Act Amendment Bill through the Queensland Parliament, under the provisions of which the growers and millers were represented on a Cane Prices Board, whose duty it was to see that there was paid to the grower a reasonable price which would enable him to pay a decent wage to his employees. However, recognising that even this was not sufficient, the Labour Government of Queensland took steps to bring about what is known as the first sugar agreement, and successfully sought the indorsement of the Commonwealth Government, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher. That first agreement, thus brought into existence by the Federal Government, acting in conjunction with the Queensland Labour Government, fixed the price of sugar at &#163;18 a toil - an increase of &#163;3 4s. per ton - but, in 191S, the growers were successful in having the agreement renewed with the price fixed at &#163;21 a ton. However, the increased cost of production, machinery, and everything else during the next two years necessitated a corresponding increase in the price of sugar, and the growers were successful in getting the price set out in the 1920 agreement increased to &#163;30 6s. 8d. a ton, due largely to the action of the Labour party in Queensland. The increase gave the industry a great fillip. It enabled the growers who, through bad seasons, had got behind, to recoup themselves to some extent. It caused a steady increase in the value of the crop which, last year, was &#163;9,000,000 as compared with &#163;1,500,000 in 1915, before Labour intervened on .behalf of the growers. There are 25,000 people employed annually in sugar operations. It is one of the greatest means of giving employment <inline font-style="italic">In</inline> Australia. From the southern States at least 4,000 workers proceed to Queensland each year to. obtain employment during the cutting season. The amount of capital invested is &#163;16,000,000. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Extension of time granted.&#93;</inline> Machinery valued at hundreds of thousands of pounds is supplied by the southern States to Queensland for operations connected with the sugar industry. Towns such as Bundaberg, Childers, Gin Gin, Mackay, Cairns, and many others depend almost solely on this industry. It is the bulwark of the White Australia policy. It would not be possible to populate the great north of Australia without it; indeed, it would be necessary for the Commonwealth to maintain a standing army there for the purpose of keeping out the black races. It has enabled the north to be settled. For example, the number of electors- in the Herbert division has increased by about 13,000 within the last eleven years. Without the sugar-growing industry we could not induce many people to lea ve the southern parts of Australia and settle in those districts where cane can be <inline font-style="italic">grown</inline> successfully by Australians. The sugar cane-growers are thus blazing the track for Australian settlement. For many years the pioneering work was done with little return. If given the opportunity, this industry will do a great deal more for Australia thanit has already done. </para>
        <para>I hope that supplies of raw sugar will be made available for the Millaquin Company at Bundaberg, which. employs a large number of men. I regret to say that this refinery, through not getting a reasonable supply of raw sugar, has recently had to dismiss fifty or sixty hands. The Nationalist and Country party members have tricked the sugar farmers. </para>
        <para>The sugar cane-growers were led to believe, that if they voted for Nationalist and Country party candidates at the last election the Commonwealth Government would see that the sugar agreement was renewed, or, failing this, that there would be an embargo on the importation of black-grown sugar. The ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. W. M.

Complimentary speeches -were made in regard to him, but he was dexterous enough in his utterances to do everything hut definitely promise the growers what they desired. He left them .hoping while he was hesitating. He said that the industry was ot great importance to Australia, and he would see that it received a fair deal. </para>

        <para>That at the end of the present term, in June next, the sugar agreement be discontinued. </para>
        <para class="block">The influential members of that Federation represent Flinders-lane and the big business interests of Australia. They have not at heart the interests of the struggling farmers. There .is nothing in common between them. They subscribe money to the funds of the National Federation, which financed the Nationalist candidates during the last election. At the next election Nationalists and Country party candidates will most likely go before the electors as one party, and all will draw their financial sustenance from the National Federation. Naturally, if the Federation pays the piper it will also call the tune. The Prime Minister is a Victorian ; his -name is Stanley Melbourne Bruce; he is Melbourne in sympathies as well as in name. I believe the former Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. W. M. Hughes)</inline> was more sympathetic to the sugar industry than is the gentleman who has succeeded him. </para>
        <para>A conference of growers discussed the position of the sugar industry in January, 1922, and submitted the following proposals to the Commonwealth Government. Firstly, that the existing sugar agreement be renewed, and, as an alternative, the following: - A Commonwealth Sugar Pool to be established for five years. The second resolution was only a machinery one, by which the sugar would be acquired, and also, made provision to include New South Wales sugar in the Pool. Resolutions 3 and 4 directly affected the Commonwealth, and read as follows : - </para>
        <para>While the Pool is in operation, the Commonwealth Government to prohibit the importation of black-grown sugar except so much as is required from time to time as determined by the Pool to make good any Australian shortage; this embargo to be applied subject to conditions stated in clause 4 relating to price to be charged to the consumers. </para>

        <para>During the currency of the Pool 1A refined sugar to be sold at such a price as will insure that the retail price of refined sugar to the consumer shall not exceed 4jd. per lb. in capital cities. </para>
        <para class="block">The growers asked for a continuance of the embargo on black-grown sugar for a period of five years, and guaranteed to supply consumers with sugar at 4|d. per lb., a reduction of 1 1/4d. on the price which had ruled since 1920. A deputation was sent, all the way from Queensland to wait on the Prime Minister in Melbourne. At first he said that no good purpose could be served by receiving them, but eventually he did so. The first request .was for a renewal of the agreement, which they had a right to expect, but it was turned down. The honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> said to-night that he personally was in favour of a renewal of the sugar agreement, but the honorable member and other Nationalist members had an opportunity in the last Parliament, when the Nationalist Government had a majority of only one over the combined numbers of the opposing parties, to force the Government to renew the sugar agreement. In failing to take action then the honorable member for Lilley, and every other Nationalist member from Queensland, betrayed the trust that had been reposed in them by their constituents. The fact must be borne in mind that there are in the present Cabinet two Queenslanders, in the persons of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> and it is, therefore, no wonder that the honorable member for Lilley says that it would be interesting to know whether .those Ministers indorsed the action of the Cabinet in rejecting the requests of the sugar-growers. If they had been true to the trust reposed in them by the people of Queensland, the sugar agreement would have been renewed, or, failing that, the alternative proposals adopted. In reply to the second proposal submitted by the deputation, the Prime Minister promised to give consideration to the matter. Three months have elapsed, and that delay has caused stagnation in the industry. There was a feeling of uncertainty; the growers did not know what to expect for their sugar, and one result has been that the establishment of the TullyRiver mill has been hindered. Settlement has been retarded. The foundry at Bundaberg has put off thirty men, because there was uncertainty as to what woTk would be offering; the mills were not renewing their machinery, and the outlook for the foundry was dull. Early in June the Prime Minister went to Queensland and made certain proposals, but by that time sugar in Java and Cuba had risen to &#163;28 10s. and &#163;30 per ton respectively. There was a shortage in the world&#39;s production of, approximately, 300,000 tons, due partly to the failure of the beet crop in Europe and partly to speculation in the worid&#39;s markets. &#39; The world&#39;s supplies had decreased, and the world&#39;s parity had correspondingly increased. The proposals put before the sugar industry by the Prime Minister in Brisbane, no doubt after the city organ had pealed forth for an hour,&#39; were for the continuation of the agreement for two years only - </para>

        <para>Mr.FORDE. - Yes. That offer was absolutely unfair.  His  offer to give the growers &#163;27 for one year, and to then appoint a tribunal to fix the price for subsequent years, with a maximum of &#163;27 per ton, was a &#34;heads I win, tails you lose&#34; proposition. The attitude of the sugar-growers has been most fair and reasonable, and naturally they are very dissatisfied with the treatment they have received. As an alternative to the Prime Minister&#39;s scheme, they asked for &#163;27 net at the mills for raw sugar, an agreement for two years instead of one, as offered by the Prime Minister, the embargo upon the importation of black-grown sugar to continue for three years instead of two years, and the appointment of a tribunal to determine the price for the third year. The representatives of the sugar-growers consider that their request is reasonable in view of the fact that world&#39;s parity is greatly in excess of &#163;30 6s. 8d. per ton, which price will obtain until the end of the present month. The opinion that the Commonwealth Government have not treated the sugar industry fairly is not the opinion of only those engaged in the industry.

The Government&#39;s proposals are for two years., &#39;but that is not enough. If, at the  end of that period, the industry is again to be the sport of chance, or worse, of politics, .which may be defined from the sugar-grower&#34;s viewpoint as- chance, with the dice loaded against the industry, then it .is certain that the prospects of the sugar districts will immediately be affected, and that expansion will definitely be checked. The inadequacy of the Government&#39;s proposals will best be appreciated by comparing them with the reasonable demand of the industry. </para>

        <para>The growers are most emphatic in their condemnation of the Commonwealth Government because they have in mind the fact that, during the period of Government control, the sugar industry saved Australia &#163;17,000,000. They know that during the last ten years the consumers of Australia have been provided with sugar at an average price of 4d. per lb., and that the people of England and France were compelled to pay as much as ls. 6d. per lb. In England to-day the people are paying 8 1/2d. per lb. for their sugar.

        <para>We know that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company does not want Government control; it desires the same freedom to control the sugar industry as the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said it possessed prior to the agreement in 1915. Just as the rack-renters, the profiteers, the speculators and the market-riggers do not want Government interference, so the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and those who desire to filch great profits from the sugar industry do not favour restriction of their actions by Government, control in any way. I maintain that the growers&#39; demand could have been acceded to without the consumers suffering any detriment. The price of &#163;27 per ton net could have been given for an extra year and  the sugar could have been sold to the into the figures and have found that it consumers at 4-Jd. per lb. I have gone could be done in this way: - </para>

          <graphic href="103331192306274_37_3.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para class="block">Therefore, it will be seen that  I have not  said something that I could not  prove.  Sugar should never have been sold at a higher price than 4Jd. per lb. if the Commonwealth Government had not bungled to the extent of importing 116,000 tons of sugar at prices ranging up to &#163;80 per ton, and averaging &#163;44 6s. 2d. - which was world&#39;s parity. Instead of selling that sugar to the consumers at the price at which they imported it, they reduced the price with a view to catching votes at a general election, and sold at less than half the price at which they  had  bought. They thus incurred  a  loss of &#163;4,000,000, which afterwards had to be made good by charging for local sugar the price of 6d; per lb. that led to all the opposition in the southern States. The price of sugar in Australia was 3d. per lb. up to 1915; it was 3|d. per lb. from January, 1916, to 26th January, 1920, and 6d. per lb. from that time until  recently,  when it was reduced to 5d. per lb.,  the  price at which it stands today.  The Government now propose  reducing it to 4&#163;d. per lb., a price at which it could have been sold since 1920, even though the Government had done the - fair thing and had acceded to the demands of the sugar-growers. Australian jam manufacturers got their sugar for &#163;26 12s., while British jam manufacturers had to pay &#163;48 10s. pelton. The sugar industry in Australia during the period of Government control saved the people of Australia &#163;17,000,000. Foreign raws, purchased from 1915 to ,1922 inclusive, totalled 475,947 tons, and the average rate per ton gross was &#163;37 19s. During the same period the Australian raws purchased totalled 1,412,000 tons, at an average price per ton gross of &#163;25 17s. lid. Had the whole of Australia&#39;s requirements in sugar been purchased on the world&#39;s market at world&#39;s parity Australia&#39;s sugar bill would have amounted to &#163;71,000,000 instead of &#163;54,000,000, inclusive of &#163;5,000,000 worth of foreign raws. The present proposals of the Commonwealth Government do not afford&#39; the  measure of protection which, is warranted; but the Queensland Premier and the officials of the Sugar Growers&#39; Association have decided that it will be better to have some measure of protection rather than have none at all. Even though the Commonwealth Government do not offer the protection which was really promised to the growers by the Government candidates at the election, the growers take the view,&#34; Under duress we must accept what we are offered rather than throw ourselves on the mercy of the Colonial Sugar Refining monopoly.&#34; In an interview which I gave to a representative of one of the Queensland newspapers, I said I thought it was better for the growers to accept the proposals with a view to liberalizing them later. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to bring before the notice of the Postmaster-General some matters which I think are worthy of his serious consideration. I have been requested by local municipal bodies to endeavour to obtain increased postal facilities for Hurlstone Park, portion of which has been added to my constituency. Apparently the Department is not prepared to consider favorably their suggestion that a post-office, which is very badly needed, should be erected in that populous suburb. A few years ago, when I passed through this neighbourhood, it consisted almost entirely of paddocks with habitations scattered here and there in what was then bush land. During the recent election campaign, when I had occasion frequently to travel through the district, I found that these paddocks were now covered with houses and handsome business premises; the trams had been extended, and several lines&#39; of motor buses were running out. Notwithstanding the recognition by these activities of the necessity for meeting the convenience of residents of this wonderfully rapidly settled new suburban district, the Department has not increased its postal facilities. At the request of the municipal council, I addressed a communication on the subject to the Postmaster-General some days ago, but so far have not had an acknowledgment. I understand that my friend, the honor able member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr),</inline> who represents the adjoining constituency, which also impinges upon this particular locality, has been in communication with the Department, but his representations have met with an unfavorable reception. The opportunity exists for the PostmasterGeneral to pursue a more progressive policy in regard to the extension of postal facilities, not only in suburban, but also in country districts. There is, I think, too much of a tendency to regard the Post Office as a commercial concern, that should be run on business lines in order to show a handsome profit. I do not regard the postal service in that light; it is a public utility which should assist the development of the country. So long as the Post Office can pay its way, I do not think it is necessary that &#39; it should be managed in such a way as will enable it to show a profit. I hope that this matter will receive more favorable consideration from the Postmaster-General than apparently it has received from some of the officials in the Department. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Another portion of my electorate - Marrickville - is badly in need of increased postal facilities. We have had there, for many years, a post-office, which proved adequate to the needs of the popution when it was built. At that time the population was only about one-third its present size. Notwithstanding the large increase which has taken place, and the fact that the district now contains a population of something like 42,000, compared with <inline font-style="italic">15,000</inline> when the postoffice was built, very little has been done towards increasing postal facilities. There is need for a post-office in Addisonroad., in the vicinity of Newell-street, a very thickly populated area of this important municipality. </para>
        <para>A matter which has been brought under my notice is a practice of the Department which requires business firms that receive large parcels of registered letters to sign a receipt for each individual letter. It appears to me to be a very cumbersome method. </para>

I do not know whether the Postmaster-General is aware of the fact that many business firms in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and other cities in Australia, which conduct a large quantity of local correspondence, have found it very much more profitable to engage a man to deliver their letters within the city areas. That practice has resulted in a big loss to the postal revenue, and I do not think it should be encouraged. I would like the Postmaster-General to look into the matter, and see whether some other arrangement can be made. </para>

The general feeling of the community, I am sure, is in favour of increasing invalid and old-age pensions at the earliest possible moment.

          <para>.- I desire, in the debate on this Supply Bill, which includes an item of expenditure in connexion with the New Hebrides, to suggest that the Government take action to improve the administration in those islands. Recently there appeared in one of the Victorian provincial newspapers a letter, written by theRev. F. J. Paton - the missionary maintained, by St. Andrew&#39;s Kirk, in the New Hebrides - dealing with the condition of the natives under the administration of the Con- . dominium. It is a matter of which the Government should take cognisance, and for the information &#39; ofhonorable members I shall read portion of the letter - </para>

        <para>A local Frenchman signed on a school woman against the wish of her husband for a year. This is allowed toy the French under the Condominium. A decent Frenchman working for this man complained to me that he was not able to sleep because his master&#39;s labourers were hunting the woman all night. He said:. &#34; It  is  not good for a school woman,&#34; and added: &#34;It may not be the woman&#39;s fault. Her master gave her to one of his employees, though her  Teal  husband is a school attender.&#34; The latter asked me what he could do, and I could only say, &#34;Nothing.&#34; You see, this Condominium allows it, and you in Australia allow the Condominium. The girl was then sent to another place along the coast, and this time a native fought a second Frenchman for her. This Frenchman, a drunken specimen, bolted, but last Sunday took her off as she was coming to service. They crossed a river naked. Even the lowest cannibal would not have done that. And she is a school girl. Can you not denounce those in the Commonwealth Parliamentwho allow this Condominium? Another girl working for this Frenchman was recruited near midnight on Ambrim, as she and others were shell-fishing with torches on the reef. Site was rseruited by a half-caste. She alleges that she was rushed by the boat crew and kidnapped. In any case, she has a husband on Ambrim, but the native that recruited her was rewarded with her. She was beaten by her mistress and ran away. Natives with loaded muskets hunted her and brought her back. Later she ran away, this time to the French magistrate at Port Sandwich, and pending  an  inquiry into her ill-treatment, she is held there under the care of the &#39; French  sisters, I think. One  of  our church members, recruited on a cutter whose captain is a pure- blooded native, a well-known scoundrel. How she got on board, no one knows.  Her  husband was not asked forconsent. This is illegal. I reported the matter, and the woman is now dead. No notice was taken of the report. Another school attender ran away to work for a Frenchman. He put her on board a cutter.  Her  husband refused consent. Later the French Resident interviewed the husband, and there is not a, shadow of doubt about the illegality. The woman is not returned. A third woman was recruited by a half-caste.  Her  husband, not being able to get her hack, went with her. But the recruiter has taken her for his wife <inline font-style="italic">pro tern,</inline> and she is round with him in the recruiting ship while the husband has to work on the plantation. These are about all the women who have been recruited here since the war, but multiply every other place where recruiting has been done, and you get a horrible result. And this is the Condominium you  in  Australia allow. In London they say  it  is purelya matter for Australia, as these islands, with their magnificent ports, are vital  to  her alone. </para>

They are settling in the group - a group_thai will support millions of them, and the White Australia policy will &#39;be a joke. They will simply own these islands by settling in thousands, if you delay. </para>
        <para class="block">We have&#39; a definite responsibility with regard to the treatment of these natives, and it should certainly be the duty of this Government to take the necessary steps to prevent drunken Frenchmen, or any other persons, from molesting women in the manner described by the writer of the letter which I have quoted. I hope that the Government will take prompt action. </para>
        <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce).,</inline> in his reply to the statements made by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> concerning the sale of the Commonwealth Woollen Mill at Geelong, charged honorable members on this side with insincerity and hypocrisy. We are just as sincere as the Prime Minister himself, or any other member of the Ministerial following. Our earnest desire is to do the right thing by the people of Australia. When the Woollen Mill was established, I, for one, cherished the hope that one day we would have distributed throughout the Commonwealth similar mills engaged in the manufacture of our own raw material. We are in a better position to do this than are the people of any other country. The Prime Minister also suggested that the honorable member for Yarra was using poison gas. As a matter of fact, every statement which he made can be verified from the official files. From 1916 to 1922 the Nationalist party have been using, not only poison gas, but politically they have poisoned wells and used dum dum bullets. If a man dares to say anything against them he is sent out of the country without the privilege of trial by jury. The charge, of using questionable methods is at their door, and not at the door of the Labour party. The Prime Minister has </para>

Warrnambool, Portland, and Port Fairy are among the finest harbors in Victoria, and when a State Government, owing to lack of funds, will not improve such harbors and protect them by breakwaters, it should be the duty of the Commonwealth Government to assist by contributing at least one-half of the necessary expenditure. </para>
        <para>The members of the Labour party are wrongly charged with doing everything possible to retard immigration. The honorable member for&#39; Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> said that he hoped, the day was not far distant when the trade union organizations in Australia would support the policy of the various Governments in the matter of immigration. The Labour party of Australia does not oppose immi- gration in certain circumstances. There are thousands of starving people inEngland, Scotland, Ireland, and elsewhere, and if this great young country can do anything to relieve their suffering and misery, it is our duty to assist them to come here. The Government, however, are not acting fairly to these people. Our opposition to the present policy is based on the  fact that the Government are encouraging thousands of young men and women to come to Australia, and, twentyfour hours after they land, are throwing them on their own resources to find work wherever they can when thousands of our own men and women are unable to find remunerative employment. It was reported in the press of Saturday last that a number of returned soldiers were sleeping in the SydneyDomain, and were receiving some help from a hostel controlled by the Anglican Church. When the Government unlock large areas of country,at present not available for settlement, and find employment for men and women seeking it,the members of . the Labour party will welcome settlers from overseas. A large number of German settlers in Australia are anxious to bring their relatives , and friends to the Commonwealth, but a National Government, in 1920, two years after the signing of the Armistice, passed an Act prohibiting Germans coming to Australia until 1925. Great Britain is trading with Germany, and we are doing the same, notwithstanding that the ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said that we would never again do so-. Prior to the war the Germans were good customers of ours, and as we are willing to dp business with them, is there any reason why they should not be admitted to the Commonwealth? Many of those who pioneered South Australia and the Wimmera District in Victoria were members of that cultured race, . and they have undoubtedly proved themselves to be good Australian citizens. Hundreds of young Germans who desire to migrate are going to Canada and America, and the Government should  seriously consider the desirableness of allowing them to enter Australia. Germany was our principal enemy during the recent great conflict, but just as she has been on our side before, so she may assist us in the future. Scotland and England have opposed each other, but are friends to-day. I trust that we have seen the last of great international conflicts, and that England and Germany will now be friends. </para>
        <para>I hope the policy of the Government to appoint a composite tribunal for the settlement of industrial disputes will not be pursued, because we are justly proud of having blazed the trail in the settlement of industrial disputes by compulsory arbitration. Prior to 1907 the great pastoral industry in Australia was always in a state of turmoil, but in consequence of compulsory arbitration, for which the Labour party was largely responsible, that great and important industry has since worked under peaceful conditions. I do not think any country can produce the industrial results that we can. This happy position has been brought about in consequence of our strict adherence to the principle of compulsory arbitration. No country has fewer strikes than Australia, and although America boasts of her freedom, the American people work longer hours than those of any other nation. The conditions here compare favorably, with those of any other country. </para>

        <para>I do this as an intimation to the Government that it is the desire of this House that provision should be made in this vote for the payment of increased old-age and invalid pensions, and that such increased pensions be paid as from the 1st July, 1923. Instead of proceeding with the numerous Bills concerning which notice has been given, the Government shouldimmediately introduce a measure to give effect to their promise to increase these pensions, because they must realize that a large number of people in Australia are  suffering in consequence of the meagre allowance they are now receiving. Hundreds of people do not know how to get their next meal. When poor people get an increase in wages, the rent-lords seize it as rents, and as soon as the poor old-ago pensioners receive an increase in their pensions, the rent-lords will thieve it, as they have done in the past. Something should be done to control those people who rent to old-age pensioners, at 4s., 5s., or 6s. a week, dirty hovels in which no one should be allowed to live. These poor old people, who have pioneered this country, ought not to have their money extracted from them in this way. They are entitled to all they are receiving, and. the action of the rentlords is an outrage and a disgrace. The principle is wrong, and I hope the Government will do something to clip the wings of these rapacious individuals who are robbing the poor. </para>

          <para>.- It is absurd for the. Opposition to propose an amendment providing for increased invalid and old-age pensions when the Government has already made a definite statement that it is the wish and intention ofthis party that an increase should be made in the old-age pensions. </para>

        <para>I intend to deal with three or four other matters which I consider important, and I hope the Ministry will take note of my remarks. The first relates to the sugar industry, which is very important to Queensland and the Commonwealth. When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> was in my electorate I went into the matter very thoroughly with him, and tried very hard to obtain something better than he has now notified the sugar-growers will be granted. I understand that after the conversation I had with him some improvement was made in the schemer, but I regret that it did not go far enough. I -should have dealt with this question earlier but for the fact that a conference of growers, manufacturers, and representatives of the Queensland Government was sitting in Brisbane, and to-day we were to be informed whether the Prime, Minister&#39;s offer would be accepted. I have many telegrams from people in my electorate asking me to oppose the offer, and endeavour to secure an amendment of it in the direction already suggested by me to the Prime Minister when he was in Queensland. </para>
        <para class="block">My request was that he should make the embargo for four, instead of two, crops. An agreement for two crops would apply to the crop now about to be harvested, and next year&#39;s crop. The price of sugar overseas will be greater than the price the growers will have to accept for these two crops. The world&#39;s parity to-day is higher than the price the Prime Minister is offering, and there is every prospect of that condition continuing for at least another twelve months. It is reasonable and equitable that the growers should be granted an extension of the agreement for four years at the same rate as is proposed for two years. This important industry would, I think, have been sufficiently stabilised if Parliament had accepted the suggestion made by the Nationalist party for a protective duty of &#163;14 per ton. The proposal was rejected, and a duty of &#163;9 6s. 8d. imposed. A duty of &#163;14 per ton would&#34; have stabilized the industry; in some circumstances a duty of &#163;9 6s. 8d. cannot do it. The people of the Commonwealth are under an obligation to the sugar industry for settling a white population . along the immense coast-line of Queensland - a coast which could not be settled in any other way. It is absolutely essential, in view of our White Australia policy, that we should have sufficient white men on that coast to assist, at any rate, in protecting us from the importation of a coloured race. We should not lose sight of the fact that the League of Nations would not allow the Commonwealth of Australia to continue to hold the enormous territory it now occupies with a mere handful of 6,000,000 people. The Commonwealth&#39; is larger than the United States, where there are 112,000,000 people. We know that strong appeals have been made to the League of Nations, urging that it is not fair that the Commonwealth of Australia should hold such a vast territory, and- yet not allow the enormous surplus populations of other countries to enter. </para>

We do not want to HH an industry which is employing a large number of men and paying enormous amounts in wages. It should be encouraged, instead of being hampered. During the crushing season, no fewer than 4,000 or 5,000 men go from the southern States to work in the industry in Queensland. The Courts in that State recently decided that these men should be paid a higher wage than other workers, because they have to travel from and return to the southern , States, and have to wait a little time before the crushing commences. That extra cost is paid by the cane-growers. I do not think a four years&#39; agreement would inflict any injustice upon the consumers. After the Government has sold the surplus sugar which has been accumulated because of the amount of black-grown sugar imported at a very high price, it will be able for four years to supply the consumer in Australia at from 4 1/2d. to 4&#163;d. per lb. Further, the industry would be so stabilized that the people who would purchase sugar for the purposes of manufacture, whether for local consumption or export, would know exactly where they stood. Sugar used for export is sold at world&#39;s parity; thus everything possible is done to protect the secondary industries using sugar, and the primary industries con connected with them. I sincerely hope that the Government will not take advantage of the fact that probably a majority of the sugar organizations of Queensland will consent, under pressure, to accept the proposed agreement, because there is insufficient time before the taking off of the crop to make arrangements for financing the crude sugar factories. These factories, unfortunately, are not now in a position to produce a mill white sugar, which, I believe, could be sold in large quantities. There is not time for them to arrange to produce that class of sugar in the present season, and they are thus under a great disability. There is no doubt that if the growers and crude sugar manufacturers of Queensland accept the agreement it will be because of difficulties connected with finance, and because they will be unable without the agreement to carry on successfully during the next twelve months. The sugar industry is different from every other industry in Austrafia in that it is dependent upon protection against the sugar grown by black labour in other parts of the world. Cane sugar is not produced in any other part of the world except by black labour. The sugar industry is unlike any other industry. Honorable members often attempt to compare various industries with the sugar industry of Queensland, but they forget that when the States decided on Federation, black labourers from the Islands who were engaged in the industry received only &#163;6 a year, were well clothed and well fed, and at the end of three years were returned to their native homes. The abolition of black labour was agreed to . so as to help the White Australia policy, and the promise was made that this industry should be protected right up to the hilt. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member has not sense enough to call a man by his right name. It was stated in this House to-day that the Government should establish a sugar refinery. The Royal Commission on the sugar industry considered this aspect, but found that it would be impossible for such a refinery to compete with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. One honorable member to-night mentioned the Millaquin Mill, at Bundaberg. When I represented that district I succeeded in getting sugar from the north sent to this refinery for milling, but the manager would not take the balance of the sugar which arrived after the factory had been closed down, because, as ha said, it would not pay the mill to carry on at such a small price. I pointed out that he was getting 6s. a ton more than the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, but he still contended that it would not pay him. I asked him why it paid the Colonial Sugar Refining Company,, and he stated that its overhead charges were spread over an enormous output, and, in consequence, it could produce the sugar at a much cheaper rate than any other refinery. The members of the Sugar Commission obtained similar information, and further stated that the grower received from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in most instances a higher price than was paid by any other mills, including the Central. Mills. They instanced the districts in which higher prices were given by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I mention this because of the absurd notions that I am connected with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I have no reason to advocate its interests except in justice; it is quite capable of taking care of itself. Honorable members opposite should state what is true, and not place on the records of the country statements which are absolutely inaccurate. I sincerely hope, in common justice, that the Agreement will be extended to four years. </para>

        <para>An alteration in postal rates has been mooted, the proposal being to reduce the charge from 2d. to either 1&#189;d. or1d. in the principal cities. I was a member of two conferences of the Chambers of Commerce, which were held respectively in Tasmania and Queensland within the last fourteen months. The reduction of postal rates was mentioned, and it was pointed out that before any appeal was made to the Postmaster-General, adequate arrangements should be made to grant all necessary conveniences to the man on the land, especially the man out west, who has very few advantages. It has been urged that our first duty is to encourage people to migrate to Australia and settle on the land, and, speaking as a merchant, I would pay an extra postal charge rather than deprive the man on the land of any (conveniences to which he is justly entitled. </para>

          <para>With reference to the question of the importation into Victoria and South Australia from Queensland of fat cattle, it has been ascertained that, under the regulations of the Victorian Stock Diseases Act, the importation of fat cattle is not permitted unless the owner can certify that the stock are free from ticks or Texas fever, and that, for the six (6) months next preceding the date of the declaration, the stock have not been in direct or indirect contact with stock so affected. </para>
          <para>There are other requirements, hut these are sufficient to indicate that carriage by sea from Queensland is not permitted, in as much as the coastal districts are all tick infested and the Victorian State authorities do not recognise the possibility of givingthe declaration as above in respect of any cattle which have travelled through the coastal districts of Queensland. </para>
          <para>On the other hand, with respect to the importation of carcasses or of meat, the following is the regulation prescribed by the State Government of Victoria under the Health Act:- </para>
          <para class="block">In the case of any carcass or meat imported from outside Victoria which has been certified as wholesome by an inspector appointed for that purpose by the Government of the State or country from which it has been exported, the person importing such carcass or meat shall produce the certificate of wholesomeness to the municipal authorities into whose district such carcass or meat has been brought for sale or disposal, and a meat inspector shall examine it and if satisfied that such carcass or meat is wholesome shall brand it in accordance with the provisions of Schedule (2) to these Regulations with  regard to imported meat. </para>

        <para class="block">Honorable members who represent Victorian electorates should join in making arrangements with the Victorian Government whereby the consumer in Melbourne and elsewhere in this State would be able to obtain meat from Queensland at a reasonable price instead of paying1s. 2d. or more per lb. The danger from tick could be obviated by dipping the stock prior to embarkation. If cattle were landed at some isolated point on the harbor, and slaughtered, there would be no more danger to the public than in admitting the hides of cattle that have been affected by tick. If the cattlecould not be brought in alive on account of regulations, at least an arrangement could be made to convey chilled meat directly to Melbourne by a special steamer from one of the northern ports of Queensland. The people could then be supplied with meat of the best quality at the lowest possible figure, and at a price far below that charged for New Zealand meat. I hope that honorable members who are particularly interested in Victoria will move in this direction, and endeavour to help the poor to whom they so often refer, and also help their fellow beings in another part of the Commonwealth, who are raising cattle under adverse circumstances as to price, and Commonwealth steamers, now idle, could be used for transport. </para>

            <para>- It is a Victorian matter, and I am appealing to the Commonwealth Government to arrange for steamers to take delivery of chilled meat in Queensland, although my contention is that it could be treated far more cheaply in Victoria than in Queensland. Moreover, there is not as much risk to navigation between Queensland and Victoria as there is between New Zealand and Australia. It is&#39; an anomalous position to be paying&#188;d. lb. as a bonus on the export of meat from one part of the Commonwealth, while in another part meat is being imported from&#39; New Zealand, necessitating the sending of ready money out of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- It seems to me that, whilst the honorable member pretends to plead especially for the interests of the cane-growers of Queensland, his uppermost thought is consideration for that wealthy company. He takes the stand that the promise of&#34; protection for the sugar industry was one of the inducements which led to Queensland entering the Federation. That may he so; and I desire to say, as a South Australian, that. Queensland ought to he grateful that that promise has been more faithfully observed than the undertaking entered into with my State regarding the construction of the North-South railway, when the Northern Territory was handed over to the Commonwealth. So far, that pledge remains practically unredeemed in any particular. Furthermore, we have the spectacle of those honorable members behind Queensland interests doing their best to see that the agreement with South Australia is not carried out. I did not rise to speak on the subject of sugar. I am -much more concerned about the amendment of the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McNeill),</inline> who has moved for a reduction of the item by <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> as an intimation to the Government that the Committee desires that the promised increase of the invalid and old-age pensions shall take effect as from the 1st July next. If, in the next seven weeks, we are to pass the Estimates and the fourteen Bills of which notice has been given, I am afraid that the old-age pensioners&#39; increase will be among the &#34; slaughtered innocents.&#34; </para>

            <para>- I am glad to have that assurance from the Minister. He has advocated the granting of the increase on many occasions, and I would be exceedingly disappointed if the proposal were dropped owing to the curtailment of the session. Seeing that notice has already been given of no less than fourteen Bills, why has .the measure relating to the pensions &#39;been omitted? In the GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech it was definitely stated that the pensions would be liberalized. </para>

            <para>- I am glad to know that. &#91; heard the remarks on the subject to-day by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> and I hope he will keep his word; but it is possible to tell part of the truth and not the whole of it. In the case of the exPrime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> honorable members on this side were accustomed to look beyond his actual words.  Are we to understand that the reason why the Government have not brought down their old-age pensions proposals before now is that they desire to ascertain the exact financial position, in order that they may be able to give the last penny to these needy people? I wish that were the only reason. The concluding observation of the Prime Minister, like the postscript to a lady&#39;s letter, contained the. sting. He said lie hoped honorable members would allow the measures on the notice-paper to he disposed of so that, the Bill relating to old-age pensions could be brought forward. It seems to me that by keeping hack this Bill the Prime Minister wishes to hold a whip over the heads of the Opposition, and to have the Victorian press charging us with blocking legislation, and thereby preventing the granting of increased .pensions to the aged and infirm. The- amendment of the honorable member for Wannon seeks to eliminate such a possibility. It fixes a definite date for the payment of the increase, and brings honorable members opposite up to the collar. Speaking for myself - and, I think, also for the Labour party - I would he quite satisfied to actcept to-day such an increase as the financial position as now known would justify. I understand the Labour party sufficiently well to he able to state with confidence that the lips of honorable members on this side cannot be closed on the other measures to be brought forward by simply holding a whip over ns in the shape of a suggestion that by discussing them we shall delay the passage of the measure dealing with pensions. It is not the fault of our party that we are brought here for only three months in -the year. Honorable members are paid to attend Parliament as often as required, and df the Government limit the session to three months the blame for neglect -of the pensioners&#39; interests cannot he placed on the Opposition. One honorable member stated that if we had the opportunity we would agree to the measure&#34; in halfanhour, hut the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> wisely pointed out that he would not commit himself until he had seen what the Bill contained. If the Government bring down a measure to remove the present anomalies in connexion with the pensions, I feel sure that every honorable . member on this side of the House will assist to make it law. While listening to the speech of the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. DuncanHughes)</inline> I particularly noted his statement that he was not in favour of an increase in the old-age pension. Few members on the other side of the House have spoken at all this session, and there may be others who are opposed to the increase. Is this straw floating on the water an indication of the direction of the current beneath the surface? </para>

            <para>- We have many &#34; true blue&#34; Conservatives in South Australia. We have there a prominent advocate of black labour, but we have good things as well as bad. The honorable member for Boothby appears to be kindly hearted, and is possessed of such a mild and gentlemanly manner that it shocked me greatly when he said he was opposed to an increase in the pensions. When asked by way of an interjection from this side of the House to state the reason for his attitude, he gave only one reason, andthe essence of it was that it would mean increased taxation. He remarked that Parliament was the trustee of the people&#39;s money, and that we had no right in the present financial situation to sanction any increase. No right! I have endeavoured to ascertain the extent of the honorable member&#39;s income, and - although I am open to correction - I make bold to say that, while an old-age pensioner receives 15s. per week, the honorable member draws an amount much over &#163;15 a week. He does not have to manage even on &#163;15 a week, which is less than his parliamentary salary, and I was pained to hear an honorable member, who is at any rate wealthy, say that Parliament has no right to grant an increase to the pensioners. What is Parliament for? It has many duties, and one of these is to hold the scales of justice evenly. If it is found that one section of the community is benefiting too greatly at the expense of another, Parliament should remedy the wrong. </para>

            <para>- With my experience, of even only this day, I should be one of the last to say that; but that is, undoubtedly, the duty of Parliament. There is not an honorable member present but who will admit that most of the old-age pensioners have been the pioneers of this country, and that, as a result of their labours, profits have been made by many others, and means thus provided for the payment of taxation. This money, of course, may not come directly from these old-age pensioners, but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has said, in the end all taxation filters right down through the different strata of society until it reaches the manual labourer. There is a great deal of truth in that view, and much of the revenue from taxationHas, in that way, indirectly come from those who are now drawing pensions. There are on the Government side others besides the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes)</inline> who are against any increase of old-age pensions ; but to that honorable member and those of like mind, I should like now to repeat an illustration that I have previously presented to my own constituents. In this illustration I use my own case as, perhaps, the fairest to take under the circumstances. I do not smoke, and it is possible that there are people who would say that I am too mean to do so. I do not drink strong drink, and that is, perhaps, why I am not sufficiently interested in the measures relating to beer and spirits to desire them to be introduced beforewe deal with old-age and invalid pensions. I neither drink nor smoke, because I like to do as I choose, allowing every other man the same right. If a man chooses to smoke and drink, let him do so; it is his business. Now, let us suppose that my brother both drinks and smokes, and he spends his money in that way, while I save. Let us further suppose that we both live to the age of 65 or 70; it is probable that, through being careful,&#39; I do not need an old-age pension, whereas my brother may require such assistance. But the point is that, owing to the heavy duties on tobacco and liquors, my brother will probably have paid considerably more money than 1 have into the revenue of the country, and to an extent may be regarded as more entitled to a pension than I. T do not wish it to be understood that I am advocating a spendthrift life. I believe in a man being thrifty, though I know that that is opposed to the ideas of some people. Under the circumstances, when I hear an honorable member say that Parliament has no right to increase oldage pensions, I have to join issue with him at once. What is the honorable member for Boothby afraid of? In Australia there are eight very wealthy men, and three out of the eight are in South Australia, and each pays income tax on over &#163;100,000 per annum. If, by the imposition of extra taxation, I can drag a portion of those incomes from their possessors, for the purpose of increasing the pensions to those who have assisted in creating the wealth of this country, have I, as a mem. bar of Parliament, no right to do so? I deny the force of any such claim; and it annoys me when 1 hear it made by those in &#34; soft &#34; places - by those who are wealthy - not because they have created the wealth, but because they have inherited it. I at once rise in the defence of the old-age pensioners when I find a man with inherited wealth unwilling to afford the old people an additional ls. or 2s. 6d. &#34;per week. The honorable member for Boothby told us that, in this connexion, he was- looking to the future, and he could see the time, perhaps one hundred years hence, when the population of this country would be 50,000,000, and we should be faced with an annual expenditure&#39; on old-age pensions of &#163;50,000,000. But what is the difference between 5,500,000 people paying &#163;5,500,000 in pensions, and a population of 50,000,000 paying &#163;50,000,000 a year? There is no difference whatever, so that the honorable member .really cuts the ground from underneath his feet. </para>

        <para>There is another point in regard to old-age pensions which I desire to emphasize, and to which I draw the especial attention of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden).</inline> I have repeatedly heard that honorable gentleman on the floor of the House urge the&#39; Government to do justice to the old-age pensioners in some of our State institutions j and I presume that, like myself, he has one of these institutions- within his constituency. I have approached the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle</inline></para>
        <para class="block">Page) in the matter, but have obtained no satisfaction, though I hope that when we have the promised &#39;announcement we shall hear something is to be done. I have repeatedly urged that there is no reason why an old-age pensioner in a State institution should be differently treated from an old-age pensioner in a Roman Catholic or a Salvation Army home; and I think that the position I take up is a fair one. An, old man may come down from the back-blocks, and enter a State institution. If he does so before he applies and obtains a pension, it is no <inline font-style="italic">use</inline> his applying for a pension afterwards unless he leaves the institution permanently. Many of the old folic do not know of this regulation, and when they go into a State institution, not having previously obtained a pension, they may find 200 or 300 other inmates receiving their 2s. a week, simply owing to the fact that they had secured their oldage pension before entering. If an old man, already a pensioner, &#39;enters a State home&#39; the Commonwealth Government pay the State Government concerned 10s. 6d. a week on his account, and the pensioner is allowed 2s. a week for himself. An old man who, under the circumstances . I have outlined, find&#39;s himself cut off from the small allowance, may leave the institution, and get some friends to look after him while he applies for the pension. But if he obtains a pension and then returns to the institution, he is denied any money and finds himself in a different class altogether from the other inmates. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Gardiner, the  Deputy  Commissioner of Pensions in South Australia, has written me the following : - </para>

        <para>The time is &#34; rotten-ripe &#34; for such a ruling to be over-ruled, and I hope the Treasurer will take the matter in hand, because there is a distinct injustice, which could be removed at- no great expense to the country. What is the difference between an aged person in a Salvation Army or a Roman Catholic home - the authorities of which take care that he obtains a pension after entering - and an aged person in a State institution? </para>
        <para class="block">There is no difference whatever, and I can only hope that the position does not arise through any miserable quarrel between the Federal Government and the State Governments as to their respective duties to the old people. I have been patiently handling this matter for months, and if I cannot get support from any other, member of the Government, I do look for it from the Minister for Defence, in view of the claims he has made on behalf of the pensioners in the past. The time has now arrived when, I understand, we are to be &#34; gagged,&#34; and, therefore, I shall resume my seat. </para>

          <para>.- I submit that a wrong impression will be created unless something is said in regard to a matter that has been debated tonight. As for the amendment, I take it that it has been moved for one purpose, and one purpose only, namely, to embarrass the Government. We have a distinct promise from the Government in regard to the matter, and those who are in favour of increased invalid and old-age pensions are prepared to accept that promise. </para>

        <para>As to any proposal to place an embargo on sugar, I think I can say that the majority of honorable members on this side are against any such idea; indeed, I believe that a majority of even Queensland representatives are opposed to it. We are all ready to treat Queensland fairly, and, after a thorough examination, give a fair duty. I wish it to be clearly understood that if the Government propose to place an embargo on sugar, even for one year, and which I, for one, will not support, the position must be clearly defined, as it affects the fruit-growers throughout the States. The Western Australian people will wish to know whether they are to have sugar at the same price as the people of Sydney, in view of the &#163;2 10s. per ton freight to the western State, and how the export parity is to be arranged. All these questions must be considered by the Government before any proposal for an embargo is submitted. An enormous number of people in Australia are interested in the fruit industry. The answers given to questions I asked on the subject only recently showed that there has been a great increase in the cost of production of jams and fruits, and unless we are very careful about what we are doing in this matter we shall destroy one of the biggest industries in the country. From the discussion which has taken place here to-night one might assume that a majority of honorable members on this side are in favour of an embargo on the importation of sugar, and I have risen merely to say that so far as I am concerned, unless care is taken to protect the interests of other producers than those who grow sugar, there will be very decided antagonism to any embargo or any further concessions. </para>

            <para>- The amount proposed to be appropriated, as I pointed out to-day, is barely sufficient to cover the salaries of the public servants of the country. If it is also to include the amount necessary for the increase of oldage pensions the message must be withdrawn and a new message of appropriation from the Governor-General must be brought up. That would involve a delay of at least another day. The Prime Minister has stated the position of the Government? with regard to old-age pensions in such a way as to leave no room for doubt as to their intention. The increase of the pensions has been deliberately promised by the Government in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. The amount required for the purpose will be incorporated in the Budget, and the necessary measure to bring the proposed increase into operation will be introduced immediately the Budget is presented. The Government desire that the increase of old-age pensions should be dealt with in a considered way, in order that any increase decided upon may be permanent. They desire also to remove the anomalies which have arisen under the existing legislation, and to which the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> referred so eloquently. </para>

            <para>- The old people appreciate what is being done for them. If a policy of waste and squander is adopted, as advocated by the Labour party, whilst it may be possible to increase the pensions this year the increase may not be continued next year. We have to consider the ways and means necessary to effect our purpose, and we are proposing to deal with this question in such a way that we shall be able to continue the payment of the pensions at an increased rate. In a matter of this kind we must look to the future, and I ask who would be the first to go short should a financial calamity happen in this country ? Hon- orable members opposite would bring forward a measure without consideration. They would submit it almost as a bait to a dog instead of as a measure of justice to the people who pioneered this country. </para>

            <para>- I think I am entitled to reply when a personal interjection is made from the other side. When I have had an opportunity to assist the sick poor I have always made full use of it. If we do not give proper consideration to this matter, we may find ourselves unable to continue the payment of any increase in these pensions which we may decide upon now. I&#39; should like to know why members of the Opposition should arrogate to themselves the right to speak on this matter all the time. Who introduced the measure for the payment of old-age pensions in the first instance? I think it should be put on record that the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> had more to do than any other man in the Commonwealth with the introduction of old-age pensions. He was associated with the question in New South Wales, and was  Chairman  of the Royal Commission whose report made the payment of these pensions a live issue in this Parliament. He was, further, a member of the Commonwealth Government who introduced the first Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. Since that time, what increases in these pensions have been made? There were two such increases. One was made by a Labour </para>

We hear a great deal of talk from honorable members opposite on this subject, but the party to. which they belong was in office for many years before they made any move in the direction of increasing the old-age pension. I give every member of this House credit for being anxious to see justice done to the aged people in this country. </para>

            <para>- Whether it is bad policy to say so or not, I believe it is true that every member of the House is anxious to do the best he can for the aged poor of the country. Honorable members on both sides, quite irrespective of party considerations, have been persistent in requests for the removal of anomalies under the Act, and for an increase in the pension. I regret that any attempt should be made to make this a party matter. . The intention of the Government to increase the old-age pension is . mentioned in the Governor-General&#39;s Opening Speech, and the measure to give effect to that intention will be proceeded with immediately the Budget is presented to this House. The amendment before the Committee will not help us at all. Its effect, if carried, can only be to delay the introduction of the measure by the Government: </para>

            <para>- Surely it is in order to pass a few complimentary remarks upon the gentleman who has preceded me, especially in return for the compliments he has passed upon members of the Opposition. I intend to say but a few words most complimentary to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> Ifthe honorable gentleman would only take a few lessons from his chief in diplomacy, culture, and good manners, he would get on better. All that he appears to be able to do is to shake a red rag at a bull. He cannot hope to expedite the business of the Government in that way. I am prepared to agree that the Treasurer in his lifetime has given a great deal away to the poor, but what he has given away is nothing to the millions I have given away. I cannot allow the honorable gentleman to take advantage of this occasion to refer to his generosity and good qualities without directing attention to the very fact that my poverty to-day is wholly the result of . what I have given away to the world at large. The Treasurer has tried to teach the members of the Opposition their duty. Permit me to tell him that we do not want any lessons from him as to our duty. Honorable members opposite would not take instructions from the Opposition as to their duty. They will carry out their duties, as the Prime Minister has said, in the manner they think best, and we on this side will conduct the business of the Opposition as we think best. Wo never impute motives to the Government, except occasionally, nor do we admit them ourselves. The Treasurer has told us what the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Austin Chapman)</inline> has done. He will permit me to advertise the fact that the reason why a certain Government brought the old-age pensions legislation into existence was because they were compelled to do so. The action taken was not of their own volition, but because they were dependent for their continued existence as a Government upon the votes of members of the party on this side of the House. In like manner the present Government do things because they are dependent on the votes of a certain number of honorable gentlemen sitting in the Corner. They protest that they propose to pay increased old-age pensions. We promptly say, &#34;Do it now,&#34; but they say, &#34; No, it is not time to do so,&#34; to which our reply is, &#34; The time should be from 1st July next.&#34; The Treasurer says that he has not made provision for it in this Supply Bill. Who has prevented him from making the necessary provision in this Bill ? Our amendment is merely &#34; putting the acid &#34; on him by declaring that if he means what he says he must make the necessary provision in this Bill. As a matter of fact, if the &#163;4,500,000 provided in this measure is only for the payment of the salaries of certain public servants, it is ample demonstration of the fact that the Government propose to postpone until the latest possible date the fulfilment of their promise to pay increased pensions, and is likewise the fullest justification for the amendment of the honorable member for Wannou. What is the duty of an Opposition if it is not to take every opportunity of drawing public attention to the shortcomings of a Government in matters of this sort ? </para>

            <para>- It is also the right of an Opposition to take every advantage that political warfare affords to put the acid test on this Government for the purpose of ascertaining clearly when it proposes to carry out its promise to the oldage pensioners. Indeed, we should be avoiding our responsibilities if we failed to put such a question, and the fault, if there be any for the submission of this amendment, is due to the Government&#39;s refusal to make any definite announcement as to the specific date upon which increased old-age pensions will be paid. The amendment is perfectly justified. It is well within the functions of an Opposition to submit it, and it is submitted by honorable members on this side without imputing motives, though, indeed, if motives be imputed, ours are just as clean as are those of honorable members on the other side of the chamber. </para>

          <para>.- I am surprised at the attitude adopted by the Prime Minister. This measure, which provides for two months&#39; Supply, amounting to over &#163;4,000,000, came before the Chamber about 5 o&#39;clock this afternoon. It is being rushed through with indecent haste, and honorable members are being denied a chance of properly discussing it. It appears that, although the schedule contains many items, involving large sums, it is the Prime Minister&#39;s intention that the Bill shall be passed during this sitting, and for that purpose he desires the &#39;suspension; of the Standing Orders. Honorable members on this side of the House cannot consent to that course in order that legislation may be dealt with in this hurried maimer. The result of undue haste may be a serious mistake in connexion with the Bill, and the Opposition will not accept any responsibility therefor by agreeing to the suspension of the Standing Orders. The Prime Minister says that the urgency of the measure is due to the fact that it must reach the Senate to-morrow. Is it not remarkable that this Chamber, which is supposed to control finance, should be allowed only a few hours in which to debate a Supply Bill, whilst the Senate may spend to-morrow and Friday on the Bill, although, in respect of the majority of its members, it is a dying institution. The Senate, as at present constituted, will expire on the 30th June. Why should men who will no longer bo members of the Senate after that date have two days in which to discuss a Bill, when the House which controls money matters is allowed only a few hours for that purpose? This House, and not the Senate, must accept responsibility for all financial measures. Why cannot the Senate deal with the Bill on Friday? Is there any reason why a dying Chamber should not dispose of the measure in one day? So far this House has had no opportunity of dealing with the items in the schedule. Our mouths are to be sealed, and we are  to be denied our rights as representatives  of the people. The Prime Minister has decreed a new procedure. This is the &#39; first time in the history of the Commonwealth that, in the early stages of a new Parliament, legislation has been bludgeoned through without proper discussion. The Prime Minister cannot expect us to agree to the suspension of the Standing Orders in order that the Bill may be put through Committee practically <inline font-style="italic">in globo.</inline></para>

            <para>- Apparently, &#34;so far as honorable members- opposite are concerned, millions of .pounds are of no account; they are prepared ;to scatter them about as if the Commonwealth owed no money, and there was no obligation on us to reduce the public debt. At a time when we should be giving earnest consideration to the finances, and looking for opportunities to save money, we are to be forced at the point of the bayonet to agree to a Supply Bill for &#163;4,000,000. And all this is done for the one purpose of enabling Parliament to be closed in a few weeks so that the Prime Minister may go to England. It is impossible for the session to terminate so soon if we are to deal with the legislation that the Government have promised, and the sooner the Prime Minister realizes that if he wishes to go abroad, he must permit Parliament to remain in session, the better for all concerned. Surely the business of the country is not to be held up because the head of the Government desires to go abroad. Such procedure is without precedent, and there is no necessity for it. Indeed, it will be a reflection upon every honorable member opposite, for it will be tantamount to saying that they are incapable of carrying on the, work of government in the absence of the Prime Minister. I would not object to the suspension of the Standing Orders if this House were to be given a couple of days in which to discuss the Bill,, hut I know that the suspension is proposed only for the purpose of bludgeoning the Bill through by means of the closure. I will offer no opposition to the Prime Minister&#39;s motion if he will agree to allow the House to discuss the Bill to-night and tomorrow. We have no desire to delay the payments that will be due at the end of  the month to pensioners and public servants, but if the Bill reaches the Senate to-morrow we may safely predict that it will be passed in the same sitting. </para>

            <para>- As this House has the sole responsibility for the care of the finances, we should take every precaution to see that all financial measures are dealt with in a proper way. There may be, in the schedule many items to which honorable members on both sides of the House desire to draw attention. The remarks of each member might occupy only a few minutes, but they may relate to matters of vital importance to the community. Apparently, we are to be denied the traditional right of members to ventilate grievances on Supply. Are honorable members opposite prepared to fritter away the privileges of the House merely in order that the Prime Minister may leave for England by a certain date? The programme of legislation promised by the Government, if it were properly digested, would occupy Parliament to the end of the year. It is equal to legislative programmes which in other years have occupied Parliament for five . or six months and have only been disposed of by sitting four and five days a week towards the end of the session. How can the Prime Minister expect this Parliament to put through a programme of such magnitude in seven more weeks of sitting? The. Treasurer has promised to introduce the Budget towards the end of next month. Discussion on the Budget ought to occupy a couple of weeks. Then we have to deal with the Estimates of every Department. I remember the criticism which was levelled against members of this House by newspapers which, to-day, are urging the Government to adopt this course for passing the Budget and the Estimates in three, or four weeks. The Government propose now to put through the whole of their programme in that time. They will be whipped with scorpions in the near future by those who now approve of their action ; they will be told that they did not give these matters proper consideration. We know what occurred in the last Parliament because we did not exercise sufficient scrutiny; millions of pounds of public money were wasted. Knowing that, we yet are endeavouring to put -measures through in a manner which renders probable the making of mistakes. I did not think . I would sit in a deliberative Parliament which would permit such a thing. A paper from the Old Country which I read recently disclosed the fact that the taxation proposals which the Commonwealth placed before the recent Conference of State Premiers were known in London last February. Everything appears to have been cut and dried. It is apparent that some influence is at work outside this Chamber to bring about certain results. That demonstrates the advisability of this House remaining in session to see that no advantage is taken of the public. We are the watchdogs of the public, and: are supposed to look after their interests. The Prime Minister would be well advised if he agreed to allow this matter to stand over until to-morrow. This side of the House has never, to my knowledge, endeavoured to hold up Supply and prevent the public servants being paid at the proper time. We are quite justified in complaining of this attempt to rush the matter through. If the Prime Minister desired to attend the Imperial Conferencei this House ought to have been called together at an earlier date. The Government are solely to blame for the&#39; condition in which we find ourselves. It is idle to contend that they had to wait until the Conference with the State Premiers was held in order that they might know what programme to place before this House. A sufficient number of Bills was tabled to-day to keep this House occupied for two or three months. There was nothing to prevent the Conference being held while this House was sitting. The proposals emanating from the Conference could have been brought before this Chamber after the other legislation had been disposed of. We would then have been in a position to deal with the businessin a reasonable manner. I am more than surprised that responsible members opposite should submit tamely to this action. From the day the composite Government was formed, it -has been evident that they planned to sit as short a time as possible in order to avoid trouble. I cannot understand how men ofintelli-  gence - and all men who are elected to this Chamber must possess intelligence - can permit this sort of thing to be done without entering a protest. In State and Commonwealth Parliaments I have known of parties in which there was rigid discipline, members often supporting action of which they did not approve; but never have I sat in a Parliament in which such a condition existed as exists here. Honorable members, whether they be independent or belong to the Country or Nationalist parties, have a duty to perform. They are not doing their duty in accordance with the best traditions of Parliament, they are not looking after the interests of their people as they should, when they agree to allow this Chamber to be closed down inside ten weeks. I have heard some honorable miembera talk about freedom of speech. When they ought to be exercising their freedom to speak they allow the Prune Minister to dominate the whole position. I have read about a domineering personality that once held sway in this House. I know of nobody who has been able to dominate the House so successfully as the honorable gentleman who leads this Government. There are honorable members opposite who made certain statements in the press before the House met, but they have not said a word from their places in this Chamber ; they have been effectively &#34; gagged&#34; This thing cannot continue for any length of time. The general publio are looking on and observing the manner in which legislation is being put through without proper consideration. When they get the opportunity - it may be soon or it may be in a couple of years&#39; time - they will exercise their prerogative in the correct way, and say to these honorable members who sit behind the Government, and who assist in applying the closure when important matters are under, consideration, that they have no further confidence in them. </para>

Almost from the inception of the honorable member&#39;s remarks audible conversations have been proceeding in the chamber, and there has been a vigorous fire of interjections.

            <para>- This is a matter of very great importance. If honorable members take their duty so lightly and value their rights in this House so lowly, this will become a deliberative assembly in name only in the near future. We should deal with legislation in the best interests of the country. The Labour party has never been guilty of obstructive tactics. We may be forced into that position. My object has been to deal with business in a proper and deliberative manner, giving full consideration to the dif-. ferent questions that come before us. It is because I see that there is no chance of our being given the opportunity to exercise our rights properly that I protest against the action of the Prime Minister. If I did not make a protest in the early stages, later on I would be told that I had acquiesced in what had been done. In the last Parliament business relating to some most important Departments which had been created was rushed through, and when everything went wrong, with consequent big expense to the people, all sorts of excuses were made. If mistakes are made by this Parliament, honorable members opposite must shoulder their responsibility. If they do not desire to speak, that is no justification for their voting to &#34;gag&#34; those who do desire to discuss matters affecting the welfare of this country. I ask them to consider the position before they go too far. Let them realize that honorable members on this side have rights. They are sent here to look after the interests of their constituents. I am reminded that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> speaking on this very question, made the following statement : - </para>

        <para class="block">The Treasurer saw things with different eyes then, when he was leading the Country party. Now that he is in power he is taking exactly the opposite course. He said further - lt seems to me that the first step towards economy is for us to consider how much is to be spent, and then to insist that it shall be spent wisely. The Country party has adopted the attitude that it should exercise some control over the spending power of this Parliament, even though there is very little of the current year now left. </para>

May I ask the Treasurer how he reconciles his present attitude with his views of 4th March, 1920 ? In his speech oh that occasion he quoted with approval certain remarks made by the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poster),</inline> when speaking in Adelaide four weeks prior to that debate, thus - </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is our present position. We are drifting into demoralization. There is no war, and no occasion for hysteria. We are supposed, as common-sense men, to have got back to normal. Nevertheless, we are expected to continue to be a cypher when dealing with the affairs of the country in that we are to be denied the opportunity to devote our time and our talents to seeing what can be done to reduce the financial burdens placed on the shoulders of the people as the result of the war. We are to remain a cypher because the closure is to be applied whenever the Prime Minister feels so inclined. The Treasurer quoted further from the speech of the honorable member for Wakefield, thus - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The people were staggering under OUt:rageous prices .... There was one remedy left, and that was a vigorous determination by the people that Government be supreme and parliamentary authority restored. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This is the way the Government propose to restore parliamentary authority ! It only shows how cherished ideals are discarded when honorable members opposite get on the Treasury bench. Their desire now is to keep Parliament closed as long as possible, and to that end they feel justified in taking any steps available to them. The application of the closure is ridiculous. We might just as well admit that Parliament has no responsibility, and is a mere cypher in the hands of the Government. I appeal to honorable members opposite as intelligent men and representatives of the people to withstand this pressure by Ministers, and to honour their pledges. Did they tell the people that, if returned, they would acquiesce in this policy of stifling discussion, and preventing the searchlight of public opinion from being directed upon the transactions of the Government? I venture to say that, on the contrary, they declared that, if elected, they would give diligent attention to all those matters about which complaints have been made, and particularly the treatment of our returned soldiers, and the position with regard to the War Service Homes scandals. The only way in which this may be done is for Parliament to be allowed full opportunity to debate all subjects that may be intro.duced. This, hitherto, has been the privilege of al new Parliaments, but, unfortunately, there now appears to be a disposition among members opposite not to do so. , The Treasurer also said - </para>

            <para>- Honorable members opposite complain that there has been no time for adequate discussion. We have only to remember what has taken place. Throughout the debate there has been no reference whatever to the financial provisions of the Bill, but honorable mem bers have talked upon a number of other matters which, no doubt, they considered of paramount importance. No new expenditure is contemplated. I can assure honorable members that when the Estimates are submitted they will have the fullest opportunity to discuss the financial provisions of the Government. There has been no unreasonable limitation of honorable members&#39; privileges. I felt, while listening to the Leader of the Opposition, that apparently he was a little apprehensive that, on some future occasion, the Government might not permit adequate discussion of business before the House; but I can assure him that we will give honorable members ample opportunity for a reasonable consideration of all measures brought forward. We have no desire to force Bills through the House without debate. All we intend to do is to see that the House does the business of the country, and it is jjossible that at times we shall have to take action which might not appeal to honorable members opposite. It is a task we have to carry out, but I can assure honorable members that in the future, as in the past, reasonable opportunities will be given for the discussion of measures which come before the House. </para>

            <para>-  The  Chairman  is carrying too heavy a load. This brutal work leads to a lot of trouble. It is. not disputed that the Prime Minister moved &#34; That the question be now put. but it  is  contended that the questionto which the Prime Minister&#39;s motion relates is, not the adoption of the clause, but the  motion moved by the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey).</inline></para>

            <para>- Is this the first time that the honorable gentleman has seen the Standing Orders? Briefly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> you have made a mistake. Standing order 237 provides for a specific motion, which was moved by the honorable member for Bourke after you had called him. That motion is now before the Committee. After the honorable member for Bourke had concluded his motion, the Prime Minister, in a burst of zeal to dispose of the business in a workmanlike manner, moved that the question be now put. In the circumstances the closure so moved could apply only to the motion that progress be reported. My interpretation of the Standing Orders is correct. I would not press my dissent from your ruling if you, sir, would admit that standing order 237 has the effect that I have attributed to it. I am compelled to place upon record a motion dissenting from your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> and I take it that the Government will support you in your wrong decision, which will remain for ever on the records of the Committee as a grave reflection upon yourself and your interpretation of the Standing Orders. I wish the Prime Minister to understand &#39;that this method of procedure can be carried a little too far. The Standing Orders are the only protection honorable members have. There have been certain events in proper sequence- </para>

              <para>-  Then I desire at once to take your ruling on the submission of the schedule in that form. It has always been the custom in this Parliament for the Minister in charge of a Supply Bill, if that is thought desirable, to ask that the whole of the items for the different Departments be taken together. But should any one object that cannot be done, and the schedule must be submitted in separate Departments. I trust that you will see that the practice of this Parlia- ment in that regard is observed on this occasion. I claim that the Committee should take, first of all, the vote for the Parliament and then the votes for each of the succeeding Departments. </para>

              <para>-  When an ordinary Bill containing a number of clauses and an attached schedule is under consideration the practice has been, when the clauses have been dealt with, to put the question that the schedule stand part of the Bill. But we are here considering the schedule to a Supply Bill, and it has been the uniform practice for the  Chairman  of Committees to put the vote for each Department separately. I hope that the Committee is not going to be muzzled by any  Chairman,  by the Clerks, or by anybody else. </para>

          <para>The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN.Standing order No. 169 deals with the consideration of Bills in Committee, new clauses, schedules as printed, and new schedules; but I take it that a Supply Bill differs somewhat from an ordinary Bill. The schedule includes, votes for a number of Government Departments, and I think the Prime Minister would be well advised if he agreed to the submission of the schedule to the Committee in different Departments. </para>

              <para>- If there is disorder in this Chamber, the duty of the  Chairman  is to name the member responsible, and the business of the Committee should not proceed, pending the arrival of the  Speaker.  During a commotion a motion was declared carried. That is absolutely unfair. That is not the proper way to conduct the business of the Chamber. If the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> persisted in his defiance of the Chair, you, sir, should have named him and brought the  Speaker  in. You have no right to declare the motion carried. In the commotion no one could tell what was being said. There is a proper way of conducting parliamentary business. This sort of thing cannot go on; that must be definitely understood. It has gone far enough. I have put up with a good deal. I am prepared to do the proper thing and obey the rules of this House, but men are put into the Chair who do not know how to conduct the business of the Committee. It is about time this farce stopped. </para>

              <para>-  It is a very serious matter to expel an honorable member, especially one like the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West).</inline> There has been a great deal of confusion in Committee, and the honorable member, who has not, I think, spoken to-day, became much incensed because he could not get information he desired. During the hours we have been here we have heard little from the Ministry except the motion, &#34; That the question be now put,&#34; and in consequence the honorable member felt his position very keenly, and may have gone too far. In the circumstances, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> you may have it in  your power to ask him whether he feels inclined to apologize, and, if so, to give him an opportunity to do so. </para>

              <para>- I was indignant that, sitting in the National Parliament, I should witness the acts of the Government during the last twelve hours, and in my passion for the liberties of my country, Australia, which I love, I could do no other than point out that the Ministry were breaking every tradition of the Parliament to which I yet hope to be of some service. I desire young members to realize that Parliament is a great institution, the rights and privileges of which should be preserved in their integrity; and so long as I am a member I shall endeavour to conserve all that goes to form the foundations of the liberties of the people of this country. I know that we have to obey the laws and regulations of Parliament, and, in the opinion of the Government, I may have exceeded my duty. But those on the Government side are not obeying those laws and regulations, and it may be imagined&#39; how that affects a man with the spirit of the nation to which I belong. </para>

              <para>- May I suggest that the honorable member for Angas is treating this incident as if he were being asked to withdraw an untrue statement. It is nothing of the sort. He has used an unparliamentary expression, which, if used by any honorable member, is usually withdrawn at the request of the Chair. In the circumstances, and in the interests of orderly debate and the dignity of this Committee, I think the honorable member should withdraw what was really an unparliamentary expression. </para>

In view of what transpired at an earlier stage of the proceedings, I feel that I cannot do other than offer the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gabb)</inline> an opportunity such, as I afforded the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West),</inline> to conform to the requirements of the occasion, and in doing so I appeal to the best judgment of the honorable member for Angas and of honorable members on both sides of the House. </para>

              <para>- I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> for your statement of the case and the appeal which you have made to me. But I uttered a true statement, and having done so, I cannot see why I should be called upon to withdraw and apologize. If the Government appoint weak men to occupy the responsible position of  Chairman  of Committees, who cannot conduct the proceedings of the Committee, the Government are to blame. If the uproar in the chamber is so great when a division is being taken, that my voice cannot be heard - and I shout very loudly- I can only express regret that incapable men are appointed to the position. I feel, however, that the proceedings of this sitting have been such that it is no dishonour or disgrace to leave the chamber, and sooner than withdraw a statement I know to be true I shall do that. </para>

I now inform you that while the honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bayley)</inline> was presiding as  Chairman  of Committees, he made three grievous mistakes which created confusion in the minds of honorable members, and resulted in a motion being carried to expel the honorable member for Angas from the sitting. As a matter of fact, the Temporary  Chairman  of Committees should have apologised to the honorable member for Angas for questioning his veracity. As a member of the House I complain about the continual repetition of such grave mistakes. A continuance of the services of the honorable member for Oxley as Temporary  Chairman  of Committees cannot be conducive to the good conduct of this Chamber. </para>

He was not aware until he was informed of the fact that he had been paired with the honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E.

I contend that it is not competent for the Prime Minister to move &#34; That the question be now put,&#34; seeing that he was the mover of the original motion &#34; That the third reading of the Bill be agreed to.&#34; After he had moved the original motion the Leader of the Opposition rose to speak, and then the Prime Minister immediately moved &#34; That the question be now put.&#34; The closure motion moved by the Prime Minister could only have been properly moved by some other honorable gentleman. </para>
