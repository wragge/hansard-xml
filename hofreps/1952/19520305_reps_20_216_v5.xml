                        <para>- "With the approval of the Prime Minister I have asked the permanent head of the Department of External Affairs, Mr. Watt, to spend some time, as yet indeterminate, in SouthEast Asia. The visit is a reflection of my personal anxiety and, I think, of the anxiety of the Government, about the situation in South-East Asia as a result of the internal Communist problem in each of the countries of that area, and particularly' about the potential Communist menace to the area from outside. The centre of Mr. Watt's activities will be -Singapore where he will spend a third of' his time. The rest of his time will be spent in travelling to each of the countries of South-East Asia. . I hope to meet him in Singapore, in a month's time while 1 am on my way back from the - meeting of the consultative council of the Colombo plan in Karachi. By that time Mr. Watt will have spent one month in South-East Asia. I shall decide after consulting with him whether he is to remain there longer and what we shall require to do to strengthen Australia's representation in the area generally. The meeting in Karachi is the annual meeting, on a ministerial level, of the consultative council of the Colombo plan, and will be held from the 24th Marsh to the 1st April. I shall represent the Australian Government at that conference. </para>

                        <para>- I direct to the Minister for External Affairs, who is in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, a question that relates to cotton growing in Australia and to the fact that the next cotton planting season is not far off. I believe that increased production of Australian cotton is vital not only in areas at present under cultivation but also in other areas. We are paying, I believe, a large subsidy on our own crop and the tonnage imported is costing us dollars. There are growing industrial facilities in New South Wales to handle cotton. I ask,- therefore: Has the experimental work carried out by the Commonwealth </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman is correct in believing that experimental work has been going on for, I' think, four or five years at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's experimental stations at Katherine and the Ord River. I am not aware, although I may be uninformed on the point, that the organization is doing any experimental work at Griffith in relation to cotton production. The organization is not engaged in experimental work on the central or northwestern slopes of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales. Most of its experimental work is being done in Queensland in which State the Department of Agriculture and Stock has been very active over the years in the same sphere. The results of the department's work are circulated through a body of whose name and address I shall advise the honorable member later when I shall alao be glad to ascertain whether papers, publications or contacts that he may require may be made available to him. </para>

                        <para>- I address a question to the Minister for Works and Housing; it relates to the construction of prefabricated houses by Melbourne firms in New South Wales. Why are not firms in New South Wales that are prepared to tender for this work given an opportunity to do so? Is it a fact that Melbourne firms are doing a considerable volume of work in the construction of prefabricated houses in New South Wales under contracts let by the Australian Government? Is it also a fact that tenders for such work are not called through the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Building Trades Journal</inline> and, consequently, builders in that State are severely handicapped whilst Victorian firms are given an advantage over them? Will the Minister take steps to ensure that New South Wales builders, who could probably do the work cheaper as their plants Are more handily situated, shall be given equal opportunity with Victorian firms in tendering for these jobs? </para>

                        <para>- I think that the houses to which the honorable member has referred are a certain number which were bought from the Victorian Railways Department. They are of a special type and were imported from Great Britain. They are really not prefabricated houses but pre-cut houses, and the Department of National Development required that they be erected in the particular district as quickly as possible. In those circumstances, the Department of Works and Housing, so far as I know, included the work in a contract, that already existed with the Victorian Railways. It was my task to arrange for the importation and the original erection of these houses. It was found that when contracts for their erection were let to a number of different contractors delay was caused by reason of the fact that each contractor bad to learn the mechanics involved in erecting them - each house might be described as a timber meccano set - and that loss of time increased the cost of erecting them. Finally, the Victorian Railways assembled a team to undertake the erection of the houses. I think that one of the larger contractors in Victoria did all the work. Furthermore, the parts of these houses are stored at what might bc termed the Victorian Railways ordnance store and the parts and building quantities are drawn as required from that store. As a special number of these houses were to be built in the area to which the honorable member has referred, it was decided that it would be far cheaper and that the work could be done more quickly by extending the contract with the Victorian Railways to include the work rather than to call for open tenders for it. </para>

                    <para>- It is quite possible that members of the Citizen Military Forces would be or could be called up for service under the national service training scheme. The obligation to serve under that scheme applies to young men who reach the age of eighteen years after the 1st November, 1950, and quite possibly, some members of the Citizen Military Forces are in that situation. The fact that they are members of the Citizen Military Forces does not relieve them of their inability to serve under the national service training scheme. It would not be correct to say that men in the 20 to 23 years age group would be called up. As I have stated, the obligation applies to those in the other age group to which I have referred. I should be astonished to learn that through some error call-up notices had been sent to older men, but I shall be glad to have any specific instances brought to my notice. </para>

                        <para>- I address the following questions to the Prime Minister: Is it not a fact that for years the Australian consumers, including age pensioners, subsidized primary production, particularly butter, wheat, sugar end dried fruits, by paying a home consumption price far higher than the world price for those products, and much higher than the price at which such food could have been imported ? Is it not also a fact that millions of pounds have been provided for non-paying transport and postal facilities in country districts, and in freight concessions, bounties, subsidies and other handouts? Can the Prime Minister say what is the estimated annual value of these concessions, and will he give a guarantee that the contribution made, particularly by pensioners and people on low incomes, to subsidize primary producers will be taken into account when he is considering the demands of primary producers for world prices for their products, now that world parity is higher than the Australian price?

                            <para>- The honorable member for West Sydney invites me to put in hand a very lengthy calculation extending over many years, and I have no doubt that such an inquiry would be extremely costly. Perhaps I may summarize the answer to his question by saying that it is undeniable that over a certain period the consumer in Australia subsidized to a degree certain export industries, of which wheat is an example. For a number of years, the home consumption price charged for wheat was in excess of export parity. That, as the honorable member will realize, has not been the case for a considerable period, and if one were to isolate the wheat industry, it would be easy to show that the subsidy, in effect, which was paid for some years in respect of wheat by the local consumer is far more than off-set by the concession made by the wheat-grower to the local consumer. I never feel a strong inclination to start a heated argument about such matters. They merely illustrate the fact that in a well-balanced and civilized community primary industries and secondary industries must act in aid of each other, and that consumers must take benefits and burdens from time to time in the interests of the productive industries. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth has said that, as a matter of policy, it  wishes 'to subsidize the dairying industry. Any plan that has been proposed for the purpose of stabilizing that industry is related to some guarantee by the Commonwealth of a return to dairy farmers. We had the experience of an intolerable situation in which the Australian Government was liable under a guarantee, but the State governments were completely free to fix whatever selling price they cared to fix. In that situation, the Australian Government had no control of its liabilities. This Government has now announced that, as an essential preliminary to the conclusion of another guarantee arrangement, the States must transfer to it control of the prices of butter and cheese <inline font-style="italic">ex</inline> factories. </para>

The Joint Dairying Industry Advisory Committee may or may not be the cost finding authority, but I assure the honorable member that, whatever authority is appointed, the cost will be calculated and revealed in plenty of time to provide for a price adjustment from the 1st July as is customary. The question whether adjustments should be made twice yearly is a matter of Government policy which will be considered in conjunction with a general stabilization scheme. </para>

                        <para>- I think that I can safely say that the Australian Wheat Board does not intend to do so. The board handles funds that are the proceeds of wheat sold on behalf of growers. Those funds belong to the growers, and I believe that I am correct in saying that the investment of growers' capital in that way would be untenable in law, as well as unjustifiable in equity. However,  the  States have bulk handling authorities, and bulkheads have been built at various places in Victoria by the Grain Elevators Board and in New South Wales  by  an equivalent authority. </para>

                            <para>- I have no knowledge of the position at Tamworth in particular, but I do know that there is such a shortage of locally grown wheat in New South Wales that that State is said  torequire  the importation of 8,000,000' bushels of wheat in order to maintain something substantially less than a normal milling run. Without that there will be a serious shortage of mill offals for poultry and other industries. The Australian Wheat Board is concerning itself with this position and I shall be glad to take the matter up with it. Frankly, plansmight have been made to meet this position if the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture had disclosed to the Australian Government that there was an impending shortage of wheat in New South Wales when the problem was being discussed in relation to other States in November last. </para>

                        <para>- I wish, to ask the Prime Minister a question in relation to the provision of tax relief for primary producers who have suffered from the effects of bush fires and drought. The  Deputy  Commissioner of Taxation at Brisbane has informed me that hisrepresentatives will visit the Wide Bay electorate and other areas in Queensland' in order to make inquiries concerning thelosses sustained by primary producers asa result of bush fires. These visits are te- be made in accordance with a decision that was announced in this House by the Prime Minister. The object is to grant deferment of certain provisional tax payments for the benefit of bush fire victims. Will the right honorable gentleman have these inquiries extended with the object of providing relief also for producers who have suffered tragic losses as. a result of devastating droughts? Many of them have invested a large proportion of their assets in stock feed but now have no use for the feed because of the destruction of stock. I ask the right honorable gentleman to grant relief on equal terms to sufferers from bush fires and droughts. </para>

                        <para>- The announcement that I made on this matter as Acting Treasurer in the absence of the Treasurer related to fires. The action that was taken was prompted by the fact that bush fires had caused an extremely sudden and devastating calamity. Officers of the Taxation Branch of the Department of the Treasury and of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture have, as the honorable member has said, announced that they will visit various places, and they will deal with applicants on the spot. They have ample authority. To expand that to other cases might be to cause very great delay in dealing with the cases that we were aiming to deal with, and I do not want to have any delay that is avoidable in these matters. However, I may tell the honorable member that the position of drought areas is related to distinct problems under consideration at present by the Treasury. </para>

Is it a fact tha,t the honorable member for Macarthur is the  chairman  of what has been called a small committee of Government supporters which has been formed to study the problem of increasing food production in Australia? Is it also a fact that this small committee consists of at least 31 senators and representatives? If these are facts, is this unofficial committee functioning under government patronage, and is it being provided by the Government with transport to visit steel works and other industrial enterprises? Will the Minister say how many meetings of the committee have been held and when he expects to be in a position to present the report of the committee to the Government? Are any fees or expenses paid to members of this committee? Are government cars used in connexion with their transport? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Macarthur is the secretary of a committee of very experienced members of both the Government parties who are good enough, out of a sense of public duty, to spend their time, for no fee or reward, in acquainting themselves with the problems of primary industry in this country, and advising the Government upon them. They may or may not use government cars. If I were asked to supply them with a government car I should be very glad ' to do so. I think that the total number on the committee may be about 30. From memory, that is about one-third of the number of private members which the last Labour Government sent round the world for purposes which none of us can remember. However, I think that the honorable member for Grayndler, who is the Opposition Whip, could give some information about that matter. </para>

                        <para>- Has the Minister for Health made provision yet for persons over 65 years of age to take advantage of the additional hospital benefits which are provided by the Government under a contributory scheme? Has the Minister made provision also for the payment of that benefit to patients in public hospitals? If he has done so, does that mean the  re-introduction  of the means test for all patients who are admitted to public hospitals? Further, will the Minister have a statement prepared for the information of honorable members setting out in detail the whole of the benefits that are provided under his hospital benefits scheme? </para>

                        <para>- I shall answer the last question first. I shall endeavour to have a statement made available to all honorable members who desire it. So far as public hospitals are concerned, five of the six States have decided to apply for approval of the private and intermediate wards of their public hospitals as approved private hospitals. That will enable them to take advantage immediately of the hospital benefits scheme. Certain States have also arranged to have this scheme operate throughout their hospital schemes in relation to both ordinary public beds and private intermediate wards. </para>

There is no limit to the number of words that the Postal Department will accept as an ' urgent telegram, but however lengthy such a telegram may be no concessional rebate is allowed. If the honor-; able member can encourage transmission of more such lengthy telegrams I shall possibly extend a personal concession to him by way of commission. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I shall have that matter investigated. As the honorable member will understand, I have no detailed knowledge of the particular case to which he has referred. We do what we can in relation to such matters. As I said in this House recently, the matter is one of great difficulty. If we departed from the public tender system we should be open to the accusation of favoritism. If we adhere to the system, then obviously contracts must be given to the companies that submit the lowest tenders, and it may well be that one firm will tender for a contract to supply a large order of khaki cloth at a low price, and perhaps even at a loss, in order to keep its mills going, whilst other firms might be unable to submit such a low tender. However, this matter has already .been under consideration to ascertain whether something can be done, within the charter of the Contracts Board, to assist textile manufacturers. If something can be done in that direction, it will be done. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to make a personal explanation. On Thursday of last week the honorable member for Herbert directed a question to the Prime Minister in which he referred to a question that he had asked some time ago, an answer to which, he said, had been considerably delayed. The honorable member told the Prime Minister that the question had been put on the notice-paper on the 17th October, that it was directed to me, and that I had omitted or neglected to answer it. The honorable member was good enough to say that that was not my practice and that he regretted having had to raise the matter, but he wished to ensure that there would be no such delay when matters of the kind were raised in future. I do not suggest that the honorable member attempted wilfully to mislead the House and the Prime Minister in the matter, but I point out to him that the question to which he referred was not one upon notice but was asked without notice. He wished to put the question to me, but as I was absent from the House through illness he put it direct to the Prime Minister. In point of fact, the question did not relate to either of my departments, nor did it relate to the administration of the Prime Minister's Department. It related to a matter that comes within the jurisdiction of the Treasurer. When it was asked the Prime Minister said that, because of its nature, involving as it did the compilation by the Commonwealth Statistician of tables of items included in the " C " series index, some little time would be needed to provide an answer to it, and that he would see that the answer would be supplied when it became available. I was concerned when the honorable member asked the question, because I had given strict instructions to both my departments that questions on the notice-paper directed to me concerning the activities of the departments were to be dealt with promptly, and I had had no cause for complaint in that respect in the past. I consider that, in fairness to the officers of the departments, I should make it clear that there was no delay on their part in connexion with this matter, which at no stage came within my province. </para>

                            <para>-  I rise to order, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> You have given an opinion and the question now arises whether or not that opinion is correct. First, you gave priority to the motion of which the honorable member for Mackellar has given notice. That was objected to and on the question of whether the preference you determined could be challenged under the Standing Orders, you ruled that it could not be so challenged. That also is a ruling, and, surely, an honorable member can question it in the ordinary way. The House may uphold your ruling. You have interpreted the Standing Orders to provide not merely that you may give preference to one motion, but also that the grounds on which you reach your decision are not examinable by means of an appeal against that ruling to the House. I submit that you are bound to hear the challenge to your second ruling. </para>

                            <para>-  It is perfectly obvious, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that your ruling is sound because if it had been intended under the Standing Orders that the House should decide which motion should be given priority they would not have provided that the  Speaker  should determine that point, but would have provided that it should be determined by the House itself. Standing Order 48 specifically gives authority to the  Speaker  in this matter. Obviously, it was never intended that the House should determine it. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is now apparently argued that the Standing Order means, " In the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> or of the House, as the case may be ". .Such an argument has no foundation. Standing Order 48 expressly provides that priority shall be given to the motion which, in the opinion of the  Speaker,  is the most urgent and important. Honorable gentlemen, when they study the Standing Orders, find many rules that have to be interpreted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and in respect of which his opinion is obviously challengeable, because the words " in the opinion of the  Speaker  " are not included in them. But in the matter now under consideration the point that had to be resolved was whether priority should be given to one motion instead of to another motion. It concerned the order of business. Therefore, the House expressly provided that the judgment in such a case was to be the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> It is merely bandying words to say that it is the opinion of somebody else. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has been eager to support his colleague, but has not dared to contend that the words mean in the opinion of somebody else, because to do so would be to commit an absurdity of language. </para>

In such circumstances, the House would be completely impotent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> may give, from his standpoint, a perfectly honest ruling, yet the majority of honorable members may regard it as incorrect, unfair and unjust. I suggest that those who drafted the Standing Orders visualized, in their wisdom, just such a position as has arisen this afternoon, and, accordingly, formulated Standing Order 101. In those circumstances, I submit that the motion of dissent submitted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> and seconded by myself is in order. </para>

                            <para>- I propose to discuss only one point, but I regard it as of some consequence to the House. The view has been expressed by the honorable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> that a faulty ruling by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> would leave the House impotent. The position, if that opinion were correct, would be serious, but, of course, the House, as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> and the honorable member for Lalor know, is always master of its own business. If it be found that the Standing Orders do not enable business to be called on and the House, by a majority vote, wishes to have it called on, a motion may be submitted for the suspension of so much of the Standing Orders as would prevent that item of business from being dealt with. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the House would be impotent. The House has alwaysbeen master of its own business. It has placed certain authority in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> hands for a particular purpose. The House, if it wished to take that authority out of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> hands, could do so by a majority vote. </para>

                <para>The Australian Government, after discussion with the United Kingdom Government, has decided to send a famous Royal Australian Air Force jet fighter wing to the Middle East about July to join the Royal Air Force forces in that area. Until now, Great Britain has borne the whole burden of providing garrison forces for the important Middle East area. Australia has now agreed to contribute a part of the peace-time air force garrison in the Middle East. The Royal Australian Air Force wing to bc stationed in the Middle East is No. 78 Fighter Wing, comprising No. 75 and No. 76 squadrons and supporting units. The wing is at present stationed at Williamtown, New South Wales. Its squadrons are equipped with Australian - built De Havilland Vampire jet fighters. These aircraft will not be taken to the Middle East but will remain in Australia. The wing, on arrival in the Middle East,  will  be provided with aircraft and equipment from Royal Air Force sources and will be stationed at a Royal Air Force base for combined and advanced training. </para>
                <para>Great advantage will accrue to the Royal Australian Air Force from its garrison service in this area, for it will give to many officers and men training and experience in an area which presents distinctive problems to air forces. It is expected that the wing will leave Sydney by ship about June, 1952. The eventual location has not yet been decided, but the use of a Royal Air Force base in Cyprus is under consideration. </para>
                <para>The despatch of No. 78 wing to the Middle East will mean that the Royal Australian Air Force will be operating in three places overseas. No. 77 squadron, flying Meteor jet fighters, and No. 30 - Dakota transport unit- - are engaged in the Korean war. No. 1 - Lincoln heavy bomber - and No. 38 - Dakota transport squadrons - are serving in the campaign in Malaya under the operational command of the Royal Australian Air Force. No. 78 wing is at present commanded by Wing Commander Brian Eaton, D.S.O. and Bar, D.F.C., who is one of the Royal Australian Air Force's most celebrated fighter pilots. He  fought  with great distinction in the Middle East and Southern Europe in the 1939-45 war. </para>

                        <para>- The endeavour of the Opposition to postpone the discussion of this matter is perhaps understandable, but it does little credit to their intelligence or integrity. When . charges had been brought against a political party that its official journals were circulating subversive and seditious statements calculated to lower the morale of Australian troops fighting in Korea, to give aid and comfort to the enemies of the United Nations and to impair the defences of Australia, one would have thought that the members of the party would have been anxious to clear themselves of such charges. The fact that they have tried to obstruct the introduction of this motion convicts them of knowing that the motion itself is justified. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I do not believe that this motion will have issue in any action. It is not so designed. It is designed to bring before this House certain matters that should be considered, and that may call for action after consideration. Nevertheless, the motion is both important and urgent, first, because of the substance of the seditious statements of which complaint is made; secondly, .because the statements are not isolated but form a continuing series ; and, thirdly, because they have been made in a journal that claims to represent officially the Australian Labour party which sponsors considerable members opposite. The statements have been made in a feature article which has appeared in a certain journal almost every week for some time. The feature article always has the same author and is known as " Canberra Commentary ". These articles are published in the paper called the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Herald,</inline> which is officially  described as 'being published at " 20 Trades' Hall, Adelaide". It also describes itself as " The official organ of the Australian Labour party " and a byline is added - " Expressing the official viewpoint of the united trades and labour councils of South Australia representing 80,000 trade unionists ". I do not believe that, because I do not believe that there are 80,000 traitors among the South Australian trade unionists. </para>
                    <para>Honorable members of this House who come here under the sponsorship and patronage of the Australian Labour party must be involved in the publication of  this official organ. They must either disown their own publications or convict themselves yet further. I shall now bring to the' notice of the House the nature of the publications. I refer to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Herald,</inline> of the 5th February, 1952, in which the author, after discussing Korea, made this statement - </para>

                        <para>The soldiers fighting in Korea under the flag of the United Nations should be told that they are not fighting for the purpose of keeping South Korea free, they are embroiled in the extension and strengthening of American imperialism in Asia. </para>

                    <para>Can' one imagine a more dastardly or damaging statement? I again remind honorable members that that statement was made in an official journal of the Australian Labour party. </para>

                        <para>In the circumstances it should be quite obvious to workers that the representatives of the member nations of the United Nations Organization cannot be expected to do anything in the nature of establishing and maintaining world peace beyond, when they are compelled to do so, making virtues of necessities. Practically all of them are supporters of the capitalist system who act politically through the medium of anti-Labour Governments. As such, they will continue to talk at length about the need for world peace but will not be prepared to do anything constructive to make it possible or lasting. </para>

                    <para>That is a direct attack on the sincerity of our side in the United Nations.

                        <para>Whether there will be another world war or not or whether there will be a lasting world peace or not will depend much more upon what the masses of the workers will be prepared to do, either one way or the other, than it will upon what the United Nations Organization can or is prepared to do. In other words, either war or peace becomes the order of the day to the extent only that workers make it possible to be so. They and they alone constitute the labor power required either to be used for the purposes of war or those of peace. </para>

The full infamy of that attitude can be gauged by the fact that it is an echo of a well-known Communist line that was first put out in 1915 by Lenin in a thesis <inline font-style="italic">The Defeat of One's Own Government in the Imperialist War.</inline> That line was continued by George Dimitrov in his pamphlet <inline font-style="italic">The War and the Working Class</inline> that was published in October, 1939.

I know that there are many loyal elements inside the Australian Labour party. Let them show themselves now ry disowning this article and by taking proper measures against its author. If they do not do so now they will show that the same forces of treason that governed the actions of a large section of their party in 1939 and 1940 are still at work. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member referred to an article which, he said, had appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> published in Adelaide. He claimed that it was a copy of an article from the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Call</inline> of Melbourne. I believe that to be so, because : passages that he has read seem to correspond in substance with the article-  that he read last week in relation to Korea and the purposes of the war there. In respect of that article, I repeat what the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> has said, namely, that the Labour party is opposed to and deprecates that expression of opinion. The honorable member has picked out a short passage from a lengthy article and has made misleading references to certain persons. One referred to a member of the bar in England whom the honorable member for Mackellar declares to be a Communist. I do not know that he is a Communist. The other reference apparently was to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Pratt, a distinguished civil servant who was an adviser to the Foreign Office for many years. The honorable member for Mackellar cast a slur on that gentleman without producing proof of the accuracy of his assertions. He has' asked this House to express the deliberate opinion that the Labour party is involved in some sedition on the basis of a tiny extract from a couple of articles which honorable members have not read. That is a shocking thing. It is an abuse of the proceedings of the House to submit the motion at all. In the political movement one differs from some opinions that are expressed. At the same time, there is a principle which this House must recognize. That is the principle of freedom of expression. Subject to the law of the land and to the law of sedition, people are entitled to express their opinions. This Parliament should not be persuaded by a side wind introduced in a shabby, sneaking way and put forward so incoherently to condemn persons of a serious crime. If treason and sedition are involved, that is a matter for decision by the judges and juries of the land not by the' honorable member for Mackellar. </para>

                            <para>- No slander or intimidation should be used by an honorable member to prevent expressions of opinion so long as they are not breaking the law that has been passed by the Australian or the State parliaments. If an opinion is not calculated to cause disaffection or disturbance it is not seditious. This House cannot dare to express an opinion about the seditious character of an article that its members have not even read. The honorable member has said that he intended to send copies of the article round to honorable members after the motion had been moved. Just imagine! Condemn first and look at the facts afterwards! That is the kind of justice we should have in this country under the honorable member for Mackellar. I believe the attack that he has made is completely unworthy of this House. He has not pressed it seriously. As a matter of fact, the objective of the attack i.3 so party-political that it amounts to sheer malevolence. I consider that the honorable member, by making it, is himself guilty of the very thing that he attributes to the Labour party - subversion. What he is attempting to do io to subvert the processes of the Parliament, to substitute for the courts of law the <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> tribunal of the Parliament. I believe that his own party could not support such a revolutionary proposal unless it saw all the facts and considered that they justified the proposal. I do not believe that the facts would justify it. I say that if there is any subversion it is on the part of the honorable member, and that he has not produced one tittle of evidence of any other sedition. </para>

                    <para>There is a deeper and more sinister aspect of the matter. This kind of thing may well represent an attempt to introduce into our Australian democracy, of which this Parliament is representative, the doctrine known as "  Macarthyism  ", which specializes in the slur, the- sneer, the innuendo and the quotation of passages out of their context. The honorable member has not even told us the name of the author of the articles. No, he will distribute the article later on! I think that the motion has the same object as that of another motion that was submitted recently, and that it is intended to refer to a distinguished senator. I say further that the honorable gentleman's attack is in keeping with other speeches that he has made, which indicate a desire to convict people without a hearing. He is to be the judge of whether a person is, or is not, guilty of sedition. Just imagine the honorable member, with his so very apparent prejudices, as a member of a jury sworn to give an impartial verdict in a case in which the defendant was charged with sedition. Is the House going to be any less attentive to an issue of that kind than a jury would be? I do not believe that anybody, no matter how politically biased he was or how much he detested his opponents, could be so obsessed with hatred as to support a motion of this character. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member has said that he does not know whether any action will be taken as a result of his motion, but he wants the matter considered. There is a doctrine known to the law as "contempt of court ". There ought also to be a doctrine known to the law as " contempt of parliament ". Judges have laid it down that before a case is presented by the prosecution it is possible to prejudice the community against the defendant. The court sums it up by saying that it is possible to poison the fountains of justice before, they begin to flow. That is what the honorable member is trying to do. Just imagine it being possible to hold a proper hearing after an attack such as that levelled by the honorable member ! If it be a reference to an honorable genusman who is a former Minister of the Crown, then it is a reference to a man who is himself an ex-soldier, who fought for Australia, who is the father of a man who lost his life in war and of another son who also served his country at the front. If that be the case, then it only adds to the contempt with which the honorable member is treating this Parliament. But worst of all is his pretended support of the United Nations. Just look at the record of his statements about the United Nations over the last two years. He made a most savage, violent, and unjustified attack on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trygve</inline> Lie, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Honorable members will recall that attack quite clearly. Its terms were so extravagant and abusive that I do not suppose anybody paid much attention to it, hut it is on record, and I shall not refer any further to it. He has not said anything in opposition to the United Nations since the outbreak of the Korean war. In fact, he was not interested in the good work performed and able to be performed, by the United Nations until the Korean war started. Prior to the outbreak of the Korean war he was an open opponent of the Secretary-General of the organization. </para>
                    <para>It is difficult to take the honorable member seriously, but it is a serious thing to impute subversive activities to a political party, when the only basis for the imputation is the kind of proof that the honorable member has produced. Just imagine placing such proof before a magistrate ! The case would be thrown out of court as rubbish, which is a good description of the case that the honorable gentleman has placed before us to-day. I ask this House never to condemn people until they have been heard. We do not even know the nature of the document on which the honorable member is relying for his allegations. He has given us no proof of what he has said. He has read one sentence out of what he admits to be a lengthy article. In a court of law the jury would be instructed to acquaint itself with all the facts, and not just some of them, before it decided whether sedition had occurred. If the Crown Prosecutor said, " My case relies on the last sentence of a lengthy article that covers many pages ", but kept the rest of the article secret, the court would instruct the jury to dismiss the charge. I ask the House, which is, in a sense, the jury, though it is not exactly in the same position as a jury, to treat this motion with the utter and absolute contempt it deserves. </para>

                        <para>.- I shall not attempt to simulate the simulated heat that was shown by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt).</inline> I rise to support the action of the' honorable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth)</inline> in directing attention to a series of seditious and subversive' articles in the South Australian <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> which is an official Labour' party organ. The Leader of the Opposition has said that this motion is unworthy of. this House. I say that these articles are unworthy of the Labour party, which must' say, in the interests of our national security and unity, where it stands in relation to them. The Leader of the Opposition has not by any means answered the charge that has been levelled by the honorable member for Mackellar. He has contented himself with making a vicious attack on the mover of the motion, and has made no attempt to answer the charges contained in the motion itself. He has complained that the honorable member's letter supplies him with insufficient particulars. Yet he has before him a copy of the journal concerned, and so has the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell).</inline> How can they possibly complain justly that they do not know the particulars of the attack? In case there is any possible doubt about these particulars I shall give to the Leader of the Opposition some information about the articles of which we complain. On page 5 of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 15th February, one of them appears. This newspaper is described as an official organ of the Labour party, and is published in Adelaide at a price of 3d. a copy. Can the right honorable gentleman justly claim any longer that he has not sufficient particulars ? </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable gentleman made this nonsensical complaint that he has not sufficient particulars when he knows, as we all know, that the matter has been debated elsewhere. I say that his statement that he has not sufficient particulars of the matter is completely hypocritical. The two articles to which the honorable member for Mackellar referred are serious enough in themselves, but if any honor able member takes the trouble to read previous articles contained in back numbers of this newspaper, in the column entitled " Canberra Commentary ", by the same author, he will find that they are a part of a serious and studied plan. They teach a political and economic philosophy based on the theme of class war. They say that war is caused by profit-mongering armament-makers, and that innocent workers are led blindly to the slaughter by such people on both sides in any war, so that the armament-makers may be assured of profits. The writer goes on to state that there is no hope in the United Nations, but that the only hope for mankind is mass action by the workers - in other words, by a revolution of the proletariat. If any honorable member doubts the force of my contention, I can give to him a number of similar examples. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Nothing is said about Communist imperialism, and nothing about the Communist breach of the conditions and orders of the United Nations. Instead, the article claims that the Korean war was caused by " competing capitalist groups ". The whole plan of the argument is plain. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that this is not the place to raise these matters if they involve sedition. We have directed the attention of the House to them in order that the Opposition may not remain in ignorance of the sort of thing that is being done in the name of the Labour party. </para>
                    <para>The Opposition now has the opportunity to state where it stands and to make its position clear to the Australian people. I also hope that as a result of the attentionnow givento the articles in this House they will be examined by officers of the law. I cannot say whether they are, in fact, seditious or not according to law, and I am less concerned about that aspect of the matter than I am about their effect on the morale of the Australian people and of Australian soldiers fighting in Korea. </para>
                    <para>Two possibilities lie behind these articles. The first is that they are a part of a deliberate attempt to undermine the morale of the people and of our soldiers. If that is the case, then it is clear in whose interest the attempt is being made. The other possibility is that they are innocent and foolish - in short, that their author is a dangerous fool. In either case, where does the Labour party stand, and what does it intend to do? The whole of the argument that lies behind these articles is based on two premises. The first is that wars are organized by capitalists in pursuit of gains, and the second is that the only salvation for mankind lies in a revolution of the proletariat on both sides. For that argument to have any validity it would have to rest on two grounds. The first is that political attempts to avoid war are useless, and the second is that Communist imperialism and all that lies behind it, can be completely ignored. Does the Labour party support or reject these two assumptions? Let it give a plain answer to that question. It is of no use for honorable members opposite to avoid the issue, as the Leader of the Opposition has attempted to do, by launching an abusive attack on the mover of the motion. I hope that the honorable member for Melbourne, who is  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, will give a clear answer to the charge made by us. Does he support the premise that the United Nations is useless, and that Communist imperialism can be ignored? What the author of the. articles asks us to believe is that those who make armaments in the United States of America, Great Britain and Australia are in league with one another and with those who make armaments in Russia for the purpose of making profits. </para>

                        <para>.- It says something for the good sense and fundamental decency of honorable members on both sides of the House that five minutes after the honorable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth)</inline> had submitted this motion the majority of honorable members were nauseated by it. However, at the same time, it is significant that honorable members must submit to having thrust down their throats arguments of the kind that the honorable member for Mackellar advanced, because the majority has agreed to deal with this motion prior to dealing with the urgent problem of providing houses for ex-servicemen of World War II. and also for Australian soldiers who are now fighting in Korea. In those circumstances, it is disgusting to have to listen to the diatribe that the honorable member has discharged against some one whom he has not the " guts " to name. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw it. Th: honorable member for Mackellar has not named the man whom he has charged with the most atrocious crimes of sedition and treachery. The honorable member has sought to advance a step further towards the introduction of thought control into the Parliament. All that the writer, about whom he complained has done has been to propound a point of view about the campaign in Korea. I remind the honorable member that statements' of the kind which he now condemns have been published in conservative newspapers. But he has not directed attention -to those statements. The basis of this motion is a series of articles that were published in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin.</inline> I propose to show that the charge that the honorable member has levelled against the writer of the articles in Labour journals to which he has referred must also be preferred against the author of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> articles. If, as the honorable member has said, the former articles were written with the object of weakening unity among the Allies, the latter articles are more to be condemned. The writer of the articles in <inline font-style="italic">Labour Gall</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> took as his text those that had been published in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin.</inline> The contention of the articles as a whole was that the Chinese Communists and their North Korean allies were better fighters than the Americans. Referring to the Chinese Communists, the writer said - </para>

                        <para>The answer to the representative of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> is that the soldiers fighting in Korea under the flag of the UN should be told that they are not fighting to keep South Korea free. They are fighting to extend and strengthen American imperialism in Asian countries, and nothing else. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">In the guise of patriotism, the writer of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> articles made a miserable and sneaking attack upon the honour of United Nations soldiers whereas the writer of the articles that were published in Labour journals courageously dealt with doubts that had arisen in his mind. The honorable member, in his quaint phraseology, said that he was giving aid and comfort to the enemy. The man whom he has condemned gave great discomfort to the enemy when he carried a carbine as a member of the Australian Light Horse in South Africa many years ago. Furthermore, his familyhas been sorely stricken as a result of war. One of his sons gave his life in World War II. whilst another son was in the merchant navy, the members of which are the heroic, unsung heroes of the seas. However, the honorable member for Mackellar does not worry about facts of that kind. He has sought merely to destroy a man because of his own insensate hatred of those who hold views different from his own. He has dedicated himself to the proposition that single-handed he can destroy the menace of communism. As he suffers from that abberation it is impossible to help him. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has said, the case that the honorable member made was completely muddied. It was discursive and so far has been supported only by the honorable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne).</inline> Those honorable members gave a horrible example of spleen and posturing in making a most atrocious attack upon a man who had the courage to speak his mind and to stand up to what he said, knowing that in a democracy others who might defy him to the death would recognize that he had a right to state a point of view. It will be a sorry state of affairs if thought control should be introduced into this House and, as a concomitant of the treaty of peace with Japan a new menace, the Kempei Tai, should be brought here, mainly through the efforts of the honorable member for Mackellar, in order that the thoughts of honorable members shall be conditioned. All honorable members should recognize the rottenness of the case that the honorable member has made and reject the motion forthwith. </para>

                        <para>- The Fisheries Bill 1952 deals with general fisheries in Australian waters, and the Pearl Fisheries Bill 1952 is drafted in much the same way. It will simplify the consideration of the two bills if I point out that this Parliament has the constitutional power to make laws with respect to fisheries in Australian waters beyond the territorial limits. That is a most important power. The territorial limits, broadly speaking, define the jurisdiction of the States, and beyond those limits, and only beyond them, the Parliament of the Common wealth may pass laws and make regulations on the subject of fisheries. </para>

                        <para>- That is an important point. The Constitution does not define the term " Australian waters ". It has proved to be a broad and extensive concept. In the days before federation, the Federal Council of Australasia, which was a legislative body, and included New Zealand, passed legislation, with the authority of the Imperial Parliament, under the Federal Council of Australasia Act 1885, on various subjects, one of which was pearl fisheries. That act is to be repealed and replaced by this legislation. </para>

                <para>The purpose of this bill is to give power to regulate fishing craft and fisheries. That power is very wide, and includes authority to regulate, and authority to prohibit. It is important that the gap now existing in legislative enactments be filled. There is no power at present for the regulation of fisheries outside the territorial limits. The Commonwealth has the constitutional power to do so, but has never exercised it. The States have the power of regulation only within the territorial limits. It is extremely important that the Commonwealth's power should be exercisable by the appropriate department in respect of fisheries extending towards Australia, and Australian fisheries extending towards other places, and that the Parliament should give the necessary authority for such regulation. </para>

                        <para>- It extends to fisheries in Australian waters, but the term " Australian waters " is not defined by the Constitution. It is left to the courts to define " beyond territorial limits ". The authority must relate to fisheries that are not within the territorial limits, because the regulation of such fisheries is the exclusive prerogative of the States, and must apply to what are called " Australian waters ". In my opinion, that is a broad concept, and any area known to-day as Australian waters comes within the scope of that power. Let us suppose, for instance, that Japanese fishing craft come to the waters round New Guinea, whether it is the trust territory of New Guinea or Papua, or to the Australian coast, but well outside the three-mile limit. This Parliament has power to pass laws on that topic. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>The importance of Japanese fisheries is not simply a subject for argument because the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> mentioned in his speech on the Peace Treaty (Japan) Bill 1952 that Canada and the United States of America already have firm agreements with Japan that keep Japanese fishermen away from their waters well outside the three-mile limit. Such waters are fished by the nationals of Canada or the United States of America respectively. We have no such arrangement, as yet, but Japan agrees in the peace treaty to negotiate on this matter. So long as the power deals with fisheries in Australian waters outside the territorial limits, there are no restrictions upon it legally. That is to say, " Australian waters " may extend 50 or 100 miles outside the territorial limits as long as such waters are Australian. I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> to consider this point, because it is my firm conviction that " Australian waters " is not limited to the area round the continent of Australia, but extends to all the waters round our territories, including New Guinea, to the Admiralty Islands and the equator, the territories to the Antarctic, such as Heard Island, and the territories in the Pacific, such as Norfolk Island - in short, all those vast territorial interests of Australia outside the continent. Can those areas of ocean be fairly called " Australian waters " ? I believe that, legally, the Parliament can pass legislation that the Australian courts will uphold, and effectively prevent Japanese fishing craft from coming south of the equator in the area to which I have referred. When I make that statement, I do not mean that the Japanese can be prevented by our laws from fishing south of the equator well to the east and to the west of Australia. But I consider that such measures may be taken in respect of our possessions to the north of the Australian mainland. </para>
                <para>I come now to the broader, international aspect of this legislation. The Minister for External Affairs has stated correctly that legislation, authorized by this Parliament, is needed and that the Japanese fishing craft should be pinned down to a specified area. I do not think that the Japanese should fish south of the equator, which is an enormous distance from their own territories. When I make that statement I am not speaking of the Antarctic, although there are matters about fisheries in those waters that deserve special consideration, because the Japanese have broken every agreement that has ever been made with respect to the method of fishing in that area. I am thinking now of the fisheries nearer Australia. It is perfectly well known that before the last war the Japanese used their fishing craft for the purposes of observation and espionage in the waters that they subsequently tried to encompass, and indeed, nearly did completely encompass, to our disaster. The Government is in a difficult position regarding this matter, because Australia has not obtained what the United States of America and Canada took care to secure before the peace treaty with Japan - a firm agreement to keep the Japanese  outside  the Canadian and United States fisheries. A big protest meeting was held in California against an attempt by the Japanese to come to those fishing grounds. It is not that we wish to exclude the Japanese from access to raw materia] - in this instance, fish - but the Japanese have many fishing grounds nearer their own territory than are Australian waters. I hope that the Government will watch the position most carefully in order to ensure that our interests shall be protected. I am satisfied that he will have legal power, which Australian courts will recognize, to do this effectively under the terms of the bill. My remarks apply equally to the Pearl Fisheries Bill. Here is an instrument that is given by the Parliament to the Government in order to enable it to protect Australian fisheries and, indirectly, to prevent any abuse of Australia's security. The instrument is sharp enough for the purpose. The Government now has the responsibility of using it effectively, and I hope that it will do so. The Opposition supports the bill on that basis and it will watch with keen attention the action that the Government will take to implement the measure, having regard to the menace that I have mentioned. The Minister referred to nations other than Japan. He said that it should be easy for Australia to make agreements with Indonesia and Holland in respect of Dutch New Guinea and with Portugal in respect of Portuguese Timor. It should attempt to make such agreements as soon as possible. The most important task, however, is to make an agreement with Japan that will protect not only Australian fisheries but also, looking well ahead, Australian security. The course that I have suggested is the course that the Government should adopt in relation to both measures. </para>

                    <para>f4.47]. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - I assure the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> and the country that the purpose that the Government had in mind in introducing this legislation was, not merely to safeguard Australian fishing interests by enforcing conservative methods, but also to protect Australia's interests in the widest sense. The opinion expressed by the legal advisers of the Government, as I understand it, does not coincide exactly with the expressed legal view of the Leader of the Opposition. I believe that the Government's advisers are doubtful whether international law would permit the exercise of Australian authority under Australian statute law over foreigners in waters outside our territorial limits. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. There is some doubt on that point. Therefore, if control could be secured by means of agreement, a positive step forward would be made. It would be unreasonable, and possibly futile, to attempt to persuade any foreign power to accept limitations on its fishing rights outside Australian territorial waters unless the Australian Government had statutory power to impose similar limitations on Australian nationals in the same waters. <inline font-style="italic">\Qnorum formed.]</inline> This bill, when translated into law, will establish such power. I remind the House that Japan is under an obligation, according to the terms of the peace treaty, to enter into negotiations for an agreement in respect of fishing rights if it is called upon to do so by any one of the parties to the treaty. Australia, of course, will exercise that right. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition was wrong when he said that the Governments of the United States of America and Canada had secured from the Japanese, prior to the signing of the peace treaty, an agreement which entirely prohibited the Japanese from fishing in waters contiguous to the west coast of the North American continent. My advice is that the agreement placed limitations upon the quantity of fish that could be taken from those waters by the J  Japanese  and probably also upon the period of fishing and the area in which fishing operations could be conducted. The Government considers that this bill is essential to its plan for the conservation of Australian fishing resources and is a necessary preliminary step towards the negotiation of agreements with foreign countries. </para>

                        <para>.- The introduction of this short amending bill has been made necessary because, in the opinion of the Government's legal advisers, the power of the insurance commissioner, under section 19 of the Life Insurance Act, to refuse registration to a company that wishes to enter the field of life insurance is not sufficiently wide. At least two companies that are already engaged in other forms of insurance are known to have such heavy expense rates that it would be unfair to the insuring public to allow them to obtain automatic registration as life insurance companies. Under the act as it now stands, the insurance commissioner would be required to grant them registration. The original life insurance legislation introduced in 1945 by the Chifley Government represented the first attempt that had been made in 45 years of federation to enact Commonwealth legislation for the protection of the general public in all matters associated with life insurance. Previously, life insurance was regulated by State legislation, which differed widely. In some States, particularly New South Wales, there was virtually no protective legislation. The Victorian Parliament, in 1936 or 1937, gave effect to the recommendations of a royal commission on life insurance that it had established, Strange as it may seem, all the recommendations of the commission were adopted in full. It was one of the few royal commissions of which that can be said. The Chifley Government incorporated the same principles in its legislation in 1945, and, up to date, the act has worked remarkably well. Persons who wish to invest their money in life insurance premiums for the benefit of their dependants and their heirs are able to buy insurance at a reasonable rate. Premiums are fixed according to the average period of expectation of life determined by the last preceding census. Surrender values and paid up policies are provided for. In every respect, the act is one of the best pieces of legislation governing life insurance in any part of the world. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>However, the Government has now discovered a weakness that could not have been foreseen in 1945. It proposes that any insurance company which is not already registered for life insurance purposes but which wishes to engage in that class of business shall not be granted registration automatically and that the Treasurer shall have the right to refuse registration on the recommendation of the insurance commissioner if in the opinion of the commissioner, its expenses of management are excessive. It is not commonly realized that in some departments of life insurance offices, particularly in the industrial departments, the expense ratio has always been high. In the 1930's in Victoria as well as in other States, some companies had expense ratios of over 50 per cent., and some even 60 per cent. It should be noted that head offices of most of those insurance companies were situated in Sydney, and that there was no legislation on the New South Wales statute-book that gave any protection in this regard to the people of New South Wales. But the companies had to conform to such laws as were enacted in the States and particularly in the State of Victoria, where they had to conform to that splendid law enacted in the late 30's. One of the best insurance companies, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, had an expense ratio of 28 per cent. in its ordinary department and 42 per cent. in its industrial department. I think that the Government is to be commended for trying to protect the general public and, as imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I congratulate it on following the general lines of the legislation that was so excellently initiated by the Chifley Government. </para>

                        <para>-  I rise to a point of order. My motion was couched in a form that is used only on special occasions. It has already been resorted to to-day, and it seems that the amendment of the honorable member for Melbourne is designed merely to obstruct Government business. I claim that it is entirely out of order and that your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> is in accordance with the Standing Orders. </para>

                <para class="block">That standing order may be interpreted to mean that the Government is in charge of the notice-paper. But the motion to vary the order of business on the notice paper is an entirely different matter. In my opinion, once the Government proposes to alter the order of business on the notice-paper, it is quite clear that a member of the Opposition would be in order in moving an amendment to provide that a different order of business be laid down from that proposed by the Government. </para>

                        <para>.- This item concerns the gold-mining industry and a ministerial statement that was made to the House by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden).</inline> In that paper, the Treasurer stated that there had been a substantial change in the policy on gold, so that the International Monetary Fund might relax its conditions in regard to the sale of gold. I wish to emphasize that the position of the gold-mining industry is not a happy one because of a state of uncertainty as to what the future holds for it. That applies not only to the gold-mining companies. The business people of the gold-mining districts and the workers in the industry have a vested interest in its welfare. The workers who have been engaged in gold mining for many years have all their property in the district where the industry operates. It is too early to say that the relaxation of the conditions for the sale of gold on the open market through certain channels will prove of great assistance to the industry. It came into operation only a few months ago. There is little evidence yet to show whether it will be of value or not, but I know that a number of men who have been interested in gold mining are doubtful whether it has any value to the industry. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>During the Chifley Government's term of office, its policy was to place the gold mines in three categories. They were the producing mines, the mines that were on a marginal balance and the nonproductive mines. The last two were heavily subsidized. That policy has been abandoned, and many mining companies are spending substantial sums in trying to establish the industry. They are waiting for a lead from the Government. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> was good enough to hand to me the other day a statement setting out the operations of the International Monetary Fund, but there was little in it to encourage enthusiasm as to the future. It is generally accepted throughout Australia that the gold-mining industry is of great economicvalue to Western Australia. I am disappointed with the statement that was made by the Treasurer. I cannot find anything new in it, nor does it offer any definite policy for the future. Many miners feel so uncertain about it that they are prepared to sell their property and move elsewhere if they can get a job, rather than risk a crash. The Government is not acting honestly when it leaves people in such a state of uncertainty. It should do something to assist the non-productive mines. The owners are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds in various centres and are maintaining a substantial population without producing one ounce of gold. If people are enterprising enough to develop the country on those lines, and therefore advance the Government's own policy of decentralization, the Government should help the industry. </para>
                    <para>In 1949, the Prime Minister promised that if he was returned to office his Government would provide some lasting and permanent assistance to the gold-mining industry. </para>

                        <para>.- In his statement, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> dealt with the policy which allowed a certain percentage of the gold to be sold on the free world market. That included an announcement that the tax exemption that was previously granted to the industry was to be extended to cover that percentage of output which was sold overseas at a greatly enhanced price. It is strange that when tax exemptions are granted, they are given to the people who own the mines and who have put money into them, but not to the workers who work in the mines and produce the wealth and the dividends. I do not know why that is so. If the Government grants a tax exemption to those who get dividends from the gold mines, why is not the worker who is engaged in the industry equally entitled to it ? If the industry is of such a nature that labour and capital have to be attracted to it, and if the Government proposes to grant capital and exemption from tax on the money that it earns, similarly the worker should be granted a tax exemption on his earnings. I regret that the Government did not take that step when it permitted the sale of gold overseas at a higher price. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Whilst I concede that gold has its place in our scheme of things when the Government has dissipated our overseas balance so recklessly, nevertheless one cannot help contrasting the treatment given to the gold mining industry in connexion with taxation with the treatment given to the agricultural industry. At the same time as the Government takes away the 40 per cent, initial depreciation allowance, which operated for the benefit of the farmer, who produces something that is at least as urgently required as gold, it  contines  the tax-free exemption that it has granted to the gold producer. I am not arguing whether or not the gold producer should not have the benefit of that tax-free exemption, because I know that we wish to use our gold production to augment our overseas balances. At the same time, we certainly need food as urgently as we need gold in order to augment those balances and to feed our people. But when farmers' organizations put a case to the Treasurer that some differential treatment should be allowed in relation to taxes on primary production, they are told that it simply cannot be done because it would establish a new and dangerous principle in taxation. All I can say is that I am astonished to find that the Australian Country party accepts such a statement from the Treasurer, who, after all, is its leader. What the primary producers have asked for can be done, and in fact it is already done in relation to the gold industry. If the Government were really concerned about encouraging primary production and meeting the requests of the members of one of its  constitutent  parties, it could establish a system of tax-free exemptions for rural industries just as easily as it has done so in the case of the gold-mining industry. I hope that the members of the Australian Country party will not take this nonsense from their leader when he replies to their representations in relation to the tax liabilities of primary producers, but will show some backbone and  will stand up and fight for similar treatment to be given to farmers as has already been given to gold producers. The honorable member for Mallee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tunbull),</inline> who has just interjected, says that it is just a joke. I am not astonished that he considers it a joke, because he has never yet been fully seised of the importance of the primary producer to this country, and I do not believe he ever will be. </para>
                    <para>The next point I wish to make is that some gold-producing companies, particularly in Queensland, work ore that is also a source of sulphur, a material that is vital for the production of superphosphate, which is in short supply and will be in shorter supply in the near future. However, if those companies produced sulphur from the same ore as that from which they produce gold, they would lose their entitlement to the tax-free exemption. If the honorable member for Mallee, who is interjecting again, would listen to me and later make some representations to the Treasurer about this matter, he would be doing something more useful than he is doing by chattering away while I am speaking. </para>

                            <para>- May I ask him why gold-mining companies which fill a national need by producing sulphur from the same ore as that from which they produce gold should, by so doing, place themselves in a disadvantageous position in respect of the tax-free exemption. I understand that companies producing gold would lose their entitlement to that exemption if they produced sulphur from the same ore, as they could easily  do.  In other words, the Government is  pursuing  a policy which puts a  premium  on the non-production of a  commodity  that is vital to our primary production. One would have thought that,  in the  time that has elapsed since this  sessionbegan,  the Government would have  had  an opportunity to correct that  anomaly,,  if it intends to correct it at all. I  invite  the Treasurer to tell the House what  the  Government intends to do about  it, and  also to give to the primary producers-- </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">m reply</inline> - There  isreally  nothing material to which I  need  reply. The honorable member for  Yarra. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Keon)</inline> has continued his tactics  of  endeavouring to cast on the Australian Country party responsibility for everything that is wrong. If there is  one  thing that the Australian Country  party  is responsible for it is for the  basicprinciples  that have led to the  economic  well-being of the rural producers of Australia. The paper which we are debating refers to a modification of a former arrangement whereby  the  gold-mining industry was restricted,  as  a result of the decisions of the International Monetary Fund, in respect  of  the sale of gold. Those conditions have been relaxed to such a degree that  thu  gold-producing members of the fund  areallowed  to dispose of their gold on the free market. I had conferences with  tha  accredited representatives of the gold mining industry throughout Australia, and I can say that the Government  has  done for the industry exactly what  it  requested should be done. I should be surprised to learn that any dissatisfaction exists in the industry in connexion with the Government's policy in relation to  it.  The operation of the tax-free exemption provision is a mere extension of a concession that the gold-mining industry has hitherto enjoyed. </para>

                            <para>.- This debate arises from a statement that was made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> in relation to Middle Eastern affairs generally, which he delivered in the House on the 16th October of last year. I made a statement recently in the House on a variety of matters connected with international affairs, amongst which I dealt with Middle Eastern affairs. That statement brought my report to the House on that important part of the world reasonably up to date. Since then the only event of signal importance that has occurred in the Middle East has been that the former Prime Minister of Egypt, Aly Maher Pasha, has been replaced by  His Excellency  Naguib Hilaly Pasha, who has now held office for slightly more than a week. It is too early yet to make any reference to any trends that may develop out of the new Prime Minister's administration. I therefore have nothing useful to add to my previous statement to the House. The Government is kept fully informed of Middle Eastern affairs through our representatives in Cairo and also through the office of the Department of External Affairs in London. There is no outstanding matter of which I can acquaint the House that would be of particular importance to honorable members, so I shall not detain the House any longer on this matter. </para>

                        <para>.- The papers on native welfare that we are now debating were long and serious statements, just as other papers that we have had on this subject have been. Any honorable member who studies the situation that has existed over the last five years will come to the conclusion that, in common with all the other statements on the subject made by any government, this statement means exactly nothing. I mean that no change takes place as a result of the statement in the condition of the aborigines, particularly in the Northern Territory. Whilst we always get in these statements a plethora of principle, we also get a minimum of action. That is true of this report. At a scientists' congress that was held at Brisbane about eighteen months ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cook</inline> read a paper on native health. Having regard to the facts that it revealed, it was one of the most brutal papers that could have been read on the subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cook,</inline> who was speaking to a critical audience, described the natives of the Northern Territory and Australian aborigines generally as centres of infection. The time has arrived when papers that are tabled by the Minister should set out evidence of a definite programme. They should reveal facts, such as the number of doctors who have been appointed to a real medical staff to deal with native health. Honorable members, regardless of party affiliations, are tired of having presented to them papers of the kind that we are now discussing. We require to be supplied with evidence of a programme which, if it is to mean anything, must clothe itself in physical facts. We should be informed about the setup of an actual organization that is really capable of doing something at the minimum level, which is the health level, for our native people. The paper now before us is similar to those that have been tabled in this House during the last twenty years. Honorable members will recall the Bleakley report which referred to native health, tuberculosis, and lack of training for half-castes. The Thompson report, which was published ten years ago, was couched in similar terms. Neither of those reports meant anything at all insofar as a change of government policy was concerned. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Although the present Government has been in office for only two years, I direct the attention of the House to its record in respect of native affairs. On three occasions I asked the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> whether he would set up a health organization in the Northern Territory, and on each occasion he merely replied that he was conferring with the States on that matter. The States have no authority and no responsibility in the Northern Territory; but the Minister thought that that reply was adequate. Subsequently, I changed the line and asked him whether new Australian doctors could be appointed to posts in the Northern Territory in precisely the same way as such doctors have been appointed in New Guinea. ' After all, the non-registration of qualified new Australians as medical practitioners is a sham. It is due not to lack of qualifications but to a trade union principle. Australian doctors do not want too many doctors in practice in this country. However, if the Government, because British doctors are not available for appointments to such posts, can enable new Australian doctors to practise in New Guinea in positions in which they are responsible for the. health and lives of both whites and natives, why cannot new Australian doctors be appointed to posts in the Northern Territory to care for the health of the natives? The Minister for Health hasevaded giving a real answer to questions that I have addressed to him on that point. I do not speak accusingly, because I do not think that any government in the history of Australia has ever got really excited about the problem of native health. Periodically, humanitarian and church organizations have taken up the matter. But it has been merely a case of some officer being sent to the territories to make a survey just as was done when the Bleakley and Thompson reports were furnished. </para>
                    <para>Dealing with the problem of the prevalence of yaws among aborigines <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thompson,</inline> in his report which was made fifteen years ago, said that the affliction could be remedied by a simple course of injections and that as far as he could ascertain the natives were willing to subject themselves to the injections. Indeed, they coined a native term to describe the injection. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thompson</inline> did not think that it would be difficult to set up an organization to carry out that work. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cook,</inline> in a scientific paper that he wrote recently, made similar criticisms. Whilst I do not claim to be thoroughly informed about this matter, I assume that medical doctors would know their own fields and that when they made certain recommendations they would know what they were talking about. It would, indeed, be a change if instead of the kind of ministerial statements that have so far been presented to the House we were given reports that would indicate future Government policy and give definite facts about some organization that had actually been set up to handle the problem of native health. We want reports that contain statistics of treatment, because if the job is to be done somebody must be treated. A worthwhile survey of the problem would show that some improvement had been effected. I have no intention of attacking the Minister for Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hasluck).</inline> Indeed, long before he ever thought of entering politics he disclosed an excellent approach on his part towards this problem. I submit that an increased appropriation should be made in respect of this section of his department for the purpose of establishing an organization to cope with the problem of native health. If the Government cannot recruit Australian doctors with the requisite qualifications, it is time that it enlisted the services of highly qualified new Australian doctors, because it has complete authority over the registration of doctors in the territories that it administers. </para>

                    <para> -  I agree with what the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> has said, and I shall not repeat his remarks. I propose to refer only to that section of the report that deals with the problem of mixed blood. The problem that arises in relation to full blood, including the education of the natives and fitting them to take their place in the community, is a long-range proposition; but the problems in relation to mixed blood, particularly the problem of giving them rights to which they are justly entitled, can be dealt with immediately. The Australian community has every reason to be ashamed of the injustice that it has inflicted upon these people- It is true that under existing laws natives of mixed blood can be exempted from the provisions of ordinances that apply to aborigines aud thus be enabled to enjoy, as a right, the privileges that are enjoyed by white Australians. At present, the onus is placed upon the person concerned to prove that they have the right to full citizenship that is enjoyed by their white brethren. That right should be mads available automatically to natives of mixed blood. To-day, they are placed in a humiliating position. They are liable to pay income tax and also to conscription for service in the defence of Australia. Yet, they are still denied rights inherent in full citizenship. The Parliament cannot possibly justify that position. A male of mixed blood is entitled to vote at general elections. Indeed, after he reaches the age of 21 years, he is obliged under penalty to vote as an ordinary elector. If natives of mixed blood are deemed capable of performing these duties and are also under an obligation to perform them they are obviously entitled to the rights and privileges of full citizenship. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I make this plea, on behalf of not only natives of mixed blood now living in our midst, but also unborn generations, because the latter will feel to a greater degree the humiliating position in which natives of mixed blood are placed to-day. That humiliation will be felt more acutely as the barrier of colour tends to disappear in succeeding generations. I again urge the Government to remedy this injustice immediately, not only in our own interests, but also in the interests of humanity. Considerable discontent exists among the coloured community, not only in the Northern Territory, but also wherever they may be found throughout Australia. They are now asking for rights to which they are justly entitled, and I believe that as a white community we should make those rights available to them, not only out of a spirit of generosity, but also on the ground of natural justice. In this matter the Australian Government should give a lead to the States by granting to natives of mixed blood in the territories that it controls full rights of citizenship which have been denied to them for many years. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> made certain criticisms. Whilst I appreciate the force of a good deal of what he said, I point out that this report does not purport to be a survey of administrative action. It has been made as a result of a conference that the Australian Government initiated between Commonwealth and State representatives with a view to drawing up a programme of action. The report does not purport to give a review of what has been done. It sets out a programme of action in which the Commonwealth and States have agreed to take certain steps in- their respective administrative spheres during the coming year. The honorable member for Fremantle referred to the report that had been furnished by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cook. Dr.</inline> Cook collaborated  with  other  Commonwealth  officers in the preparation  of that  section of  this  programme of action  which  sets out in some detail matters-  with  respect to native health. He was  one of  the authors of that section of the  report which  deals with the health  matters to which  the honorable member has  referred- </para>
                    <para>I was very pleased to hear the  remarksthat  the honorable member for the  Northern  Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> made.  One of  the most encouraging and heartening  signstoday  in Australia so far as  native  welfare is concerned is that persons  who&gt;  have lived in the Northern Territory  and  have been in daily contact  with nativesand  people of mixed blood are among  the  stoutest champions of the rights  of our  native people. Contrary to the  impression  held by some people in the  southern  parts of Australia, a <inline font-style="italic">very large</inline> number  of the people in the Northern  Territory  are to-day sympathetic towards the  future  of the natives and have constructive  ideas  regarding the best means of helping  them.  It is also true, of course, that there  arestill  some who discuss the problem  without  sympathy. However, it would  bequite  wrong to imagine that the  people  of the north who know the  problem  best do not wish to see great improvements made. In fact, since I took  office,  I have found great encouragement  in the  attitude of the people of the  north  and, in contrast, have found  that i»  the southern areas of Australia,  whilst it  is true that many advocates of natives'' rights have both experience and  understanding  of the subject, many persons  whoclaim  to be most certain of what should be done for aborigines and people  of  mixed blood have not first hand knowledgeof it. I welcome the remarks of  the  honorable member for the Northern Territory, and I assure him that  what he  said in relation to the rights of the  people  of mixed blood accords with the  accepted  policy of the Government which is  endeavouring  to ensure that all persons  living  in Australia shall have the privileges  of  citizenship as a right and that  such a  right shall be withheld from them  only if,  by reason of their present conditions,  it  be found that special arrangements  are- needed for their guardianship and tutelage during a transitional period. I assure him that the Government will give serious consideration to the particular representations he has made- </para>

                                <para>- It is not customary to have a ministerial statement printed. If the Government wishes to have the paper printed, the Printing Committee will attend to the matter. The motion for the printing of a ministerial statement is a form that is used in the House in order to provide an opportunity for discussion upon a particular subject. It is news to me that a motion for the printing of a paper can be carried. </para>

                                <para>- The paper is always printed if the motion is agreed to. I have in mind ministerial statements that have been made from time to time on international affairs. It is correct to say that the motion for the printing of such a paper provides an opportunity for discussion, which is formally concluded when the motion is agreed to. The Opposition has not objected to the motion for the printing of this paper, the subject matter of which is most informative. </para>

                                <para>- I rise to order. I have had extensive experience as a member of the Printing Committee, and I know that a motion of this kind is a form of parliamentary machinery. The House indicates that it wishes a paper to be printed, and the Printing Committee subsequently decides whether a large number or a limited number of copies of it shall be printed. Departmental reports that are laid on the table and not ordered to be printed are also dealt with by the committee. It is customary for the motion for the printing of a paper to be agreed to. </para>

                    <para>. - I direct the attention of the House to a condition of inequity in the Australian Capital Territory which, I consider, lies within the power of the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kent Hughes)</inline> to correct. For some time there has existed in Canberra an organization known as the A.C.T. Hire Car Proprietors' Association. For several years, every hire car proprietor in the territory was a member of that organization. "Within recent years, the association, with the approval of the Department of the Interior, had telephone 'boxes erected on the several hire car ranks. The telephones were leased to the hire car proprietors' association and its members had the exclusive use of them. That system worked satisfactorily until about halfway through last year, when one member of the association, having fallen out with his comrades, resigned officially from it. As a result of that decision, he was debarred from using the telephones at the hire car ranks. The A.C.T. Hire Oar Proprietors' Association, quite legally and properly, placed locks on the telephones so that only its members, who were provided with keys, could use the instruments. The effect of that move was to deprive the non-member of the association of the full use of the hire car ranks which, as I have pointed out, were established and are maintained by the Department of the Interior. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I do not cavil at the decision of the association to place locks on the telephone boxes, but I do take exception to the condition which so limits the activities of a man who has been granted a licence to operate as a hire car proprietor. When the ranks were provided with telephone boxes, the public in the Australian Capital Territory were persuaded by newspaper and radio advertisements to discontinue the practice of telephoning individual hire car proprietors, and to use the numbers of the several hire car ranks. The hire car proprietor affected by this decision approached me, and claimed that his living, and his right to make full use of the hire car ranks, were being limited. I had several discussions with him and also with officials of the A.C.T. Hire Car Proprietors' Association at that time, and with the responsible officers of the Department of the Interior. The general decision among* them was that the best way in which the position could be resolved would be for the hire car proprietor concerned to rejoin the association so that, once again, all the hire car operators would be able to use the telephones on the ranks. </para>
                <para>Possibly, the hire car proprietor to whom I refer is an irascible and perhaps a litigious man, but he did agree to sink his pride and rejoin the association, on the understanding that he would be welcomed back as .a member and that the position would be resolved to everyone's satisfaction. He made an application to the association for re-admission; it was dealt with at a meeting of the association last night. The application was rejected by one vote. The position now is that this man, although he is a registered hire car proprietor and holds a licence from the Department of the Interior, is denied full use of the facilities provided by the department for the use of hire car proprietors and the general public. I do not hold a brief for the hire car proprietor concerned or for the A.C.T. Hire Car Proprietors' Association, and I am critical of neither one nor the other, but I believe that the decision that was taken last night by the association points to the need for action by the Department of the Interior. Regulation 26 of the Motor Hire Car Regulations, published in volume 2 of the <inline font-style="italic">Laws of the Australian Capital Territory</inline> reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Where more than one public hire car is upon a public stand the vehicle nearest to the telephone box on such a public stand shall, unless the person hiring selects a particular vehicle, have a right to the hiring. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I contend that any man who is not a member of the association is denied that  right, because the telephones are the property of the association and quite rightly or quite legally, it has decided to lock the boxes and provide only its members with keys to open them. Therefore, a man who is not a member of the association is now denied the right to make full use of the public ranks, which are maintained by the Department of the Interior, and to gain a full living from the licence that he holds from the  deparment.  I hope the Minister for the Interior will examine the matter, following the rejection of the man's application for re-admission to the association, and ascertain whether any action can be taken to rectify the position generally. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that I may rot criticize the Government. I thought that the Standing Orders would not preclude me from doing so. However, the fact is that order of the day No. 11 relates to the subject of war service homes. It is an important statement by the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Townley)</inline> on the termination or repudiation of certain obligations that had been entered into by the Government with returned servicemen. It is perfectly true that the Minister made a statement a few days ago in which he announced a mitigation of the effect of that repudiation in a few instances; but the real issue is that finance was refused for the completion of the annual programme for the benefit of returned servicemen under the War Service Homes Act. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to discuss it. I merely wish to refer to the crucial importance of the matter. It is not my purpose to anticipate discussion on it. Indeed, my only wish is to accelerate the discussion on this subject. The hour is early. We have ample time to discuss the subject of war service homes, which is of general importance. The Vice-President of the Executive Council is almost scurrying away from this matter of paramount importance. I do not know of any occasion in the history of this Parliament when a similar incident has occurred. When item 11 is reached I propose to move an amendment with the object of directing the Government to continue to grant assistance for war service homes until the end of this financial year. I do not know what view will be taken on that amendment by the House, but it is well known to honorable members that an acute division of opinion has occurred in the ranks of the Government itself on the subject. </para>

Rut I contend that the Government should provide an opportunity for such a discussion at this early hour. The Opposition objects to the adjournment of the House when there is ample time for a discussion of the ministerial statement. It is clear that the purpose of adjourning the House at such an early hour is simply to burke the discussion. On behalf of the Opposion, I oppose the motion for the adjournment. The matter could be discussed to-night. Unless the Government plans to have the Parliament prorogued in order to burke discussion still further, we shall have an opportunity to debate the subject to-morrow morning. There is no reason why we should not proceed with the discussion now. </para>

                    <para>.- In the few remarks that I shall make I shall avoid most sedulously any reference to any subject that is mentioned on the notice-paper in accordance with the instructions that you have given, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> under the Standing Orders. A most serious position has developed in relation to the housing of ex-servicemen, and I want to direct the attention of the House, as is my right during an adjournment debate, to the facts of that position. During the last six months, the planned policy of the Government in relation to the disposition of funds for the housing of ex-servicemen has had the most grave consequences. In the first place, the parsimonious Treasury allotted a certain sum for this purpose, but that fund has been exhausted, and ex-servicemen who, bv their own skill, have succeeded in finding houses for sale that have been occupied previously and which, therefore, are classified under the regulations that relate to war service homes as being "not new "- </para>

                        <para>- I must reiterate the comment by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> that the Government is scuttling for cover after the protestations that it has made of undying fealty to ex-servicemen. It lacks the intestinal fortitude to stand up to the Opposition and debate this issue. There is plenty of time available. We have to-night and to-morrow, and the Opposition is prepared to stand up and contest this issue with the Government man to man. The Government is merely taking advantage of the processes of the House in order to make it impossible for us to argue our case. </para>

                <para>I am completely hemmed in by th') spears of the Government so that I cannot state my point of view to the House. All that I can do is to state the particular complaints that I have received from electors whom I represent. I refer to those complaints now. I have received a letter from an elector who has been in  grave difficulties with the War Service Homes Division. This is a departmental matter that I refer to the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Townley)</inline> for his consideration. The file number of the letter that this man has received is " JE/  " - and the emphasis should be on the stroke because any ex-serviceman who has anything to do with the War Service Homes Division is likely to be stricken- <inline font-style="italic">f</inline> 4477RN ". It is addressed to an ex-serviceman at Dulwich Hill, Sydney, who, in October last received a message from the division directing him to present himself immediately with £682 14s. 7d. in his pocket. He was informed that, upon the production of the money, a house would be prepared for him forthwith. The man obtained the money with some difficulty and paid it to the division. He was told that the land on which the house was to be erected had been surveyed, and he waited happily for further news. Incidentally, he was told that these days everybody ought to have £700 available! In January of this year he was again called by the division and asked, because of rising costs, to provide an additional sum of £106 5s. 5d. Thus, the Government's planning has imposed hardships in two ways on ex-servicemen who wish to obtain houses. First, the Treasury restrictions on credit make it necessary for an applicant to provide a large sum initially. Secondly, delays involve him in increasing expenditure because of the effect of rising prices. </para>
                <para>In due course, this man took his wife and family to Miranda, where the house was to be built, and found that not a stone had been turned. What was the need for such urgency on the part of the War Service Homes Division in demanding money? The telegram that he received in October of last year directed him to present himself within 24 hours with almost £700 in cash. No contract has been let for the construction of the house and now fresh tenders have been called. The War Service Homes Division has no intention of proceeding with the construction of those planned blocks of houses at Miranda because it cannot obtain contracts for their erection. Why did it not tell this ex-serviceman so ? Tt should have informed him that the whole show had gone up in smoke:- - It has no intention of building many of the houses for which it has made arrangements with applicants, or of financing the purchase of houses- </para>

                <para>The second case that I have in mind is that of Ronald Archibald Davis, of 155a Denison-street, Dulwich Hill. This young man lives in a house occupied by eight persons. He has a wife and one child, and he has tried by all means at his disposal to obtain more suitable accommodation than he has at present. He located a house, for sale at Herne Bay, not far from the housing settlement there. He was told that an amount of £700 would have to be paid as a deposit. The negotiations were of such a nature, he has informed me, that it was necessary for him to conclude the deal swiftly. Otherwise there would have been no sale. The tentative contract would have been ' cancelled by the vendor. Last Monday the vendor notified him that, unless the remainder of the purchase money was produced, the sale would be cancelled. The deposit of £700 was in jeopardy. The ex-serviceman immediately approached the War Service Homes Division and asked that financial aid be expedited, but he was bluntly told that no more money could be made available for houses other than new houses and that he had been guilty of a careless gesture in. paying a deposit of £700. He thought that it was very strange to hear such talk from officials of the division merely because, in his anxiety to obtain a house for his wife and child, he had not consulted them in the first instance. Because the Government will not honour its promise, he is in danger of having all the money that he has saved since the war whipped away from him. Those savings include his deferred pay and the war gratuity that was conserved for the purpose of helping men to obtain houses. He has mentioned all these facts in a letter in- which he has made an appeal to me, which now I make to the Minister for Social Services. This man is under notice of eviction from the temporary premises in which he now lives under appalling conditions. As he has pointed out to me, his treatment, by the War Service Homes Division is a poor reward for the honest, unswerving service that he gave to his country.. He has suggested that, if the Government is in a dilemma, it can escape only by providing more money. It should not let this dreadful situation remain in the air until the Parliament goes into recess so that it will be left to the decision of public servants. </para>

The first letter concerns a man who wanted to build a new house but. who found that in spite of the fact that he had £700 in cash it was impossible for him to do so. </para>

                    <para>. - The Opposition opposes this motion. During the last three quarters of an hour, honorable members have seen once more that the Government is taking extraordinary pains, which are obvious to all, to avoid discussion on an item of importance which is on the notice paper relating to war service homes. The hour is early and it would be quite possible to have a discussion on the subject. I am not going into the merits of the question, as I know that there are divisions of opinion on it which extend even to the Government side of the House. I propose, therefore, to move an amendment to omit all words after " to ", first occurring, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following word : " to-morrow ". </para>

                        <para>- I appreciate your point, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and respectfully concur with it, but the amendment would have the same effect as the defeat of the motion. The main point put forward by the Opposition is simply and primarily that the House has an important matter to discuss. The Government is determined to use its majority to force the closure in order to prevent that matter from being discussed to-night. We wish the House to discuss that issue so that we may have an opportunity of taking the opinion of the House about whether this repudiation of the Government's obligations to ex-servicemen in respect of existing homes shall take effect or not. We say that it should not take effect, and we shall therefore vote against the motion. </para>

                        <para>. - I direct the attention of the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> to a matter of tremendous importance that concerns the housing of Australian citizens. When the present immigration scheme was first formulated, I told the Premiers of the States that it would be their responsibility to see that accommodation available to Australian citizens should not be disturbed because of the expected influx of immigrants. I also gave an assurance that no Australian would be disturbed in his employment. Unfortunately, no State government has yet seen fit to pass legislation in order to guarantee that Australian citizens shall not be disturbed in their domestic accommodation. Since I have been in Opposition in this House, and earlier when I was Minister for Immigration, I urged the Premiers to pass legislation to prevent any newcomer to. our shores from being able to buy a property until he had been resident in Australia for a period of at least five years. I also suggested to the Premiers, and I have advocated this course publicly, that any Australian who has been for two years, or longer, in occupation of premises should not be disturbed by those who buy property and try to evict Australians in order to provide accommodation for relatives who are to follow them from overseas. Unless something is done to protect Australians who occupy houses for which they have paid rent for ten, fifteen or twenty years, there will be a reaction against immigration which neither the Minister nor I would desire. I believe that all newcomers are entitled to a house and that, where necessary, they should be assisted to build houses; but they should not be allowed to buy properties and disturb Australians who are already in possession of accommodation. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; and no State government has yet been prepared to take action to protect the interests of Australians and their right to remain in houses in which they have lived for a long time. I also find that some municipal authorities will not take action to see that overcrowding shall not take place in many houses in which newcomers are living and in which they are being exploited in the matter of rents by persons of their own blood. Far too many persons are living in small rooms and are being charged very high rents. That is not a good thing for the newcomers or from the viewpoint of the general health of the community. It is a condition of affairs that militates against the assimilation of newcomers. It has resulted from the readiness with which persons who are not of Australian birth but many of whom are British nationals can now buy and dispossess Australians of houses in which they are living. In such circumstances, there is a tendency on the part of newcomers to gather in pockets according to their former nationality. Whilst I have no objection to new Australians gathering together in small numbers because they speak the same language or to persons who were not born in Australia speaking their own language in this country and, under supervision, having newspapers printed <inline font-style="italic">j.m1</inline> their native language, it would be a good thing from everybody's point of view if newcomers were despersed to the greatest possible degree. The Minister is in possession of papers that relate to certain property in my electorate and is aware of the matters that I have mentioned. I ask him to make representations on this subject to the Premiers at the next conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. I certainly intend to take up the matter through the executive of the Victorian division of the </para>

Quite a lot of Australians are being evicted because the houses in which they live are being sold over their heads. Unfortunately, many Australians arc only too willing. to sell houses at fancy prices and have no objection to seeing their fellow Australians evicted from them. That practice is socially bad and idefensible in every respect. </para>
                    <para>I direct the attention of the House to the fact that the tune, <inline font-style="italic">Majestic Fanfare,</inline> has been adopted recently by the Australian Broadcasting Commission in place of the great Australian anthem, <inline font-style="italic">Advance Australia Fair.</inline> I have been informed by a correspondent that the tune, <inline font-style="italic">Majestic Fanfare,</inline> has allegedly been arranged by an English composer, Vaughan Williams. My correspondent directs my attention particularly to the word " arranged " as it has been used by the  chairman  of the commission ; and he also tells me that the tune <inline font-style="italic">Majestic Fanfare,</inline> so called, is identical with a tune that was used by the Germans during World War II., in the announcement of special communiques when, for instance, German forces captured a town or defeated a section of the Russian army. If it were a good old Nazi tune, it is certainly not a good tune for the Australian Broadcasting Commission to use. It is nonsense to say that it has been arranged by an English composer if it is identical with a Nazi tune. It would be better for the commission to forget the pretence and play, say, <inline font-style="italic">Lily of Marleane,</inline> or any other such tune; but to substitute a Nazi tune for an Australian anthem is just the sort of thing I should expect from my knowledge of the mental outlook of some of the persons who play a part in running the commission. I am astonished that the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> was not aware of the facts that I have just mentioned. If he were also Minister for Information, as I once was, he would have been aware of them. Now that he has been made aware of them he should take action to ensure that no more Nazi tunes shall be played by the Australian Broadcasting Commission under conditions under which a royalty is paid to somebody who, allegedly, arranged the tune, but, in fact, did not alter one note of it. </para>

                        <para>.- This House should not go into recess until it has received a promise from the Government that it will render the fullest possible financial assistance to the Olympic Federation for the purpose of financing the appearance of Australian athletes at the Olympic Games to be held at Helsinki. We are proud of the athletic records of Australian men and women. Honorable members who saw the film that was shown in the Senate Club Room this evening must have been delighted at the wonderful demonstration of physical and mental health, endurance and courage that was given by althletes of all nationalities when competing at the Olympic Games that were held in London. Australia has every reason to be proud of its athletes. Although our population is small, nevertheless our sportsmen and sportswomen have for many years ranked high among world athletes and have brought great credit to this country. </para>

The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> has just returned from overseas where he was engaged on a mission upon which he has not ' yet reported to the Parliament, although the cost of it must have amounted to some thousands of pounds. Surely, when many small nations can afford to finance the appearance of . their sportsmen at the Olympic Games, Australia, of whose athletic manhood and womanhood all of us have cause to be proud, should be able to do likewise. I appeal to the sporting; instincts of all honorable members.

I  am  quite certain that no honorable member wishes Australian citizens to be removed from houses through any process of  that  kind, but I am alarmed at the policy statement put forward by the honorable gentleman as an authoritative spokesman for the Labour party. He considers  that  legislation should be passed by the  State  parliaments  to  prevent a new settler  from  purchasing  b  house - until he has  -been  here for a period of at least five years. The honorable gentleman indicated  that  lie would press his colleagues in  'the  Victorian Parliament to pursue  that  policy, and we  all  know how much'  influence  the Labour party has on the present Government- of that State.

                            <para>- I accept the amendment that the honorable gentleman now puts forward. The whole problem requires more careful thought than possibly he has given to it. We in Australia cannot expect people to come here and accept all the difficulties that settlement in a new homeland brings with it while denying to them the opportunity^ which is one of the fundamental opportunities offered in any civilized country, to acquire their own, dwellings. I agree that we do not want newcomers to dispossess Australian citizens in order to acquire houses for themselves, and, therefore, I consider that this Government and, indeed, this Parliament can serve the country better by concentrating on the positive measures that can be taken to encourage housing instead of" looking for an additional restriction that will make conditions even -more difficult for those who embark upon  the  tremendously difficult business of settling in a new country. I claim that this Government has done a great deal in that direction, and my claim is based not on words but on actual results. I have before me an article that was published as recently as yesterday on the leader page of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, which, I think, enjoys the high respect of Opposition members. The article bears the heading," " What the figures show" and the sub-heading, " New houses overtaking the urgent demand ". The article states, in part - </para>

                    <para class="block">The figures in the article reveal that in 1948-49, 52,684 houses, including new flats were built; in 1949-50, 56,900 new dwellings; and in 1950-51, the first complete year in which this Government was in office, more than 69,000 new dwellings. Up to the 30th June last - and this is a significant figure - 83,722 houses were under construction compared with 68,000 in the corresponding period in the pre  vious  year, or an increase of 15,000 new houses in that period. That is not just a fortuitous result. This Government has recognized that, if it is to bring new settlers here, it must accept the responsibility for ensuring that they shall obtain accommodation and make their contribution to the problem of providing housing. </para>

                    <para>I wish to deal particularly with the point raised by the honorable member for Melbourne about the purchase of houses by immigrants. I point out that such persons have been required to make a contribution to the housing position. Many of them have been under contract to the Government to work where required for a period of two years, and a substantial proportion of them have been placed in the timber, brick, cement and tile industries, which are directly related to housing. They also assist to build houses that they may later occupy. That, in itself, has been an important direction in which newcomers have been used during the first two years of their residence in this country. Europeans who come to Australia under the Commonwealth scheme are provided with accommodation. Other persons come here on the nomination of a friend, relative or employer upon whom we throw the responsibility of providing their accommodation. So, in order to relieve the pressure on Australians in regard to the  acquisition of homes, we have acted in various important directions, such as placing labour in places where it can do the moat good, and in the industries that assist in the erection of homes.  I  shall not elaborate those matters because I believe that the facts that  I  have placed before the House speak for themselves.  I  hope that no political party, whether in the Commonwealth sphere or a State sphere, will try to impose upon new settlers restrictions so onerous that we shall discourage people from coming to Australia and helping us to develop this land and make it more secure. Australia  i3  only one of many countries that are trying to attract new settlers at the present time, and  I  know of no other country that has placed upon the acquisition of houses the kind of restriction that the honorable member for Melbourne has recommended.  I  hope that his statement does not represent the settled policy of the Labour party, and that it will not be adopted before it has been carefully considered. </para>

                        <para>.- Although the Government has not made a definite announcement, it can be assumed that the Parliament will be closed for at least a few months. Therefore,  I  shall take this opportunity to direct attention to certain matters that I regard as of the utmost importance. I have not yet been able to raise them in the House during the few weeks it has been open. First,  I  shall refer to housing.  I  agree with the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> that the situation in regard to the purchase of new and occupied houses by new arrivals is completely unsatisfactory. A housing official in New South Wales informed me that he and his colleagues know to the day how long a new Australian has been in this country, because the moment the new Australian completes twelve months' residence, he applies for emergency accommodation. Nobody knows exactly  where  he has been accommodated in the interim period. It is all very well for the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> to read figures and passages from newspaper articles in an attempt to make it appear that the housing position is improving. Let him consider the position of one of the unfortunates who has been registered with a State Housing Authority for a long time ! He does not hope to get a permanent dwelling; he is merely seeking emergency accommodation; yet he has to wait for years before it becomes available. It will be poor consolation to such a person to learn that the Minister considers that the housing position is improving. The State governments cannot provide emergency accommodation for many persons, a considerable number of whom are ex-servicemen. The Minister has spoken of the Government's obligation to new arrivals in this country. I do not blame the unfortunate individuals, who have been induced to come here, for the position, because they are human beings and must have somewhere to live; but the Government is to be condemned for having brought those people to this country, to add to the existing difficulties of the Australian community. A number of opinions has been expressed by experts about the housing lag, which has been estimated at times to be as high as  300,000  houses. The Government requires at least four years to overtake that lag, and that calculation does not take into account the provision of dwellings for new arrivals and young couples who will marry during that period. Therefore, those unfortunate people who are being dispossessed of their homes by new Australians with plenty of money must be in despair. Many of the persons who have been evicted are ex-servicemen. Whilst it is true that an ex-serviceman may make application to the War Service Homes Division, he is simply listed among those waiting for a house and, in fact in many instances he will be kept waiting for years. The housing shortage will become more acute as a result of the Government's credit restriction policy, yet the Minister has the audacity to claim that the position is improving. I do not consider that it is improving. In my electorate, people continually ask me whether I can help them to obtain any kind of accommodation for themselves and their kiddies. Many of them live in basements, and the health of their children is being affected. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is an absolute scandal that the Government should seek to close this Parliament for some months while people are faced with such urgent problems. </para>
                    <para>I now propose to refer to retrenchments in the Public Service. Honorable members have the right to ask questions without notice, or place them on the notice-paper, but my questions during this sessional period have been met with evasion after evasion on the part of Ministers. I asked the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> a question about a matter, the answer to which would not require days or weeks of research. I wished to know whether it was a fact that ex-servicemen were being dismissed from government departments and were being replaced with female juniors. Many of those men had been employed by the Commonwealth for years as temporary officers. The Prime Minister replied that he had no knowledge of the matter, but would have inquiries made about it. I asked the question some days ago, yet I have not received an answer. I am in a position to say that many ex-servicemen, who have had many years' experience in various departments, have been dismissed and replaced with female juniors. One man whom I have in mind was employed in the records branch of the child endowment section of the Department of Social Services. He has been dismissed and his position taken by a female junior. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for Supply <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> is in charge of Commonwealth motor car pools in the capital cities. A direction has been issued for the elimination of overtime in that section of the department. Of course, that instruction does not mean that economies will be effected by a reduction of the use of motor cars. It simply means that various private hire car services are now7 engaged in running their vehicles after hours when they are required by government officials and members of the Government. Those private transport services are being paid an exhorbitant rate for the use of their motor cars, and the Government has not effected an economy because the cost of hiring the private vehicles is greater than would have been the case had the Common- wealth service been continued. The employees of the Commonwealth motor car pools have not objected to working overtime, and, therefore, I see no reason for the change. However, this Government always prides itself on its confidence in private enterprise, and is eager to pass any plums over to the persons who make contributions to its party funds. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> has informed the House that youths of eighteen years, when they complete their training under the national service scheme, are given the opportunity to decide whether they wish to join the permanent forces, which means, in effect, that they may be sent to any theatre of operations in any part of the world. That practice, in my opinion, is wrong. A boy of eighteen is not entitled to vote in Australia, and the official viewpoint is that he has not reached an age at which he is capable of making important decisions. But such young men are being induced to volunteer for service anywhere in the world by being deliberately placed in a position in which they would be embarrassed in front of their camp mates if they refused to do so. Many of them volunteer against the wishes of their parents and without realizing the possible consequences of their action. I believe that no person in the community should be called upon to make such a decision unless he has reached the age of 21 years or, alternatively, unless he has obtained the consent of his parents. It is scandalous that the Government should permit this practice to continue. </para>
                    <para>We have heard a great deal of boasting recently about what the Government is supposed to have done to assist the pensioners. But the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Allan Fraser)</inline> exposed the hypocrisy of those vainglorious claims when he pointed out that the percentage of the basic wage that is represented by the age pension to-day is probably lower than it has ever been previously. The position of pensioners to-day is desperate. I notice that the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> laughs. He is not worried by the problem of finding a way to maintain existence from day to day. This honorable gentleman, with his tax-free allowance and increased salary, declared in this House recently that the Government had gone to the limit with social services and could go no further. I a-n glad that the Minister for Social Services (Air. Townley) is in the chamber at present, because I shall expose the shocking state of affairs that now exists. A Brisbane newspaper publishes a column, " Your Good Health, by Truth's Own Doctor ". Readers are invited to submit health problems for the doctor to solve. This is a summary of a letter that was written to the doctor by a pensioner - </para>

                    <para class="block">It is all very well for honorable members on the Government side of the chamber to laugh, but the simple fact is that many unfortunate Australians cannot afford to buy meat and other important foods and are being advised by medical men to apply for special medicines under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </para>

                            <para>- It may seem so to the honorable member, but to me it is not a pleasing thought that many of those who are willing to fight for my defence at this time are less than twenty years of age. I am sure that every honorable member will agree with me in this respect. Australians have been let in for the obligation to keep their end up primarily by honorable members opposite. The Opposition has not questioned the necessity for us to defend our country and to take a stand alongside the other members of the United Nations in the conflict in Korea. However, it has displayed a marked reluctance to assist in the raising of forces for the defence of the country and for service on our behalf overseas. Therefore, I consider that the remarks of the honorable member for East Sydney were utterly lacking in sincerity. A thousand Australians are at present on the way to Korea to fight for this land. </para>

                        <para>.- I take strong exception to the Government's decision to terminate the current series of sittings at this stage, especially in view of the present impoverished position of many Australians. The Government proposes to adjourn the House until after the Easter season, at which we shall commemorate the crucifixion of our Saviour. But many of us will go back to poverty and despair in our electorates. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>As a result of the action of this Government in permitting cheap overseas goods to enter Australia, 300 of my electors were dismissed last week and 300 more will be dismissed next week. Cheap rayon goods that were manufactured in Japan have been imported into Australia under the British preferential tariff because they were shipped from Hong Kong. Members of this Parliament have improved their own financial position by passing legislation that provides for the payment to us of higher salaries and allowances. But what of others whom we are supposed to represent? What of the pensioners? They have not been granted an increase of their miserable pittance. I shall not discuss the subject at length. I merely remind honorable members that we have helped ourselves, but have done nothing for the poorest people in the community. </para>
                    <para>A serious housing problem has developed in the Hunter electorate. A former military camp at Greta, which accommodated 14,000 troops during World War II., is now being used to house 12,000 new Australians. It is a holding centre for the wives and children of immigrants who are employed elsewhere. Some of the men have been sent to Queensland, but many of them have been absorbed in the heavy industries of Newcastle. I have asked the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> to make use of two vacant blocks of huts at Greta to provide accommodation for at least some of these workers and their families. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Government should ask the New South Wales Government to institute a daily train service for these workers between Branxton and Newcastle so that they may live with their wives and children. Does not the Government want to promote happiness and contentment amongst these new Australians, many of whom suffered privation and brutal treatment under the nazi regime in Germany? I visited Germany in 1945 and I saw many such people who were then still living in the camps where Hitler's nazis had persecuted and tortured them, because there was no other place for them to go after the Allies had taken control. </para>
                    <para>The Parliament should remain in session because the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> has recently returned from abroad and proposes to make a very important statement to Cabinet next week. When will the Parliament be able to discuss this statement if we adjourn to-night? What are the proposed economies that the Treasurer intends to recommend to Cabinet? Will they usher in another depression? Many Australians will suffer desperate poverty over the Easter period and we should not adjourn at this stage. The Burlington and Bradford textile factories at Rutherford have been severely affected by the importation of cheap Japanese rayon goods. The Rutherford factory was a munitions establishment and it is still owned by the Australian Government. However, I suppose that the Government will soon dispose of it to private enterprise. Perhaps that is why the Government has caused trouble for the textile trade. By the end of next week, the number of dismissals from the Rutherford factory will reach a total of 600. But this House will be in recess. Nobody will then be able to say a word in protest. </para>

                                <para>Following on remarks made by the honorable member for Hoddle in the House on the 8th November, 1951, when he stated that the returns to the contractor in respect of all advertisements on the " pink pages " in the Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth telephone directories were in round figures £906,000,. of which the department received only £143,500, the matter was investigated closely. My inquiries disclosed, however, that the figures quoted by the honorable member were very wide of the mark. A careful estimate based on the maximum authorized prices which may be charged to advertisers showed that the total amount which could have been received by the telephone directory contractors throughout the Commonwealth from clients for the insertion of advertising matter in the publications as to the order of £320,000 for the 1950 issue. Of this amount the department received £157,000. In connexion with the Sydney and Melbourne directories, which include complete lists of business subscribers classified under their professional, trade and business headings, the amount paid by the advertising contract covered the printing costs and returned a good margin of profit to the department. Without these classified sections the department would have had to incur substantial additional expenditure on information, staff and facilities in the two cities concerned. </para>
